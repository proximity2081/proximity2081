{"time": 326, "text": "Great line."}, {"time": 328, "text": "Of evil?"}, {"time": 329, "text": "I read a good chunk of the Gulag Archipelago when I was a teenager because my grandfather had it in his house because he was one of these Americans who was obsessed with the Soviet Union and the Soviet threat and wanted people to be aware of some of what had happened."}, {"time": 349, "text": "And so he had those books lying around and I would read them."}, {"time": 355, "text": "And it's a similar kind of parallel story to what happened in Germany during the war, this creation of this system of camps and oppression and lots of troubling behavior."}, {"time": 373, "text": "To me it's a story of how fear and desperation combined with a charismatic leader can lead to evil."}, {"time": 383, "text": "But it's also a story of bravery, of love, of brotherhood and sisterhood and basically survival."}, {"time": 392, "text": "You have a man's search for meaning, which is the story of a man in a concentration camp basically finding beauty in life even under most extreme conditions."}, {"time": 405, "text": "So to me World War II is not necessarily a bleak view of human nature."}, {"time": 413, "text": "It's a little moment of evil that revealed a much bigger good in humanity."}, {"time": 422, "text": "So I'm not so sure that it leads me to a pessimistic view of the world, the fact that somebody like Hitler could happen, the fact that a lot of people could follow Hitler and get excited and maybe even love the hate of the other for some moment of time."}, {"time": 440, "text": "I think all of us are capable of that, but I think all of us also have a capacity for good."}, {"time": 449, "text": "And I think, I don't know what you think, but I think we have a greater desire for good than evil."}, {"time": 458, "text": "And it seems like that's where technology is very useful as a guide, as a helping hand."}, {"time": 465, "text": "Can you give me an example maybe?"}, {"time": 468, "text": "So I give you examples of futuristic technologies and I can give you examples of current technologies."}, {"time": 474, "text": "Current technologies, knowledge in the form of very basic knowledge, which is like Wikipedia and search the original dream of Google that I think is very much a success, which is making the world's information accessible at your fingertips."}, {"time": 495, "text": "That kind of technology enables the natural, if this axiom, this assumption that people want to do good is true, then letting them discover all of the information out there, false information and true information, all of it, and let them explore that's going to lead to a better world, to better people."}, {"time": 520, "text": "Fascist technologies is, I personally, I mentioned to you offline, sort of love artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 563, "text": "That sounds like an easy thing, but it's actually from an AI perspective very difficult."}, {"time": 567, "text": "I mean, this is the theme of a book I wrote called The Diamond Age, which talks about a book that essentially does that."}, {"time": 575, "text": "And I've been sort of watching people try to come at the problem of building that thing from different directions for ever since the book came out, basically."}, {"time": 587, "text": "And so I kind of have, although I haven't worked on it myself, I do get a sense of the level of difficulty in realizing that goal."}, {"time": 601, "text": "So that book is in the 90s, so as Google is coming to be, it's essentially not Google, but the search engine, the initial search engines, which gave birth to Google essentially in contrast."}, {"time": 618, "text": "That was still in the era of Alta Vista and Ask Jeeves and multiple different search engines."}, {"time": 624, "text": "And yeah, I'm pretty sure I had not heard of Google at that point."}, {"time": 628, "text": "That would have been 95, 96."}, {"time": 630, "text": "I think the book came out in 94."}, {"time": 633, "text": "And then, of course, the social networks followed, which is another form of guidance through the space of information."}, {"time": 642, "text": "Well, what happens is that these things come along and then people find ways to game them."}, {"time": 648, "text": "And so I saw an interesting thread the other day pointing out that 20 years ago, if you had Googled Pythagorean theorem, chances are you would have been taken directly to a page explaining the Pythagorean theorem."}, {"time": 667, "text": "If you do it now, you're probably going to..."}, {"time": 670, "text": "The top hits are going to be from somebody who's got an angle, who's got a scheme, right?"}, {"time": 675, "text": "They're trying to sell you math tutoring or they're working some kind of marketing plan on you."}, {"time": 685, "text": "So the traditional engines become actually less useful over time for their original educational purpose."}, {"time": 695, "text": "That doesn't mean that they shouldn't be replaced by newer and better ones."}, {"time": 701, "text": "First of all, to defend the people with the angle, right?"}, {"time": 705, "text": "They're trying to find business models to fund, oftentimes, which is funny you went with Pythagorean, like you went at math, those greedy bastards, but it's great."}, {"time": 718, "text": "How can we monetize the Pythagorean theorem?"}, {"time": 722, "text": "Well, I mean, education, right, is just to figure out like people who love math education, for example, love it purely, not purely, but very often love it for itself, for just teaching math."}, {"time": 739, "text": "Because, you know, when coming face to face with, for example, like the YouTube algorithm, they start to try to figure out, okay, how can I make money off of this?"}, {"time": 747, "text": "The primary goal is still that love of education, but they also want to make that love of education their full time job."}, {"time": 758, "text": "But I see that sort of that dance of humanity with the algorithms as it finds this kind of local pocket of optimality, or suboptimality, whatever, it gets stuck in it."}, {"time": 772, "text": "It's a pocket of some sort."}, {"time": 774, "text": "But I see that pocket as way better than what we had before in the 80s, right, or the 90s before the internet."}, {"time": 780, "text": "But like, and now we're now, this is also human nature, we start writing very eloquent articles about how this pocket is clearly a pocket, it's not very good, and we can imagine much better lands far beyond, but the reality is it's better than before, and now we're waiting for a new book."}, {"time": 801, "text": "And you have to wait either for lone geniuses or for some kind of momentum of a group of geniuses that just say, enough is enough, I have an idea, this is how we get out."}, {"time": 841, "text": "Yeah, tunnels through the barrier or gets enough energy to jump over the barrier."}, {"time": 846, "text": "And eventually we'll be, as you've talked about, I mean, we'll colonize the solar system, and then we'll be stuck in the solar system, and then people will say, well, we're screwed because when the sun energy runs out, there's no way to get to the next solar system, and so on."}, {"time": 865, "text": "It goes on until we colonize the entirety of the observable universe."}, {"time": 869, "text": "I think getting out of the solar system is going to be a hard one."}, {"time": 873, "text": "So can you, you mentioned this, can you elaborate why you think, back to sort of a serious question, why do you think it's hard to get outside of our solar system?"}, {"time": 884, "text": "It's just an energy calculation."}, {"time": 886, "text": "I mean, you can do it slowly whenever you want, but the idea of getting there in one lifetime or a few lifetimes requires huge amounts of energy to accelerate."}, {"time": 905, "text": "And then as soon as you get halfway there, you need to expend an equal amount of energy to decelerate, or you'll just go shooting by."}, {"time": 915, "text": "And so that means carrying a lot of energy."}, {"time": 918, "text": "And there's ideas like Yuri Milner, I think, is still funding the idea to use laser propulsion to send something to another star system, a small object."}, {"time": 932, "text": "But it'll have no way to slow down, as far as I know."}, {"time": 935, "text": "They never talk about that part, like how do we slow down?"}, {"time": 940, "text": "It's a quick flyby to take a good picture, I guess."}, {"time": 942, "text": "Yeah, you better take some good pictures on your way by."}, {"time": 945, "text": "So, and that's great if it happens, I'm not knocking it."}, {"time": 949, "text": "But the amount of energy that's needed is just staggering, and there's other issues like just how do you maintain an ecosystem for that long in isolation?"}, {"time": 962, "text": "How do you prevent people from going crazy?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "What happens if you hit something while traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light?"}, {"time": 970, "text": "So that's sort of some combination of expanding human lifespan, but also just good old fashioned, stable society on a spaceship."}, {"time": 980, "text": "Yeah, yeah, the generation ship."}, {"time": 984, "text": "No, I think that's the only way."}, {"time": 986, "text": "It would have to keep going for a long time."}, {"time": 991, "text": "And they might get to where they're going and find a shitty solar system."}, {"time": 998, "text": "We can try to do some advanced survey, but if you get there and all the planets in that solar system are just garbage planets, then it's kind of a big let down for this like thousand year voyage that you've just been on, right?"}, {"time": 1017, "text": "So we have a pretty narrow range of parameters that we need to stay between in order to survive in terms of the gravitational field that we can deal with."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "So that sets a bound on the size of the planet and what we need in the way of temperature and atmosphere and so on."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "So when you look at all those complications, then basically building sort of exactly the environment we want out of available materials in this solar system starts to look a hell of a lot better."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "It's hard to make an economic argument, let's say, for making that journey."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "One of the things I like about the expanse is the fact that the people who are trying to build the starship to go to the other solar system are doing it for religious reasons."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "I think that's the only reason that you would do it because economically it just makes more sense to build rotating cylindrical space habitats and make them perfect."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "Well, isn't everything done for religious reasons?"}, {"time": 1093, "text": "Like why do we exploration?"}, {"time": 1096, "text": "Why do we go to the moon again and do the other things?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "What does JFK said is not because they're easy, but because they're hard."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Isn't that kind of a religious reason?"}, {"time": 1105, "text": "I knew a veteran of the Apollo program who once said that the Apollo moon landings were communism's greatest achievement."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "Yeah, so the conflict between nations is a kind of... Not exactly a religion, but it's what you're talking about."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "Well, it's a struggle for meaning and that meaning isn't found in some kind of..."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "It's hard to find meaning in mathematics."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "It's found in some kind of in music and religion, whatever, art."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Some people do, but those are probably not enough of them to... People that find meaning in mathematics, they usually find meaning between the lines nevertheless, not in the actual proving some kind of thing."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "So from a cost perspective, do you actually see a possible future where we're building these kind of generation ships and just why not launch them one a year out like wandering ants out into the galaxy?"}, {"time": 1176, "text": "I have nothing against it."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "It's just, like I said, it's got the motivation to do it has to come from some kind of spiritual or kind of non tangible calculus."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "So from a business model perspective, you don't think there's a business model there?"}, {"time": 1196, "text": "One of the many fascinating things you've done in your life, you were at the very beginning, you were the person that convinced Jeff Bezos to start a spaceship company, a space company."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "You were there at Blue Origin for a few years in the beginning working on alternate propulsion systems and at least according to Wikipedia, alternate business models."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Yeah, I mean, to go back to the first thing you said, Jeff Bezos is not a guy who required a lot of convincing."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "He'd been thinking about it since he was five years old and it was an inevitability."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "But the idea that kind of got hatched in 1999 was to just do some advanced scouting work, explore the corners of the space of possibilities."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "And so that was Blue Operations LLC, which was the precursor to Blue Origin."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "And so it was a small staff of people that did that for a few years."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "And I think it was about 2003, 2004 that it swung decisively towards the direction it's been following ever since, which is using basically existing aerospace technologies and models to make chemical fueled rockets for space tourism."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "I believe and I continue to believe that the fact that we use chemical rockets is just an accident of history that comes out of World War II."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "So until World War II, rockets are being built on a small scale by people like Robert Goddard."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "But then Hitler desperately wants to bomb London, but he can't quite reach it and the Luftwaffe has been kind of neutralized."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "So he decides he's going to lob warheads into it with rockets, which is a terrible misallocation of resources."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "So it only could have happened in a dictatorship controlled by a lunatic."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "But that's the situation that existed."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So they built these rockets, that's the V2."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "And then it's just a complete coincidence that that war ends with atomic bombs being developed in a completely separate super weapon program."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "And so suddenly the existence of the bombs creates a demand for rockets that didn't exist before because if you've got atomic bombs, you need a way to deliver them."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "You can do it with bombers, but it's a lot better to just hurl them to the other side of the world on the top of a rocket."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "So suddenly rockets, which had gotten a boost because of Hitler's V2 program, got a much bigger boost during the 50s and 60s."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And it is a complete, you're right, for some reason I never thought of this, it is an accident of history that nuclear weapons are developed at a similar time."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "First of all, nuclear weapons didn't have to be developed at the same time as World War II."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "That's an accident in history."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "And then the fact, okay, so then Hitler started using rockets, that's an accident of, okay, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "That's a fascinating set of coincidences."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "Yeah, which is true of a lot of technologies, by the way."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "By the time these rockets are kind of working, we've got hydrogen bombs that are so big and so devastating that nobody really wants to use them."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "But it turns out you can fit a capsule with a couple of people in it into the socket on the end of a missile that was made to hold a hydrogen bomb."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "So we start doing that instead as a proxy for having a war."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "I'd love to be in the meeting where the first guy brought that up as an idea."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "It's probably a Russian."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "Why don't we strap a person to the rocket?"}, {"time": 1466, "text": "Well, it probably was because they did it first, right?"}, {"time": 1471, "text": "And they had perhaps less respect for sort of safety protocols."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "They were a little bit more willing to sacrifice the life of an astronaut or to risk the life of an astronaut."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "This is basically the story of how through all of this competition and because of these historical accidents, trillions of R&D dollars and rubles were put into development of chemical rocket technology, which has now advanced to an incredibly high degree."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "But there's other ways to make things go really fast, which is all that rockets do."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "That's all orbit is."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "It's just going really fast."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "And because so many nerds are obsessed with space, people have been thinking about alternate schemes for as long as they've been thinking about rockets."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "And so one of the first things that I learned kind of trying to explore new possibilities was that I could put all of my brainpower to work and be creative as I could and invent some idea that I thought was new for making things go fast."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "And I would always find out that some guy in Russia or somewhere had thought the same idea up 50 years ago and figured out all the math."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "And so at a certain point, you give up on trying to invent completely new ideas and just go poking around trying to find those guys."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "So there's a number of ideas that we looked at."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "Some are crazier, some are less crazy."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And the direction that that company eventually took was chemical rockets."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "Is there something you can comment on possible ideas?"}, {"time": 1586, "text": "So first of all, you could use nuclear, so nuclear propulsion."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "So that's, I mean, you've probably heard of Project Orion, which was the... Freeman Dyson and some of his collaborators had a scheme to power a large space vehicle by detonating atomic bombs behind it."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "And so one of the other people who was working at Blue Operations during this time was George Dyson, the son of Freeman."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "And so we knew all about Project Orion and he found an old film that they'd shot on a beach in La Jolla of a prototype of this that was powered by like lumps of C4."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So that was an idea, but for a private company, obtaining a large number of atomic bombs was probably out of scope."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So it was more of a theoretical thing."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "There's a conceptually similar approach using lasers that Freeman worked on with Arthur Kantrowitz and some others, where you take a pulsed laser and you fire it at a vehicle that has a block of ice on the back."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "And the pulse hits the ice and flashes off a layer of steam that becomes plasma."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "And plasma is opaque because it conducts."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "And so being opaque, it then absorbs all of the energy from the laser pulse and gets really hot and just pushes on the back of the block of ice."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "And then you wait a moment for that to dissipate and then you do it again."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "So it would just kind of vibrate its way."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "Like it sounds really violent, but Freeman said that if you were wearing like rubber sold tennis shoes standing in this vehicle, you would just feel a mild vibration."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "So there your source of energy is on the ground and you're getting higher specific impulse than you could get by burning chemicals."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "Jordan Kerr and others worked on another laser system, the late Dr. Jordan Kerr, that just would heat up a heat exchanger by many converging solid state lasers from the ground."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "And Kevin Parkin works on a similar scheme that just uses microwaves to do that."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "We looked at tall towers."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "I spent a while looking kind of semi seriously at giant bullwhips."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "What's a bullwhip?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Just a whip, you have them here in Texas, right?"}, {"time": 1761, "text": "But how does that have to do with propulsion?"}, {"time": 1763, "text": "If you think about it, a whip is an incredibly simple primitive object that can break the speed of sound."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "So it's unbelievable in a way that for thousands of years, people with no technology have been able to accelerate objects through the speed of sound just through an architectural trick."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "Just the physics of a moving bend of material in a medium can do this."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "So that's the thing I still think about from time to time."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "You can use the same physics to make freestanding loops of chain or other flexible materials that just kind of stand up under their own physics."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "I mean, it's kind of awesome to imagine."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "So imagine using the same kind of physics of a whip, but have at the end of it a spaceship."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "That would detach at the moment of maximum velocity."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "Why wouldn't that?"}, {"time": 1837, "text": "So part of my motivation in studying that was to ask that question."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "It was more almost a symbolic way of saying, look, there's all kinds of physics we haven't explored yet."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "It's no more crazy than the idea of chemical rockets."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "It's just that more money's gone into chemical rockets, right?"}, {"time": 1868, "text": "Can I ask you a question on propulsion that's a little bit more out there?"}, {"time": 1874, "text": "So I don't know if you've seen quite a lot of recent articles and reports and so on about UFOs, like the Tic Tac aircraft."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "I keep seeing a lot of chatter about it, but I haven't gone deep into it."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "So the DOD released footage filmed by pilots, and there's a lot of reports about objects that moved in ways they haven't seen before that seem to defy the laws of physics if we consider the aircraft that we have today."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "So the reason I asked you that is because it kind of, to me, whatever the heck it is, it's inspiring for the possibilities of ideas for propulsion."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "If it's like secret projects from foreign nations or it's physical phenomena that we don't yet understand, like ball lightning, all those kinds of things, or if it is aliens or objects from an alien civilization."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "I most likely believe if it's an object from an alien civilization, it's got to be like a really dumb drone that just got lost."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "It's definitely not like the pinnacle of intelligence."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "It's like some teenager's science fair experiment."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "Yeah, it just flew for a few centuries out and just landed, and then we humans are all like really excited about this wild thing."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "I mean, what do you think about those... First of all, like the millions of reports of UFOs, right?"}, {"time": 1977, "text": "There's some psychology there that's deeply cultural, but also the possibility of aliens having visited Earth."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I'd like to see some better pictures."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "For the reason I mentioned earlier, having to do with the difficulty of traveling between star systems, it's really hard for me to believe it's aliens."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "I just can't understand why you would go to all that trouble to transport something across light years and then do what these UFOs are allegedly doing."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "Like how is that interesting?"}, {"time": 2014, "text": "How does that justify the trip?"}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So if you travel across those kinds of distances, you would make a bigger splash."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "First of all, I would expect that the arrival of these things would be something we'd notice."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "It's got to decelerate into our solar system unless it got here really, really, really slowly."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "So I guess that's a possibility and just kind of snuck in."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "So at the end, we would detect some kind of footprint in terms of energy."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "You would think."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "So I actually think your idea of a science fair project gone bad, it makes more sense in that it would explain why if these things are alien technologies, they're just kind of hanging around our aircraft carriers for no particular reason, like not trying to communicate."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "Can you imagine a scenario where aliens have visited Earth or are visiting Earth and we wouldn't notice it at all?"}, {"time": 2082, "text": "I mean, if they've got technology to get here, they've probably got technology to conceal the fact that they're trying to conceal themselves."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "I meant more like they're not trying to conceal themselves, but we're just our cognitive capabilities are like too limited and we are not thinking big enough."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "We're looking for little green men, we're looking for things that operate at a time scale that's human like, you know."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "I love thinking about ideas like that."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "That's great science fiction novel fodder that the aliens are so different that we simply don't see them."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "Is there, in terms of language, do you think it would be difficult, not aliens visiting us but traveling to other places to find a common language?"}, {"time": 2134, "text": "You've written about the importance of language in intelligent civilizations."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "How difficult is the problem to bridge the gap between aliens and humans in terms of language so we're not lost in translation?"}, {"time": 2150, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there's different takes on that depending on how biologically similar they are to us, you know."}, {"time": 2156, "text": "I mean, there's a school of thought that says, basically, advanced life has to be carbon based for just reasons of chemistry."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "So right away, if you impose that limitation, then you're kind of assuming something that's starting to be biologically similar to us."}, {"time":

people didn't yet know he was the greatest of all time."}, {"time": 8527, "text": "You saw Gabe."}, {"time": 8528, "text": "So that was part, it's, it's funny is, uh, it feels like a small world that you would be in the same space as Dan Gabel a hundred feet away, a little dot on the mat trouncing his opponents, him and him and Chris Taylor."}, {"time": 8543, "text": "So the other star was this 400 pound plus guy named Chris Taylor who, uh, also went to the Olympics."}, {"time": 8552, "text": "So yeah, people, you know, he was, he was a no, he was a, uh, athletic hero and wrestling is there's certain States like Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Iowa, where wrestling is the sport because those are States of small towns."}, {"time": 8569, "text": "And so if you're a small town is if you're like Dan Gabel, uh, and you have to be on a football team with 20 other guys who are not Dan Gabel, then no matter how good you are, your team might, might suck."}, {"time": 8584, "text": "Uh, but if in a solo thing, you can, you can go to the Olympics."}, {"time": 8591, "text": "So we did a lot of wrestling in our gym classes in school and I didn't like it."}, {"time": 8596, "text": "And I think partly it's just that it was so, so competitive and the people who were cared about it really cared about it a lot, you know?"}, {"time": 8606, "text": "And so it was, it was pretty tough and I didn't think I had the right body type."}, {"time": 8611, "text": "But then when I was, uh, after college, I was in Iowa city for a few years when he was coaching the, that the wrestling team there and the, he won like nine championships out of 10 years, you know, during that, during that time."}, {"time": 8627, "text": "So he was both the greatest individual wrestler of all time and like the greatest team coach."}, {"time": 8633, "text": "Um, so I know I've never met him, but we've, uh, he's kind of been like in my sphere of awareness since I was, you know, kind of my whole life."}, {"time": 8644, "text": "And people would always tell stories about him, like I think he got arrested once for some kind of, I don't know, minor offense in Ames."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "And so he just basically stayed up all night."}, {"time": 8657, "text": "He was in this cage in the jail, just stayed up all night doing pull ups on, you know, it sounds about right."}, {"time": 8665, "text": "And, uh, uh, so yeah."}, {"time": 8670, "text": "So has that been, I mean, I was such an interesting place in the world and wrestling is just part of that story."}, {"time": 8680, "text": "Is that somewhere in there?"}, {"time": 8681, "text": "Does that resonate deeply with who you are?"}, {"time": 8684, "text": "It was a formative thing for me growing up there for sure."}, {"time": 8688, "text": "It's just a, uh, you know, uh, uh, or at least used to be a very orderly place, high social capital, very minimal class differences."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "So like you'd have some people who would drive a Cadillac instead of a Chevy, but, uh, that was it."}, {"time": 8709, "text": "That was, you know, those were the rich people, right?"}, {"time": 8711, "text": "So, um, and a college town is always a different environment like, uh, you know, Austin, uh, has some of this, um, so it was a pretty kind of utopian, uh, other than the weather and a few other things, uh, environment to, to grow up in the, the martial art I ended up doing is sword stuff, which is interesting because it uses a different feedback loop."}, {"time": 8739, "text": "So when you're, if you're grappling, everything is through sense of touch and your sense of touch is very old and simple, right?"}, {"time": 8750, "text": "Like earthworms don't have, don't even have eyes, but they can tell when they're being touched, right?"}, {"time": 8756, "text": "So it's very fast."}, {"time": 8759, "text": "Um, and uh, with, um, with a standoff or like boxing or some kinds of sword fighting, you're, you're not touching the other person."}, {"time": 8771, "text": "Most of the time, your, your, your visual system is doing something way more, it's doing slam and trying to figure out what the other person is up to."},

other person and now you're back to wrestling, you're feeling what they're doing and it's all about that."}, {"time": 8803, "text": "But some of the older sword arts, um, don't engage the blade that way."}, {"time": 8810, "text": "You stand off at range and then you make cutting attacks and, um, and, uh, and so, so those are all processed visually and I think I'm more of a slow thinker, so it works for me better."}, {"time": 8828, "text": "I mean, the same, it has the same, the artistry and the beauty of boxing, I suppose, just like you said, is like, there's no, there's no contact and it's all processed visually and I'm sure there's a dance of its own that, that depends on the characteristic of a sword involved."}, {"time": 8846, "text": "There is a set of, of stances and, and, uh, basic reactions that you try to learn that are thought to be defensible, um, and, and safe or safer."}, {"time": 8857, "text": "And so it tends to be a series of short engagements where you'll, you'll close in, you'll try out your, your idea and it works or it doesn't, then you, you back off again."}, {"time": 8870, "text": "It's interesting to think about like human history because martial arts, okay, that's a thing."}, {"time": 8877, "text": "But in terms of sword fighting, just the full range of humans that existed who mastered sword fighting or sought the mastery of sword fighting, just to imagine the thousands of people who, the heights they have achieved because the stakes are so incredibly high to be good."}, {"time": 8899, "text": "And it's the richest, most powerful people in those

8915, "text": "I mean, that, that's fascinating, um, that, that's fascinating and we perhaps have lost that forever with greater weapons."}, {"time": 8926, "text": "I mean, the artistry of sword fighting when it's life and death and you go into war, you have the Miyamoto Musashi's of the world, right?"}, {"time": 8934, "text": "The, I don't know, there's a, there's a poetry to that, that there's a mastery to that that I don't know if we could achieve with any other kind of martial art."}, {"time": 8945, "text": "Well the, one of the good, you were talking earlier about the, the, the good effects of the internet, social media that we sometimes overlook."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "And, and one of those is that, um, there were all these isolated people around the world who were interested in this, who found each other and kind of created a network of, of people who help each other learn these things."}, {"time": 9004, "text": "Um, actually there's a guy here in Austin named
