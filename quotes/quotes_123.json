different, had a function which helped any old chemical reaction which was important to the cell, you would go ahead and let that try, and evolution would slowly improve that function."}, {"time": 427, "text": "And so you have the possibility of duplicating and then having things drift apart."}, {"time": 434, "text": "One of them retain the old function, the other one do something new for you."}, {"time": 438, "text": "And there's evolutionary pressure to improve."}, {"time": 443, "text": "Look, there isn't in computers too, but improvement has to do with closing some companies and opening some others."}, {"time": 450, "text": "The evolutionary process looks a little different."}, {"time": 454, "text": "Yeah, similar timescale perhaps."}, {"time": 457, "text": "Much shorter in timescale."}, {"time": 459, "text": "Companies close, yeah, go bankrupt and are born, yeah, shorter, but not much shorter."}, {"time": 465, "text": "Some companies last a century, but yeah, you're right."}, {"time": 471, "text": "I mean, if you think of companies as a single organism that builds and you all know, yeah, it's a fascinating dual correspondence there between biological organisms."}, {"time": 482, "text": "And companies have difficulty having a new product competing with an old product."}, {"time": 490, "text": "When IBM built its first PC, you probably read the book, they made a little isolated internal unit to make the PC."}, {"time": 498, "text": "And for the first time in IBM's history, they didn't insist that you build it out of IBM components."}, {"time": 507, "text": "But they understood that they could get into this market, which is a very different thing by completely changing their culture."}, {"time": 515, "text": "And biology finds other markets in a more adaptive way."}, {"time": 524, "text": "Yeah, it's better at it."}, {"time": 527, "text": "It's better at that kind of integration."}, {"time": 530, "text": "So maybe you've already said it, but what to use the most beautiful aspect or mechanism of the human mind?"}, {"time": 541, "text": "Is it the adaptive, the ability to adapt as you've described, or is there some other little quirk that you particularly like?"}, {"time": 551, "text": "Adaptation is everything when you get down to it."}, {"time": 556, "text": "But the difference, there are differences between adaptation where your learning goes on only over generations and over evolutionary time, where your learning goes on at the time scale of one individual who must learn from the environment during that individual's lifetime."}, {"time": 579, "text": "And biology has both kinds of learning in it."}, {"time": 583, "text": "And the thing which makes neurobiology hard is that a mathematical system, as it were, built on this other kind of evolutionary system."}, {"time": 598, "text": "What do you mean by mathematical system?"}, {"time": 601, "text": "Where's the math and the biology?"}, {"time": 603, "text": "Well, when you talk to a computer scientist about neural networks, it's all math."}, {"time": 608, "text": "The fact that biology actually came about from evolution, and the fact that biology is about a system which you can build in three dimensions."}, {"time": 625, "text": "If you look at computer chips, computer chips are basically two dimensional structures, maybe 2.1 dimensions, but they really have difficulty doing three dimensional wiring."}, {"time": 639, "text": "Biology is, the neocortex is actually also sheet like, and it sits on top of the white matter, which is about 10 times the volume of the gray matter and contains all what you might call the wires."}, {"time": 653, "text": "But there's a huge, the effect of computer structure on what is easy and what is hard is immense."}, {"time": 669, "text": "And biology does, it makes some things easy that are very difficult to understand how to do computationally."}, {"time": 677, "text": "On the other hand, you can't do simple floating point arithmetic because it's awfully stupid."}, {"time": 683, "text": "And you're saying this kind of three dimensional complicated structure makes, it's still math."}, {"time": 690, "text": "It's still doing math."}, {"time": 692, "text": "The kind of math it's doing enables you to solve problems of a very different kind."}, {"time": 700, "text": "So you mentioned two kinds of adaptation, the evolutionary adaptation and the adaptation or learning at the scale of a single human life."}, {"time": 710, "text": "Which do you, which is particularly beautiful to you and interesting from a research and from just a human perspective?"}, {"time": 722, "text": "And which is more powerful?"}, {"time": 725, "text": "I find things most interesting that I begin to see how to get into the edges of them and tease them apart a little bit and see how they work."}, {"time": 735, "text": "And since I can't see the evolutionary process going on, I'm in awe of it."}, {"time": 746, "text": "But I find it just a black hole as far as trying to understand what to do."}, {"time": 752, "text": "And so in a certain sense, I'm in awe of it, but I couldn't be interested in working on it."}, {"time": 759, "text": "The human life's time scale is however thing you can tease apart and study."}, {"time": 767, "text": "Yeah, you can do, there's developmental neurobiology which understands how the connections and how the structure evolves from a combination of what the genetics is like and the real, the fact that you're building a system in three dimensions."}, {"time": 788, "text": "In just days and months, those early days of a human life are really interesting."}, {"time": 797, "text": "They are and of course, there are times of immense cell multiplication."}, {"time": 804, "text": "There are also times of the greatest cell death in the brain is during infancy."}, {"time": 812, "text": "It's turnover."}, {"time": 813, "text": "So what is not effective, what is not wired well enough to use at the moment, throw it out."}, {"time": 822, "text": "It's a mysterious process."}, {"time": 825, "text": "From, let me ask, from what field do you think the biggest breakthrough is in understanding the mind will come in the next decades?"}, {"time": 836, "text": "Is it neuroscience, computer science, neurobiology, psychology, physics, maybe math, maybe literature?"}, {"time": 849, "text": "Well, of course, I see the world always through a lens of physics."}, {"time": 852, "text": "I grew up in physics and the way I pick problems is very characteristic of physics and of an intellectual background which is not psychology, which is not chemistry and so on and so on."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Yeah, both of your parents are physicists."}, {"time": 870, "text": "Both of my parents were physicists and the real thing I got out of that was a feeling that the world is an understandable place and if you do enough experiments and think about what they mean and structure things so you can do the mathematics of the, relevant to the experiments, you ought to be able to understand how things work."}, {"time": 895, "text": "But that was, that was a few years ago."}, {"time": 898, "text": "Did you change your mind at all through many decades of trying to understand the mind, of studying in different kinds of ways?"}, {"time": 907, "text": "Not even the mind, just biological systems."}, {"time": 911, "text": "You still have hope that physics, that you can understand?"}, {"time": 917, "text": "There's a question of what do you mean by understand?"}, {"time": 921, "text": "When I taught freshman physics, I used to say, I wanted to get physics to understand the subject, to understand Newton's laws."}, {"time": 928, "text": "I didn't want them simply to memorize a set of examples to which they knew the equations to write down to generate the answers."}, {"time": 938, "text": "I had this nebulous idea of understanding so that if you looked at a situation, you could say, oh, I expect the ball to make that trajectory or I expect some intuitive notion of understanding and I don't know how to express that very well and I've never known how to express it well."}, {"time": 961, "text": "And you run smack up against it when you do these, look at these simple neural nets, feed forward neural nets, which do amazing things and yet, you know, contain nothing of the essence of what I would have felt was understanding."}, {"time": 980, "text": "Understanding is more than just an enormous lookup table."}, {"time": 984, "text": "Let's linger on that."}, {"time": 986, "text": "How sure you are of that?"}, {"time": 988, "text": "What if the table gets really big?"}, {"time": 991, "text": "So, I mean, asked another way, these feed forward neural networks, do you think they'll ever understand?"}, {"time": 1000, "text": "Could answer that in two ways."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "I think if you look at real systems, feedback is an essential aspect of how these real systems compute."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "On the other hand, if I have a mathematical system with feedback, I know I can unlayer this and do it, but I have an exponential expansion in the amount of stuff I have to build if I can resolve the problem that way."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "So feedback is essential."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So we can talk even about recurrent neural nets, so recurrence, but do you think all the pieces are there to achieve understanding through these simple mechanisms?"}, {"time": 1042, "text": "Like back to our original question, what is the fundamental, is there a fundamental difference between artificial neural networks and biological or is it just a bunch of surface stuff?"}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Suppose you ask a neurosurgeon, when is somebody dead?"}, {"time": 1062, "text": "So we'll probably go back to saying, well, I can look at the brain rhythms and tell you this is a brain which has never could have functioned again."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "This is one of the, this other one is one of the stuff we treat it well is still recoverable."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "And then just do that by some electrodes looking at simple electrical patterns, which don't look in any detail at all what individual neurons are doing."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "These rhythms are utterly absent from anything which goes on at Google."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Yeah, but the rhythms."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "But the rhythms what?"}, {"time": 1107, "text": "So, well, that's like comparing, okay, I'll tell you, it's like you're comparing the greatest classical musician in the world to a child first learning to play."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "The question I'm at, but they're still both playing the piano."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "I'm asking, is there, will it ever go on at Google?"}, {"time": 1129, "text": "Because you're one of the seminal figures in both launching both disciplines, both sides of the river."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "I think it's going to go on generation after generation."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "The way it has where what you might call the AI computer science community says, let's take the following."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "This is our model of neurobiology at the moment."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "Let's pretend it's good enough and do everything we can with it."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "And it does interesting things."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And after a while it sort of grinds into the sand and you say, ah, something else is needed for neurobiology."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "And some other grand thing comes in and enables you to go a lot further."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "What will go into the sand again?"}, {"time": 1184, "text": "And I think it could be generations of this evolution."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "I don't know how many of them."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "And each one is going to get you further into what a brain does."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "And in some sense, past the Turing test longer and in more broad aspects."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "And how many of these are going to have to be before you say, I've made something, I've made a human, I don't know."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "But your sense is it might be a couple."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "My sense is it might be a couple more."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "And going back to my brainwaves as it were."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Yes, from the AI point of view, they would say, ah, maybe these are an epiphenomenon and not important at all."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "The first car I had, a real wreck of a 1936 Dodge, go above about 45 miles an hour and the wheels would shimmy."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "Good speedometer that."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Now, nobody designed the car that way."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "The car is malfunctioning to have that."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "But in biology, if it were useful to know when are you going more than 45 miles an hour, you just capture that."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "And you wouldn't worry about where it came from."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "It's going to be a long time before that kind of thing, which can take place in large complex networks of things is actually used in the computation."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "Look, how many transistors are there in your laptop these days?"}, {"time": 1294, "text": "Actually, I don't know the number."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "It's on the scale of 10 to the 10."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "I can't remember the number either."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "And all the transistors are somewhat similar."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "And most physical systems with that many parts, all of which are similar, have collective properties."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Sound waves in air, earthquakes, what have you, have collective properties."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "There are no collective properties used in artificial neural networks, in AI."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Yeah, it's very."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "If biology uses them, it's going to take us to more generations of things for people to actually dig in and see how they are used and what they mean."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "See, you're very right."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "We might have to return several times to neurobiology and try to make our transistors more messy."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "At the same time, the simple ones will conquer big aspects."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "And I think one of the most, biggest surprises to me was how well learning systems because they're manifestly nonbiological, how important they can be actually, and how important and how useful they can be in AI."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So if we can just take a stroll to some of your work."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "If we can just take a stroll to some of your work that is incredibly surprising, that it works as well as it does, that launched a lot of the recent work with neural networks."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "If we go to what are now called Hopfield networks, can you tell me what is associative memory in the mind for the human side?"}, {"time": 1411, "text": "Let's explore memory for a bit."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Okay, what do you mean by associative memory is, ah, you have a memory of each of your friends."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "Your friend has all kinds of properties from what they look like, what their voice sounds like, to where they went to college, where you met them, go on and on, what science papers they've written."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "And if I start talking about a 5 foot 10 wire, cognitive scientist who's got a very bad back, it doesn't take very long for you to say, oh, he's talking about Jeff Hinton."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "I never mentioned the name or anything very particular."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "But somehow a few facts that are associated with a particular person enables you to get a hold of the rest of the facts."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "Or not the rest of them, another subset of them."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "And it's this ability to link things together, link experiences together, which goes under the general name of associative memory."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "And a large part of intelligent behavior is actually just large associative memories at work, as far as I can see."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "What do you think is the mechanism of how it works?"}, {"time": 1493, "text": "What do you think is the mechanism of how it works in the mind?"}, {"time": 1498, "text": "Is it a mystery to you still?"}, {"time": 1503, "text": "Do you have inklings of how this essential thing for cognition works?"}, {"time": 1510, "text": "What I made 35 years ago was, of course, a crude physics model to actually enable you to understand my old sense of understanding as a physicist, because you could say, ah, I understand why this goes to stable states."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "It's like things going downhill."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "And that gives you something with which to think in physical terms rather than only in mathematical terms."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "So you've created these associative artificial networks."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "Now, if you look at what I did, I didn't at all describe a system which gracefully learns."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "I described a system in which you could understand how learning could link things together, how very crudely it might learn."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "One of the things which intrigues me as I reinvestigate that system now to some extent is, look, I see you, I'll see you every second for the next hour or what have you."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "Each look at you is a little bit different."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "I don't store all those second by second images."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "I don't store 3,000 images."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "I somehow compact this information."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "So I now have a view of you, which I can use."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "It doesn't slavishly remember anything in particular, but it compacts the information into useful chunks, which are somehow these chunks, which are not just activities of neurons, bigger things than that, which are the real entities which are useful to you."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "Which are useful to you."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "Useful to you to describe, to compress this information coming at you."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "And you have to compress it in such a way that if the information comes in just like this again, I don't bother to rewrite it or efforts to rewrite it simply do not yield anything because those things are already written."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "And that needs to be not, look this up, have I stored it somewhere already?"}, {"time": 1656, "text": "There'll be something which is much more automatic in the machine hardware."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Right, so in the human mind, how complicated is that process do you think?"}, {"time": 1667, "text": "So you've created, feels weird to be sitting with John Hotfield calling him Hotfield Networks, but."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "It is weird."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "Yeah, but nevertheless, that's what everyone calls him."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "So here we are."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "So that's a simplification."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "That's what a physicist would do."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "You and Richard Feynman sat down and talked about associative memory."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "Now, if you look at the mind where you can't quite simplify it so perfectly, do you think that?"}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Well, let me backtrack just a little bit."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "Biology is about dynamical systems."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "Computers are dynamical systems."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "You can ask, if you want to model biology, if you want to model neurobiology, what is the time scale?"}, {"time": 1719, "text": "There's a dynamical system in which, of a fairly fast time scale in which you could say, the synapses don't change much during this computation, so I'll think of the synapses fixed and just do the dynamics of the activity."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "Or you can say, the synapses are changing fast enough that I have to have the synaptic dynamics working at the same time as the system dynamics in order to understand the biology."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "Most, if you look at the feedforward artificial neural nets, they're all done as learnings."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "First of all, I spend some time learning, not performing, and I turn off learning and I turn off learning, and I turn off learning and I perform."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "That's not biology."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And so as I look more deeply at neurobiology, even as associative memory, I've got to face the fact that the dynamics of the synapse change is going on all the time."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "And I can't just get by by saying, I'll do the dynamics of activity with fixed synapses."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "So the synaptic, the dynamics of the synapses is actually fundamental to the whole system."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "And there's nothing necessarily separating the time scales."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "When the time scale's gonna be separated, it's neat from the physicist's or the mathematician's point of view, but it's not necessarily true in neurobiology."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "So you're kind of dancing beautifully between showing a lot of respect to physics and then also saying that physics cannot quite reach the complexity of biology."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "So where do you land?"}, {"time": 1830, "text": "Or do you continuously dance between the two points?"}, {"time": 1833, "text": "I continuously dance between them because my whole notion of understanding is that you can describe to somebody else how something works in ways which are honest and believable and still not describe all the nuts and bolts in detail."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "I can describe weather as 10 to the 32 molecules colliding in the atmosphere."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "I can simulate weather that way if I have a big enough machine."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "I'll simulate it accurately."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "It's no good for understanding."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "If I want to understand things, I want to understand things in terms of wind patterns, hurricanes, pressure differentials, and so on, all things as they're collective."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And the physicist in me always hopes that biology will have some things that can be said about it which are both true and for which you don't need all the molecular details as the molecules colliding."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "That's what I mean from the roots of physics, by understanding."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "So what did, again, sorry, but Hopfield Networks help you understand what insight did give us about memory, about learning?"}, {"time": 1917, "text": "They didn't give insights about learning."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "They gave insights about how things having learned could be expressed, how having learned a picture of you, a picture of you reminds me of your name."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "That would, but it didn't describe a reasonable way of actually doing the learning."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "They only said if you had previously learned the connections of this kind of pattern, would now be able to, behave in a physical way was to say, ah, if I put the part of the pattern in here, the other part of the pattern will complete over here."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "I could understand that physics, if the right learning stuff had already been put in."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "And it could understand why then putting in a picture of somebody else would generate something else over here."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "But it did not have a reasonable description of the learning that was going on."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "It did not have a reasonable description of the learning process."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "But even, so forget learning."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "I mean, that's just a powerful concept that sort of forming representations that are useful to be robust, you know, for error correction kind of thing."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "So this is kind of what the biology does we're talking about."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "Yeah, and what my paper did was simply enable you, there are lots of ways of being robust."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "If you think of a dynamical system, you think of a system where a path is going on in time."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And if you think for a computer, there's a computational path, which is going on in a huge dimensional space of ones and zeros."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And an error correction system is a system, which if you get a little bit off that trajectory, will push you back onto that trajectory again."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "So you get to the same answer in spite of the fact that there were things, so that the computation wasn't being ideally done all the way along the line."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "And there are lots of models for error correction."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "But one of the models for error correction is to say, there's a valley that you're following, flowing down."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "And if you push a little bit off the valley, just like water being pushed a little bit by a rock, it gets back and follows the course of the river."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "And that basically the analog in the physical system, which enables you to say, oh yes, error free computation and an associative memory are very much like things that I can understand from the point of view of a physical system."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "The physical system is, can be under some circumstances, an accurate metaphor."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "It's not the only metaphor."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "There are error correction schemes, which don't have a valley and energy behind them."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "But those are error correction schemes, which a mathematician may be able to understand, but I don't."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "So there's the physical metaphor that seems to work here."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "So these kinds of networks actually led to a lot of the work that is going on now in neural networks, artificial neural networks."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "So the follow on work with restricted Boltzmann machines and deep belief nets followed on from these ideas of the Hopfield network."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "So what do you think about this continued progress of that work towards now re revigorated exploration of feed forward neural networks and recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks and kinds of networks that are helping solve image recognition, natural language processing, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "It always intrigued me that one of the most long lived of the learning systems is the Boltzmann machine, which is intrinsically a feedback network."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "And with the brilliance of Hind and Sinowski to understand how to do learning in that."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "And it's still a useful way to understand learning and the learning that you understand in that has something to do with the way that feed forward systems work."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "But it's not always exactly simple to express that intuition."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "But it's always amuses me to see Hinton going back to the
