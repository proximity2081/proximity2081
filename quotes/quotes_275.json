243, "text": "That's funny because there's lots of different schools of thought, like these people versus these people, and maybe vegans versus steakhouse people."}, {"time": 243, "text": "I think in terms of the sciences, and I guess you and I would be on opposite sides here, you have the astronomy people versus the zoology people."}, {"time": 263, "text": "The big question is, would you rather spend 10 minutes on the moon or would you rather spend 10 minutes in the deep sea?"}, {"time": 263, "text": "And for me, it's clearly the deep sea."}, {"time": 263, "text": "The zoology that's down there, there's something I would encourage people to look up called Deepstaria, which is a jellyfish."}, {"time": 281, "text": "And what's amazing when you watch these deep sea dives on YouTube is that the scientists, they're nature dorks like everybody else."}, {"time": 281, "text": "They went into this field, and there's none of this maybe soldier nation style cynicism of when they see an amazing animal in its natural environment exhibiting these crazy behaviors, they lose it."}, {"time": 304, "text": "They're on the mics like, oh my god."}, {"time": 304, "text": "It's so exciting to watch."}, {"time": 304, "text": "I'm not a rocket person, but I'm definitely a zoology person."}, {"time": 313, "text": "So animals and plants and the sea."}, {"time": 315, "text": "And also, it's so mathematical."}, {"time": 315, "text": "There's so many forms."}, {"time": 315, "text": "There's this plant called Areospermum titanopsoides."}, {"time": 315, "text": "I don't know how to pronounce it because they're always in Latin."}, {"time": 315, "text": "You never hear them pronounced."}, {"time": 327, "text": "You said sperm."}, {"time": 328, "text": "Areospermum, yeah, because it's a woolly seed is the genus."}, {"time": 328, "text": "The leaf, it just always puts out one leaf, but the leaf is covered in little magnifying lenses to make it maximize the sunlight."}, {"time": 342, "text": "So it looks like this little crystal seashell."}, {"time": 342, "text": "It's tiny."}, {"time": 342, "text": "It's like two centimeters, but it's just this amazing thing that grows out of the sands in South Africa."}, {"time": 353, "text": "Just to defend Solzhenitsyn for a second."}, {"time": 353, "text": "So if I may read a couple of his lines from the speech."}, {"time": 353, "text": "So he said, one day, that's how he introduces it."}, {"time": 361, "text": "One day, Dostoevsky threw out the enigmatic remark, beauty will save the world."}, {"time": 361, "text": "What sort of a statement is that?"}, {"time": 368, "text": "For a long time, I considered it mere words."}, {"time": 368, "text": "How could that be possible?"}, {"time": 368, "text": "When in bloodthirsty history did beauty ever save anyone from anything?"}, {"time": 379, "text": "And then later, he goes on to argue with himself in the speech as an older, wiser man now."}, {"time": 385, "text": "But perhaps that ancient trinity of truth, goodness and beauty is not simply an empty, faded formula as we thought in the days of our self confident, materialistic youth."}, {"time": 396, "text": "If the tops of these three trees converge as the scholars maintained, but the two blatant, two direct stems of truth and goodness are crushed, cut down, not allowed through, then perhaps the fantastic, unpredictable, unexpected stems of beauty will push through and soar to that very same place."}, {"time": 416, "text": "And in so doing, will fulfill the work of all three."}, {"time": 416, "text": "In that case, Dostoevsky's remark, beauty will save the world, was not a careless phrase, but a prophecy."}, {"time": 428, "text": "Which of these three things are your favorites?"}, {"time": 428, "text": "Truth, goodness or beauty?"}, {"time": 434, "text": "What do you call truth and goodness?"}, {"time": 434, "text": "The blatant, two direct stems of truth and goodness versus the fantastic, unpredictable, unexpected stems of beauty, which is how I see your Twitter account."}, {"time": 449, "text": "I don't think that, I think there's a certain dearth of beauty to be had in my Twitter account, that's for sure."}, {"time": 454, "text": "It's certainly no goodness."}, {"time": 454, "text": "Or truth."}, {"time": 454, "text": "It's Twitter, there's no truth to be found."}, {"time": 461, "text": "I will answer the question, I will of course point out that having this kind of, you know, distinction between the three things is I think kind of synthetic."}, {"time": 467, "text": "I think they very heavily overlap."}, {"time": 472, "text": "If not, if I could probably make the argument they're synonymous."}, {"time": 476, "text": "In fact, I do believe that they're largely synonymous."}, {"time": 481, "text": "That's such an interesting word, goodness."}, {"time": 481, "text": "Which of those three is my favorite?"}, {"time": 488, "text": "I think truth is overrated in the sense that if something is a good story, the story doesn't have to be true or real in order to motivate you and move you."}, {"time": 506, "text": "A lot of times, we can delude ourselves about somebody and that might actually serve a purpose to some extent."}, {"time": 514, "text": "You know, if you have someone who's maybe a family member and you kind of ignore bad things that they do, there might be a reason for that."}, {"time": 519, "text": "Of the three which is most important, I think I would say probably goodness."}, {"time": 525, "text": "I would say of the three the most important is goodness because if you don't appreciate goodness, then beauty is just empty."}, {"time": 538, "text": "It's just a picture or it's nice."}, {"time": 538, "text": "Bad people appreciate beauty."}, {"time": 538, "text": "You know, bad people are often, you know, seductive or have a beauty about them."}, {"time": 550, "text": "And in terms of action, I think it takes a lot of skill and work to create beauty or to create truth or to express truth or express beauty."}, {"time": 556, "text": "But I think goodness is like the easiest default state of being, just being good to others."}, {"time": 569, "text": "Yeah, like, you know, like there'll be things where these videos where like one dog is drowning and like another dog jumps in and saves it from the pool."}, {"time": 575, "text": "Like that to me is just really amazing stuff and is very moving."}, {"time": 582, "text": "So just to me, goodness means integrity and it means kindness."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And yeah, I think of the three, that's the one I pick."}, {"time": 597, "text": "And I think people, sorry to interrupt, I think people also have this idea which is inculcated to them, especially by corporate America, that as you get older, it's okay to do the wrong thing sometimes, blah, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 607, "text": "And so I think goodness gets rarer and rarer."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And I think people know better and they tell themselves lies."}, {"time": 618, "text": "But once you get, allow yourself the chance to just be good, I think it makes for a better life."}, {"time": 626, "text": "It's like it's not that much work."}, {"time": 626, "text": "Like it's not like going to the gym or working out, that's a lot of work and it's great afterwards."}, {"time": 631, "text": "But like goodness is easy once you get into the habit of it."}, {"time": 637, "text": "I suppose working out is the same way."}, {"time": 637, "text": "There's a lot of stuff."}, {"time": 637, "text": "If you make it a habit, you're going to get the rewards of it and it's going to be easy."}, {"time": 646, "text": "The rewards of goodness I think are more immediate than the rewards of working out."}, {"time": 651, "text": "As opposed to the hard drugs."}, {"time": 653, "text": "If, you mentioned this quote on one of your live streams, I think, if you save one life, you save the world."}, {"time": 661, "text": "That's such a cool line."}, {"time": 661, "text": "I think I remember reading about Paul Farmer."}, {"time": 661, "text": "I think his name is, he's a doctor that really, I mean, doctors in general, they kind of don't care about like what they're doing as a broad policy across hundreds of thousands of millions of people."}, {"time": 680, "text": "They just care about the human in front of them, which is so interesting."}, {"time": 680, "text": "They don't care it's going to cost, like in his case to save one child, it will cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars."}, {"time": 690, "text": "They don't care about that."}, {"time": 690, "text": "They know very well that their actions cannot be scaled, but they can't help but help the child in front of them."}, {"time": 698, "text": "And it's so interesting."}, {"time": 704, "text": "That's such an interesting way to live."}, {"time": 704, "text": "And that's the way I kind of think when I try to do something positive is, will this help one person?"}, {"time": 709, "text": "And I just kind of imagine a specific person, depending on the thing that that would help with, like when I'm trying to create something, whether it's a piece of hardware or a video or anything like that, or educational material, lecture, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 730, "text": "What do you think about this quote?"}, {"time": 730, "text": "Like what is it profound or just poetic?"}, {"time": 735, "text": "I think it's more profound than it sounds at first."}, {"time": 735, "text": "The example I think of is Michelle Bachmann."}, {"time": 740, "text": "She was a former Congresswoman from Minnesota."}, {"time": 740, "text": "She clearly had crazy eyes, something was going on with her husband."}, {"time": 744, "text": "But she adopted like 20 kids."}, {"time": 744, "text": "Terry Shappert is another friend of mine."}, {"time": 749, "text": "He's like either Navy SEAL or Marines."}, {"time": 749, "text": "Whatever it is, Terry, I apologize."}, {"time": 754, "text": "I'm not trying to be funny."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And he adopts elder dogs."}, {"time": 754, "text": "So going back to Bachmann, it's like, yeah, you can say she's crazy."}, {"time": 761, "text": "You can make fun of her politics all you want, and all that stuff's legitimate."}, {"time": 765, "text": "But if you save a kid, give them a home, and you save them from the foster system, and you put a roof over their heads and make them feel loved and appreciated, it's really hard for me to sit here and call you like a totally bad person."}, {"time": 782, "text": "I think that kind of thing is... Nick Cersei is another one."}, {"time": 782, "text": "He adopted a kid."}, {"time": 782, "text": "And I said, I think you're a hero."}, {"time": 788, "text": "One of the things that's very hard for me in writing, as you know, I talk about this endlessly in this book, The White Pill, but writing about when people do hurtful things to children, it really is hard to watch."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And it's hard to... Because when you're an author, you have to kind of empathize with the character."}, {"time": 806, "text": "Where's this character coming from?"}, {"time": 810, "text": "Explain their point of view."}, {"time": 810, "text": "And that's the one that's the hardest for me to wrap my head around."}, {"time": 814, "text": "Cruelty to children."}, {"time": 815, "text": "And yeah, sadism to children."}, {"time": 815, "text": "It's just like, this is something even animals know not to do."}, {"time": 823, "text": "Dogs, when you see them around kids, they're very protective."}, {"time": 827, "text": "If the kid pokes their eyes out, the dog doesn't do anything."}, {"time": 830, "text": "So it's like, if you can't even get to that level, what kind of person are you?"}, {"time": 830, "text": "So I think that quote is a profound one, and it's an important one."}, {"time": 839, "text": "It also means we're not all called upon to be Superman."}, {"time": 844, "text": "You only have very finite ability to move the needle."}, {"time": 844, "text": "But at the same time, if you have actually saved the life, you can go to meet your maker."}, {"time": 852, "text": "You did your part."}, {"time": 852, "text": "You left the world a little bit better than you found it."}, {"time": 858, "text": "And that's all you could ask anybody."}, {"time": 861, "text": "Also, I think from a policy perspective, it seems we just do better when we focus on doing a small thing, helping one person."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Because it feels like when you start talking about communism and all those kinds of things, when you start to believe you could do good by a lot of people, that's where your mind somehow stops being able to do good by a lot of people."}, {"time": 878, "text": "That's when you start to think about utopias and somehow utopias goes to feeds power into the brain to where it deludes you completely."}, {"time": 891, "text": "And then you start, it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelette kind of reasoning and you run into trouble."}, {"time": 896, "text": "It seems like it's much better even when you have the power and the money and so on to achieve scale, to focus on one and then... Or locally, yeah."}, {"time": 901, "text": "Locally, yeah."}, {"time": 908, "text": "Because then also you have the feedback."}, {"time": 908, "text": "So if you have some kind of program in Austin or Brooklyn or something like that, and you can watch, oh, this is working, this isn't working, then you could port it out to other places."}, {"time": 917, "text": "But top down helping is at the very least, it's going to be inefficient."}, {"time": 922, "text": "And also I think it's a lot more useful when you're helping people when it's a one on one relationship because then it's less, I don't know, embarrassing, but certainly less something to receive help."}, {"time": 931, "text": "And you also feel it's one thing if you get a check from the government, food stamps, it's nothing if someone's like, hey, I'm going to buy your groceries until you get back on your feet."}, {"time": 940, "text": "You have this kind of motivation, I think for most people to be like, you know what?"}, {"time": 944, "text": "This person believed in me."}, {"time": 944, "text": "I'm going to make it worth their while that they believed in me because I didn't believe in me."}, {"time": 950, "text": "When I was giving lectures at MIT, there was one, it was scared shitless."}, {"time": 955, "text": "And I mean, everybody, you know how students are and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 961, "text": "They're kind of bored and they don't understand that you're human too."}, {"time": 966, "text": "Or this could be just me."}, {"time": 966, "text": "They don't understand you're trying to pass as human."}, {"time": 973, "text": "But there's one gentleman in the audience and he went to all the lectures, all the gentlemen, he was a faculty at MIT."}, {"time": 980, "text": "And he just, without very kind of nonchalant, just said, after the lectures, he would kind of nod at me and say, you did great."}, {"time": 988, "text": "And before, like one time he said, in a non creepy way, I know this is going to come off as creepy."}, {"time": 995, "text": "He said, you look great today."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "He said that in the way, so he's like 60, 70, whatever."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "It's in a wise sage way, because I was wearing a suit and tie."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "I look like, when you dress up like a young kid, you dress them up for school."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "So he was just like, all right, you're all dressed up."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "You're looking great."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "You got this."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "That has a lasting impact, that kind of pat on the back."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "Cruelty towards other adults is somehow understandable, because it's a world full of conflict, but cruelty towards children doesn't, it doesn't quite, I can't understand it."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "I can't understand how you could act in a way that directly causes suffering to a child in front of you."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "I don't think I've ever talked to you, this might be a good time to ask you about this."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "What do you make, what lessons do you draw about human civilization from Jeffrey Epstein, from just laying out?"}, {"time": 1064, "text": "Everybody thinks about different things."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "When you talk to Eric Weinstein, he thinks about intelligence and Jeffrey Epstein is a front for something else."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "That's what he thinks about."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "I think about the weakness of grown men in the face of charismatic evil, which is like, for me directly, is MIT."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "I actually was, I guess I was at MIT when Jeffrey Epstein was just at the very end."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "He must have been there."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "I didn't know any of this, but it really bothers me that nobody was able to see through this man because he's obviously, what is also obvious to me is that he was very charismatic."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "I try to think about human nature from this perspective is directly, like we said, help one life."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "Would I know a Jeffrey Epstein if he was in my life?"}, {"time": 1121, "text": "Would I know evil when I saw evil?"}, {"time": 1130, "text": "Even if it's sitting across from you."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "The evil laugh."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "It's a Necronomicon."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "I'm sure we'll talk about it."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "We see things, you and I, Michael, very differently about a lot of things politically and so on."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "The reason I like you a lot, the reason I like the people I do in my life is there's a warmth, there's a kindness, there's a humanity underneath it all."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "I don't really care what you believe."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "I don't care what your Twitter says."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "It's easy to mistake your Twitter to indicate that there's not a deeply human love for humanity in there."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "And that's why I'm detecting that."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "I think I would be able to detect that Jeffrey Epstein."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "If you say detect, I'm just imagining the T1000 sketch."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "Detected."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "I imagine, I hope I would be able to not detect that Epstein lacks that completely."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "Even if he's charismatic in the humor he has, even if he is charismatic in the expression of curiosity for science, which he did."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "He was curious about not just boring minutia of science."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "He was interested about the big questions in science, which I could see that become exciting to scientists."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "Like, oh wow, here's a person who's thinking big."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "That's always exciting."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "When somebody goes into a room and thinks about how do we solve intelligence?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "How do we travel faster than the speed of light?"}, {"time": 1231, "text": "That's exciting to people, especially people with money because it's like, all right, so we might be able to actually do big things here."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "But you could see through the bullshit, the deadness in the eyes."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "So I think about that because I feel like I have the responsibility for me as an individual to detect evil."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "So I, do you know who Michael Allig is?"}, {"time": 1254, "text": "This is going to be a whole long, this is going to be on Lex Clips, but this is a whole long story."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "So there was a scene in New York in the nineties called the Club Kids."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And they would go out to different nightclubs at night."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "They would all dress in really kind of crazy costumes."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "And the costumes were all like goofy and like just like an angel."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "This was dressed like a nurse."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "There was a juvenile aspect to it."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "They're all taking, you know, ketamine and ecstasy to all hours."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "This is kind of, rape culture was coming up in there."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "And ahead of it, and in fact, there's a clip on YouTube."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "I think it was the Jane Whitney show of the Club Kids and Gigi Allen."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "Gigi Allen is a, you know, kind of punk rock performer, hard rock performer who passed away."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "And the audience and Gigi Allen was very aggressive and like a crazy person."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "My friend once saw him in a concert and he took a dump on stage, smeared it all over his face, grabbed the girl from the audience, gave her a big kiss."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "And as she walked by him, she just went like this, like, excuse me, like went to the bathroom."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "So the audience is screaming at Gigi Allen because he's very visibly over the top."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Whereas you got a bunch of these kids dressed in these silly costumes, you guys just having fun."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Well, the head of the Club Kids, Michael Allig, ended up killing someone."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "There was a kid called Angel Menendez who hung around with them."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "He would always have angel wings and boots."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "One time they're at Michael's condo with another drug dealer named Freeze."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "They got into a fight."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "So Angel got hit in the head with a hammer."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "They kill him."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "What are we going to do with the body?"}, {"time": 1352, "text": "They put it on ice in the bathtub."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "They had a party."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "So everyone's going to the bathroom while Angel's body's there."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Michael got, they're like, all right, we got to take care of this."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Michael got extremely high in heroin, had like a cutlery from Macy's, saw the body in pieces, put it in a box."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "They took him in a cab."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "The cab driver helped them throw the body into the river."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "And then Michael starts walking around Manhattan wearing Angel's boots and would tell people, oh, I killed Angel."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "Now, because he was a super effeminate, over the top, like he would pee in people's beer kind of guy, everyone's like, oh God, Michael, like you and your stupid pranks."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "But it was true."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "And he got caught and he got sentenced to jail."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "So I was in a store in Manhattan in Soho."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And it was one of those stores where you have like all sorts of things for sale."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "And I saw a painting and it said Malice."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "And I'm like, wait, what?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "And it was M. Allig."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "It was a Michael Allig painting."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "He had painted while in jail."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "So my mom bought it for me for my birthday."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "I don't remember what birthday it was."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "And I started writing to him in prison."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "He was going to write a memoir called Aligula, which is clever."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "And then I actually went to visit him."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "I'm like, I want to see what this person's like."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "Because on one hand, he's king of New York nightlife, this goofy person."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "And it's also kind of ironic that G.G."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "Allen is like, maybe he's gross."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "He's not killing anybody."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "He's probably an accountant off the stage."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "And Michael Allig actually did kill someone and then bragged about it, tongue in cheek."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "But meeting him, he passed away last December, on Christmas actually, on Christmas 2020."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "He was clearly a sociopath."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And I'd never met a sociopath before."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "Now, a lot of times you'll read these, you'll take a BuzzFeed quiz, like, are you a

there's that expression, all writing is editing."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "So for the White Pills specifically, this is, I don't know if it's the most ambitious book I've ever done, your reader I think is more ambitious because that's all of North Korea's history and it's written in somebody else's voice, not a person's abortion."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "And you, like you mentioned, you had to read a giant number of books."}, {"time": 6222, "text": "Yeah, 60 books as research, yeah."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "Well, maybe can we just pause, can you say what White Pill is about?"}, {"time": 6228, "text": "Sure, it's about hope and it's a tale of good and evil."}, {"time": 6232, "text": "And I think that's, I don't want to tip my hand too much, but people are always like, how do you think, why are you so hopeful?"}, {"time": 6238, "text": "And I'm not hopeful on an emotional level, I'm hopeful because looking at history, I think there's certain things that not will certainly happen again, but it's not at all implausible to happen again and that the good guys will win."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "And this is one of those cases."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "So, the book took on a life of its own, it's very different from how I originally conceived it."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "I originally conceived it as a kind of retelling of Camus philosophy, Ryan Holiday, who he used to be close friends with, I've talked to him in a while."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "He has a whole kind of cottage industry based on the Stoics of the past."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "I'm like, okay, I asked him once, can I do this with Camus?"}, {"time": 6276, "text": "He said, sure."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "And then I reread Camus recently and it wasn't what I had remembered."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "I was like, Camus wasn't that, I apologize to interrupt."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "So, it's interesting."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "So, he kind of took ideas from Stoics and started to kind of use it as a book that gives you advice about how to live life from the Stoic perspectives."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "And you were thinking, is there something in existentialism, absurdism, or something specifically in Camus thinking, or I think you've mentioned Mithos Sisyphus, specifically like his philosophical work."}, {"time": 6311, "text": "So, you were trying to see like, is there, can I resurrect this?"}, {"time": 6315, "text": "That's actually, I would think, that's an interesting project."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "And it's sad to hear that it didn't materialize in exactly that form, because I thought there would be a lot in that."}, {"time": 6333, "text": "So, I had Douglas Murray on my show and he also made the point, like when you go back and read Camus, there's not that much there."}, {"time": 6338, "text": "The myth of Sisyphus is not at all how I remembered it."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "The vast bulk of that book is like literary criticism."}, {"time": 6346,

title essay is basically like a six chapter essay at the back of the book, which it's good for what it is, but there's not that much there to draw."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "I'm extremely, he's a

6383, "text": "It's the kind of book where reading the book doesn't add anything to the plot."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "The plot is a plague comes, sleeps over the town, destroys a lot of life and vanishes quickly as it came."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "You don't need to read the book now."}, {"time": 6395, "text": "You get the point."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "I deeply disagree with you."},

a time of tragedy like The Plague."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "Also, it's an allegory, so you could start to think about whether it's Nazi Germany, whatever you think that is."}, {"time": 6421, "text":

is told, I think, has a lot of meaning."}, {"time": 6439, "text": "It's like, to me, you saying that's interesting."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "You say it this way, but to me, it's like saying Animal Farm doesn't need to be read because it's an obvious story."}, {"time": 6451, "text": "I don't think there's much plot to The Plague."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "I think Animal Farm has a very long plot and a complex plot."}, {"time": 6458, "text": "But there's experiences within."}, {"time": 6462, "text": "So the situation is set up in The Plague and there's experiences that start to reveal a philosophy."}, {"time": 6468, "text": "So yeah, it's not very plot driven."}, {"time": 6473, "text": "So I would say you still should read it, but The Plague doesn't... Like you didn't give away anything currently."}, {"time": 6483, "text": "Some books are just..."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "I mean, Ayn Rand is similar to that in the sense like The Plague is not as

necessarily the important thing."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "To me, the behavior of the people is the important thing."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "You could like separate it into a bunch of blog posts

understand the different values that people have, but yeah."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "Yeah, but that's what the plot serves."}, {"time": 6524, "text": "Yeah, I would have to think."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "But in The Plague, it's the behavior of the people that's really important."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "And the same, I mean, The Stranger too."}, {"time": 6531, "text": "I mean, these like..."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "I'm trying to scramble here for books I really appreciate that don't have a plot."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "I mean, Notes from Underground."}, {"time": 6544,

the plot."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "He's the one who doesn't have plots."}, {"time": 6554, "text": "Thomas Mann."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "Would you say Kafka has a plot?"}, {"time": 6557, "text":

6565, "text": "Yeah, but there's like crawling around."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "But it's like a vignette."}, {"time": 6568, "text": "It's not really like this."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "It's not short, yeah."}, {"time": 6570, "text": "A Hunger Artist, one of my probably favorite short stories is that kind of a short story."}, {"time": 6575, "text": "It's a pretty long short story of Kafka's."}, {"time": 6580, "text": "It's about a man."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "I don't know if you read it."}, {"time": 6583, "text": "It's about a man that is like a freak in a sense that his skill is that he can fast for a long time."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "And then people gather on the cage and look at him as he fasts."}, {"time": 6597, "text": "I don't actually remember if he's in a cage or not."}, {"time": 6600, "text": "And eventually, he fasts so long that people don't even care anymore."}, {"time": 6604, "text": "Like they just leave."}, {"time": 6606, "text": "So there's a, it has to do something."}, {"time": 6611, "text": "It makes me think about like, don't become, the way you live, don't become like a freak show, a circus act."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "Like live for an ideal, live for something that brings you joy."}, {"time": 6625, "text": "Or don't live for the sake of attention."}, {"time": 6627, "text": "For the sake of attention."}, {"time": 6630, "text": "Yeah, anyway, so I rudely interrupted because you were talking about the plague and connecting it to the writing process of White Pill."}, {"time": 6640, "text": "Well, anyway, so how I was writing this one, I just had a first draft of notes and it's not in chronological order."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "It's like, I read certain books as research and then I had the pull quotes that was necessary there."}, {"time": 6654, "text": "And now I'm basically rearranging everything and putting it."}, {"time": 6657, "text": "So the book started as Ryan Holiday's."}, {"time": 6661, "text": "The equivalent of Ryan Holiday as Camus, the working title would have been The Point of Tears because this is great."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "Camus is a great quote maker and he has this line about man must live, live to the point of tears, which I think is just what I love about him is Camus, he always comes off as like he's clenching his teeth."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "He's clenching his teeth both in terms of like barely mitigated rage and injustice."}, {"time": 6689, "text": "Like when he sees people suffering, it just really makes him like just upset to the core."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "But also this sense of not taking life for granted and kind of just pushing yourself and pushing the boundaries."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "And his point being that life is inherently meaningless, which gives a great opportunity to impute meaning to it to create our own meaning to life."}, {"time": 6713, "text": "So taking the main essay from Sisyphus, myth of Sisyphus, that was the origin story for the white pill, but then it became something completely different."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "And so then it became, how are you so optimistic in the face of everything that's going on in the world?"}, {"time": 6727, "text": "And I started writing it when COVID started hitting."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "And I, because again, I'm not optimistic because of some temperament of mine."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "I'm optimistic because, you know, people talk about how if the US didn't exist, China would just become an empire and take over everything."}, {"time": 6744,

movie."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "Like once it happens, it's the happy ending for them."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "So yeah, that was the start."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "And I'm like, all right, let me tell, one thing I'm good at is telling stories."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "So this is really a..."}, {"time": 6780, "text": "So this is narrative, plot driven."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "Very, very plot driven and also heavily character driven, but the characters are real."}, {"time": 6789, "text": "So it's interesting to kind of mention what kind of, what does the first draft kind of look like in terms of, what kind of things do you plop down?"}, {"time": 6799, "text": "Oh, so it'll be like, let's suppose I just read a, like, you know, some book called The Guillotine at Work, which was an early book attacking Lenin from the anarcho communist perspective."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "So it'll just be like all the different quotes, like a paragraph here, double space, another paragraph, you know, blah, blah, blah, so on and so forth."}, {"time": 6816, "text": "Whereas for other sections where I wasn't just using the book as research, there would be like talking about McKinley getting shot."}, {"time": 6823, "text": "Like it's just me writing the narrative and that I could just pretty much copy paste into the second draft."}, {"time": 6829, "text": "By way of advice, would you give that as advice?"}, {"time": 6832, "text": "Is that a good way to do it?"}, {"time": 6834, "text": "Or is that a very peculiar way your brain works?"}, {"time": 6836, "text": "No, so this is actually advice I feel comfortable giving to people who are trying to write."}, {"time": 6842, "text": "Because it's just like with the gym, right?"}, {"time": 6844, "text": "If you did seven sets, seven, excuse me, reps last week and you did eight this week, it's psychologically motivating because you're going the right direction and the human mind extrapolates."}, {"time": 6854, "text": "So make sure, tell yourself I'm gonna get a page done today or two pages done, sit your ass down on the computer, you're not allowed to get up till you get those two pages."}, {"time": 6864, "text": "It doesn't matter if they look like garbage because if you have a 300 page first draft and it's crap, at least you have something to work with and that's a big number."}, {"time": 6874, "text": "So if you're gonna, the thing is, since the first draft is gonna be crap, if you're editing as you write, it's gonna be extremely discouraging."}, {"time": 6882, "text": "And it's also trying to drive and doing reverse at the same time."}, {"time": 6886, "text": "It's a completely nonsensical way to do it."}, {"time": 6888, "text": "Get it all out there, don't look it over."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "If you have a great line, put it in your phone and then add it to the draft so it'll be a complete slog."}, {"time": 6897, "text": "But editing that slog is gonna be a lot easier than creating it to begin with."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "And when you see those disparate lines all laid out on the page, how difficult is it to then start stitching it together?"}, {"time": 6908, "text": "Do you find that when you look at a list of those things the final product will look very different or will you actually use those lines?"}, {"time": 6917, "text": "No, I will use those lines."}, {"time": 6918, "text": "Then I have a file called scraps."}, {"time": 6920, "text": "So like if the line's no longer used, I put it in my scrap pile."}, {"time": 6924, "text": "I'd love to see what's in the scrap pile."}, {"time": 6926, "text": "Okay, yeah, sure."}, {"time": 6928, "text": "One of the things I've been pulling scraps is a lot of times when I was earlier writing, I would have contemporary references and I realized that that's bad because I want the reader to be in the past as the present."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "So if you're talking about let's say 1901 and then you're referring to Obama, that screws people up so I had to pull all those."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "Okay, let's talk about some New Year's resolutions."}, {"time": 6953, "text": "Do you ever do New Year's resolutions?"}, {"time": 6955, "text": "Do you ever think like that, like take a special day in the year to think about how you're gonna try to change yourself or do you try to transform yourself

lot."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "I finally got a new computer which my friend Jay installed so I can have a decent camera because of my old, this is my mindset as a hoarder."}, {"time": 7123, "text":

as a result of it that really mean a lot to me."}, {"time": 7150, "text": "It's made my life profoundly better place."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "But it's not the same as that book on the shelf,

this happens inevitably with elites, it's, you know, it happens in universities, it happens in the food industry, there's only so many people at the top of these things, the field is small, and

us because you're not in the boardroom, but we're not, you know, we are trying to produce a product that people want."}, {"time": 10269, "text": "So unlike the people who criticized me, I was bothered

say that there's no corruption, you should show that because we constantly worry about it."}, {"time": 10296, "text": "Not because like, look, there's rules."}, {"time": 10299, "text": "Yeah, which are enforced by you."}, {"time": 10301, "text": "So like, I think the only way to avoid force for time, the corrupting force of power is to freak out about it, nonstop."}, {"time": 10313, "text": "The impression I always get from people like him, and I haven't seen the interview and I won't be watching it, is they're genuinely convinced that they're good guys."}, {"time": 10324, "text": "And if you're the good guy, sure corruption is a concern theoretically, but I know this guy at the FDA, I know this senator, sure we disagree, sure they do some things I don't like, but in terms of corrupt,

the 21st century."}, {"time": 10345, "text": "The thought process, I think, writes itself."}, {"time": 10348, "text": "I think, yeah, having the humility, I do this all the time, maybe to a destructive level, thinking that I might be doing bad for the world, I might be wrong, I might be that kind of thinking is very, you should do at least some of that."}, {"time": 10358, "text": "Not to a point of being paralyzed, but a little bit."}, {"time": 10364, "text": "You're actually in the right mindset for me to ask you then for advice."}, {"time": 10369, "text": "You're in this

that."}, {"time": 10388, "text": "Like if you had them on your show or just giving me advice on how to talk to them, what do you think is the right way to talk to them?"}, {"time": 10400, "text": "And forget about future guests, but like to get at something new, you know, together."}, {"time": 10408, "text": "Like get at something, not for views or likes or clicks or any of that, but discover something new through the mode of conversation."}, {"time": 10415, "text": "Well, like let's take those one at a time."}, {"time": 10415, "text": "So if I was talking to Trump, I told Ruben to ask Trump this and he didn't."}, {"time": 10420, "text": "What I wanted to know is what's the look on your face when you're sending these tweets, right?"}, {"time": 10425, "text": "Because I imagine him

that Trump little smirk he does?"}, {"time": 10435, "text": "So when you get someone to open up about their emotion, about some of their passion, I think that breaks down some barriers and creates a bond."}, {"time": 10445, "text": "But Ruben wouldn't be, that's not his style."}, {"time": 10445, "text": "Like that's a great question for you to ask."}, {"time": 10449, "text": "Well, I told him to say Michael Malice."}, {"time": 10451, "text": "Oh, Michael Malice."}, {"time": 10453, "text": "For Biden, that would be a tough one because Biden gets, doesn't get enough credit for what a good politician he is."}, {"time": 10459, "text": "There was this moment people can see on YouTube where Biden is addressing a room full of people and he had someone there and he goes, can you, why don't you stand up so everyone can give you a hand?"}, {"time": 10470, "text": "And the guy was in a wheelchair and Biden's like, oh, and like, but instantly he goes, you know what, we're all going to stand up for you."}, {"time": 10477, "text": "And he made everyone get up and applaud the guy."}, {"time": 10481, "text": "I'm like, that's quick."}, {"time": 10481, "text": "Like, yeah, you made a fool of yourself."}, {"time": 10485, "text": "So he is a glad hander."}, {"time": 10485, "text": "In many ways, he's more of a schmoozer than Trump was."}, {"time": 10485, "text": "Like Trump made the point that he knows all the good people, but Biden knows how to shake hands."}, {"time": 10494, "text": "Well, I think with both, and sorry to interrupt, with both Trump and Biden, like you mentioned earlier, to me, at least their family is fascinating."}, {"time": 10498, "text": "The dynamic as a family man, as a father, as a..."}, {"time": 10503, "text": "I think that Biden won't acknowledge his illegitimate grandkid is a problem for me."}, {"time": 10508, "text": "But at the same time, I can see why he thinks it's off limits to ask."}, {"time": 10513, "text": "So that's the thing when you're dealing with people that powerful, they're not used to having to answer questions, which might be perfectly nice, but would cause them to freak the hell out."}, {"time": 10522, "text": "That's the tricky thing of talking to people, as you know, like some, some topics are off limit, not in that they draw lines, but they just shut down when you ask them."}, {"time": 10527, "text": "Trust me, I think I talked to Elon three times now, you better believe I brought up love."}, {"time": 10534, "text": "And how far do you think that got?"}, {"time": 10540, "text": "And you could just imagine exactly."}, {"time": 10540, "text": "We did exactly the kind of robot back and forth."}, {"time": 10540, "text": "And he just like just shut down."}, {"time": 10547, "text": "So yeah, I worry about that with the person."}, {"time": 10547, "text": "But that's the thing that makes it fascinating with those two, because he had with Hunter and losing his son, like the dynamic of the complexities of all that, like just having children fuck up in the way children do."}, {"time": 10568, "text": "And then with Trump, the interesting dynamic with his very different kids and all kind of interesting in different ways and maintaining connection with all of them and also letting them flourish individually is fascinating to me."}, {"time": 10579, "text": "Well, I also want to ask Trump if he can name all the presidents in order, which there's no, he can, but I'd also want to know all the, do you think he knows who the second president of the United States is?"}, {"time": 10588, "text": "John Adams, he knows."}, {"time": 10588, "text": "I think when it gets between Ulysses S.

between Donald Trump and Putin, not the interaction, like not the stupid journalistic stuff, but it's clear to me that he is a student of power."}, {"time": 10653, "text": "And like he enjoys the game of power."}, {"time": 10661, "text": "And so it's interesting because to me, the reason he admires Putin is it's another player in the game of power."}, {"time": 10666, "text": "And I think why so many people hate him, Trump, is that he demonstrated to a lot of Americans how much of a con job most of politics is and how people just say what they need to do."}, {"time": 10679, "text": "But behind closed doors, these people are buffoons and he exposed them as that."}, {"time": 10683, "text": "I'd also, so the Biden, I think Biden would be a tougher interview than Trump because I feel like Biden's more slippery in many ways."}, {"time": 10690, "text": "He's much more of a consummate politician."}, {"time": 10694, "text": "He's been in the Senate since the early seventies, since he was like 30 or 35, whatever it was."}, {"time": 10699, "text": "So, you know, he'd have his little kind of pat answers."}, {"time": 10699, "text": "There was Larry King, who was certainly a softball interviewer and I don't begrudge him that at all."}, {"time": 10706, "text": "I remember very vividly and it was like, I think it was the 2008 cycle."}, {"time": 10711, "text": "He asked Hillary, why do so many people hate you?"}, {"time": 10716, "text": "Why do you think so many people hate you?"}, {"time": 10716, "text": "And she just goes like, oh, well, I take tough stances on the, and he cut her off."}, {"time": 10720, "text": "He goes, other people have taken those stances."}, {"time": 10724, "text": "Why do they hate you?"}, {"time": 10724, "text": "And she didn't really, I was really impressed with him that he didn't let her off the hook."}, {"time": 10728, "text": "That to me is great."}, {"time": 10728, "text": "But some people will say that's still too softball because you like, they would want him to start listing, I don't know, droning, like all the things that Hillary Clinton is criticized for."}, {"time": 10742, "text": "Yeah, but then what she, she's done this many times."}, {"time": 10742, "text": "She's very good at this."}, {"time": 10746, "text": "She'll be like, look, I've addressed all these in the past."}, {"time": 10746, "text": "If you want to start rehashing Republican talking points, you can go look up my interviews."}, {"time": 10749, "text": "Yeah, I think it's counterproductive."}, {"time": 10753, "text": "So what about more prescient for me?"}, {"time": 10753, "text": "I can't believe I'm walking through this fire for no good reason whatsoever, but Anthony Fauci."}, {"time": 10760, "text": "So let me tell you why I care about Anthony

how amazing of a person he is."}, {"time": 10843, "text": "Well, I would also be curious about the AIDS stuff."}, {"time": 10843, "text": "Because that's something gets criticized about and I wouldn't
