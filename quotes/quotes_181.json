metrics about what that is."}, {"time": 313, "text": "And then in an organization of 1,000 people who build a computer, there's lots of different disciplines that you have to operate on."}, {"time": 325, "text": "And so..."}, {"time": 327, "text": "So there's a bunch of levels of abstraction in an organization like Intel and in your own vision, there's a lot of brilliance that comes in at every one of those layers."}, {"time": 339, "text": "Some of it is science, some of it is engineering, some of it is art, what's the most, if you could pick favorites, what's the most important, your favorite layer on these layers of abstractions?"}, {"time": 351, "text": "Where does the magic enter this hierarchy?"}, {"time": 355, "text": "I don't really care."}, {"time": 357, "text": "That's the fun, you know, I'm somewhat agnostic to that."}, {"time": 360, "text": "So I would say for relatively long periods of time, instruction sets are stable."}, {"time": 368, "text": "So the x86 instruction set, the ARM instruction set."}, {"time": 372, "text": "What's an instruction set?"}, {"time": 373, "text": "So it says, how do you encode the basic operations?"}, {"time": 376, "text": "Load, store, multiply, add, subtract, conditional, branch."}, {"time": 380, "text": "You know, there aren't that many interesting instructions."}, {"time": 383, "text": "Look, if you look at a program and it runs, you know, 90% of the execution is on 25 opcodes, you know, 25 instructions."}, {"time": 391, "text": "And those are stable, right?"}, {"time": 393, "text": "What does it mean, stable?"}, {"time": 395, "text": "Intel architecture's been around for 25 years."}, {"time": 399, "text": "And that's because the basics, you know, are defined a long time ago, right?"}, {"time": 405, "text": "Now, the way an old computer ran is you fetched instructions and you executed them in order."}, {"time": 412, "text": "Do the load, do the add, do the compare."}, {"time": 417, "text": "The way a modern computer works is you fetch large numbers of instructions, say 500."}, {"time": 423, "text": "And then you find the dependency graph between the instructions."}, {"time": 427, "text": "And then you execute in independent units those little micrographs."}, {"time": 435, "text": "So a modern computer, like people like to say, computers should be simple and clean."}, {"time": 440, "text": "But it turns out the market for simple, clean, slow computers is zero, right?"}, {"time": 446, "text": "We don't sell any simple, clean computers."}, {"time": 449, "text": "No, you can, how you build it can be clean, but the computer people want to buy, that's, say, in a phone or a data center, fetches a large number of instructions, computes the dependency graph, and then executes it in a way that gets the right answers."}, {"time": 469, "text": "And optimizes that graph somehow."}, {"time": 470, "text": "Yeah, they run deeply out of order."}, {"time": 473, "text": "And then there's semantics around how memory ordering works and other things work."}, {"time": 478, "text": "So the computer sort of has a bunch of bookkeeping tables that says what order should these operations finish in or appear to finish in?"}, {"time": 487, "text": "But to go fast, you have to fetch a lot of instructions and find all the parallelism."}, {"time": 492, "text": "Now, there's a second kind of computer, which we call GPUs today."}, {"time": 497, "text": "And I call it the difference."}, {"time": 499, "text": "There's found parallelism, like you have a program with a lot of dependent instructions."}, {"time": 504, "text": "You fetch a bunch and then you go figure out the dependency graph and you issue instructions out of order."}, {"time": 509, "text": "That's because you have one serial narrative to execute, which, in fact, can be done out of order."}, {"time": 515, "text": "Did you call it a narrative?"}, {"time": 518, "text": "Yeah, so humans think of serial narrative."}, {"time": 520, "text": "So read a book, right?"}, {"time": 522, "text": "There's a sentence after sentence after sentence, and there's paragraphs."}, {"time": 526, "text": "Now, you could diagram that."}, {"time": 529, "text": "Imagine you diagrammed it properly and you said, which sentences could be read in any order, any order without changing the meaning, right?"}, {"time": 539, "text": "That's a fascinating question to ask of a book, yeah."}, {"time": 542, "text": "Yeah, you could do that, right?"}, {"time": 544, "text": "So some paragraphs could be reordered, some sentences can be reordered."}, {"time": 548, "text": "You could say, he is tall and smart and X, right?"}, {"time": 555, "text": "And it doesn't matter the order of tall and smart."}, {"time": 559, "text": "But if you say the tall man is wearing a red shirt, what colors, you can create dependencies, right?"}, {"time": 568, "text": "And so GPUs, on the other hand, run simple programs on pixels, but you're given a million of them."}, {"time": 576, "text": "And the first order, the screen you're looking at doesn't care which order you do it in."}, {"time": 582, "text": "So I call that given parallelism."}, {"time": 584, "text": "Simple narratives around the large numbers of things where you can just say, it's parallel because you told me it was."}, {"time": 592, "text": "So found parallelism where the narrative is sequential, but you discover like little pockets of parallelism versus."}, {"time": 601, "text": "Turns out large pockets of parallelism."}, {"time": 603, "text": "Large, so how hard is it to discover?"}, {"time": 605, "text": "Well, how hard is it?"}, {"time": 606, "text": "That's just transistor count, right?"}, {"time": 608, "text": "So once you crack the problem, you say, here's how you fetch 10 instructions at a time."}, {"time": 613, "text": "Here's how you calculate the dependencies between them."}, {"time": 616, "text": "Here's how you describe the dependencies."}, {"time": 618, "text": "Here's, you know, these are pieces, right?"}, {"time": 620, "text": "So once you describe the dependencies, then it's just a graph."}, {"time": 627, "text": "Sort of, it's an algorithm that finds, what is that?"}, {"time": 631, "text": "I'm sure there's a graph theoretical answer here that's solvable."}, {"time": 635, "text": "In general, programs, modern programs that human beings write, how much found parallelism is there in them?"}, {"time": 645, "text": "What does 10X mean?"}, {"time": 647, "text": "So if you execute it in order, you would get what's called cycles per instruction, and it would be about, you know, three instructions, three cycles per instruction because of the latency of the operations and stuff."}, {"time": 662, "text": "And in a modern computer, excuse it, but like 0.2, 0.25 cycles per instruction."}, {"time": 668, "text": "So it's about, we today find 10X."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And there's two things."}, {"time": 673, "text": "One is the found parallelism in the narrative, right?"}, {"time": 677, "text": "And the other is the predictability of the narrative, right?"}, {"time": 681, "text": "So certain operations say, do a bunch of calculations, and if greater than one, do this, else do that."}, {"time": 690, "text": "That decision is predicted in modern computers to high 90% accuracy."}, {"time": 696, "text": "So branches happen a lot."}, {"time": 698, "text": "So imagine you have a decision to make every six instructions, which is about the average, right?"}, {"time": 703, "text": "But you want to fetch 500 instructions, figure out the graph, and execute them all in parallel."}, {"time": 708, "text": "That means you have, let's say, if you fetch 600 instructions and it's every six, you have to fetch, you have to predict 99 out of 100 branches correctly for that window to be effective."}, {"time": 722, "text": "Okay, so parallelism, you can't parallelize branches."}, {"time": 726, "text": "Or you can."}, {"time": 727, "text": "No, you can predict."}, {"time": 728, "text": "You can predict."}, {"time": 729, "text": "What does predicted branch mean?"}, {"time": 731, "text": "So imagine you do a computation over and over."}, {"time": 733, "text": "You're in a loop."}, {"time": 734, "text": "So while n is greater than one, do."}, {"time": 739, "text": "And you go through that loop a million times."}, {"time": 741, "text": "So every time you look at the branch, you say, it's probably still greater than one."}, {"time": 745, "text": "And you're saying you could do that accurately."}, {"time": 747, "text": "Very accurately."}, {"time": 748, "text": "Modern computers."}, {"time": 749, "text": "My mind is blown."}, {"time": 750, "text": "How the heck do you do that?"}, {"time": 752, "text": "Well, you want to know?"}, {"time": 753, "text": "This is really sad."}, {"time": 755, "text": "20 years ago, you simply recorded which way the branch went last time and predicted the same thing."}, {"time": 764, "text": "What's the accuracy of that?"}, {"time": 766, "text": "85%."}, {"time": 768, "text": "So then somebody said, hey, let's keep a couple of bits and have a little counter so when it predicts one way, we count up and then pins."}, {"time": 776, "text": "So say you have a three bit counter."}, {"time": 778, "text": "So you count up and then you count down."}, {"time": 780, "text": "And you can use the top bit as the signed bit so you have a signed two bit number."}, {"time": 785, "text": "So if it's greater than one, you predict taken."}, {"time": 787, "text": "And less than one, you predict not taken, right?"}, {"time": 791, "text": "Or less than zero, whatever the thing is."}, {"time": 794, "text": "And that got us to 92%."}, {"time": 797, "text": "Okay, no, it gets better."}, {"time": 799, "text": "This branch depends on how you got there."}, {"time": 802, "text": "So if you came down the code one way, you're talking about Bob and Jane, right?"}, {"time": 808, "text": "And then said, does Bob like Jane?"}, {"time": 810, "text": "It went one way."}, {"time": 811, "text": "But if you're talking about Bob and Jill, does Bob like Jane?"}, {"time": 813, "text": "You go a different way."}, {"time": 815, "text": "Right, so that's called history."}, {"time": 816, "text": "So you take the history and a counter."}, {"time": 820, "text": "That's cool, but that's not how anything works today."}, {"time": 823, "text": "They use something that looks a little like a neural network."}, {"time": 828, "text": "So modern, you take all the execution flows."}, {"time": 832, "text": "And then you do basically deep pattern recognition of how the program is executing."}, {"time": 839, "text": "And you do that multiple different ways."}, {"time": 843, "text": "And you have something that chooses what the best result is."}, {"time": 847, "text": "There's a little supercomputer inside the computer."}, {"time": 850, "text": "That's trying to predict branching."}, {"time": 851, "text": "That calculates which way branches go."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So the effective window that it's worth finding grass in gets bigger."}, {"time": 859, "text": "Why was that gonna make me sad?"}, {"time": 861, "text": "Because that's amazing."}, {"time": 862, "text": "It's amazingly complicated."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Well, here's the funny thing."}, {"time": 867, "text": "So to get to 85% took 1,000 bits."}, {"time": 871, "text": "To get to 99% takes tens of megabits."}, {"time": 878, "text": "So this is one of those, to get the result, to get from a window of say 50 instructions to 500, it took three orders of magnitude or four orders of magnitude more bits."}, {"time": 892, "text": "Now if you get the prediction of a branch wrong, what happens then?"}, {"time": 896, "text": "You flush the pipe."}, {"time": 897, "text": "You flush the pipe, so it's just the performance cost."}, {"time": 899, "text": "But it gets even better."}, {"time": 901, "text": "So we're starting to look at stuff that says, so they executed down this path, and then you had two ways to go."}, {"time": 909, "text": "But far away, there's something that doesn't matter which path you went."}, {"time": 914, "text": "So you took the wrong path."}, {"time": 917, "text": "You executed a bunch of stuff."}, {"time": 920, "text": "Then you had the mispredicting."}, {"time": 921, "text": "You backed it up."}, {"time": 922, "text": "You remembered all the results you already calculated."}, {"time": 925, "text": "Some of those are just fine."}, {"time": 927, "text": "Like if you read a book and you misunderstand a paragraph, your understanding of the next paragraph sometimes is invariant to that understanding."}, {"time": 935, "text": "Sometimes it depends on it."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And you can kind of anticipate that invariance."}, {"time": 943, "text": "Yeah, well, you can keep track of whether the data changed."}, {"time": 947, "text": "And so when you come back through a piece of code, should you calculate it again or do the same thing?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "Okay, how much of this is art and how much of it is science?"}, {"time": 955, "text": "Because it sounds pretty complicated."}, {"time": 959, "text": "Well, how do you describe a situation?"}, {"time": 960, "text": "So imagine you come to a point in the road where you have to make a decision, right?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "And you have a bunch of knowledge about which way to go."}, {"time": 967, "text": "Maybe you have a map."}, {"time": 968, "text": "So you wanna go the shortest way, or do you wanna go the fastest way, or do you wanna take the nicest road?"}, {"time": 974, "text": "So there's some set of data."}, {"time": 977, "text": "So imagine you're doing something complicated like building a computer."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And there's hundreds of decision points, all with hundreds of possible ways to go."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And the ways you pick interact in a complicated way."}, {"time": 993, "text": "And then you have to pick the right spot."}, {"time": 995, "text": "Right, so that's."}, {"time": 996, "text": "So that's art or science, I don't know."}, {"time": 997, "text": "You avoided the question."}, {"time": 998, "text": "You just described the Robert Frost problem of road less taken."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "I described the Robert Frost problem?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "That's what we do as computer designers."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "It's all poetry."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "Yeah, I don't know how to describe that because some people are very good at making those intuitive leaps."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "It seems like just combinations of things."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "Some people are less good at it, but they're really good at evaluating the alternatives."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "Right, and everybody has a different way to do it."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And some people can't make those leaps, but they're really good at analyzing it."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "So when you see computers are designed by teams of people who have very different skill sets."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And a good team has lots of different kinds of people."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "I suspect you would describe some of them as artistic, but not very many."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "Unfortunately, or fortunately."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "Well, you know, computer design's hard."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "It's 99% perspiration."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "And the 1% inspiration is really important."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "But you still need the 99."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "Yeah, you gotta do a lot of work."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "And then there are interesting things to do at every level of that stack."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "So at the end of the day, if you run the same program multiple times, does it always produce the same result?"}, {"time": 1081, "text": "Is there some room for fuzziness there?"}, {"time": 1084, "text": "That's a math problem."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "So if you run a correct C program, the definition is every time you run it, you get the same answer."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "Yeah, well that's a math statement."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "But that's a language definitional statement."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "So for years when people did, when we first did 3D acceleration of graphics, you could run the same scene multiple times and get different answers."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "Right, and then some people thought that was okay and some people thought it was a bad idea."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "And then when the HPC world used GPUs for calculations, they thought it was a really bad idea."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "Okay, now in modern AI stuff, people are looking at networks where the precision of the data is low enough that the data is somewhat noisy."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "And the observation is the input data is unbelievably noisy."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "So why should the calculation be not noisy?"}, {"time": 1140, "text": "And people have experimented with algorithms that say can get faster answers by being noisy."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "Like as a network starts to converge, if you look at the computation graph, it starts out really wide and then it gets narrower."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "And you can say is that last little bit that important or should I start the graph on the next rev before we whittle it all the way down to the answer, right?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "So you can create algorithms that are noisy."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Now if you're developing something and every time you run it, you get a different answer, it's really annoying."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "And so most people think even today, every time you run the program, you get the same answer."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "No, I know, but the question is that's the formal definition of a programming language."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "There is a definition of languages that don't get the same answer, but people who use those, you always want something because you get a bad answer and then you're wondering is it because of something in the algorithm or because of this?"}, {"time": 1195, "text": "And so everybody wants a little switch that says no matter what, do it deterministically."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "And it's really weird because almost everything going into modern calculations is noisy."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "So why do the answers have to be so clear?"}, {"time": 1208, "text": "Right, so where do you stand?"}, {"time": 1209, "text": "I design computers for people who run programs."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "So if somebody says I want a deterministic answer, like most people want that."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "Can you deliver a deterministic answer, I guess is the question."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "Like when you."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Yeah, hopefully, sure."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "What people don't realize is you get a deterministic answer even though the execution flow is very undeterministic."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "So you run this program 100 times, it never runs the same way twice, ever."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "And the answer, it arrives at the same answer."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "But it gets the same answer every time."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "It's just amazing."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Okay, you've achieved, in the eyes of many people, legend status as a chip art architect."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "What design creation are you most proud of?"}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Perhaps because it was challenging, because of its impact, or because of the set of brilliant ideas that were involved in bringing it to life?"}, {"time": 1266, "text": "I find that description odd."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "And I have two small children, and I promise you, they think it's hilarious."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "This question."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "I do it for them."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "So I'm really interested in building computers."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "And I've worked with really, really smart people."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "I'm not unbelievably smart."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "I'm fascinated by how they go together, both as a thing to do and as an endeavor that people do."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "How people and computers go together?"}, {"time": 1300, "text": "Like how people think and build a computer."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "And I find sometimes that the best computer architects aren't that interested in people, or the best people managers aren't that good at designing computers."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "So the whole stack of human beings is fascinating."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So the managers, the individual engineers."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Yeah, I said I realized after a lot of years of building computers, where you sort of build them out of transistors, logic gates, functional units, computational elements, that you could think of people the same way, so people are functional units."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "And then you could think of organizational design as a computer architecture problem."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "And then it was like, oh, that's super cool, because the people are all different, just like the computational elements are all different."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "And they like to do different things."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "And so I had a lot of fun reframing how I think about organizations."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "Just like with computers, we were saying execution paths, you can have a lot of different paths that end up at the same good destination."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "So what have you learned about the human abstractions from individual functional human units to the broader organization?"}, {"time": 1371, "text": "What does it take to create something special?"}, {"time": 1375, "text": "Well, most people don't think simple enough."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "All right, so the difference between a recipe and the understanding."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "There's probably a philosophical description of this."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "So imagine you're gonna make a loaf of bread."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "The recipe says get some flour, add some water, add some yeast, mix it up, let it rise, put it in a pan, put it in the oven."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "It's a recipe."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "Understanding bread, you can understand biology, supply chains, grain grinders, yeast, physics, thermodynamics, there's so many levels of understanding."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "And then when people build and design things, they frequently are executing some stack of recipes."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And the problem with that is the recipes all have limited scope."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "Like if you have a really good recipe book for making bread, it won't tell you anything about how to make an omelet."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "But if you have a deep understanding of cooking, right, than bread, omelets, you know, sandwich, you know, there's a different way of viewing everything."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "And most people, when you get to be an expert at something, you know, you're hoping to achieve deeper understanding, not just a large set of recipes to go execute."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And it's interesting to walk groups of people because executing recipes is unbelievably efficient if it's what you want to do."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "If it's not what you want to do, you're really stuck."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "And that difference is crucial."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "And everybody has a balance of, let's say, deeper understanding of recipes."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "And some people are really good at recognizing when the problem is to understand something deeply."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "It totally makes sense, does every stage of development, deep understanding on the team needed?"}, {"time": 1495, "text": "Oh, this goes back to the art versus science question."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "If you constantly unpack everything for deeper understanding, you never get anything done."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And if you don't unpack understanding when you need to, you'll do the wrong thing."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "And then at every juncture, like human beings are these really weird things because everything you tell them has a million possible outputs, right?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "And then they all interact in a hilarious way."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "Yeah, it's very interesting."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "And then having some intuition about what you tell them, what you do, when do you intervene, when do you not, it's complicated."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "It's essentially computationally unsolvable."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "Yeah, it's an intractable problem, sure."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "Humans are a mess."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "But with deep understanding, do you mean also sort of fundamental questions of things like what is a computer?"}, {"time": 1551, "text": "Or why, like the why questions, why are we even building this, like of purpose?"}, {"time": 1558, "text":

little simpler."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "So common practice is you build a computer, and then when somebody says, I wanna make it 10% faster, you'll go in and say, all right, I need to make this buffer bigger, and maybe I'll add an add unit."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "Or I have this thing that's three instructions wide, I'm gonna make it four instructions wide."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "And what you see is each piece gets incrementally more complicated, right?"}, {"time": 1594, "text": "And then at some point you hit this limit, like adding another feature or buffer doesn't seem to make it any faster."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "And then people will say, well, that's because it's a fundamental limit."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And then somebody else will look at it and say, well, actually the way you divided the problem up and the way the different features are interacting is limiting you, and it has to be rethought, rewritten."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "So then you refactor it and rewrite it, and what people commonly find is the rewrite is not only faster, but half as complicated."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "From scratch?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "So how often in your career, but just have you seen is needed, maybe more generally, to just throw the whole thing out and start over?"}, {"time": 1634, "text": "This is where I'm on one end of it, every three to five years."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "Which end are you on?"}, {"time": 1641, "text": "Rewrite more often."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "Rewrite, and three to five years is?"}, {"time": 1645, "text": "If you

very hard, because they have one customer who cares about that one."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "So speaking of the long term, for over 50 years now, Moore's Law has served, for me and millions of

0.5."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "But that's referring strictly, again, to the original definition of just."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "A transistor count."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "A shrink factor's

one over 0.6 more transistors."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "So can you linger on it a little longer?"}, {"time": 1889, "text": "What's a broader, what do you think should be the broader definition of Moore's Law?"}, {"time": 1893, "text": "When you mentioned how you think of performance, just broadly, what's a good way to think about Moore's Law?"}, {"time": 1902, "text": "Well, first of all, I've been aware of Moore's Law for 30 years."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "In which sense?"}, {"time": 1909, "text": "Well, I've been designing computers for 40."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "You're just watching it before your eyes kind of thing."}, {"time": 1916, "text": "And somewhere where I became aware of it, I was also informed that Moore's Law was gonna die in 10 to 15 years."}, {"time": 1922,

gonna die in five years."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "And then it went back up to 10 years."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "And at some point, I decided not to worry about that particular prognostication for the rest of my life, which is fun."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "And then I joined Intel and everybody said Moore's Law is dead."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "And I thought that's sad, because it's the Moore's Law company."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "And it's not dead."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "And it's always been gonna die."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "And humans like these apocryphal kind of statements, like we'll run out of food, or we'll run out of air, or we'll run out of room, or we'll run out of something."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "Right, but it's still incredible that it's lived for as long as it has."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "And yes, there's many people who believe now that Moore's Law is dead."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "You know, they can join the last 50 years of people who had the same idea."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "Yeah, there's a long tradition."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "But why do you think, if you can try to understand it, why do you think it's not dead?"}, {"time": 1983, "text": "Well, let's just think, people think Moore's Law is one thing, transistors get smaller."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "But actually, under the sheet, there's literally thousands of innovations."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "And almost all those innovations have their own diminishing return curves."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "So if you graph it, it looks like a cascade of diminishing return curves."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "I don't know what to call that."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "But the result is an exponential curve."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "Well, at least it has been."},

you will probably tell people, well, this is done."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "Meanwhile, some other pile of people are doing something different."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "So that's just normal."}, {"time": 2028, "text": "So then there's the observation of how small could a switching device be?"}, {"time": 2034, "text": "So a modern transistor is something like a thousand by a thousand by a thousand atoms, right?"}, {"time": 2039, "text": "And you get quantum effects down around two to 10 atoms."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "So you can imagine the transistor as small as 10 by 10 by 10."},

modern transistor, if you look at the fan, it's like 120 atoms wide, but we can make that thinner."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "And then there's a gate wrapped around it, and then there's spacing."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "There's a whole bunch of geometry."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "And a competent transistor designer could count both atoms in every single direction."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "Like there's techniques now to already put down atoms in a single atomic layer."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "And you can place atoms if you want to."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "It's just from a manufacturing process, if placing an atom takes 10 minutes and you need to put 10 to the 23rd atoms together to make a computer, it would take a long time."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "So the methods are both shrinking things and then coming up with effective ways to control what's happening."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "Manufacture stably and cheaply."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "So the innovation stock's pretty broad."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "There's equipment, there's optics, there's chemistry, there's physics, there's material science, there's metallurgy, there's lots of ideas about when you put different materials together, how do they interact, are they stable, is it stable over temperature, like are they repeatable?"}, {"time": 2140, "text": "There's like literally thousands of technologies involved."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "But just for the shrinking, you don't think we're quite yet close to the fundamental limits of physics?"}, {"time": 2150, "text": "I did a talk on Moore's Law and I asked for a roadmap to a path of 100 and after two weeks, they said we only got to 50."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "100 what, sorry?"}, {"time": 2159, "text": "100 X shrink."},

here's the thing about Moore's Law, right?"}, {"time": 2169, "text": "So I believe that the next 10 or 20 years of shrinking is gonna happen, right?"}, {"time": 2176, "text": "Now, as a computer designer, you have two stances."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "You think it's going to shrink, in which case you're designing and thinking about architecture in a way that you'll use more transistors."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "Or conversely, not be swamped by the complexity of all the transistors you get, right?"}, {"time": 2196, "text": "You have to have a strategy, you know?"}, {"time": 2199, "text": "So you're open to the possibility and waiting for the possibility of a whole new army of transistors ready to work."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "I'm expecting more transistors every two or three years by a number large enough that how you think about design, how you think about architecture has to change."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "Like, imagine you build buildings out of bricks, and every year the bricks are half the size, or every two years."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "Well, if you kept building bricks the same way, so many bricks per person per day, the amount of time to build a building would go up exponentially, right?"}, {"time": 2236, "text": "But if you said, I know that's coming, so now I'm gonna design equipment that moves bricks faster, uses them better, because maybe you're getting something out of the smaller bricks, more strength, thinner walls, you know, less material, efficiency out of that."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "So once you have a roadmap with what's gonna happen, transistors, we're gonna get more of them, then you design all this collateral around it to take advantage of it, and also to cope with it."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "Like, that's the thing people don't understand."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "It's like, if I didn't believe in Moore's Law, and then Moore's Law transistors showed up, my design teams would all drown."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "So what's the hardest part of this inflow of new transistors?"}, {"time": 2277, "text": "I mean, even if you just look historically, throughout your career, what's the thing, what fundamentally changes when you add more transistors in the task of designing an architecture?"}, {"time": 2290, "text": "Well, there's two constants, right?"}, {"time": 2292, "text": "One is people don't get smarter."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "By the way, there's some science showing that we do get smarter because of nutrition or whatever."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "Sorry to bring that up."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "Blend effect."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "Yeah, I'm familiar with it."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "Nobody understands it, nobody knows if it's still going on."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So that's a... Or whether it's real or not."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "But yeah, it's a..."}, {"time": 2310, "text": "I sort of..."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "Anyway, but not exponentially."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "I would believe for the most part, people aren't getting much smarter."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "The evidence doesn't support it, that's right."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "And then teams can't grow that much."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "Right, so human beings, you know, we're really good in teams of 10, you know, up to teams of 100, they can know each other."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "Beyond that, you have to have organizational boundaries."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "So you're kind of, you have, those are pretty hard constraints, right?"}, {"time": 2334, "text": "So then you have to divide and conquer, like as the designs get bigger, you have to divide it into pieces."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "You know, the power of abstraction layers is really high."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "We used to build computers out of transistors."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "Now we have a team that turns transistors into logic cells and another team that turns them into functional units, another one that turns them into computers, right?"}, {"time": 2353, "text": "So we have abstraction layers in there and you have to think about when do you shift gears on that."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "We also use faster computers to build faster computers."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "So some algorithms run twice as fast on new computers, but a lot of algorithms are N squared."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "So, you know, a computer with twice as many transistors and it might take four times as long to run."}, {"time": 2376, "text": "So you have to refactor the software."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "Like simply using faster computers to build bigger computers doesn't work."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "So you have to think about all these things."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "So in terms of computing performance and the exciting possibility that more powerful computers bring, is shrinking the thing which you've been talking about, for you, one of the biggest exciting possibilities of advancement in performance?"}, {"time": 2401, "text": "Or is there other directions that you're interested in, like in the direction of sort of enforcing given parallelism or like doing massive parallelism in terms of many, many CPUs, you know, stacking CPUs on top of each other, that kind of parallelism or any kind of parallelism?"}, {"time": 2420, "text": "Well, think about it a different way."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "So old computers, you know, slow computers, you said A equal B plus C times D, pretty simple, right?"}, {"time": 2430, "text": "And then we made faster computers with vector units and you can do proper equations and matrices, right?"}, {"time": 2438, "text": "And then modern like AI computations or like convolutional neural networks, where you convolve one large data set against another."}, {"time": 2447, "text": "And so there's sort of this hierarchy of mathematics, you know, from simple equation to linear equations, to matrix equations, to deeper kind of computation."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "And the data sets are getting so big that people are thinking of data as a topology problem."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "You know, data is organized in some immense shape."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "And then the computation, which sort of wants to be, get data from immense shape and do some computation on it."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "So what computers have allowed people to do is have algorithms go much, much further."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "So that paper you reference, the Sutton paper, they talked about, you know, like when AI started, it was apply rule sets to something."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "That's a very simple computational situation."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "And then when they did first chess thing, they solved deep searches."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "So have a huge database of moves and results, deep search, but it's still just a search, right?"}, {"time": 2508, "text": "Now we take large numbers of images and we use it to train these weight sets that we convolve across."}, {"time": 2516, "text": "It's a completely different kind of phenomena."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "We call that AI."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "Now they're doing the next generation."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "And if you look at it, they're going up this mathematical graph, right?"}, {"time": 2527, "text": "And then computations, both computation and data sets support going up that graph."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "Yeah, the kind of computation that might, I mean, I would argue that all of it is still a search, right?"}, {"time": 2540, "text": "Just like you said, a topology problem with data sets, you're searching the data sets for valuable data and also the actual optimization of neural networks is a kind of search for the..."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "I don't know, if you had looked at the interlayers of finding a cat, it's not a search."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "It's a set of endless projections."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "So, you know, a projection, here's a shadow of this phone, right?"}, {"time": 2565, "text": "And then you can have a shadow of that on the something and a shadow on that of something."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "And if you look in the layers, you'll see this layer actually describes pointy ears and round eyeness and fuzziness."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "But the computation to tease out the attributes is not search."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "Like the inference part might be search, but the training's not search."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "And then in deep networks, they look at layers and they don't even know it's represented."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "And yet, if you take the layers out, it doesn't work."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "So I don't think it's search."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "But you'd have to talk to a mathematician about what that actually is."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "Well, we could disagree, but it's just semantics, I think, it's not, but it's certainly not..."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "I would say it's absolutely not semantics, but..."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "Okay, all right, well, if you want to go there."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "So optimization to me is search, and we're trying to optimize the ability of a neural network to detect cat ears."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "And the difference between chess and the space, the incredibly multidimensional, 100,000 dimensional space that neural networks are trying to optimize over is nothing like the chessboard database."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "So it's a totally different kind of thing."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "And okay, in that sense, you can say it loses the meaning."}, {"time": 2647, "text": "I can see how you might say, if you..."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "The funny thing is, it's the difference between given search space and found search space."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "Yeah, maybe that's a different way to describe it."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "That's a beautiful way to put it, okay."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "But you're saying, what's your sense in terms of the basic mathematical operations and the architectures, computer hardware that enables those operations?"}, {"time": 2669, "text": "Do you see the CPUs of today still being a really core part of executing those mathematical operations?"}, {"time": 2678, "text": "Well, the operations continue to be add, subtract, load, store, compare, and branch."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "It's remarkable."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "So it's interesting, the building blocks of computers or transistors under that atoms."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "So you got atoms, transistors, logic gates, computers, functional units of computers."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "The building blocks of mathematics at some level are things like adds and subtracts and multiplies, but the space mathematics can describe is, I think, essentially infinite."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "But the computers that run the algorithms are still doing the same things."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "Now, a given algorithm might say, I need sparse data, or I need 32 bit data, or I need, you know, like a convolution operation that naturally takes eight bit data, multiplies it, and sums it up a certain way."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "So like the data types in TensorFlow imply an optimization set."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "But when you go right down and look at the computers, it's and and or gates doing adds and multiplies."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "Like that hasn't changed much."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "Now, the quantum researchers think they're going to change that radically, and then there's people who think about analog computing because you look in the brain, and it seems to be more analogish."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "You know, that maybe there's a way to do that more efficiently."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "But we have a million X on computation, and I don't know the relationship between computational, let's say, intensity and ability to hit mathematical abstractions."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "I don't know any way to describe that, but just like you saw in AI, you went from rule sets to simple search to complex search to, say, found search."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Like those are orders of magnitude more computation to do."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "And as we get the next two orders of magnitude, like a friend, Roger Gaduri, said, like every order of magnitude changes the computation."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "Fundamentally changes what the computation is doing."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "Oh, you know the expression the difference in quantity is the difference in kind."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "You know, the difference between ant and anthill, right?"}, {"time": 2813, "text": "Or neuron and brain."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "You know, there's this indefinable place where the quantity changed the quality, right?"}, {"time": 2822, "text": "And we've seen that happen in mathematics multiple times, and you know, my guess is it's going to keep happening."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "So your sense is, yeah, if you focus head down and shrinking the transistor."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "Well, it's not just head down, we're aware of the software stacks that are running in the computational loads, and we're kind of pondering what do you do with a petabyte of memory that wants to be accessed in a sparse way and have, you know, the kind of calculations AI programmers want."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "So there's a dialogue
