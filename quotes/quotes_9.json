was possible to do that with technology."}, {"time": 304, "text": "So that was a case where the sort of the agent sort of intrigued me from a literary point of view and became a personality."}, {"time": 310, "text": "I think more recently, I've also written plays and when plays you write dialogue and obviously you write a fixed set of dialogue that follows a linear narrative."}, {"time": 323, "text": "But with modern agents, as you design a personality or a capability for conversation, you're sort of thinking of, I kind of have imaginary dialogue in my head."}, {"time": 333, "text": "And then I think, what would it take not only to have that be real, but for it to really know what it's talking about."}, {"time": 338, "text": "So it's easy to fall into the uncanny valley with AI where it says something it doesn't really understand, but it sounds good to the person."}, {"time": 348, "text": "But you rapidly realize that it's kind of just stimulus response."}, {"time": 348, "text": "It doesn't really have real world knowledge about the thing it's describing."}, {"time": 355, "text": "And so when you get to that point, it really needs to have multiple ways of talking about the same concept."}, {"time": 361, "text": "So it sounds as though it really understands it."}, {"time": 365, "text": "Now, what really understanding means is in the eye of the beholder, right?"}, {"time": 365, "text": "But if it only has one way of referring to something, it feels like it's a canned response."}, {"time": 371, "text": "But if it can reason about it, or you can go at it from multiple angles and give a similar kind of response that people would, then it starts to seem more like there's something there that's sentient."}, {"time": 388, "text": "You can say the same thing, multiple things from different perspectives."}, {"time": 388, "text": "I mean, with the automatic image captioning that I've seen the work that you're doing, there's elements of that, right?"}, {"time": 397, "text": "Being able to generate different kinds of statements about the same picture."}, {"time": 400, "text": "So in my team, there's a lot of work on turning a medium from one form to another, whether it's auto tagging imagery or making up full sentences about what's in the image, then changing the sentence, finding another image that matches the new sentence or vice versa."}, {"time": 418, "text": "And in the modern world of GANs, you sort of give it a description and it synthesizes an asset that matches the description."}, {"time": 426, "text": "So I've sort of gone on a journey."}, {"time": 426, "text": "My early days in my career were about 3D computer graphics, the sort of pioneering work, sort of before movies had special effects done with 3D graphics, and sort of rode that revolution."}, {"time": 437, "text": "And that was very much like the Renaissance where people would model light and color and shape and everything."}, {"time": 445, "text": "And now we're kind of in another wave where it's more impressionistic and it's sort of the idea of something can be used to generate an image directly, which is sort of the new frontier in computer image generation using AI algorithms."}, {"time": 463, "text": "So the creative process is more in the space of ideas or becoming more in the space of ideas versus in the raw pixels?"}, {"time": 470, "text": "Well, it's interesting."}, {"time": 470, "text": "I think at Adobe, we really want to span the entire range from really, really good, what you might call low level tools by low level as close to say, analog workflows as possible."}, {"time": 482, "text": "So what we do there is we make up systems that do really realistic oil paint and watercolor simulations."}, {"time": 488, "text": "So if you want every bristle to behave as it would in the real world and leave a beautiful analog trail of water and then flow after you've made the brushstroke, you can do that."}, {"time": 498, "text": "And that's really important for people who want to create something really expressive or really novel because they have complete control."}, {"time": 506, "text": "And then as certain other tasks become automated, it frees the artists up to focus on the inspiration and less of the perspiration."}, {"time": 515, "text": "So thinking about different ideas, obviously."}, {"time": 515, "text": "Once you finish the design, there's a lot of work to, say, do it for all the different aspect ratio of phones or websites and so on."}, {"time": 528, "text": "And that used to take up an awful lot of time for artists."}, {"time": 531, "text": "It still does for many what we call content velocity."}, {"time": 531, "text": "And one of the targets of AI is actually to reason about from the first example of what are the likely intent for these other formats?"}, {"time": 543, "text": "Maybe if you change the language to German and the words are longer, how do you reflow everything so that it looks nicely artistic in that way?"}, {"time": 552, "text": "And so the person can focus on the really creative bit in the middle, which is what is the look and style and feel and what's the message and what's the story and the human element?"}, {"time": 561, "text": "So I think creativity is changing."}, {"time": 561, "text": "So that's one way in which we're trying to just make it easier and faster and cheaper to do so that there can be more of it, more demand because it's less expensive."}, {"time": 573, "text": "So everyone wants beautiful artwork for everything from a school website to Hollywood movie."}, {"time": 579, "text": "On the other side, as some of these things have automatic versions of them, people will possibly change role from being the hands on artisan to being either the art director or the conceptual artist."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And then the computer will be a partner to help create polished examples of the idea that they're exploring."}, {"time": 599, "text": "Let's talk about Adobe products, AI and Adobe products."}, {"time": 602, "text": "Just so you know where I'm coming from, I'm a huge fan of Photoshop for images, Premiere for video, Audition for audio."}, {"time": 612, "text": "I'll probably use Photoshop to create the thumbnail for this video, Premiere to edit the video, Audition to do the audio."}, {"time": 619, "text": "That said, everything I do is really manually and I set up, I use this old school Kinesis keyboard and I have auto hotkey that just, it's really about optimizing the flow."}, {"time": 632, "text": "Of just making sure there's as few clicks as possible, so just being extremely efficient, something you started to speak to."}, {"time": 639, "text": "So before we get into the fun sort of awesome deep learning things, where does AI, if you could speak a little more to it, AI or just automation in general, do you see in the coming months and years or in general, prior in 2018, fitting into making the life, the low level pixel work flow easier?"}, {"time": 664, "text": "Yeah, that's a great question."}, {"time": 665, "text": "So we have a very rich array of algorithms already in Photoshop, just classical procedural algorithms as well as ones based on data."}, {"time": 674, "text": "In some cases, they end up with a large number of sliders and degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 680, "text": "So one way in which AI can help is just an auto button, which comes up with default settings based on the content itself rather than default values for the tool."}, {"time": 689, "text": "At that point, you then start tweaking."}, {"time": 691, "text": "So that's a very kind of make life easier for people whilst making use of common sense from other example images."}, {"time": 699, "text": "So like smart defaults."}, {"time": 700, "text": "Smart defaults, absolutely."}, {"time": 702, "text": "Another one is something we've spent a lot of work over the last 20 years I've been at Adobe, or 19, thinking about selection, for instance, where, you know, with quick select, you would look at color boundaries and figure out how to sort of flood fill into regions that you thought were physically connected in the real world."}, {"time": 723, "text": "But that algorithm had no visual common sense about what a cat looks like or a dog."}, {"time": 728, "text": "It would just do it based on rules of thumb, which were applied to graph theory."}, {"time": 732, "text": "And it was a big improvement over the previous work where you had sort of almost click everything by hand."}, {"time": 739, "text": "Or if it just did similar colors, it would do little tiny regions that wouldn't be connected."}, {"time": 744, "text": "But in the future, using neural nets to actually do a great job with, say, a single click or even in the case of well known categories like people or animals, no click where you just say select the object and it just knows the dominant object is a person in the middle of the photograph."}, {"time": 760, "text": "Those kinds of things are really valuable if they can be robust enough to give you good quality results or they can be a great start for like tweaking it."}, {"time": 771, "text": "So, for example, background removal."}, {"time": 774, "text": "Like one thing I'll, in a thumbnail, I'll take a picture of you right now and essentially remove the background behind you."}, {"time": 781, "text": "And I want to make that as easy as possible."}, {"time": 784, "text": "You don't have flowing hair, like rich at the moment."}, {"time": 788, "text": "I had it in the past."}, {"time": 790, "text": "It may come again in the future."}, {"time": 793, "text": "So that sometimes makes it a little more challenging to remove the background."}, {"time": 797, "text": "How difficult do you think is that problem for AI for basically making the quick selection tool smarter and smarter and smarter?"}, {"time": 805, "text": "Well, we have a lot of research on that already."}, {"time": 806, "text": "If you want a sort of quick, cheap and cheerful, look, I'm pretending I'm in Hawaii, but it's sort of a joke, then you don't need perfect boundaries."}, {"time": 816, "text": "And you can do that today with a single click with the algorithms we have."}, {"time": 820, "text": "We have other algorithms where with a little bit more guidance on the boundaries, like you might need to touch it up a little bit."}, {"time": 828, "text": "We have other algorithms that can pull a nice mat from a crude selection."}, {"time": 833, "text": "So we have combinations of tools that can do all of that."}, {"time": 837, "text": "And at our recent Max conference at Adobe Max, we demonstrated how very quickly, just by drawing a simple polygon around the object of interest, we could not only do it for a single still, but we could pull a mat, well, pull at least a selection mask from a moving target, like a person dancing in front of a brick wall or something."}, {"time": 859, "text": "And so it's going from hours to a few seconds for workflows that are really nice, and then you might go in and touch up a little."}, {"time": 868, "text": "So that's a really interesting question."}, {"time": 870, "text": "You mentioned the word robust."}, {"time": 871, "text": "You know, there's like a journey for an idea, right?"}, {"time": 876, "text": "And what you presented probably at Max has elements of just sort of, it inspires the concept, it can work pretty well in a majority of cases."}, {"time": 885, "text": "But how do you make something that works, well, in majority of cases, how do you make something that works, maybe in all cases, or it becomes a robust tool that can... Well, there are a couple of things."}, {"time": 897, "text": "So that really touches on the difference between academic research and industrial research."}, {"time": 902, "text": "So in academic research, it's really about who's the person to have the great new idea that shows promise."}, {"time": 909, "text": "And we certainly love to be those people too."}, {"time": 912, "text": "But we have sort of two forms of publishing."}, {"time": 915, "text": "One is academic peer review, which we do a lot of, and we have great success there as much as some universities."}, {"time": 922, "text": "But then we also have shipping, which is a different type of... And then we get customer review, as well as, you know, product critics."}, {"time": 930, "text": "And that might be a case where it's not about being perfect every single time, but perfect enough of the time, plus a mechanism to intervene and recover where you do have mistakes."}, {"time": 943, "text": "So we have the luxury of very talented customers."}, {"time": 946, "text": "We don't want them to be overly taxed doing it every time."}, {"time": 950, "text": "But if they can go in and just take it from 99 to 100 with the touch of a mouse or something, then for the professional end, that's something that we definitely want to support as well."}, {"time": 963, "text": "And for them, it went from having to do that tedious task all the time to much less often."}, {"time": 969, "text": "So I think that gives us an out."}, {"time": 969, "text": "If it had to be 100% automatic all the time, then that would delay the time at which we could get to market."}, {"time": 979, "text": "So on that thread, maybe you can untangle something."}, {"time": 983, "text": "Again, I'm sort of just speaking to my own experience."}, {"time": 988, "text": "Maybe that is the most useful."}, {"time": 990, "text": "So I think Photoshop, as an example, or Premiere, has a lot of amazing features that I haven't touched."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "And so in terms of AI helping make my life or the life of creatives easier, this collaboration between human and machine, how do you learn to collaborate better?"}, {"time": 1017, "text": "How do you learn the new algorithms?"}, {"time": 1018, "text": "Is it something where you have to watch tutorials and you have to watch videos and so on?"}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Or do you think about the experience itself through exploration, being the teacher?"}, {"time": 1030, "text": "We absolutely do."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "So I'm glad that you brought this up."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "We sort of think about two things."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "One is helping the person in the moment to do the task that they need to do, but the other is thinking more holistically about their journey learning a tool."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "And when it's like, think of it as Adobe University, where you use the tool long enough, you become an expert."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "And not necessarily an expert in everything."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "It's like living in a city."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "You don't necessarily know every street, but you know the important ones you need to get to."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "So we have projects in research, which actually look at the thousands of hours of tutorials online and try to understand what's being taught in them."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And then we had one publication at CHI where it was looking at, given the last three or four actions you did, what did other people in tutorials do next?"}, {"time": 1074, "text": "So if you want some inspiration for what you might do next, or you just want to watch the tutorial and see, learn from people who are doing similar workflows to you, you can without having to go and search on keywords and everything."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "So really trying to use the context of your use of the app to make intelligent suggestions, either about choices that you might make, or in a more assistive way, where it could say, if you did this next, we could show you."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And that's basically the frontier that we're exploring now, which is, if we really deeply understand the domain in which designers and creative people work, can we combine that with AI and pattern matching of behavior to make intelligent suggestions, either through, you know, verbal, possibilities, or just showing the results of if you try this."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And that's really the sort of, you know, I was in a meeting today thinking about these things."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "Well, it's still a grand challenge."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "You know, we'd all love an artist over one shoulder and a teacher over the other, right?"}, {"time": 1137, "text": "And we hope to get there."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "And the right thing to do is to give enough at each stage that it's useful in itself, but it builds a foundation for the next stage."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Give enough at each stage that it's useful in itself, but it builds a foundation for the next level of expectation."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "Are you aware of this gigantic medium of YouTube that's creating just a bunch of creative people, both artists and teachers of different kinds?"}, {"time": 1166, "text": "And the more we can understand those media types, both visually and in terms of transcripts and words, the more we can bring the wisdom that they embody into the guidance that's embedded in the tool."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "That would be brilliant to remove the barrier from having to yourself type in the keyword searching, so on."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And then in the longer term, an interesting discussion is, does it ultimately not just assist with learning the interface we have, but does it modify the interface to be simpler?"}, {"time": 1196, "text": "Or do you fragment into a variety of tools, each of which has a different level of visibility of the functionality?"}, {"time": 1202, "text": "I like to say that if you add a feature to a GUI, you have to have yet more visual complexity confronting the new user."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "Whereas if you have an assistant with a new skill, if you know they have it, so you know to ask for it, then it's sort of additive without being more intimidating."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "So we definitely think about new users and how to onboard them."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Many actually value the idea of being able to master that complex interface and keyboard shortcuts like you were talking about earlier, because with great familiarity, it becomes a musical instrument for expressing your visual ideas."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And other people just want to get something done quickly in the simplest way possible."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "And that's where a more assistive version of the same technology might be useful, maybe on a different class of device, which is more in context for CAPTCHA, say."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "Whereas somebody who's in a deep post production workflow maybe want to be on a laptop or a big screen desktop and have more knobs and dials to really express the subtlety of what they want to do."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "Can you talk through a favorite or some of them or examples that popped in mind?"}, {"time": 1304, "text": "I'm sure I'll be able to provide links to other ones we don't talk about because there's visual elements to all of them that are exciting."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Why they're interesting for different reasons might be a good way to go."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "So I think sky replace is interesting because we talked about selection being sort of an atomic operation."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "It's almost like if you think of an assembly language, it's like a single instruction."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "Whereas sky replace is a compound action where you automatically select the sky, you look for stock content that matches the geometry of the scene."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "You try to have variety in your choices so that you do coverage of different moods."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "It then mats in the sky behind the foreground."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "But then importantly, it uses the foreground of the other image that you just searched on to recolor the foreground of the image that you're editing."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "So if you say go from a midday sky to an evening sky, it will actually add sort of an orange glow to the foreground objects as well."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "I was a big fan in college of Magritte and he has a number of paintings where it's surrealism because he'll like do a composite, but the foreground building will be at night and the sky will be during the day."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "There's one called The Empire of Light, which was on my wall in college."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "And we're trying not to do surrealism."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "It can be a choice, but we'd rather have it be natural by default rather than it looking fake."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "And then you have to do a whole bunch of post production to fix it."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "So that's a case where we're kind of capturing an entire workflow into a single action and doing it in about a second rather than a minute or two."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And when you do that, you can not just do it once, but you can do it for say like 10 different backgrounds."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "And then you're almost back to this inspiration idea of I don't know quite what I want, but I'll know it when I see it."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And you can just explore the design space as close to final production value as possible."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And then when you really pick one, you might go back and slightly tweak the selection mask just to make it perfect and do that kind of polish that professionals like to bring to their work."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "So then there's this idea of, you mentioned the sky, replacing it to different stock images of the sky."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "But in general, you have this idea."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "Or it could be on your disc or whatever."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Disc, right."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "But making even more intelligent choices about ways to search stock images, which is really interesting."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "It's kind of spatial."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "So that was something we called concept canvas."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "So normally when you do a say an image search, you would I assuming it's just based on text, you would give the keywords of the things you want to be in the image, and it would find the nearest one that had those tags."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "For many tasks, you really want, you know, to be able to say I want a big person in the middle or in a dog to the right and umbrella above the left because you want to leave space for the text or whatever for the and so concept canvas lets you assign spatial regions to the keywords."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "And then we've already pre indexed the images to know where the important concepts are in the picture."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "So we then go through that index matching to assets."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "And even though it's just another form of search, because you're doing spatial design or layout, it starts to feel like design, you sort of feel oddly responsible for the image that comes back as if you invented it."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "So it's, it's a it's a good example where giving enough control starts to make people have a sense of ownership over the outcome of the event."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "And then we also have technologies in Photoshop, we physically can move the dog in post as well."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "But for concept canvas, it was just a very fast way to sort of loop through and be able to lay things out."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "And in terms of being able to remove objects from a scene and fill in the background, right, automatically."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "I so that's extremely exciting."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "And that's so neural networks are stepping in there."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "I just talked this week, Ian Goodfellow, so the GANs for doing that is definitely one approach."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "So that is that is that a really difficult problem?"}, {"time": 1556, "text": "Is it as difficult as it looks, again, to take it to a robust product level?"}, {"time": 1561, "text": "Well, there are certain classes of image for which the traditional algorithms like content aware fill work really well, like if you have a naturalistic texture, like a gravel path or something, because it's patch based, it will make up a very plausible looking intermediate thing and fill in the hole."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "And then we use some algorithms to sort of smooth out the lighting so you don't see any brightness contrast in that region, or you've gradually ramped from one from dark to light, if it straddles the boundary, where it gets complicated as if you have to infer invisible structure behind behind the person in front."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "And that really requires a common sense knowledge of the world to know what, you know, if I see three quarters of a house, do I have a rough sense of what the rest of the house looks like?"}, {"time": 1605, "text": "If you just fill it in with patches, it can end up sort of doing things that make sense locally, but you look at the global structure, and it looks like it's just sort of crumpled or messed up."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "And so what GANs and neural nets bring to the table is this common sense learned from the training set."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "And the challenge right now is that the generative methods that can make up missing holes using that kind of technology are still only stable at low resolutions."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And so you either need to then go from a low resolution to a high resolution using some other algorithm, or we need to push the state of the art and it's still in research to get to that point."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "Of course, if you show it something, say it's trained on houses, and then you show it an octopus, it's not going to do a very good job of showing common sense about octopuses."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "So again, you're asking about how you know that it's ready for primetime."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "You really need a very diverse training set of images."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "And ultimately, that may be a case where you put it out there with some guardrails where you might do a detector which looks at the image and sort of estimates its own competence of how well a job could this algorithm do."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "So eventually, there may be this idea of what we call an ensemble of experts where any particular expert is specialized in certain things."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And then there's sort of a, either they vote to say how confident they are about what to do, this is sort of more future looking, or there's some dispatcher which says you're good at houses, you're good at trees."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "So I mean, all this adds up to a lot of work because each of those models will be a whole bunch of work."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "But I think over time, you'd gradually fill out the set and initially focus on certain workflows and then sort of branch out as you get more capable."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "You mentioned workflows, and have you considered maybe looking far into the future?"}, {"time": 1763, "text": "And this is a big topic in the whole world of AI is what data can you gather and why?"}, {"time": 1767, "text": "At one level, a way to think about it is we not only want to train our customers in how to use our products, but we want them to teach us what's important and what's useful."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "At the same time, we want to respect their privacy."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "And obviously, we wouldn't do things without their explicit permission."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "And I think the modern spirit of the age around this is you have to demonstrate to somebody how they're benefiting from sharing their data with the tool."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "Either it's helping in the short term to understand their intent, so you can make better recommendations, or if they're friendly to your cause, or your tool, or they want to help you evolve quickly, because they depend on you for their livelihood, they may be willing to share some of their workflows or choices with the data set to be then trained."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "There are technologies for looking at learning without necessarily storing all the information permanently, so that you can sort of learn on the fly, but not keep a record of what somebody did."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "So we're definitely exploring all of those possibilities."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "It's nice for you to say that."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "I mean, I think there are some professional workflows where people might be very protective of what they're doing, such as if I was preparing evidence for a legal case, I wouldn't want any of that, you know, phoning home to help train the algorithm or anything."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "There may be other cases where people are, say, having a trial version, or they're doing some, I'm not saying we're doing this today, but there's a future scenario where somebody has a more permissive relationship with Adobe, where they explicitly say, I'm fine, I'm only doing hobby projects, or things which are non confidential."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "And in exchange for some benefit, tangible or otherwise, I'm willing to share very fine grained data."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "So another possible scenario is to capture relatively crude, high level things from more people, and then more detailed knowledge from people who are willing to participate."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "We do that today with explicit customer studies where, you know, we go and visit somebody and ask them to try the tool and we human observe what they're doing."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "In the future, to be able to do that enough to be able to train an algorithm, we'd need a more systematic process."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "But we'd have to do it very consciously, because is one of the things people treasure about Adobe is a sense of trust."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And we don't want to endanger that through overly aggressive data collection."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "So we have a chief privacy officer."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "And it's definitely front and center of thinking about AI rather than an afterthought."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Well, when you start that program, sign me up."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "Okay, happy to."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "Is there other projects that you wanted to mention that that I didn't perhaps that pop into mind?"}, {"time": 1967, "text": "Well, you covered the number, I think you mentioned Project Puppetron, I think that one is interesting, because it's, you might think of Adobe as only thinking in 2d."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "And that's a good example where we're actually thinking more three dimensionally about how to assign features to faces so that we can, you know, if you take so what puppet run does, it takes either a still or a video of a person talking, and then it can take a painting of somebody else and then apply the style of the painting to the person who's talking in the video."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "And it's unlike a sort of screen door post filter effect that you sometimes see online, it really looks as though it's sort of somehow attached or reflecting the motion of the face."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "And so that's the case where even to do a 2d workflow, like stylization, you really need to infer more about the 3d structure of the world."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And I think, as 3d computer vision algorithms get better, initially, they'll focus on particular domains, like faces, where you have a lot of prior knowledge about structure, and you can maybe have a parameterized template that you fit to the image."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "But over time, this should be possible for more general content."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And it might even be invisible to the user that you're doing 3d reconstruction, but under the hood, but it might then let you do edits much more reliably or correctly than you would otherwise."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "And, you know, the face is a very important application, right?"}, {"time": 2060, "text": "So making things work."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "And a very sensitive one."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "If you do something uncanny, it's very disturbing."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "You have to get it right."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "So in the space of augmented reality and virtual reality, what do you think is the role of AR and VR and in the content we consume as people, as consumers, and the content we create as creators?"}, {"time": 2085, "text": "Now, that's a great question."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "We think about this a lot, too."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "So I think VR and AR serve slightly different purposes."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "So VR can really transport you to an entire immersive world, no matter what your personal situation is."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "To that extent, it's a bit like a really, really widescreen television, where it sort of snaps you out of your context and puts you in a new one."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "And I think it's still evolving in terms of the hardware."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "I actually worked on VR in the 90s trying to solve the latency and sort of nausea problem, which we did, but it was very expensive and a bit early."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "There's a new wave of that now, I think."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "And increasingly, those devices are becoming all in one rather than something that's tethered to a box."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "I think the market seems to be bifurcating into things for consumers and things for professional use cases, like for architects and people designing where your product is a building and you really want to experience it better than looking at a scale model or a drawing, I think, or even than a video."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "So I think for that, where you need a sense of scale and spatial relationships, it's great."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "I think AR holds the promise of sort of taking digital assets off the screen and putting them in context in the real world on the table in front of you, on the wall behind you."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "And that has the corresponding need that the assets need to adapt to the physical context in which they're being placed."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "I mean, it's a bit like having a live theater troupe come to your house and put on Hamlet."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "My mother had a friend who used to do this at Stately Homes in England for the National Trust."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "And they would adapt the scenes and even they'd walk the audience through the rooms to see the action based on the country house they found themselves in for two days."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "And I think AR will have the same issue that, you know, if you have a tiny table and a big living room or something, it'll try to figure out what can you change and what's fixed."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "And there's a little bit of a tension between fidelity where if you captured, say, Nureyev doing a fantastic ballet, you'd want it to be sort of exactly reproduced."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "And maybe all you could do is scale it down."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "Whereas somebody telling you a story might be walking around the room doing some gestures and that could adapt to the room in which they were telling the story."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "And do you think fidelity is that important in that space

you want to catch every nuance and they don't want to be reanimated by some algorithm."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "It could be that if it's really, you know, a lovable frog telling you a story and it's about a princess and a frog, then it doesn't matter if the frog moves in a different way."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "I think a lot of the ideas that have sort of grown up in the game world will now come into the broader commercial sphere once they're needing adaptive characters in AR."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "Are you thinking of engineering tools that allow creators to create in the augmented world, basically making a Photoshop for the augmented world?"}, {"time": 2276, "text": "Well, we have shown a few demos of sort of taking a Photoshop layer stack and then expanding it into 3D."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "That's actually been shown publicly as one example in AR."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "Where we're particularly excited at the moment is in 3D."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "3D design is still a very challenging space."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "And we believe that it's a worthwhile experiment to try to figure out if AR or immersive makes 3D design more spontaneous."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "Can you give me an example of 3D design, just like applications?"}, {"time": 2306, "text": "Literally, a simple one would be laying out objects, right?"}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So on a conventional screen, you'd sort of have a plan view and a side view and a perspective view, and you'd sort of be dragging it around with a mouse."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "And if you're not careful, it would go through the wall and all that."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "Whereas if you were really laying out objects, say, in a VR headset, you could literally move your head to see a different viewpoint."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "They'd be in stereo."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "So you'd have a sense of depth because you're already wearing the depth glasses, right?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "So it would be those sort of big gross motor move things around kind of skills seem much more spontaneous, just like they are in the real world."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "The frontier for us, I think, is whether that same medium can be used to do fine grained design tasks, like very accurate constraints on, say, a CAD model or something that may be better done on a desktop, but it may just be a matter of inventing the right UI."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "So we're hopeful that because there will be this potential explosion of demand for 3D assets driven by AR and more real time animation on conventional screens, that those tools will also help with, or those devices will help with designing the content as well."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "You've mentioned quite a few interesting sort of new ideas."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "And at the same time, there's old timers like me that are stuck in their old ways and are... Well, I think I'm the old timer."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "But the opposed all change at all costs."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "When you're thinking about creating new interfaces, do you feel the burden of just this giant user base that loves the current product?"}, {"time": 2402, "text": "So anything new you do, any new idea comes at a cost that you'll be resisted?"}, {"time": 2413, "text": "Well, I think if you have to trade off control for convenience, then our existing user base would definitely be offended by that."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "I think if there are some things where you have more convenience and just as much control, that may be more welcome."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "We do think about not breaking well known metaphors for things."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "So things should sort of make sense."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "Photoshop has never been a static target."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "It's always been evolving and growing."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "And to some extent, there's been a lot of brilliant thought along the way of how it works today."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "So we don't want to just throw all that out."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "If there's a fundamental breakthrough, like a single click is good enough to select an object rather than having to do lots of strokes, that actually fits in quite nicely to the existing toolset, either as an optional mode or as a starting point."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "I think where we're looking at radical simplicity, where you could encapsulate an entire workflow with a much simpler UI, then sometimes that's easier to do in the context of either a different device, like a mobile device, where the affordances are naturally different."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "Or in a tool that's targeted at a different workflow, where it's about spontaneity and velocity rather than precision."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "And we have projects like Rush, which can let you do professional quality video editing for a certain class of media output that is targeted very differently in terms of users and the experience."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "And ideally, people would go, if I'm feeling like doing Premiere, big project, I'm doing a four part television series, that's definitely a Premiere thing."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "But if I want to do something to show my recent vacation, maybe I'll just use Rush because I can do it in the half an hour I have free at home rather than the four hours I need to do it at work."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "And for the use cases, which we can do well, it really is much faster to get the same output."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "But the more professional tools obviously have a much richer toolkit and more flexibility in what they can do."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And then at the same time with the flexibility and control, I like this idea of smart defaults, of using AI to coach you to like what Google has, I'm feeling lucky button."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "Or one button kind of gives you a pretty good set of settings."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "And then that's almost an educational tool to show."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "Because sometimes when you have all this control, you're not sure about the correlation between the different bars that control different elements of the image and so on."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "And sometimes there's a degree of, you don't know what the optimal is."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "And then some things are sort of on demand, like help, right?"}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Where I'm stuck, I need to know what to look for."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "I'm not quite sure what it's called."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "And something that was proactively making helpful suggestions or, you could imagine a make a suggestion button where you'd use all of that knowledge of workflows and everything to maybe suggest something to go and learn about or just to try or show the answer."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "And maybe it's not one intelligent default, but it's like a variety of defaults."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And then you go, I like that one."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "Several options."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "So back to poetry."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "We're going to interleave."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "So first few lines of a recent poem of yours before I ask the

the ocean glass, but I was still just me."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "This is a poem about you leaving your phone behind and feeling quite liberated because of it."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "So this is kind of a difficult topic and let's see if we can talk about it, figure it out."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "But so with the help of AI more and more, we can create sort of versions of ourselves, versions of reality that are in some ways more beautiful than actual reality."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "And some of the creative ways that we can do that, some of the creative effort there is part of creating this illusion."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "So of course this is inevitable, but how do you think we should adjust as human beings to live in this digital world that's partly artificial, that's better than the world that we lived in a hundred years ago when you didn't have Instagram and Facebook versions of ourselves and the online Oh, this is sort of showing off better versions of ourselves."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "We're using the tooling of modifying the images or even with artificial intelligence ideas of deep fakes and creating adjusted or fake versions of ourselves and reality."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "I think it's an interesting question."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "You're all sort of historical bent on this."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "So I actually wonder if 18th century aristocrats who commissioned famous painters to paint portraits of them had portraits that were slightly nicer than they actually looked in practice."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "So human desire to put your best foot forward has always been true."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "I think it's interesting."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "You sort of framed it in two ways."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "One is if we can imagine alternate realities and visualize them, is that a good or bad thing?"}, {"time": 2742, "text": "In the old days, you do it with storytelling and words and poetry, which still resides sometimes on websites, but we've become a very visual culture in particular."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "In the 19th century, we're very much a text based culture."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "People would read long tracks, political speeches were very long."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "Nowadays, everything's very kind of quick and visual and snappy."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "I think it depends on how harmless your intent."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "A lot of it's about intent."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "So if you have a somewhat flattering photo that you pick out of the photos that you have in your inbox to say, this is what I look like, it's probably fine."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "If someone's going to judge you by how you look, then they'll decide soon enough when they meet you whether the reality, you know."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "I think where it can be harmful is if people hold themselves up to an impossible standard, which they then feel bad about themselves for not meeting."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "I think that definitely can be an issue."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "But I think the ability to imagine and visualize an alternate reality, which sometimes you then go off and build later, can be a wonderful thing too."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "People can imagine architectural styles, which they then, you know, have a startup, make a fortune, and then build a house that looks like their favorite video game."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "Is that a terrible thing?"}, {"time": 2837, "text": "I think I used to worry about exploration, actually, that part of the joy of going to the moon."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "When I was a tiny child, I remember it in grainy black and white, was to know what it would look like when you got there."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And I think now we have such good graphics for visualizing the experience before it happens, that I slightly worry that it may take the edge off actually wanting to go, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 2860, "text": "Because we've seen it on TV."}, {"time": 2860, "text": "We kind of, oh, you know, by the time we finally get to Mars, we'll go, yeah, yeah, so it's Mars."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "That's what it looks like."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "But then, you know, the outer exploration, I mean, I think Pluto was a fantastic recent discovery where nobody had any idea what it looked like."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "And it was just breathtakingly varied and beautiful."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "So I think expanding the ability of the human toolkit to imagine and communicate on balance is a good thing."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "I think there are abuses, we definitely take them seriously and try to discourage them."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "I think there's a parallel side where the public needs to know what's possible through events like this, right?"}, {"time": 2901, "text": "So that you don't believe everything you read in print anymore."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "And it may over time become true of images as well."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "Or you need multiple sets of evidence to really believe something rather than a single media asset."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So I think it's a constantly evolving thing."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "It's been true forever."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "There's a famous story about Anne of Cleves and Henry VIII where luckily for Anne, they didn't get married, right?"}, {"time": 2925, "text": "So, or they got married and broke up in it."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "What's the story?"}, {"time": 2934, "text": "Oh, so Holbein went and painted a picture and then Henry VIII wasn't pleased and, you know, history doesn't record whether Anne was pleased, but I think she was pleased not to be married more than a day or something."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "So, I mean, this has gone on for a long time, but I think it's just a part of the magnification of human capability."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "You've kind of built up an amazing research environment here, research culture, research lab, and you've written that the secret to a thriving research lab is interns."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "Can you unpack that a little bit?"}, {"time": 2966, "text": "So a couple of reasons."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "As you see looking at my personal history, there are certain ideas you bond with at a certain stage of your career and you tend to keep revisiting them through time."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "If you're lucky, you pick one that doesn't just get solved in the next five years and then you're sort of out of luck."}, {"time": 2983, "text": "So I think a constant influx of new people brings new ideas with it."}, {"time": 2988, "text": "From the point of view of industrial research, because a big part of what we do is really taking those ideas to the point where they can ship as very robust features, you end up investing a lot in a particular idea."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "And if you're not careful, people can get too conservative in what they choose to do next, knowing that the product teams will want it."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "And interns let you explore the more fanciful or unproven ideas in a relatively lightweight way, ideally leading to new publications for the intern and for the researcher."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "And it gives you then a portfolio from which to draw which idea am I going to then try to take all the way through to being robust in the next year or two to ship."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "So it sort of becomes part of the funnel."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "It's also a great way for us to identify future full time researchers."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "Many of our greatest researchers were former interns."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "It builds a bridge to university departments so we can get to know and build an enduring relationship with the professors whom we often do academic give funds to as well as an acknowledgement of the value the interns add in their own collaborations."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "So it's sort of a virtuous cycle."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "And then the long term legacy of a great research lab hopefully will be not only the people who stay, but the ones who move through and then go off and carry that same model to other companies."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "And so we believe strongly in industrial research and how it can complement academia."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "And we hope that this model will continue to propagate and be invested in by other companies, which makes it harder for us to recruit, of course, but that's a sign of success."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And a rising tide lifts all ships in that sense."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And where's the idea born with the interns?"}, {"time": 3094, "text": "Is there brainstorming?"}, {"time": 3094, "text": "Is there discussions about, you know, like what?"}, {"time": 3102, "text": "Where do the ideas come from?"}, {"time": 3103, "text": "As I'm asking the question, I realize how dumb it is, but I'm hoping you have a better answer."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "A question I ask at the beginning of every summer."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "So what will happen is we'll send out a call for interns."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "They'll, we'll have a number of resumes come in."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "People will contact the candidates, talk to them about their interests."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "They'll usually try to find some, somebody who has a reasonably good match to what they're already doing, or just has a really interesting domain that they've been pursuing in their PhD."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "And we think we'd love to do one of those projects too."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "And then the intern stays in touch with the mentor, as we call them."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "And then they come and at the end of two weeks, they have to decide."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "So they'll often have a general sense by the time they arrive."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "And we'll have internal discussions about what are all the general ideas that we're wanting to pursue to see whether two people have the same idea, and maybe they should talk and all that."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "But then once the intern actually arrives, sometimes the idea goes linearly."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "And sometimes it takes a giant left turn."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "And we go, that sounded good."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "But when we thought about it, there's this other project, or it's already been done."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "And we found this paper, we were scooped."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "But we have this other great idea."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "So it's pretty, pretty flexible at the beginning."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "One of the questions for research labs is who's deciding what to do?"}, {"time": 3182, "text": "And then who's to blame if it goes wrong?"}, {"time": 3188, "text": "Who gets the credit if it goes right?"}, {"time": 3188, "text": "And so in Adobe, we push the needle very much towards freedom of choice of projects by the researchers and the interns."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "But then we reward people based on impact."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "So if the projects ultimately end up impacting the products and having papers and so on."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "And so your alternative model, just to be clear, is that you have one lab director who thinks he's a genius and tells everybody what to do, takes all the credit if it goes well, blames everybody else if it goes badly."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "So we don't want that model."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "And this helps new ideas percolate up."}, {"time": 3225, "text": "The art of running such a lab is that there are strategic priorities for the company."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "And there are areas where we do want to invest and pressing problems."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "And so it's a little bit of a trickle down and filter up meets in the middle."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "And so you don't tell people you have to do X, but you say X would be particularly appreciated this year."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "And then people reinterpret X through the filter of things they want to do and they're interested in."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "And miraculously, it usually comes together very well."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "One thing that really helps is Adobe has a really broad portfolio of products."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "So if we have a good idea, there's usually a product team that is intrigued or

of codependency as like two people that can't stop hanging out, you know, or like, you know, that's not totally off, but I think for the most part, my favorite definition of codependency is the inability to tolerate the discomfort of others."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "You grow up in an alcoholic home, you grow up around mental illness, you grow up in chaos, you have a parent that's a

the idea of robots so much because you don't have to walk on eggshells around them, you don't have to worry they're gonna get mad at you yet, but there's no, codependents are hypersensitive to the

I thought, gee, that might be a way to solve these problems with equations that we don't know how to do."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "So that was for me one of the first attractions is that I now had an alternative language to try to attack a set of mathematical problems."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "But I quickly realized that A, this mathematical language was not known by mathematicians, which makes it pretty interesting because now you have to actually teach mathematicians about a piece of mathematics because that's how they make their living."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "And the great thing about working with mathematicians, of course, is the rigor with which they examine ideas."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "So they make your ideas better than they start out."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "So I start working with a group of mathematicians and it was in that collaboration that we figured out that these funny pictures had error correcting codes buried in them."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "Can you talk about what are error correcting codes?"}, {"time": 3325, "text": "Ah, sure."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "So the simplest way to talk about error correcting codes is first of all, to talk about digital information."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "Digital information is basically strings of ones and zeros."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "They're called bits."}, {"time": 3341, "text": "So now let's imagine that I want to send you some bits."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "Well, maybe I could show you pictures, but maybe it's a rainy day or maybe the windows in your house are foggy."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "So sometimes when I show you a zero, you might interpret it as a one."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "Or other times when I show you a one, you might interpret it as a zero."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "So if that's the case, that means when I try to send you this data, it comes to you in corrupted form."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "And so the challenge is how do you get it to be uncorrupted?"}, {"time": 3375, "text": "In the 1940s, a computer scientist named Hamming addressed the problem of how do you reliably transmit digital information?"}, {"time": 3386, "text": "And what he came up with was a brilliant idea."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "Now, the way that you solve it is that you take the data that you want to send, the ones in your strings of ones and zeros, your favorite string, and then you dump more ones and zeros in, but you dump them in in a particular pattern."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "And this particular pattern is what a Hamming code is all about."}, {"time": 3405, "text": "So it's an error correcting code because if the person at the other end knows what the pattern's supposed to be, they can figure out when one's got changed to zeros, zero's got changed to one."},

out that they have ones and zeros buried in them."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "But even more astoundingly, the ones and zeros are not there randomly."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "They are in the pattern of error correcting codes."}, {"time": 3434, "text": "So this was an astounding thing that when we first got this result and tried to publish it, it took us three years to convince other physicists that we weren't crazy."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "Eventually we were able to publish it, I and this collaboration of mathematicians and other physicists."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "And so ever since then, I have actually been looking at the mathematics of these objects, trying to still understand properties of the equations."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "And I want to understand the properties of equations because I want to be able to try things like electrons."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "So as you can see, it's just like a two step removed process of trying to get back to reality."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "So what would you say is the most beautiful property of these Adinkra graphs, objects?"}, {"time": 3476, "text": "What do you think, by the way, the word symbols, what do you think of them, these simple graphs?"}, {"time": 3481, "text": "Are they objects or?"}, {"time": 3484, "text": "How should we think about that?"}, {"time": 3486, "text": "For people who work with mathematics like me, our mathematical concepts are, we often refer to them as objects because they feel like real things."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "Even though you can't see them or touch them, they're so much part of your interior life that it is as if you could."}, {"time": 3503, "text": "So we often refer to these things as objects, even though there's nothing objective about them."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And what does a single graph represent in space?"}, {"time": 3511, "text": "Okay, so the simplest of these graphs has to have one white ball and one black ball."}, {"time": 3516, "text":

ball and white ball."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "So the simplest of these objects looks like two little balls, one black, one white, connected by a single line."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "And what it's talking about is, as I said, a deep mathematical property related to symmetry."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "You've mentioned the error correcting codes, but is there a particular beautiful property that

there is."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "The craziest thing about these to me is that when you look at physics and try to write equations where information gets transmitted reliably, if you're in one of these super symmetrical systems with this extra symmetry, that doesn't happen unless there's an error correcting code present."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "So it's as if the universe says, you don't retransmit information unless there's something about an error correcting code."}, {"time": 3573, "text": "This to me is the craziest thing that I've ever personally encountered in my research."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "And it's actually got me to wondering how this could come about, because the only place in nature that we know about error correcting codes is genetics."}, {"time": 3587,

acting on the mathematical laws of the physics of our universe?"}, {"time": 3599, "text": "This is a very bizarre and strange idea."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "And it's something I've wondered about

theory."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "There's still maybe this aspect of it, which is there's still for me from an outsider's perspective, this fascinating heated debate."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "On the status of string theory."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "Can you clarify this debate, perhaps articulating the various views and say where you land on it?"}, {"time": 3650, "text": "So first of all, I doubt that I will be able to say anything to clarify the debate around string theory for a general audience."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "Part of the reason is because string theory has done something I've never seen the erectal physics do."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "It has broken out into consciousness of the general public before we're finished."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "You see, string theory

from that."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "That early RNA world eventually got to replication, where enzymes encoded in RNA would replicate RNA itself."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "And then that process

2116, "text": "So you start with an RNA molecule and you translate it into another kind of form."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "And that's the first kind of encoding."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "You're like, well, do you need some kind of code?"}, {"time": 2127, "text": "Yeah, but the code was in fact one thing."}, {"time": 2127, "text": "It was conflated with the actuators."}, {"time": 2134,

steps."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "They're basically, you know, the culmination of probably many competing software infrastructures for life preservation that won out."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "And then when the ribosome was so efficient at making proteins, all the other ones basically died out."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "And then the life forms that were using the modern ribosome were basically the more successful ones because it could make proteins."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "And now those proteins are much more versatile because RNA only has four bases."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "Proteins eventually have 20 amino acids, not initially, but eventually."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "And then they can form in much more complex shapes and they can create all kinds of additional machines."},

normal, reverse transcription as the oddball."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "Well, RNA preceded DNA."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "So reverse transcription actually was the first invention before transcription itself."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "So basically RNA invents proteins, RNA and proteins together invent DNA."}, {"time": 2249, "text": "So you now have a more stable medium and more stable backbone with two helices instead of one, two strands instead of one, the double helix."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "And RNA basically says, listen, I'm tired."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "I'm going to delegate all information storage to DNA and I'm going to delegate most actuation to proteins."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "But that's to you is not like a, that's just an efficiency thing."},

about sort of, would Europa life be scared of humans coming over and taking over?"}, {"time": 2472, "text": "Chances are no, not even like earth bacteria because earth bacteria would be wiped out in

those transitions, I was just a kid being a kid."}, {"time": 6801, "text": "And maybe the time that I started seeing it that way was maybe when I decided to stay at MIT as a professor after having been there as a student."}, {"time": 6817, "text": "And I kind of saw the struggle of getting professors to not see you as a kid when they're your peers."}, {"time": 6825, "text": "And I was very

about Ethereum 1.0."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So what were they trying to do to scale this whole process?"}, {"time": 2103, "text": "So they were like, well, if we could run contracts elsewhere and

are."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "Now, the problem with that is, well, somebody could lie about what the results are."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "So you need a resolution mechanism."}, {"time": 2123,

any kind of normal sandbox, you have to like replace syscalls with calls into the hypervisor."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "Sandbox, syscalls, hypervisor."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "As long as it's

doing a rendering, can't, for example, read a file from the file system."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "It has, if it tries to make an open syscall in Linux, the open syscall, you can't make it open syscall, no, no, no."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "You have to request from the kind of hypervisor process or like, I don't know what it's called in Chrome, but the, hey, could you open this file for me?"}, {"time": 2196, "text": "And then it does all these checks and then it passes the file handle back in if it's approved."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "So what's the, in the context of Ethereum, what are the boundaries of the sandbox that we're talking about?"}, {"time": 2208, "text": "Well, like one of the calls that you, actually reading and writing any state to the Ethereum contract, or to the Ethereum blockchain."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "Writing state is one of those calls that you're going to have to sandbox in layer two, because if you let layer two just arbitrarily write to the Ethereum blockchain."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "So layer two is really sitting on top of layer one."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "So you're going to have a lot of different kinds of ideas that you can play with."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "And they're all, they're not fundamentally changing the source code level of Ethereum."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "Well, you have to replace a bunch of calls with calls into the hypervisor."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "So instead of doing the syscall directly, you replace it with a call to the hypervisor."}, {"time": 2257, "text": "So originally they were doing this by first running the, so Solidity is the language that most Ethereum contracts are written in."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "It compiles to a bytecode."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "And then they wrote this thing they called the transpiler."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "And the transpiler took the bytecode and it transpiled it into OVM safe bytecode."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "Basically bytecode that didn't make any of those restricted syscalls and added the calls to the hypervisor."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "This transpiler was a 3000 line mess."}, {"time": 2285, "text": "And it's hard to do."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "It's hard to do if you're trying to do it like that, because you have to kind of like deconstruct the bytecode, change things about it, and then reconstruct it."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "And I mean, as soon as I hear this, I'm like, well, why don't you just change the compiler, right?"}, {"time": 2300, "text": "Why not the first place you build the bytecode, just do it in the compiler."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "So yeah, I asked them how much they wanted it."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "Of course, measured in dollars and I'm like, well, okay."}, {"time": 2314, "text": "And you wrote the compiler."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "Yeah, I modified, I wrote a 300 line diff to the compiler."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "It's open source, you can look at it."}, {"time": 2320,

C++."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "C++, yeah."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "So when asked how you were able to do it, you said, you just gotta think and then do it right."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "So can you break that apart a little bit?"}, {"time": 2344, "text": "What's your process of one, thinking and two, doing it right?"}, {"time": 2349, "text": "You know, the people that I was working for were amused that I said that."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "It doesn't really mean anything."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "I mean, is there some deep, profound insights to draw from like how you problem solve from that?"}, {"time": 2363, "text": "This is always what I say."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "I'm like, do you wanna be a good programmer?"}, {"time": 2366, "text": "Do it for 20 years."}, {"time":

Musk?"}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Is it you?"}, {"time": 2422, "text": "It is definitely not me."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "And I do not think it's Elon Musk."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "But yeah, this idea of groups reaching consensus in a decentralized yet formulaic way is one extremely powerful idea from crypto."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "Maybe the second idea is this idea of smart contracts."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "When you write a contract between two parties, any contract, this contract, if there are disputes, it's interpreted by lawyers."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "Lawyers are just really shitty overpaid interpreters."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "Imagine you had, let's talk about them in terms of a, in terms of like, let's compare a lawyer to Python, right?"}, {"time": 2465, "text": "So lawyer, well, okay."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "That's really, I never thought of it that way."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "So Python, I'm paying even 10 cents an hour."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "I'll use the nice Azure machine."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "I can run Python for 10 cents an hour."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "Lawyers cost $1,000 an hour."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "So Python

{"time": 2497, "text": "Yeah, I mean, just cost, reliability, everything about Python is so much better than lawyers."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "So if you can make smart contracts, this whole concept of code is law."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "I love, and I would love to live in a world where everybody accepted that fact."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "So maybe you can talk about what smart contracts are."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "So let's say, let's say, you know, we have a, even something as simple as a safety deposit box, right?"}, {"time": 2531, "text": "Safety deposit box that holds a million dollars."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "I have a contract with the bank that says two out of these three parties must be present to open the safety deposit box and get the money out."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "So that's a contract for the bank, and it's only as good as the bank and the lawyers, right?"}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Let's say, you know, somebody dies and now, oh, we're gonna go through a big legal dispute about whether, oh, well, was it in the will, was it not in the will?"}, {"time": 2557, "text": "What, like, it's just so messy, and the cost to determine truth is so expensive."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "Versus a smart contract, which just uses cryptography to check if two out of three keys are present."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "Well, I can look at that, and I can have certainty in the answer that it's going to return."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "And that's what, all businesses want is certainty."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "You know, they say businesses don't care."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Viacom, YouTube, YouTube's like, look, we don't care which way this lawsuit goes."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "Just please tell us so we can have certainty."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "Yeah, I wonder how many agreements in this, because we're talking about financial transactions only in this case, correct, the smart contracts?"}, {"time": 2595, "text": "Oh, you can go to anything."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "You can put a prenup in the Ethereum blockchain."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "A married smart contract?"}, {"time": 2603, "text": "Sorry, divorce lawyer, sorry."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "You're going to be replaced by Python."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "Okay, so that's another beautiful idea."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "Do you think there's something that's appealing to you about any one specific implementation?"}, {"time": 2620, "text": "So if you look 10, 20, 50 years down the line, do you see any, like, Bitcoin, Ethereum, any of the other

policy."}, {"time": 3600, "text": "So that's the interesting thing is you're not doing, you don't appear to be, maybe you can correct me, you don't appear to be doing lane detection or lane marking

We have a lot of high quality data, yeah."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "Like more than you need in the second."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "Well... We have way more than we do."}, {"time": 3643, "text": "We have way more data than we need."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "I mean, it's an interesting question actually, because in terms of amount, you have more than you need, but the driving is full of edge cases."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "So how do you select the data you train on?"}, {"time": 3658, "text": "I think this is an interesting open

mean, the entirety of machine learning can be, they don't seem to really care."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "They just kind of select data."}, {"time": 3672, "text": "But I feel like that if you want to solve, if you want to create intelligent systems, you have to pick data well, right?"}, {"time": 3678, "text": "And so do you have any hints, ideas of how to do it well?"}, {"time": 3682, "text": "So in some ways that is..."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "The definition I like of reinforcement learning versus supervised learning."}, {"time": 3689, "text": "In supervised learning, the weights depend on the data."}, {"time": 3694, "text": "And this is obviously true, but in reinforcement learning, the data depends on the weights."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "And actually both ways."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "That's poetry."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "So how does it know what data to train on?"}, {"time": 3706, "text": "Well, let it pick."}, {"time": 3707, "text": "We're not there yet, but that's the eventual."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "So you're thinking this almost like a reinforcement learning framework."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "We're going to do RL on the world."}, {"time": 3715, "text":

3757, "text": "So maybe we've seen 10 X improvement in a year, but a hundred miles is still a far cry from the a hundred thousand you're going to need."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "So you're going to somehow need to get three more 10 Xs in there."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "And you're, what's your intuition?"}, {"time": 3772, "text": "You're basically hoping that there's exponential improvement built into the baked into the cake somewhere."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "Well, that's even, I mean, 10 X improvement, that's already assuming exponential, right?"}, {"time": 3780, "text": "There's definitely exponential improvement."}, {"time": 3782, "text": "And I think when Elon talks about exponential, like these things, these systems are going to exponentially improve, just exponential doesn't mean you're getting a hundred gigahertz processors tomorrow."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "Like it's going to still take a while because the gap between even our best system and humans is still large."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "So that's an interesting distinction to draw."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "So if you look at the way Tesla is approaching the problem and the way you're approaching the problem, which is very different than the rest of the self driving car world."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "So let's put them aside is you're treating most the driving task as a machine learning problem."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "And the way Tesla is approaching it is with the multitask learning where you break the task of driving into hundreds of different tasks and you have this multiheaded neural network that's very good at performing each task."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "And there there's presumably something on top that's stitching stuff together in order to make control decisions, policy decisions about how you move the car."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "But what that allows you, there's a brilliance to this because it allows you to master each task, like lane detection, stop sign detection, the traffic light detection, drivable area segmentation, you know, vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian detection."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "There's some localization tasks in there."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "Also predicting of like, yeah, predicting how the entities in the scene are going to move."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Like everything is basically a machine learning task."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "So there's a classification, segmentation, prediction."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "And it's nice because you can have this entire engine, data engine that's mining for edge cases for each one of these tasks."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "And you can have people like engineers that are basically masters of that task, like become the best person in the world at, as you talk about the cone guy for Waymo, the becoming the best person in the world at cone detection."}, {"time": 3906, "text": "So that's a compelling notion from a supervised learning perspective, automating much of the process of edge case discovery and retraining neural network for each of the individual perception tasks."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "And then you're looking at the machine learning in a more holistic way, basically doing end to end learning on the driving tasks, supervised, trained on the data of the actual driving of people."}, {"time": 3934, "text": "They use comma AI, like actual human drivers, their manual control, plus the moments of disengagement that maybe with some labeling could indicate the failure of the system."}, {"time": 3947, "text": "So you have the, you have a huge amount of data for positive control of the vehicle, like successful control of the vehicle, both maintaining the lane as, as I think you're also working on longitudinal control of the vehicle and then failure cases where the vehicle does something wrong that needs disengagement."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "So like what, why do you think you're right and Tesla is wrong on this?"}, {"time": 3974, "text": "And do you think, do you think you'll come around the Tesla way?"}, {"time": 3977, "text": "Do you think Tesla will come around to your way?"}, {"time": 3981, "text":

back and forth on what I think about it."}, {"time": 9151, "text": "But the basic thesis is it's a nice compelling notion that we can reduce the task of creating an intelligent system, a generally

you find that, was that just at the time you found that as a compelling idea or do you still find that a compelling idea?"}, {"time": 9176, "text": "I still find that a compelling idea."}, {"time":

you know what compression is, you know what lossless, it's lossless compression, not lossy, lossless compression."}, {"time": 9202, "text": "And that that is equivalent to intelligence, which I

prize, I spent the next six months of my life trying it."}, {"time": 9227, "text": "And well, that's when I started learning everything about AI."}, {"time": 9231, "text": "And then I worked at Vicarious for a bit and then I read all the deep learning stuff."}, {"time": 9235, "text": "And I'm like, okay, now I like I'm caught up to modern AI."}, {"time": 9239, "text": "And I had a really good framework to put it all in from the compression stuff, right?"}, {"time": 9244, "text": "Like some of the first deep learning models I played with were GPT basically, but before transformers, before it was still RNNs to do character prediction."}, {"time": 9257, "text": "But by the way, on the compression side, I mean, especially with neural networks, what do you make of the lossless requirement with the Hutter prize?"}, {"time": 9266, "text": "So, you know, human intelligence and neural networks can probably compress stuff pretty well, but it would be lossy."}, {"time": 9276, "text": "You can turn a lossy compression to a lossless compressor pretty easily using an arithmetic encoder, right?"}, {"time": 9281, "text": "You can take an arithmetic encoder and you can just encode the noise with maximum efficiency."}, {"time": 9286, "text": "So even if you can't predict exactly what the next character is, the better a probability distribution, you can put over the next character."}, {"time": 9294, "text": "You can then use an arithmetic encoder to, right?"}, {"time": 9297, "text": "You don't have to know whether it's an E or an I, you just have to put good probabilities on them and then, you know, code those."}, {"time": 9303, "text": "And if you have, it's a bits of entropy thing, right?"}, {"time": 9306, "text": "So let me, on that topic, it'd be interesting as a little side tour."}, {"time": 9310, "text": "What are your thoughts in this year about GPT3 and these language models and these transformers?"}, {"time": 9316, "text": "Is there something interesting to you as an AI researcher, or is there something interesting to you as an autonomous vehicle developer?"}, {"time": 9324, "text": "Nah, I think it's overhyped."}, {"time": 9327, "text": "I mean, it's not, like, it's cool."}, {"time": 9329, "text": "It's cool for what it is, but no, we're not just gonna be able to scale up to GPT12 and get general purpose intelligence."}, {"time": 9335, "text": "Like, your loss function is literally just, you know, cross entropy loss on the character, right?"}, {"time": 9341, "text": "Like, that's not the loss function of general intelligence."}, {"time": 9347, "text": "Can you imagine that, like, to play devil's advocate on yourself, is it possible that you can, the GPT12 will achieve general intelligence with something as dumb as this kind of loss function?"}, {"time": 9361, "text": "I guess it depends what you mean by general intelligence."}, {"time": 9365, "text": "So there's another problem with the GPTs, and that's that they don't have a, they don't have longterm memory."}, {"time": 9373, "text": "So, like, just GPT12, a scaled up version of GPT2 or GPT3, I find it hard to believe."}, {"time": 9386, "text": "Well, you can scale it in, so it's a hard coded length, but you can make it wider and wider and wider."}, {"time": 9396, "text": "You're gonna get cool things from those systems, but I don't think you're ever gonna get something that can, like, you know, build me a rocket ship."}, {"time": 9407, "text": "What about solved driving?"}, {"time": 9409, "text": "So, you know, you can use Transformer with video, for example."}, {"time": 9414, "text": "You think, is there something in there?"}, {"time": 9417, "text": "No, because, I mean, look, we use a GRU."}, {"time": 9421, "text": "We use a GRU."}, {"time": 9422, "text": "We could change that GRU out to a Transformer."}, {"time": 9425, "text": "I think driving is much more Markovian than language."}, {"time": 9429, "text": "So, Markovian, you mean, like, the memory, which aspect of Markovian?"}, {"time": 9433, "text": "I mean that, like, most of the information in the state at T minus one is also in state T. I see, yeah."}, {"time": 9440, "text": "Right, and it kind of, like, drops off nicely like this, whereas sometime with language, you have to refer back to the third paragraph on the second page."}, {"time": 9447, "text": "I feel like."}, {"time": 9448, "text": "There's not many, like, you can say, like, speed limit signs, but there's really not many things in autonomous driving that look like that."}, {"time": 9453, "text": "But if you look at, to play devil's advocate, is the risk estimation thing that you've talked about is kind of interesting."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "Is, it feels like there might be some longer term aggregation of context necessary to be able to figure out, like, the context."}, {"time": 9471, "text": "Yeah, I'm not even sure I'm believing my devil's advocate."}, {"time": 9475, "text": "We have a nice, like, vision model, which outputs, like, a one or two, four dimensional perception space."}, {"time": 9483, "text": "Can I try Transformers on it?"}, {"time": 9484, "text": "Sure, I probably will."}, {"time": 9486, "text": "At some point, we'll try Transformers, and then we'll just see."}, {"time": 9489, "text": "Do they do better?"}, {"time": 9489, "text": "Sure, I'm."}, {"time": 9490, "text": "But it might not be a game changer, you're saying?"}, {"time": 9492, "text": "No, well, I'm not."}, {"time": 9493, "text": "Like, might Transformers work better than GRUs for autonomous driving?"}, {"time": 9496, "text": "Might we switch?"}, {"time": 9498, "text": "Is this some radical change?"}, {"time": 9500, "text": "Okay, we use a slightly different, you know, we switch from RNNs to GRUs."}, {"time": 9503, "text": "Like, okay, maybe it's GRUs to Transformers, but no, it's not."}, {"time": 9507, "text": "Well, on the topic of general intelligence, I don't know how much I've talked to you about it."}, {"time": 9512, "text": "Like, what, do you think we'll actually build an AGI?"}, {"time": 9518, "text": "Like, if you look at Ray Kurzweil with Singularity, do you have like an intuition about, you're kind of saying driving is easy."}, {"time": 9526, "text": "And I tend to personally believe that solving driving will have really deep, important impacts on our ability to solve general intelligence."}, {"time": 9539, "text": "Like, I think driving doesn't require general intelligence, but I think they're going to be neighbors in a way that it's like deeply tied."}, {"time": 9548, "text": "Cause it's so, like driving is so deeply connected to the human experience that I think solving one will help solve the other."}, {"time": 9557, "text": "But, so I don't see, I don't see driving as like easy and almost like separate than general intelligence, but like, what's your vision of a future with a Singularity?"}, {"time": 9566, "text": "Do you see there'll be a single moment, like a Singularity where it'll be a phase shift?"}, {"time": 9570, "text": "Are we in the Singularity now?"}, {"time":

9580, "text": "Look at the bandwidth between people."}, {"time": 9581, "text": "The bandwidth between people goes up, right?"}, {"time": 9584, "text": "The Singularity is just, you know, when the

collective intelligence?"}, {"time": 9602, "text": "Oh, I didn't say it's necessarily a good thing, but I think that's like, when I think of the definition of the Singularity, yeah, it seems kind of right."}, {"time": 9608, "text": "I see, like it's a change in the world beyond which like the world be transformed in ways that we can't possibly imagine."}, {"time": 9616, "text": "No, I mean, I think we're in the Singularity now in the sense that there's like, you know, one world and a monoculture and it's also linked."}, {"time": 9622, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I kind of share the intuition that the Singularity will originate from the collective intelligence of us ands versus the like some single system AGI type thing."}, {"time": 9635, "text": "Oh, I totally agree with that."}, {"time": 9637, "text": "Yeah, I don't really believe in like a hard take off AGI kind of thing."}, {"time": 9645, "text": "Yeah, I don't even think AI is all that different in kind from what we've already been

do have to have a mission and you wanna focus and make sure you get there."}, {"time": 9679, "text": "You can't forget that but at the same time, there is a thread that's much bigger than that

depends what you think human beings are."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "I tend to believe that as we get more intelligent, we start to see the value, the evolutionary value and the value in terms of happiness of being good to each other."}, {"time": 5198, "text": "And I think AI, if you look at AI as an optimization problem of how to create a civilization that works well and expands throughout

about this moon and you're sort of a scholar of many planets and moons, but that one kind of stood out to me."}, {"time": 880, "text": "So why is that an interesting one?"}, {"time": 882, "text": "For so many reasons, but Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system."}, {"time": 887, "text": "It has hundreds of active volcanoes on it."}, {"time": 890, "text": "It has volcanic plumes that go hundreds of kilometers up above its surface."}, {"time": 896, "text": "It puts out more volume of magma per volcano than volcanoes on Earth today."}, {"time": 903, "text": "But I think to me, the reason that it's most interesting is as a laboratory for understanding planetary processes."}, {"time": 912, "text": "So one of the broad goals of planetary science is to put together a sort of more general and coherent framework for how planets work in general."}, {"time": 924, "text": "Our current framework, you know, it started out very Earth centric."}, {"time": 927, "text": "We start to understand how Earth volcanoes work."}, {"time": 930, "text": "But then when you try to transport that to somewhere like Io that doesn't have an atmosphere, which has a very tenuous atmosphere, which makes a big difference for how the magma degasses, for something that's really small, for something that has a different heat source, for something that's embedded in another object's magnetic field, the kind of intuition we have from Earth doesn't apply."}, {"time": 950, "text": "And so broadly, planetary science is trying to broaden that framework so that you have a kind of narrative that you can understand how each planet became different from every other planet."}, {"time": 962, "text": "And I'm already making a mistake."}, {"time": 964, "text": "When I say planet,

983, "text": "So, and you also didn't mention Europa, which I think is the, is that the most famous moon of Jupiter?"}, {"time": 989, "text": "Is that the one gets attention because it might have life?"}, {"time": 995, "text": "But to you, Io is also beautiful."}, {"time": 997, "text": "What's the difference between volcanoes on Io versus Earth?"}, {"time": 1001, "text": "You said atmosphere makes a difference."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "What the heat source plays a big role."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "So many of the moons in the outer solar system are heated from gravitationally by tidal heating."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And I'm happy to describe what that is or, yeah, please, what's tidal?"}, {"time": 1021, "text": "So tidal heating is, it's, if you want to understand and contextualize planets and moons, you have to understand their heat sources."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So for Earth, we have radioactive decay in our interior as well as residual heat of formation."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "But for satellites, tidal heating plays a really significant role and in particular in driving geological activity on satellites and potentially making those subsurface oceans in places like Europa and Enceladus habitable."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And so the way that that works is if you have multiple moons and their orbital periods are integer multiples of one another, that means that they're always encountering each other at the same point in the orbit."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "So if they were on just random orbits, they'd be encountering each other at random places and the gravitational effect between the two moons would be canceling out over time."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "But because they're always meeting each other at the same point in the orbit, those gravitational interactions add up coherently."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "And so that tweaks them into eccentric orbits."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "What's an eccentric orbit?"}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit, it just means noncircular, so a deviation from a circular orbit."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "And that means that for Io or Europa, at some points in their orbit, they're closer to Jupiter and at some points in their orbit, they're farther away."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "And so when they're closer, they're stretched out in a sense, but literally just not very stretched out, like a couple hundred meters, something like that."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And then when they're farthest away, they're less stretched out."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "And so you actually have the shape of the object deforming over the course of the orbit."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And these orbits are like just a couple of days."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "And so that, in the case of Io, that is literally sufficient friction in its mantle to melt the rock of its mantle."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "And that's what generates the magma."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "That's the source of the magma."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "So why is, so Europa is, I thought there was like ice and oceans underneath kind of thing."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "So why is Europa not getting the friction?"}, {"time": 1145, "text": "It is, it's just a little bit farther away from Jupiter."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "And then Ganymede is also in the orbital resonance."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So it's a three object orbital resonance in the Jupiter system."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "But we have these sorts of orbital resonances all over the solar system and also in exoplanets."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "So for Europa, basically because it's farther from Jupiter, the effect is not as extreme, but you do still have heat generated in its interior in this way."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "And that may be driving, could be driving hydrothermal activity at the base of its ocean, which obviously would be a really valuable thing for life."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "So it's like heating up the ocean a little bit."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "Heating up the ocean a little bit."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And specifically in these like hydrothermal vents where we see really interesting life evolve in the bottom of Earth's oceans."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "So what's Io, what else?"}, {"time": 1195, "text": "So we know the source is this friction, but there's no atmosphere."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "I'm trying to get a sense of what it's like if you and I were to visit Io, like what would that look like?"}, {"time": 1206, "text": "What would it feel like?"},

surface is actually really cold, very far below freezing on the surface when you're away from a volcano, but the volcanoes themselves are over a thousand degrees or the magma when it comes out is over a thousand degrees."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "But it does come to the surface, the magma?"}, {"time": 1235, "text": "In particular places."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Whoa, that probably looks beautiful."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "So like, so it's frozen, not ice."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Like what is, is rock, it's really cold rock."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And then you just have this like, what is, what does that look, what would that look like with no atmosphere?"}, {"time": 1253, "text": "Would that, uh, would it be smoke?"}, {"time": 1258, "text": "It's just magma, like just red, yellow, like liquidy things?"}, {"time": 1263, "text": "It's black, it's black and red, I guess."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "Like think of the type of magma that you see in Hawaii."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "So different types of magma flow in different ways, for example."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So in somewhere like Io, the magma is really hot and so it will flow out in sheets because it has really low viscosity."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "And I think the lava flows that we've been having in Hawaii over the past couple of years are probably a decent analogy, although Io's magma's lavas are even more fluid and faster moving."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "How faster?"}, {"time": 1297, "text": "Like what, uh, how fat, like if you, uh, by the way, sorry, through the telescope, are you tracking at what timescale?"}, {"time": 1303, "text": "Like every frame is how far apart?"}, {"time": 1307, "text": "If you're looking through a telescope, are we talking about seconds or we're talking about days, months, when you kind of track, try to get a picture of what the surface might look like, what's the frequency?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So it depends a little bit on what you want to do."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "I, ideally every night, um, but you could take a frame every second and see how things are changing."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "The, the problem with that is that for things to change on a one second timescale, you to actually see something change that fast, you have to have super high resolution."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "The spatial resolution we have is a couple of hundred kilometers."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "And so things are not changing on those scales over one second, unless you have something really crazy happening."}, {"time": 1349,

to you?"}, {"time": 1361, "text": "Would you be able to understand something deeper about these volcanic eruptions and how magma flows and just the, like the rate of the magma is, or is it basically enough to have the kilometer resolution?"}, {"time": 1375, "text": "Do you get it?"}, {"time": 1377, "text": "We want to go there."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "You want to go, you want to go to Io?"},

mean you don't like, I don't want to go there as a human as a human."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "I want to send a robot there to look at it though."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "This is again, everybody's discriminating against robots."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "This is not, but it's fine."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "But it's not hospitable to humans in any way, right?"}, {"time": 1402, "text": "Just very cold and very hot."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "It's very cold."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "The atmosphere is composed of sulfur dioxide, so you can breathe it."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "There's no pressure."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "I mean, it's kind of all the same things you talk about."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "One talks about, about Mars only worse, the atmosphere is still a thousand times less dense than Mars is."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And the radiation environment is terrible because you're embedded deep within Jupiter's magnetic field and Jupiter's magnetic field is full of charged particles that have all come out of Io's volcanoes actually."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "So Jupiter's magnetic field strips all this material out of Io's atmosphere and that populates its entire magnetosphere and then that material comes back around and hits Io and spreads throughout the system actually."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "It's just, it's like Io is the massive polluter of the Jupiter system."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "So what does studying Io teach you about volcanoes on earth or vice versa?"}, {"time": 1463, "text": "Is in the difference of the two, what insights can you mine out?"}, {"time": 1470, "text": "That might be interesting in some way."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Well, we try to port the tools that we use to study earth volcanism to Io and it works to some extent, but it is challenging because the situations are so different and the compositions are really different."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "When you talk about outgassing, you know, earth volcanoes outgassed primarily water and carbon dioxide, and then sulfur dioxide is the third most abundant gas."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And on Io, the water and carbon dioxide are not there, either it didn't form with them or it lost them, we don't know."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "And so the chemistry of how the magma outgassed this is completely different."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "But the kind of one to me most interesting analogy to earth is that, so Io, as I've said, it has these really low viscosity magmas, the lava spreads really quickly across its surface, it can put out massive volumes of magma in relatively short periods of time."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And that sort of volcanism is not happening anywhere else in the solar system today."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "But literally every terrestrial planet and the moon had this, what we call very effusive volcanism early in their history."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "Okay, so this is almost like a little glimpse into the early history of earth."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "So what are the chances that a volcano on earth destroys all of human civilization?"}, {"time": 1560, "text": "Maybe I wanted to sneak in that question."},

kind of humbling to see something so powerful and so hot, like so unpleasant for humans, and then you realize we're sitting on many of them here?"}, {"time": 1579, "text": "Yeah, Yellowstone is a classic example."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "I don't know what the chances are of that happening."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "My intuition would be that the chances of that are lower than the chances of us getting wiped out by some other means, that maybe it'll happen eventually, that there'll be one of these massive volcanoes on earth, but we'll probably be gone by then by some other means."},

people have about life being in Europa?"}, {"time": 1620, "text": "Maybe also, what are the things we know about it?"}, {"time": 1623, "text": "What are the things to you that are interesting about that particular moon of Jupiter?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "Yeah, Europa is, from many perspectives, one of the really interesting places in the solar system among the solar system moons."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So there are a few, there's a lot of interest in looking for or understanding the potential for life to evolve in the subsurface oceans."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "I think it's fairly widely accepted that the chances of life evolving on the surfaces of really anything in the solar system is very low."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "The radiation environment is too harsh and there's just not liquids on the surface of most of these things and it's canonically accepted that liquids are required for life."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "And so the subsurface oceans, in addition to maybe Titan's atmosphere, the subsurface oceans of the icy satellites are one of the most plausible places in the solar system for life to evolve."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "Europa and Cellitus are interesting because for many of the big satellites, so Ganymede and Callisto, also satellites of Jupiter, also are thought to have subsurface oceans."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "But they have these ice shells and then there's an ocean underneath the ice shell."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "But on those moons around Ganymede, we think that there's another ice shell underneath and then there's rock."},

Europa doesn't have this ice shell at the bottom of the ocean, we think."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "And so the water and rock are in direct interaction and so that means that you can basically dissolve a lot of material out of the rock."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "You potentially have this hydrothermal activity that's injecting energy and nutrients for life to survive."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And so this rock water interface is considered really important for the potential habitability."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "As a small aside, you kind of said that it's canonically assumed that water is required for life."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "Is it possible to have life like in a volcano?"}, {"time": 1753, "text": "I remember people were like in that National Geographic program or something kind of hypothesizing that you can really have life anywhere."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "So as long as there's a source of heat, a source of energy, do you think it's possible to have life in a volcano, like no water?"}, {"time": 1774, "text": "I think anything's possible."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "It doesn't have to be water."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "You can tell, as you identified, I phrased that really carefully."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "It's canonically accepted that because scientists recognize that we have no idea what broad range of life could be out there and all we really have is our biases of life as we know it."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "But for life as we know it, it's very helpful to have or even necessary to have some kind of liquid and preferably a polar solvent that can actually dissolve molecules, something like water."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "So the case of liquid methane on Titan is less ideal from that perspective."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "But liquid magma, if it stays liquid long enough for life to evolve, you have a heat source, you have a liquid, you have nutrients."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "In theory, that checks your three classic astrobiology boxes."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "That'd be fascinating."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "I mean, it'd be fascinating if it's possible to detect it easily."}, {"time": 1832, "text":

need to send robots and do some drilling?"}, {"time": 1851, "text": "I think realistically you need to do the drilling."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "So Europa also has these long tectonic features on its surface where it's thought that there's potential for water from the ocean to be somehow making its way up onto the surface."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And you could imagine some out there scenario where there's bacteria in the ocean."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "It's somehow working its way up through the ice shell."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "It's spilling out on the surface."}, {"time":

4309, "text": "And the, these sort of belts of debris throughout the solar system, the outer solar system, you know, the Kuiper belt that we talked about, the asteroid belt, as well as certain other

are so interested in them, aside from potentially the fact that they could come hit Earth, but scientifically it's, it gives us a window into understanding the composition of the material from which

different ways."}, {"time": 4364, "text": "Some of them are ancient objects."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "So they accreted out of the sort of disc of material that the whole solar system formed out of and have kind of remained ever since more or less the same."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "They've probably collided with each other and we see the, all these collisional fragments and you can actually look and based on their orbits say, you know, like these 50 objects originated as the same object."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "You can see them kind of dynamically moving apart after some big collision."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "And so some of them are these ancient objects maybe that have undergone collisions."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "And then there's this other category of object that is the one that I personally find really interesting which is remnants of objects that could have been planets."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "So early on a bunch of potential planets accreted that we call planetesimals and they formed and they formed with a lot of energy and they had enough time to actually differentiate."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "So some of these objects differentiated into cores and mantles and crests."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "And then they were subsequently disrupted in these massive collisions and they, now we have these fragments, we think fragments floating around the asteroid belt that are like bits of mantle, bits of core, bits of crest basically."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "So it's like puzzle pieces that you might be able to stitch together or I guess it's all mixed up so you can't stitch together the original planet candidates or is that possible to try to see if they kind of, I mean, there's too many objects in there to."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "I think that there are cases where people have kind of looked at objects and by looking at their orbits, they say these objects should have originated together, but they have very different compositions."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "And so then you can hypothesize maybe they were different fragments of a differentiated object."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "But one of the really cool things about this is, you know, we've been talking about getting clues into the interiors of planets."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "We've never seen a planetary core or deep mantle directly."}, {"time": 4497, "text": "Some mantle material comes up on our surface and then we can see it, but, you know, sort of in bulk."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "We haven't seen these things directly and these asteroids potentially give us a chance to like look at what our own core and mantle is like, or at least would be like if it had been also floating through space for a few billion years and getting irradiated and all that."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "But it's a cool potential window or like analogy into the interior of our own planet."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "Well, how do you begin studying some of these asteroids?"}, {"time": 4530, "text": "What if you were to put together a study, like what are the interesting questions to ask that are a little bit more specific?"}, {"time": 4537, "text": "Do you find a favorite asteroid that could be tracked and try to track it through telescopes?"}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Or do you, is it has to be, do you have to land on those things to study it?"}, {"time": 4551, "text": "So when it comes to the asteroids, there are so many of them and the big pictures or the big questions are answered, so some questions can be answered by zooming in in detail on individual object, but mostly you're trying to do a statistical study."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "So you want to look at thousands of objects, even hundreds of thousands of objects and figure out what their composition is and look at, you know, how many big asteroids there are of this composition versus how many small asteroids of this other composition and put together these kinds of statistical properties of the asteroid belt."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "And those properties can be directly compared with the results of simulations for the formation of the solar system."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "What do we know about the surfaces of asteroids or the contents of the insides of asteroids and what are still open questions?"}, {"time": 4612, "text": "So I would say that we don't know a whole lot about their compositions."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "Most of them are small and so you can't study them in such detail with telescopes as you could, you know, a planet or moon and at the same time, because there are so many of them, you could send a spacecraft to a few, but you can't really like get a statistical survey with spacecraft."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "And so a lot of what we, a lot of what has been done comes down to sort of classification."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "You look at how bright they are, you look at whether they're red or blue, simply, you know, whether their spectrum is sloped towards long wavelengths or short wavelengths."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "There are certain, if you point a spectrograph at their surfaces, there are certain features you can see."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "So you can tell that some of them have silicates on them."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "But these are the sort of, they're pretty basic questions."}, {"time": 4670, "text": "We're still trying to classify them based on fairly basic information in kind of combination with our general understanding of the material the solar system formed from."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "And so you're sort of, you're coming in with prior knowledge, which is that you more or less know what the materials are the solar system formed from, and then you're trying to classify them into these categories."}, {"time": 4689, "text": "There's still a huge amount of room for understanding them better and for understanding how their surfaces are changing in the space

actually operate a spacecraft in such a dense field of debris."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "Oh, the asteroid belt, there's a ton of material there, but it's actually not that dense."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "It is mostly open space."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "So mentally do picture like mostly open space with some rocks."}, {"time": 4731, "text": "The problem is some of them are not thought to be solid."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "So some of these asteroids, especially these, these core mantle fragments, you can think of as sort of solid like a planet, but some of them are just kind of aggregates of material."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "We call them rubble piles."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "And so there's not necessarily."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "Might look like a rock, but do a lot of them have kind of clouds around them, like a dust cloud thing, or like, do you know what you're stepping on when you try to land on it?"}, {"time": 4762, "text": "Like what are we supposed to be visualizing here?"}, {"time": 4766, "text": "This is like very few have water, right?"}, {"time": 4769, "text": "There's some water in the outer part of the asteroid belt, but they're not quite like

based."}, {"time": 436, "text": "And that's tough because RNA is pretty fragile in the world."}, {"time": 440, "text": "And it probably didn't get very big as a consequence."}, {"time": 444, "text": "But then proteins evolved and I'm skipping like hundreds of millions of years of evolution."}, {"time": 450, "text": "Proteins evolved, maybe without a cell, maybe with a cell."}, {"time": 455, "text": "But then to make a cell, there probably were some RNA based cells early on, but they were pretty simple."}, {"time": 462, "text": "But the cells that we know of today, even bacteria and single celled eukaryotes, they have very long DNA genomes."}, {"time": 470, "text": "And you need a lot of DNA to make a complicated cell."}, {"time": 474, "text": "And so we think at some point, the RNA became DNA."}, {"time": 479, "text": "And probably one of the earliest enzymes that arose is the enzyme that could copy that RNA into DNA, which we now know today as reverse transcriptase, which my former boss, David Baltimore and Howard Temin co discovered."}, {"time": 494, "text": "And that enzyme arose and copied RNA to DNA."}, {"time": 499, "text": "And then you could build big cells with DNA because DNA can be millions and millions of bases in length and RNA, the longest RNA we know of is 40,000 bases, not much bigger than the SARS CoV2."}, {"time": 512, "text": "What would you say is the magic moment along that line?"}, {"time": 516, "text": "I saw it was one or two billion, maybe three billion years it took to go from bacteria to complex organism."}, {"time": 529, "text": "It seems like Earth had a very long time, not a very long time without life, and then a very long time with very primitive life."}, {"time": 539, "text": "Maybe I'm discriminating, calling bacteria primitive life."}, {"time": 543, "text": "People would object to you doing that for sure."}, {"time": 546, "text": "But it seems like complex organism when it starts becoming something like, I don't know what's a good, not animal like, but more complexity than just like a single cell."}, {"time": 557, "text": "What do you think is the magic there?"}, {"time": 560, "text": "What's the hardest thing?"}, {"time": 561, "text": "If you were trying to engineer Earth and build life and build the simulations, obviously we're living in a video game, what this is."}, {"time": 567, "text": "So if you were trying to build this video game, what's the hardest part along this evolution?"}, {"time": 572, "text": "Bacteria are mostly single cells."}, {"time": 576, "text": "They do make colonies."}, {"time": 577, "text": "They get together in biofilms, which are really important."}, {"time": 581, "text": "But they're all single bacteria in that."}, {"time": 583, "text": "And the key is making an organism where cells do different things."}, {"time": 589, "text": "We have skin cells and eye cells and brain cells."}, {"time": 591, "text": "Bacteria never do that."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And the reason is probably energy."}, {"time": 595, "text": "Bacteria can't make enough energy to do that."}, {"time": 598, "text": "And so there was another cell existing at the time, the archaea."}, {"time": 606, "text": "And the idea is that a bacteria went into an archaea and became the modern day mitochondria, the energy factory of the cell."}, {"time": 614, "text": "And that now led that cell develop into more and more complicated organisms like we have today."}, {"time": 620, "text": "It was all about energy."}, {"time": 621, "text": "So the mitochondria, the energy, the mitochondria is the magic thing."}, {"time": 627, "text": "It's just actually not my idea."}, {"time": 628, "text": "It's Nick Jones."}, {"time": 629, "text": "Have you heard of Nick Jones?"}, {"time": 630, "text":

make a lot of energy, which a mitochondria can do."}, {"time": 643, "text": "It's basically a whole bacteria inside of a bigger cell."}, {"time": 646, "text": "And that becomes what we now call

"text": "Yeah, which points of viruses come along?"}, {"time": 656, "text": "So remember, we have these precellular, they're called precellular replicons, right?"}, {"time": 661, "text": "And so we have a precellular stage where we have these self replicating molecules and then cells arise."}, {"time": 670, "text": "And then the self replicating molecules invade the cells."}, {"time": 676, "text": "Because it's a hospitable environment."}, {"time": 677, "text": "I mean, they didn't know that."}, {"time": 679, "text": "They just went in and it turned out it was beneficial for them, so it stuck."}, {"time": 683, "text": "And they replicate inside the cell now where they have pools of everything they need."}, {"time": 687, "text": "They get more and more complicated."}, {"time": 689,

protected."}, {"time": 697, "text": "They can move from host to host."}, {"time": 699, "text": "And because they're at the earliest stages of cellular evolution, they can diversify to infect anything that arises."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And that is why I think there's so many of them and everything on the planet is infected because the ancestor of everything was infected many years ago."}, {"time": 717, "text": "So it's easier to steal than to build from scratch."}, {"time": 721, "text": "So it's easier to sort of break into somebody else's thing and steal their proteins."}, {"time": 727, "text": "My colleague, Dixon de Palmier, calls viruses safe crackers."}, {"time": 731, "text": "Safe crackers."}, {"time": 732, "text": "So it's just, from an evolutionary perspective, it's easier to steal because you can select."}, {"time": 740, "text": "But then you have to figure out mechanisms for stealing, for breaking into, for cracking the state."}, {"time": 745, "text": "Well, you don't have to figure out."}, {"time": 746, "text": "It just happens, right?"}, {"time": 748, "text": "Because molecules are so diverse that a molecule gets into a cell and if there's a protein that sticks to it, it's gonna stick and that gives an advantage."}, {"time": 759, "text": "There's no planning."}, {"time": 761, "text": "There's no thinking about it, right?"}, {"time": 764, "text": "Oh, we'll return to that."}, {"time": 766, "text": "Ha ha ha ha ha."}, {"time": 768, "text": "What, but these numbers are crazy."}, {"time": 770, "text": "So what, as these more complex organisms evolved, let's take us humans as an example, should we be afraid of these high numbers?"}, {"time": 781, "text": "Should we be worried that there's so many viruses in the world?"}, {"time": 785, "text": "Well, to a certain extent."}, {"time": 786, "text": "I mean, they have, it's twofold."}, {"time": 788, "text": "They're good and bad, right?"}, {"time": 789, "text": "Viruses are no, there was no question they can be bad."}, {"time": 792, "text": "We know that because they've infected and caused disease throughout history, but we're also, you and I are full of viruses that don't hurt us at all and probably help us and every organism is the same."}, {"time": 802, "text": "So they are clearly beneficial as a consequence."}, {"time": 805, "text": "So I think, so every living thing on the planet has multiple viruses infecting everything you can see."}, {"time": 815, "text": "And most of them I think we don't worry about because they can't infect us."}, {"time": 821, "text": "They're unable."}, {"time": 822, "text": "In fact, now you can actually take your feces and send them to a company and they will sequence your viruses in your feces for you, your fecal virome, right?"}, {"time": 832, "text": "And the most common virus in human feces is a plant virus that infects peppers."}, {"time": 840, "text": "It's called pepper model mosaic virus."}, {"time": 843,

fields."}, {"time": 850, "text": "We eat them, they just pass us."}, {"time": 853, "text": "So I think most of the viruses we don't need to worry about except when we're talking about species that are closest to us, mammals, of course."}, {"time": 863, "text": "And I think the most numerous ones are the most concerning, they're viruses like bats."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Bats are 20% of mammals

to people, no question about it."}, {"time": 882, "text": "So there's a proximity in terms of just living together and a proximity genetically too."}, {"time": 886, "text": "So it's more likely that a virus will jump from a bat and a rodent."}, {"time": 889, "text": "And birds too."}, {"time": 890, "text": "Birds can give us their viruses that's happened."}, {"time": 893, "text": "Influenza viruses come from birds mainly."}, {"time": 897, "text": "So I think those are the three species, not species, it's higher than species obviously, but those are the three I would worry about in terms of getting their viruses."}, {"time": 905, "text": "And we don't really know what's out there, right?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "We have very little clue about what viruses, and I've for years wanted to capture wild mice in my backyard and see what viruses they have because no one knows."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And it's an easy."}, {"time": 921, "text": "We can't ask them, so you mean map, like is there a way?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "I can't ask them, yeah."}, {"time": 925, "text": "No, I would have to sacrifice them and take tissue and then bring it in the lab and do genome sequencing."},

run it past the database."}, {"time": 949, "text": "The gold standard is the GenBank database which is maintained here in the US."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And you see if you get any hits."}, {"time": 956, "text": "And then you can say, ah, look, this sequence is similar to this virus."}, {"time": 961, "text": "And you can classify all the viruses you see."}, {"time": 963, "text": "The problem is 90% of your sequence is dark matter."}, {"time": 969, "text": "It doesn't hit with anything."}, {"time": 971, "text": "It's probably a lot of it is unknown viruses."}, {"time": 974, "text": "And that's gonna be hard to figure out because someone's gonna have to go after it and sort it through."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So yes, you can find a lot of viruses and the numbers you get are astounding."}, {"time": 982, "text": "You can find thousands of new viruses just by looking in various life forms."}, {"time": 988, "text": "But there are many more that we don't pick up because

don't know if you've been paying attention to that."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "With them DeepMind solving the protein folding problem and then also releasing, first of all, open sourcing the code,

releasing that data."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "On the side of, because you're saying there's dark matter."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "Is there something, first, what are your general thoughts, level of excitement about their work?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And second, how can that be applied to viruses?"}, {"time": 1039, "text": "Do you think we'll be able to explore the dark matter of virology using machine learning?"}, {"time": 1045, "text": "Because in all this dark sequence, you can translate it and make a protein."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "You can see what a protein looks like."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "It has what we call an open reading frame, right?"}, {"time": 1054, "text": "A start and a stop."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "And right now it's just a bunch of amino acids, but if we could fold it, maybe the fold would be like something we already know, some protein fold, which gives you a lot of clues, right?"}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Because there are only so many protein folds in biology and that dark matter is probably one of them."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "So I think that's very exciting because for years, I've followed structural biologists for years and in the beginning, we couldn't even solve structures of viruses, they're too big."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "We could do small molecules like myoglobin, that was the first one done, took years to do that."},

crystals of the virus, right?"}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And now we can do cryo electron microscopy, which is much faster."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "You could solve, the spike of SARS COVID 2 was solved in two months by Jason McClelland here in Austin actually at the beginning of the pandemic, but you're limited, you can't do huge proteins."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "You can only do moderately sized ones."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "So, or actually you can do viruses, but you can't do small proteins."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "So that's speeded it up, but it's still too fast to solve."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "You get a new protein, you wanna solve its structure."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So if we could predict it, and I know from talking to structural biologists, this has been their holy grail from day one."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "They wanna be able to take a sequence of a protein, put it in a computer and have the structure put out without having to do all the experiment."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "So that's why this is very exciting that you can predict it."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "That mean it's not finished obviously, and there's more to do, but I think it will be a day where you could take any amino acid sequence and predict what it's gonna look like."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "See, but like aren't structural biologists gonna get greedy?"}, {"time": 1160, "text": "So once you have that, don't you wanna go more complicated then?"}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Don't you wanna go, because that's just the first step, right?"}, {"time": 1167, "text": "You go from amino acid to the structure, then there's like multiple protein interactions."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Like how do you get to the virus?"}, {"time": 1174, "text": "Well, so that's what the ultimate goal of getting a structure is that then you can do experiments and figure out what the structure means, right?"}, {"time": 1182, "text": "So many, in the old days, structural biology was a career in itself."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "You worked with people who had a system and just solve proteins for them, and then you moved on to another one."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "You didn't really do any experiments."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "The other people got to do all the interesting experiments."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "Now, young structural biologists are multifaceted."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "They solve the structure, and then they say, what happens if we change this amino acid?"}, {"time": 1206, "text": "Oh, look, it blocks binding to the receptor."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "This must be the receptor binding interface."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "So that's the exciting stuff, absolutely, is doing the experiment."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "Well, I wonder if you can do some kinds of like simulations of like, you know, different proteins or multi protein systems going to war against each other, like to try to figure out, you know, reinforcement learning is used in alpha zero, for example, to learn chess and go, and that's using the self play mechanism where the thing plays against itself and learns better and better."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Whether you can, I wonder if you can simulate almost evolution in that way for primitive biological systems, have them in simulation, fight each other, and then see what comes out, like a super dangerous virus comes out or super like Chuck Norris type of thing that defends against the super dangerous virus, and it's all in simulation."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So an example would be, we have all these variants of SARS COVID 2 arising, right?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "Which look to be selected by immune responses, but we know what amino acids are changing in the spike and how they block antibody binding."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "You could simulate that."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "You could say, what is the antibody looking at?"}, {"time": 1284, "text": "Where antibodies bind on proteins are called epitopes, right?"}, {"time": 1288, "text": "You could map them all and change them in a simulation one by one and go back and forth between the antibody and the virus."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So all these, evolution is what we call an arms race, right?"}, {"time": 1298, "text": "The virus changes and then it evades the host and then the host can change."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "The host takes longer to change though, unfortunately."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "It takes geological time, but it can."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "And then the virus can change and it can go back and forth."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "And we can see evidence of this in genome sequences of both viruses and their hosts."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And so you can take a protein in a host that is a receptor for multiple viruses and you can see all the impacts of virus pressure on it."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "And you could simulate that for sure."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And that's just one thing that you could do."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "You could simulate changes in say an enzyme that makes it resistant to a drug and predict all the drug resistance."},

would it be AI, I suppose?"}, {"time": 1359, "text": "Yeah, machine learning people."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "Machine learning people."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "And you would say, look, this is the biological problem."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "Is there a way we can use your tools to attack it?"}, {"time": 1366, "text": "The problem is those people are antisocial introverts that have a place

things."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "When you look at the full spectrum of things that can kill you, can you kind of paint a brief picture?"}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Yeah, I think the big picture is that the things that can kill you are a minority of everything that's out there."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "And we're talking about molecules."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "So we have in us proteins that

fever."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "And he said, where have you been?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And he can put two and two together."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "And so we let our listeners do that."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "And they all send in guesses."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "And it's wonderful to hear them go through this."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "So there are a lot of parasites that can get you."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "You have to be careful about eating when you go overseas."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "And water too?"}, {"time": 1684, "text": "Water as well."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "And in parts of Africa, there are parasites in the lakes that if you go swimming, they can invade you."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "And in fact, they can go into your hair follicles and burrow in and get into your bloodstream."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "So Daniel is interesting because he's very adventurous and he's not afraid of any of this."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "So there's a famous lake in Africa, Lake Malawi, which harbors a lot of these parasites."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "And he said, oh yeah, yeah, I just make sure I towel off vigorously when I get out and get rid of them."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "And that was the name of an episode."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "But food is, sushi, you can get worms from sushi."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "And the solution is to freeze it."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "And many sushi restaurants now have liquid nitrogen."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "They snap freeze their sushi and that kills all the parasites."}, {"time": 1733,

about, I'm so boring and bland that especially when I am now in Texas here and I've been eating quite a bit of barbecue, I realized I really haven't explored the culinary world."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And I've been curious to travel and taste different foods."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "Is there something you could say by way of advice, channeling Daniel, I guess, if you were to travel in the world, if eating is the thing that gets you the parasites, what's a good advice for eating in strange parts of the world, Mongolia, India, China?"}, {"time": 1781, "text": "Is there something you could say by way of advice?"}, {"time": 1783, "text": "I think Daniel would say, make sure your food is cooked, right?"}, {"time": 1787, "text": "Cooked, but that's so boring."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "Yeah, it's unfortunate."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "And he would agree with you because many vegetables are delicious."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "Salads even are delicious, not cooked, but they can have parasites in them."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "Meats, fish, people like to have uncooked fish."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "So if you wanna be really safe and boring, just make sure everything is cooked."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "And now we have a case this week on TWIP of a young man who went, I forgot where he went, but he stayed in a hotel."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "I think,

from that."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "The bottom line is most of these infections with parasites can be diagnosed, and you can be treated, and you'll be fine."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "So if you really wanna experience the cuisine, I don't think you should worry about it."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "That's what Daniel would say."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "Let's return to the basics."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "We can then jump around all over the place."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "What are the basic principles of virology?"}, {"time": 1858, "text": "Maybe a good place to start is what is a virus?"}, {"time": 1863, "text": "I mean, I talk in my first lecture for 20 minutes before I get to that."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "But, and I wonder if I should put it up front, but it's kind of a boring definition."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "So if you do that first, people will turn off."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "So first you tell them about all the millions and billions of viruses around."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "So a virus, we have a very specific definition because it's different from everything else on the planet."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Because first of all, it's a parasite."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "It takes, a parasite means you take something from someone else."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "We have human parasites who take money from others, right?"}, {"time": 1896, "text": "But in biological terms, a parasite takes something from the host that the host would otherwise use energy or some building block or something."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "There's never really a symbiotic relationship between a virus and a host."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "Well, there can be."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "So that's the dichotomy I think is that we define them as parasites, yet I just told you 20 minutes ago that many viruses are probably beneficial."}, {"time": 1921, "text": "So I think what it means is we, at some point we're gonna have to change our definition, right?"}, {"time": 1926, "text": "Because after all, definitions we make are just constructs that make it easy for us to study, that don't necessarily represent what's right."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "Yeah, like Pluto was a planet at first and now it's not a planet anymore and a lot of people are very upset."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "But it's only according to us."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "There may be another race living somewhere else who thinks it's a planet, right?"}, {"time": 1948, "text": "Well, maybe that's why viruses are attacking humans."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "They're very angry."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "They're calling them parasites."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "So right now our definition includes parasite because a virus cannot do anything without a cell."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "If this mug were full of viruses, it would not do anything for years."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "It would eventually probably lose its infectivity, but it's not gonna reproduce here, it needs cells."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "And to the first people who discovered viruses, that was astounding that they didn't just reproduce, divide on their own like bacteria."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "So a virus needs to get inside of a cell, inside the cell, it can't just hang around on the surface."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "It needs to get in in order to make more of itself."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "And so we call it an obligate intracellular parasite because it needs to get in a cell and then it takes things from the cell in the form of all kinds of molecules and processes and energy and so forth to make new viruses."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "Obligate means it's obligated to be inside the cell."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "Absolutely, it will not reproduce outside of the cell."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "So this mug of viruses can in no way be living, in my opinion."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "However, once it gets inside of a cell, now the cell is a virus infected cell, it's alive."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "So a virus, in my view, has two phases, right?"}, {"time": 2025, "text": "It's this nonliving particulate phase that everyone is used to."},

2035, "text": "Which, yes, definitely."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "You don't have to go with all this other stuff."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "Yeah, well, these are all mechanical."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "There's no biology here."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "So you wouldn't want a virus here?"}, {"time": 2042, "text": "No, I'd want a virus, of course."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "No, I'll send you one and then you can look at it."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "Because now that we have the three dimensional structures solved by structural biologists, we take the coordinates and we put it in a 3D printer and you can make amazing models, right?"}, {"time": 2058, "text": "Of any virus."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "And so there's a huge variety of viruses?"}, {"time": 2061, "text": "Huge, that we know of, which is only a fraction of what's out there."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "What's the categories?"}, {"time": 2065, "text": "So there's RNA, there's DNA viruses."}, {"time": 2067, "text": "What are those, what's DNA and RNA?"}, {"time": 2070, "text": "Two broad categorizations."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "RNA, these are genetic material."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "Can be two different

on the planet today is DNA based, except some viruses are RNA based."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "And that's because, as I mentioned earlier, the first life that arose on the planet was RNA based."},

opinion, are the most successful viruses, the RNA viruses."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "And SARS CoV2 is an RNA virus."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "We can talk about why they're so successful."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "But you have, broadly speaking, viruses with RNA, genetic information, which are relics."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "Of course, they're contemporary."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "They have

viruses and the SARS Coronaviruses, they get all the press and they're RNA based, because RNA lets you change more so than DNA."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "So they evolve much faster, the RNA viruses."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "Much faster."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "And in fact, I have an lecture on evolution."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "I don't know if you've listened to that one."},

that."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "They become conservative with the bureaucracies and all that kind of stuff, so they."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "And a lot of baggage."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "Yeah,

further."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "The nucleic acid is not naked."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "Because naked nucleic acid in the world isn't good."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "I mean, it existed in the

without the ability to do the mitochondria stuff."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "Some are, they don't have nuclei, they don't have mitochondria."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "But they do have a nucleic acid, they have a membrane, and then of course there's spikes in the membrane that allow them to attach to cells."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "And so that completes our two different kinds."}, {"time": 2333,

a couple of exceptions though."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "There are viruses of fungi and plants."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "So let's do the fungi."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "Fungi would be like yeast."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "The yeast cell wall is pretty hard to get through."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "So viruses typically don't attach to a yeast and get inside."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "Rather, they just live in the yeast forever."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "And they multiply as mostly nucleic acids, and as the yeast divide, they go into the daughter cells."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "And that's how they exist."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "Plant viruses, also the plant cell wall would be very hard to get across by binding a protein."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "So plant viruses get into plants either by pests that inject them in, they're sucking sap out, and they inject virus at the same time."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "Or farmers, they have contaminated farm equipment and they roll over the plants and introduces viruses."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "So those fungi and plant viruses, they don't have this specific receptor binding to get them into the cell."}, {"time": 2401,

"And so the virus slips in."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "I guess you'd call that a Trojan horse, right?"}, {"time": 2419, "text": "Trojan horse."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "It's so hard to not anthropomorphize this whole thing."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "It is hard."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "So obviously, they don't know any of this."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "It's not an actual Trojan horse."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "So they're not getting actually tricked in the way humans trick each other."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "No, it's all passive."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "And it's just through so many years of evolution, you select something that works, and it continues."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "And what survives then goes on with perhaps a slightly different approach."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "I love this idea of passive."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "Of course, according to Sam Harris, so for my sufficiently intelligent alien civilization observing humans, our behavior might seem passive too because they understand fully exactly what we're doing."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "And then there's no free will, and we're all just operating in the same way."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "A cell does, but just a much higher level of complexity."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "Yeah, so I love the distinction between active and passive."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "I mean, the point is, I think anthropomorphizing to a certain extent is fine because it helps people understand."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "But when you start to say, I think the virus is doing that because then you're putting a human lens on it, and you may be wrong."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "Because you don't know why things happen for a virus."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "So right now, we have variants emerging, and people say, well, I think it's because the antibodies are selecting for variants."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "That's a good idea, but it may not be the only thing that's going on."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "You start imagining them coming to the table negotiating."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "Yeah, you get into trouble with that."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "That's why I tell my students, be careful about the anthropomorphizing because you're gonna apply your values to a virus, and you have different values."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "You're a human, and you have, what you think is the reason for this outcome may not be right, that's all."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "Just be open minded about it."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "In both directions."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "I actually, one of the things that pushed back on this in the space of robotics, people, most people in robotics try to not anthropomorphize."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "For example, they don't give a gender or a name to robots."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "They really try to see it as a machine."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "And to me, that makes sense in one way, but it totally doesn't make sense in another."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "If that robot is to interact, operate in the human world and interact with humans, we have to anthropomorphize it in order to understand, as an engineering problem, how should it operate in a human world?"}, {"time": 2562, "text": "Now, the difference with viruses, the scale of operation, it doesn't make sense to treat them as humanlike because the scale of operations is much smaller."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "But with robots, you're in the same time scale, the same spatial scale."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "Of course, in the movies, they always give them names and personalities, right?"}, {"time": 2578, "text": "Yeah, well, yeah, that's the, but that's my argument is we should do the same when you're trying to solve the engineering problem of robotics too."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "It's not just for the movies."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "Well, let me ask you this, because you've said, controversially, not really, that viruses are not living."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "Defend yourself."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "Are viruses alive or not?"}, {"time": 2600, "text": "So I've seen many people say, oh, they have to be, they have nucleic acids, they evolve, they mutate."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "That's all true, but they don't do it on their own."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "The particles in my mug are just not doing any of that unless they get into a cell."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "So a virus infected cell is alive."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "I totally agree with that, because in fact, when a virus gets in a cell, it converts it into a virus making factory, if you will."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "It's no longer a cell."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "Some people call it a viro cell."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "I don't really like that, but it's fine."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "So that's what I'm talking about."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "The particle is not alive."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "You can have your virus infected cell as alive, but the particle, it just would not do anything forever without getting inside of a cell."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "But once it's in a cell, it is alive then, but it's no longer a particle."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "It's taken apart and nucleic acid is moving around the cell, it's making proteins."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "Eventually it makes new particles."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "And then those particles released from the cell, they're not living anymore."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "So it's kind of, I think it's kind of like a spore, a spore of a, or a seed."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "Although the seed just doesn't work because the seeds, the cells in the seed have the ability to make their own energy and so forth."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "But a bacterial spore, and it's the same thing, doesn't do anything unless you add water and nutrients and then it starts to divide."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "But it doesn't need to get into a cell."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "It's very different from a virus."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "So that's why the particle."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "And when people think of virus, they're always thinking of the particle."}, {"time": 2687,

cell, then it makes sense to be alive."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "And by the way, when you say particle, you're referring to that structure that you've been mentioning, some parts of the membrane and

transmissible, Ebola, rabies."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And then there's these less deadly viruses that are very transmissible, like COVID, I guess kind of borderline."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "But

cavity just above your mouth."}, {"time": 3687, "text": "So the virus reproduces really well."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "And then as you talk and sneeze and cough, you expel droplets and then those

you out but when it knocks you out, it really kills you?"}, {"time": 3730, "text": "That is a philosophical question, right?"}, {"time": 3733, "text": "Because we could talk about why we haven't observed it."}, {"time": 3736, "text": "I mean, one issue is that if you're killed too quickly by a highly lethal virus, you're not gonna transmit it very well, right?"}, {"time": 3747, "text": "So

lethal, you're simply not a good transmitter."}, {"time": 3782, "text": "And I think transmission is probably one of the most powerful selection forces for viruses because a virus always has to find a new host."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "If it doesn't, it's a startup that fails, right?"}, {"time": 3796, "text": "If it doesn't find a new host, it's gone."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "And so anything that makes the virus transmit better is gonna help it."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "And if killing you, being less lethal is part of that, that works too."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "So there's a strong selection pressure against being lethal."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "I think there's a strong selection pressure against being lethal and being more transmissible."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "Those two

the DNA, I put it into cells and out came polio."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "So that's the start."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "Now, since then everybody has taken that technique and used it for their

DNA?"}, {"time": 4668, "text": "Reverse transcription."}, {"time": 4669, "text": "That's reverse transcription."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "Oh, so you actually go through the process of reverse

out a gene."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "You see some genes in the sequence."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "I don't know what these genes do."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "Let's cut them out."}, {"time": 4756,

needed for the virus to reproduce, at least in cells, right?"}, {"time": 4767, "text": "Or maybe you take the gene out and you never get any virus, so it's lethal."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "Is there a nice systematic ways of doing this?"}, {"time": 4773, "text": "Do people kind of automate it?"}, {"time": 4776, "text": "And we, I mean, the problem with SARS, the COVID virus, is it's 30,000 bases, a lot of stuff there."}, {"time": 4784, "text": "And what makes it more difficult is that you have to, it's been classified as a BSL3 agent, biosafety level three."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "And so not everyone has a lab that's capable of doing that."}, {"time": 4798, "text": "So it limits the number of people who can do experiments."}, {"time": 4802, "text": "You know, we're lucky to have a few

to wear a suit and have to have special procedures and containment and so forth."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "So it makes it difficult to do basic experiments on the virus."}, {"time": 4820, "text":

4833, "text": "Because that doesn't require BSL3, so yes."}, {"time": 4836, "text": "So like building a vaccine requires you to figure out how, or antiviral drugs, how to attack various structural

target in the virus?"}, {"time": 4855, "text": "And there are a few things that make more sense than others."}, {"time": 4860, "text": "Usually we like to target enzymes."}, {"time": 4863, "text": "I don't know if you remember your biochemistry, but enzymes are catalytic."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "You don't need a lot of them to do a lot of things."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "So they're typically in low concentrations in a virus infected cell."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "So it's easier to inhibit them with a drug."}, {"time": 4877, "text": "And the coronas have a couple of enzymes that we can target."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "So you have to figure that out ahead of time and decide what to go after."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And then you can look for drugs that inhibit what you're interested in."}, {"time": 4888, "text": "It's not that hard to do."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "There's just something beautiful about biology, about the mechanisms of biology."}, {"time": 4896,

because you mentioned we should have done a lot more in terms of vaccine development, that kind of thing for coronaviruses."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "But if I were back then, from my understanding, the thing we should all be afraid of is influenza, like some strong variants coming out from that family."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "That seems like the one that will destroy human civilization or

kinds of RNA."}, {"time": 5022, "text": "They can have what we call plus RNA."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "They can have minus RNA, or they could have plus minus, actually two strands hybridized

virus particle."}, {"time": 5093, "text": "And then when the minus RNA is in the cell, the virus enzyme makes plus RNAs and those get translated."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "So it's a big

pieces."}, {"time": 5119, "text": "They're all packaged inside that virus particle of influenza virus, but they're in pieces."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "And why that's important is because if two

one."}, {"time": 5182, "text": "Some like the 1918 apparently was very lethal, killed a lot of people."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "But more contemporary viruses, we had a pandemic in 2009 of

funny that you put it in an egg."}, {"time": 5384, "text": "It's very poetic."}, {"time": 5386, "text": "And then how do you make it not infection, not effective or whatever?"}, {"time": 5393, "text": "Not infectious."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "Not infectious, is that the right term here?"}, {"time": 5397, "text": "So how do you make it not infectious?"}, {"time": 5398, "text": "You can treat it with any number of chemicals that'll disrupt the particle so it no longer infects."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "So that step of disrupting the particle is that very specific to a particular variant

technology."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "Okay, so what are, there's several things to ask."}, {"time": 5423, "text": "So you called it old school in a way that's slightly dismissive, like people talk about Windows 98 or something."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "So is there risks involved with it?"}, {"time": 5434, "text": "Or is it just difficult to produce large amounts?"}, {"time": 5437, "text": "No, it's only, it's, it's very easy."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "I mean, you could do it in cells and culture, but eggs were convenient."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "And in the 1940s, we didn't have cells and culture."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "We didn't know how to do that."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "So we had to use something else."}, {"time": 5449, "text": "It's easy to do, but the process of inactivating the virus with a chemical makes it not the best vaccine you can make."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "The flu vaccines that we have today, which are mostly based on this inactivation, is called inactivated virus vaccines."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "Oh, so like the kind of thing it presents to the immune system to train on is not close to the actual virus."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "Yes, that's what we think."}, {"time": 5480, "text": "So that's why probably the flu vaccines are just not very good, you know?"}, {"time": 5484, "text": "60% efficiency at the best, right?"},

you feel sick, give us a call."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "We'll tell you what to do."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "So yeah, I mean, what's sickness?"}, {"time": 5518, "text": "Sickness is the presence of symptoms?"}, {"time": 5521, "text": "So this is good time to say what a symptom is, okay?"}, {"time": 5524, "text": "A symptom is what you only can feel."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "Only you can feel an upset stomach or a sore throat or that sort of thing."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "It's the lived experience of a symptom."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "Whereas a sign is something that someone could measure and tell that you're infected, like virus in your nasopharynx or something else, right?"}, {"time": 5546, "text": "Signs and symptoms."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "And so in a vaccine trial, they tell you, well, if you have any of these symptoms, they give you a paper with the exact symptoms listed to make sure you're picking them up, right?"}, {"time": 5556, "text": "So for flu, it would probably be fever, sore throat, cough."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "You call them and then they will do a PCR, make sure you've got flu and not some other virus that makes similar symptoms."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "And then they would say, are you a vaccine or non vaccine arm and count up all the infections and see how the vaccine did, basically."}, {"time": 5577, "text": "That's so fascinating because the reporting, so symptom is what you feel."}, {"time": 5583, "text": "Yes, for sure."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "And certainly the mind has a ability to conjure up feelings."}, {"time": 5591, "text": "And so like culturally, maybe there was a time in our culture where it was looked down upon to feel sick or something like that, like toughen up kind of thing."}, {"time": 5605, "text": "And so then you probably have very few symptoms being reported."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "And now is like much more, I don't know, perhaps you're much more likely to report symptoms."}, {"time": 5617, "text": "Now it's fascinating because then it changes."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "Oh, it is definitely a perception because for, your symptom may be nothing to me or vice versa, right?"}, {"time": 5626, "text": "And so when you're doing this, it's a little bit of a imprecise science because, and even it's a cultural thing in some countries, something that would make us feel horrible, they wouldn't even bother reporting."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "No, I didn't have any symptoms."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "So it's a little bit imprecise and it clouds the results."}, {"time": 5643, "text": "So if you can measure things, it's always better, but you start out with a symptom."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "And if you say, if someone tells you this virus, 20% of the people are asymptomatic, they don't report symptoms, that number is probably not a constant."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "It depends where you did the study."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "It could be different in China versus South America, Europe, et cetera, yeah."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "I mean, I was trying to figure, so I took two shots of the Pfizer vaccine and I had zero symptoms."}, {"time": 5675, "text": "So, and I was wondering, well, see, but that's my feelings, right?"}, {"time": 5678, "text": "This is not, because I felt fine, I was waiting."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "Did you have pain at the injection site?"}, {"time": 5686, "text": "No, it was kind of pleasant."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "You felt nothing the next day, no?"}, {"time": 5690, "text": "Nothing, no tiredness, no exhaustion, no."}, {"time": 5694, "text": "But see, like I have an insane sleeping schedule."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "I already put myself through crazy stuff."}, {"time": 5699, "text": "That said, maybe I was expecting something really bad."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "Like I was waiting and therefore didn't feel it."}, {"time": 5706, "text": "But I also got allergy shots and those, I was out all next day, like exhausted for some reason."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "So that gave me like a sense like, okay, at least sometimes I can feel shitty."}, {"time": 5722, "text": "That's good to know."}, {"time": 5725, "text": "And then with the vaccine it didn't, but the question is like, how much does my mind come into play there?"}, {"time": 5732, "text": "The expectations of symptoms, the expectations of not feeling well, how does that affect the sort of the self reporting of the symptoms?"}, {"time": 5742, "text": "I think it's definitely a variable there, but there's certainly many people that don't feel anything after the vaccines."}, {"time": 5748, "text": "And there's some that have a whole range of things like soreness and fever, et cetera, yeah."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "So okay, you were talking about the old school development inside the egg."}, {"time": 5759, "text": "What's better than that?"}, {"time": 5762, "text": "So then the next generation of vaccines which arose in the 50s were what we call replication competent, where the virus you take and it's actually reproducing in you."}, {"time": 5773, "text": "Yeah, that sounds safe."}, {"time": 5776, "text": "And it can be somewhat problematic, yes, as you might imagine, because once you put that virus in you, you have no more control, right?"}, {"time": 5784, "text": "It's not like you have a kill switch in it, which actually would be a great idea to put in."}, {"time": 5789, "text": "Like nanobots, what can possibly go wrong?"}, {"time": 5792, "text": "No, you could just put something in there."}, {"time": 5794, "text": "If you added a drug, you would shut it off, right?"}, {"time": 5797, "text": "And people are thinking about that because now we're engineering viruses to treat cancers and other diseases and we may wanna put kill switches in them just to make sure they don't run away."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "Oh, interesting, so you can deploy a drug that binds to this virus that would shut it off in the body, something like that."}, {"time": 5816, "text": "Something like that, yeah, that would be the idea."}, {"time": 5818, "text": "You'd have to engineer it in."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "Anyway, these were, the first one was yellow fever vaccine that was made because that was a big problem."}, {"time": 5826, "text": "And this virus, and the way you do this, back in the old day was empirical."}, {"time": 5832, "text": "So Max Tyler, who did the yellow fever vaccine, he took the virus, which is a human virus, right?"}, {"time": 5839, "text": "And he infected, I think he used chick embryos."}, {"time": 5844, "text": "And he went from one embryo to another and just kept passing and he did that hundreds of times."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "And every 10 passages, he would take the virus and put it in a mouse or a monkey, whatever his model was."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "And then eventually he got a virus that didn't cause any disease after 200 and some passages."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "And then that was tested in people and it became the yellow fever vaccine that we use today."}, {"time": 5866, "text": "He selected for mutations that made the virus not cause disease, but still make an immune response."}, {"time": 5875, "text": "So those are called replication competent."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "We now have the polio vaccine, which was developed in the 50s after the yellow fever."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "Then we had measles, mumps, rubella."}, {"time": 5885, "text": "Those are all replication competent vaccines."}, {"time": 5889, "text": "And you mentioned is that's a good idea."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "They are all safe vaccines."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "The only one that has had an issue is the polio replication competent vaccine."}, {"time": 5901, "text": "It was called Sabin vaccine or oral polio virus vaccine because you take it orally, it's wonderful because you don't have to inject it."}, {"time": 5911, "text": "This is the perfect delivery."}, {"time": 5914, "text": "Either intranasal for a respiratory virus or orally for polio goes into your intestines."}, {"time": 5919, "text": "It reproduces and it gives you wonderful protection against polio."}, {"time": 5925, "text": "However, you do shed virus out and that virus is no longer a vaccine."}, {"time": 5932, "text": "It's reverted genetically in your intestine."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "So you can infect others with polio."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "Take that virus and put it into an animal and give it polio."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "And in fact, the parents of some kids in the 60s and 70s who were immunized got polio from the vaccine."}, {"time": 5948, "text": "The rate was about one and one and a half million cases of polio."}, {"time": 5953, "text": "So it's called vaccine associated polio."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "And I always argue that we may not have picked the right vaccine."}, {"time": 5961, "text": "There was a big fight in the US and other countries between the inactivated polio and the infectious polio vaccines, which ones we should be using because we found out that the infectious vaccine actually caused polio."}, {"time": 5975, "text": "And eight to 10 kids a year in the US alone got polio from the vaccine, which looking back is really not acceptable in my view, although the public health community said it was to get rid of polio."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "So now we're close to eradicating polio globally, but this vaccine derived polio is a problem."}, {"time": 5995, "text": "So now we have to go back to the inactivated vaccine, which is tough because it's injected."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "So, okay, so the basic high level, how vaccines work principle is you want to deploy something in the body that's as close to the actual virus as possible, but doesn't do nearly as much harm."}, {"time": 6015, "text": "And there's like a million, not a million, but there's a bunch of ways you could possibly do that."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "So those are two ways."}, {"time": 6020, "text": "And now of course we have modern ways we can make mRNA vaccines, right?"}, {"time": 6025, "text": "What are the modern ways?"}, {"time": 6026, "text": "I did, you wanna look, mRNA vaccine."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "So that's one of the, that's the most modern, but even before mRNA vaccines, we learned that we could use viruses to deliver proteins from a virus that you wanna prevent."}, {"time": 6041, "text": "And so the Ebola vaccine, we took the spike gene of Ebola virus and put it in a different virus and we deliver that to people and that's called a vector vaccine."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "And some of the COVID vaccines are vectors of different kinds of most famous are adenovirus vectors carrying the spike gene into the cell."}, {"time": 6060, "text": "Can you explain how the vector vaccine works again?"}, {"time": 6063, "text": "So we have, we take a virus that will infect humans but will not make you sick."}, {"time": 6071, "text": "In the case of adenovirus, the years and years of people studying it has told us what genes you could cut out and allow the virus to infect the cell but not cause any disease."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "So instead of doing selection on it, you actually genetically modify it."}, {"time": 6087, "text": "Yes, you modify the vector, yeah."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "So you're much more precise about it."}, {"time": 6090, "text": "You're very precise and then you splice in the gene for the spike and then you use that to deliver the gene and it becomes produced as protein and then you make an immune response."}, {"time": 6100, "text": "And vector is the term for this modified."}, {"time": 6103, "text": "Right, so we're now using viruses at our bidding."}, {"time": 6107, "text": "We're using them as vectors, not just for vaccines."}, {"time": 6110, "text": "We can cure monogenic diseases."}, {"time": 6112, "text": "That is if you have, if you're born with a genetic disease, you have a deletion or a mutation in a gene, single gene, we can give you the regular gene back using a virus vector."}, {"time": 6123, "text": "So cancers too, we can cure cancers with vectors."}, {"time": 6130, "text": "I think in 10 to 15 years, most cancers will be treatable with viruses, yeah."}, {"time": 6136, "text": "And not only can we put things in the vector to kill the tumor, we can target the vector to the tumor specifically in a number of ways."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "And that makes it less toxic, right?"}, {"time": 6148, "text": "It doesn't infect all your other cells."}, {"time": 6151, "text": "But it takes time to develop a vector for a particular thing because it requires a deep understanding."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "Yeah, in fact, we have about a dozen different virus vectors that have been studied for 20 years."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "And those are the set of vaccine vectors that we're using."}, {"time": 6166, "text": "So it includes adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, which is a cousin of rabies, but doesn't make people sick."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "Influenza virus is being used as a vector and even measles virus."}, {"time": 6180, "text": "So we're familiar with how to modify those to be vectors and those are being used for COVID vaccines."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "And then of course we have the newest, which is the nucleic acid vaccines."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "So years ago, people said, why can't we just inject DNA into people?"}, {"time": 6198, "text": "Take the spike and put it in a DNA and inject it."}, {"time": 6202, "text": "So people tried many, many different vaccines."}, {"time": 6205, "text": "And in fact, there are no human licensed vaccines that are DNA vaccines."}, {"time": 6209, "text": "Although there is a West Nile vaccine for horses that's a DNA based vaccine."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "So if you have a horse, you can give it this vaccine, but no human."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "Can you clarify, does a DNA vaccine only work for DNA viruses?"}, {"time": 6224, "text": "No, it can work for DNA or RNA."}, {"time": 6226, "text": "Because remember, for an RNA virus, we can make a DNA copy of it."}, {"time": 6230, "text": "And it will still, when you put that DNA in a cell, it goes into the nucleus."}, {"time": 6236, "text": "So it's, you're just skipping a step."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "You get proteins."}, {"time": 6239, "text": "For RNA vaccines, you're giving, okay, I got it."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "So those didn't work for human vaccines."}, {"time": 6244, "text": "And there were many HIV AIDS vaccine trials that used DNA vaccines, didn't work."}, {"time": 6250, "text": "And then a number of years ago, people started thinking, how about RNA, RNA vaccines?"}, {"time": 6257, "text": "And I first heard this, I thought, what?"}, {"time": 6260, "text": "I've worked with RNA my whole career."}, {"time": 6262,

have to be very careful because your hands are full of enzymes that will degrade RNA."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "So I thought, how could this possibly work, injecting it into someone's?"}, {"time": 6280, "text": "It's an example of I was skeptical and I was wrong."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "It turns out that if you modify the RNA properly and protect it in a lipid capsule, it actually works as a vaccine."}, {"time": 6292, "text": "And people were working on this years before COVID came around."}, {"time": 6297, "text": "They were doing experimental mRNA vaccines and there were a couple of companies that were working on it."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "And so at the beginning of 2020, they said, let's try it."}, {"time": 6307, "text": "And I was skeptical, frankly, because I just thought RNA would be too labile, but I was wrong."}, {"time": 6313, "text": "So this is, as we're saying offline, one of the great things about you is you're able to say when you're wrong about intuitions you've had in the past, which is a beautiful thing for a scientist."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "But I still think it's very surprising that something like that works, right?"}, {"time": 6330, "text": "Yeah, I am surprised."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "So you're just launching RNA in a protective membrane."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "And then now one thing is surprising that the RNA sort of lasts long enough in its structure."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "But then the other thing is why does it work that that's a good training ground for the immune system?"}, {"time": 6356, "text": "Is that obvious that that should work?"}, {"time": 6359, "text": "I don't think it's obvious to most people and it's worth going into it because it's really interesting."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "I mean, first of all, they wrap the RNA in fats, in lipid membranes, right?"}, {"time": 6370, "text": "And the particular formulation they test for years to make sure it's stable, it lasts a long time after it's injected."}, {"time": 6377, "text": "And the two companies that make the current COVID vaccines, right, Moderna and Pfizer, they have different lipid formulations to get to the same."}, {"time": 6386, "text": "So that's a real part of it."}, {"time": 6389, "text": "And it's not simple."}, {"time": 6390, "text": "There are quite a few different lipids that they put into this coding."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "And they test to see how long they protect the RNA after it's injected, say, into a mouse, how long does it last?"}, {"time": 6400, "text": "And the way it works is these, apparently these lipid nanoparticles, they get injected into your muscle, they bump into cells and they get taken up."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "So lipid fat is sticky."}, {"time": 6416, "text": "It's greasy, we like to say."}, {"time": 6419, "text": "And so your cells are covered with a greasy membrane also."}, {"time": 6423, "text": "So when these lipid nanoparticles bump into them, they stick and they eventually get taken up."}, {"time": 6428, "text": "And they figured this out right at the beginning."}, {"time": 6431, "text": "If we put RNA in a lipid nanoparticle, will it get taken up into a cell?"}, {"time": 6435, "text": "And the answer was yes, it was just let's try it."}, {"time": 6437, "text": "And it worked."}, {"time": 6438, "text": "So it's basically experiment."}, {"time": 6440, "text": "It's not like some deep understanding of biology."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "It's experimentally speaking, it just seems to work."}, {"time": 6445, "text": "Yeah, well, they had some idea that lipids would target this to a cell membrane."}, {"time": 6450, "text": "And remember, there's no receptor involved."}, {"time": 6453, "text": "Like the virus has a specific protein that attaches to a receptor."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "It's not efficient enough to just bump around and get into a cell."}, {"time": 6463, "text": "That's what these things are doing."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "And they probably optimize the lipids to get more efficient uptake."}, {"time": 6469, "text": "But it's not as efficient as a virus would be to get into a cell."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "Right, so you have no specific, I mean, which is why it's surprising that you can crack into the safe with a hammer."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "Or with some fat."}, {"time": 6486, "text": "I mean, that's kind of surprising."}, {"time": 6488, "text": "It's kind of amazing that it works."}, {"time": 6491, "text": "But so maybe let's try to talk about this."}, {"time": 6497, "text": "So one of the hesitancies around vaccines or basically around any new technology is the fact that mRNA is a new idea."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "And it's an idea that was shrouded in some skepticism, as you said, by the scientific community."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "Because it's a cool new technology."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "Surprising that it works."}, {"time": 6524, "text": "I think one nice way to approach this is try to play devil's advocate and say both sides."}, {"time": 6533, "text": "One side is why your intuition says that it's safe for humans."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "And what arguments can you see if you could steal man and argument why it's unsafe for humans."}, {"time": 6546, "text": "Or not unsafe for humans, but the hesitancy to take an mRNA vaccine is justified."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "So many people are afraid because it's new technology and they feel it hasn't been tested."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "I mean, in theory, what could go wrong?"}, {"time": 6565, "text": "This is the nice thing about mRNA is that it doesn't last forever."}, {"time": 6572, "text": "As opposed to DNA, which doesn't last forever, but it can last a lot longer."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "And it could even go into your DNA, right?"}, {"time": 6581, "text": "So mRNA has a shorter lifetime, maybe days after it's injected into your arm, then it's gone."}, {"time": 6588, "text": "So that's a good thing because it's not gonna be around forever."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "So that would say, okay, so it's sticking around for your lifetime is not happening."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "But what else could happen?"}, {"time": 6600, "text": "Well, let's see the protein that's made, could that be an issue?"}, {"time": 6605, "text": "And again, proteins don't last forever."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "They have a finite longevity in the body."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "And this one also lasts perhaps at the best a few weeks."}, {"time": 6617, "text": "Now this is a protein that's made after the RNA gets into the cell."}, {"time": 6622, "text": "Yeah, so the lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell and the mRNA is translated and you get protein made."}, {"time": 6627, "text": "And there's also a question, I'm sorry to interrupt, where in the body, so because it's not well targeted, or I don't know if it's supposed to be targeted, but it can go throughout the body, that's one of the concerns."}, {"time": 6640, "text": "Right, so it's injected deep into your deltoid muscle, right here, shoulder."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "And the idea is not to put it in a blood vessel, otherwise it would then for sure circulate everywhere."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "So they go deep in a blood vessel and it's locally injected."}, {"time": 6657, "text": "And they did, before this even went into people, they did experiments in mice where they gave them a thousand times higher concentrations than they would ever give to people."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "And then when you do that, it can go everywhere basically."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "You can find these nanoparticles in every tissue of the mouse."}, {"time": 6674, "text": "But that's at a thousand fold higher concentration, right?"}, {"time": 6677, "text": "So I think at the levels that we're using in people, most of it's staying in the muscle, but sure, small amounts go elsewhere."}, {"time": 6685, "text": "Could there be a lot of harm caused if it goes elsewhere?"}, {"time": 6690, "text": "Like let's say ridiculously high quantities."}, {"time": 6693, "text": "I'm trying to understand what is the damage that could be done from an RNA just floating about."}, {"time": 6699, "text": "So the RNA itself is not gonna be a problem, it's the protein that is encoded in it, right?"}, {"time": 6703, "text": "This is a viral RNA which has no sequence in us, so there's nothing that it could do."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "It's the protein that I would say you could ask, what is that gonna do?"}, {"time": 6716, "text": "And the one property we know about the spike is that it can cause fusion of cells, right?"}, {"time": 6726, "text": "That's how the virus gets in in the beginning."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "The spike attaches to the cell by this H2 receptor and it causes the virus and the cell to fuse."}, {"time": 6739, "text": "And that's how the RNA gets out of the particle."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "But so wait, I'm a bit confused."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "So with this mRNA vaccine with the lipids and the RNA, there's no spike, right?"}, {"time": 6750, "text": "The mRNA codes for the spike."}, {"time": 6753, "text": "Oh, the mRNA codes, so it creates the spike."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "Creates a spike."}, {"time": 6756, "text": "And so that spike could cause fusion of cells."}, {"time": 6759, "text": "Yes, except they modified the spike so it wouldn't."}, {"time": 6765, "text": "They made two amino acid changes in the spike so it would not fuse."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "So they understand enough which amino acids are responsible for the fusion."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "So they could modify it."}, {"time": 6774, "text": "So now it's not gonna cause fusion, so that's not an issue."}, {"time": 6777, "text": "It's called the prefusion stabilized spike."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "So the spike, when it binds ACE2, that top falls off and the part of the spike that causes fusion is now exposed."}, {"time": 6789, "text": "And that doesn't happen in this mRNA vaccine."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "So those are the things that could have happened, but I think they're ruled out by what we've just said."}, {"time": 6798, "text": "But there's no better test than putting it into people, right?"}, {"time": 6802, "text": "And doing phase one, phase two, and phase three, and increasing numbers of people and asking, what do we see?"}, {"time": 6808, "text": "Do we have any concerns?"}, {"time": 6810, "text": "And so now it's been in many millions of people and we don't see most of the effects you see in a vaccine, you see in the first couple of months."}, {"time": 6823, "text": "Things like the myocarditis with some of the vaccines, the clotting issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine, Guillain Barre, you see those relatively quickly."}, {"time": 6834, "text": "And we've seen small numbers of those occur, but other things we haven't seen, and you never say never, right?"}, {"time": 6844, "text": "Right, so I mean, this is fascinating, right?"}, {"time": 6847, "text": "It's like I drink, I put Splenda in my coffee and it has supposedly no calories, but it tastes really good."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "And despite what like rumors and blogs and so on, I have not seen good medical evidence that is harmful to you, but it's like, it tastes too good."}, {"time": 6873, "text": "So I'm thinking like, there's gotta be longterm consequences, but it's very difficult to understand what the longterm consequences are."}, {"time": 6883, "text": "And there's this kind of like distant fear or anxiety about it."}, {"time": 6889, "text": "Like this thing tastes too good, it's too good to be true."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "There's gotta be, there's no free lunch in this world."}, {"time": 6895, "text": "This is the kind of feeling that people have about the longterm effects of the vaccine, that you mentioned that there's some intuition about near term effects that you want to remove, like the diffusion of cells and all those kinds of things, but they think, okay, this travels to other cells in the body, this travels to neurons or that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6918, "text": "And then what kind of effect does that have longterm that's yet to be discovered?"}, {"time": 6922, "text": "What do you make me for this vaccine, but in general in science about making statements about longterm negative effects?"}, {"time": 6932, "text": "Is that something that weighs heavy on you?"}, {"time": 6934, "text": "Is that something we can kind of escape through just large scale experimentation with animals and humans?"}, {"time": 6941, "text": "Well, if you're really, if you're concerned about longterm, then you have to do a longterm experiment, right?"}, {"time": 6946, "text": "And maybe you don't see something for 50, 60 years."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "So if someone says to you, there are no longterm effects of the COVID vaccines, they can't say that because they haven't done the long experiment, right?"}, {"time": 6960, "text": "There's always the possibility, but you have to weigh it."}, {"time": 6962, "text": "It's always, there's no free lunch, right?"}, {"time": 6966, "text": "There's always a risk benefit calculation you have to make."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "You can have the study, it goes 50 years and

right."}, {"time": 6986, "text": "The vaccine versus the effects of the virus."}, {"time": 6991, "text": "And like both of them, you don't know longterm effects, but you're building up intuition as you study, which what are the longterm effects?"}, {"time": 7001, "text": "Like there's a huge number of people, like that have like, I don't want to say experts because I don't like the word, but

studies."}, {"time": 7020, "text": "But you start to build up an intuition of what might be a problem down the line and what is not, biologically speaking."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "And so given that

7044, "text": "So the cognitive stuff is terrifying."}, {"time": 7047, "text": "All kinds of systems evolve, yes."}, {"time": 7048, "text": "And then you look at the same thing with the vaccine and

think that's highly unlikely."}, {"time": 7448, "text": "I think for the most part, the FDA requires the release of all the clinical trial data, right?"}, {"time": 7454, "text": "So, okay, so this clinical trial data, that's one thing."}, {"time": 7457, "text": "So that's the data that we should be focusing on, right?"}, {"time": 7460, "text": "So there's a lot of different data sets here."},

here."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "So there's a lot of money to be made by makers of the vaccine."}, {"time": 7496, "text": "So for these companies, and obviously there's a distrust of those folks

inducing immunity."}, {"time": 9775, "text": "Now, what happened last year was at the beginning of 2020, very few people in the world were immune as the virus first started spreading."}, {"time": 9785, "text": "But you can see in the sequences of those isolates from the beginning of 2020, you can see all of the changes that are now present in the variants of concern at very, very low frequencies."}, {"time": 9797, "text": "They were already there, but there was no selection for them to emerge."}, {"time": 9801, "text": "Until November, when we now had many millions of people who had mostly been infected, but also some vaccinated, then we saw the alpha variant emerge in England, probably because of immune selection."}, {"time": 9815, "text": "Now, the virus that had the change

antigenic selection."}, {"time": 9827, "text": "So the variants, the mutations that are at the core of these, quote unquote, variants, they were always there all along the vaccine, or the infections

mean, it could make things much worse or much better, and we don't know."}, {"time": 9868, "text": "Well, with flu, we see year after year the virus changes, we change the vaccine, we deal with it, we change it again, there's an unending series."}, {"time": 9875, "text": "But see, that's a very different story."}, {"time": 9877, "text": "If, do you think COVID will be with some likelihood, like the

vaccine that makes you immune to enough variants where there's not enough evolutionary room."}, {"time": 9907, "text": "Well, if you cut down the number of infections, then you reduce the diversity,

you from dying."}, {"time": 9930, "text": "So that's why it still makes sense to use vaccines because they prevent you from dying."}, {"time": 9936, "text": "That's the bottom line."}, {"time": 9938, "text": "But can we ever make a vaccine that deals with all variants?"}, {"time": 9945, "text": "And the reason I say that is because people who get naturally infected with SARS COVID, they develop

better than people who've gotten two doses of vaccine."}, {"time": 9970, "text": "For some reason, their immune response is suddenly broadened after the infection vaccination, and they can handle all the variants that we know of so far."}, {"time": 9979, "text": "So that tells me we can devise a strategy to do the same thing with a vaccine that makes a really broad vaccine that'll handle all the variants."}, {"time": 9987, "text": "Well, you actually, on the virology blog, I don't know if you're the author of that, but."}, {"time": 9992, "text": "I am, I am, yes."}, {"time": 9993, "text":

yeah."}, {"time": 10004, "text": "Yeah, it's an interesting idea that there's some early evidence now that mixing and matching vaccines, like one shot of Pfizer and one of like Moderna or something, that creates a much better immunity than does two shots of Pfizer."}, {"time": 10022, "text": "I think that's worth exploring, absolutely."}, {"time": 10025, "text": "And this is relevant, what we're doing with influenza, you know, instead of having to vaccinate people every year, why can't we devise a vaccine which you'd get once in your lifetime or maybe once every 10 years, okay?"}, {"time": 10037, "text": "So the spike of influenza, it's a long protein, kind of like the spike of SARS CoV2, it's stuck in the virus membrane, and the very tip, that's the part that changes every year."},

prevent infection."}, {"time": 10061, "text": "It's just that when people are infected or with the current vaccines, they don't make many antibodies to that stem part, but we're trying to figure out how to make those and we think they would be broadly protective and you'd never be able to, or more rarely be able to have a variant emerge that escaped it."}, {"time": 10080, "text": "And I think we can do the same thing with coronavirus too, for sure."}, {"time": 10086, "text": "Can I ask you about testing?"}, {"time": 10090, "text": "You mentioned PCR, what kind of tests are there?"}, {"time":

the way involves reverse transcriptase because it converts the viral RNA to DNA and then you amplify it."}, {"time": 10154, "text": "And you can specify what part of the viral RNA you wanna amplify

viral RNA loads, right?"}, {"time": 10172, "text": "And a common mistake that many people who should know better, physicians and scientists of all kinds, they think that indicates how much virus you have."}, {"time": 10185, "text": "It's a diagnostic of whether you have bits of RNA in you and it probably means you're infected."}, {"time": 10191, "text": "But you can't use it to shed light on what's going on and I'll tell you why in a bit."}, {"time": 10196, "text": "But first we have to explain some other things."}, {"time": 10201, "text": "So until you get to about a million copies of RNA, so you can measure the copy number in this test, this PCR test."}, {"time": 10210, "text": "It's a number called CT or cycle threshold."}, {"time": 10213, "text": "The test, the way the machine works, it goes through cycles and every cycle it amplifies what you put in and the more cycles you need to see something, that means there's not a lot of RNA there."}, {"time": 10226, "text": "So if you do a test and you have a cycle threshold of 35, you have very little RNA in you."}, {"time": 10233, "text": "Contrary, if you have a cycle threshold of 10, you have a ton of RNA and it only took 10 cycles to detect it."}, {"time": 10240, "text": "And you can extrapolate from that number, the number of copies you have per sample, say per swab."}, {"time": 10246, "text": "And if you don't have a million, you're not infectious."}, {"time": 10249, "text": "You're not gonna infect anyone."}, {"time": 10250, "text": "So in the early days, no matter what CT, what PCR result you had, they would quarantine you."}, {"time": 10256, "text": "And that was wrong because you're not shedding."}, {"time": 10258, "text": "You don't need to be quarantined, but wasn't thought through properly, right?"},

normal infection."}, {"time": 10271, "text": "Now it's 10 days should be fine."}, {"time": 10274, "text": "So what happens is you get infected, you don't know it of course."}, {"time": 10277, "text":

asymptomatic."}, {"time": 10288, "text": "You're shedding, you can infect others."}, {"time": 10290, "text": "And then you may or may not have your symptom onset."}, {"time": 10293, "text": "So you shed for a couple of days before symptom onset."}, {"time": 10296, "text": "And then within three days, four days, the viral RNA crashes and you're no longer shedding, you're no longer transmitting."}, {"time": 10302, "text": "So that's the one kind of test we have."}, {"time": 10304, "text": "It can tell you if you're infected at the moment, but it won't tell you if you're gonna be

positive."}, {"time": 10369, "text": "Well, if it's cheap enough, you just take another test because they have a certain error frequency."}, {"time": 10373, "text": "If it's positive twice, you stay

idea and it would have changed the whole situation for sure."}, {"time": 10493, "text": "If it could have been made when we talked to him last spring, I think, or summer, we would have gotten around a lot of the issues that we're in today because I think people would have stayed home and not transmitted."}, {"time": 10504, "text": "And I think it's still valuable to this day."}, {"time": 10506,

one, it was flawed."}, {"time": 10527, "text": "They had to recall the kits."}, {"time": 10529, "text": "I mean, that's a fiasco."}, {"time": 10530, "text": "They should have had 100 companies making the tests initially, right?"}, {"time": 10534, "text": "So for the future, I think what we have learned is we need to have a rapid antigen test right off the bat."}, {"time": 10543, "text": "You can't do it in a day like you can for PCR because you need to make antibodies to the protein that you're looking for and you need to do those in animals."}, {"time": 10552, "text": "But you can do it in weeks and we should be ready for that."}, {"time": 10557, "text": "Yeah, because I mean, to me, that's obvious."}, {"time": 10560, "text": "That's obviously the best solution."}, {"time": 10562,

10574, "text": "How well do we understand how COVID is transmitted?"}, {"time": 10578, "text": "There's droplets of different sizes, aerosols, tiny, tiny droplets."}, {"time": 10586, "text": "It seems like that's a very difficult thing to understand thoroughly."}, {"time": 10589, "text": "So it seems like it's transmitted both ways."}, {"time": 10593, "text": "It's unclear how exactly."}, {"time": 10595, "text": "So how much do we understand and why is it so difficult to understand fully?"}, {"time": 10600, "text": "Well, I think it's clear that it's transmitted through the air mostly."},

"That you send out little sprays and those have viruses in them."}, {"time": 10625, "text": "And the big drops fall to the ground and the little ones can go 100 feet or more, right?"}, {"time": 10631, "text": "But the little ones also have less virus in them."}, {"time": 10635, "text": "So I'm not sure, well, we certainly do not know how much virus you need to be infected."}, {"time": 10641, "text": "But it's probably at least several thousand particles, if not more."}, {"time": 10646, "text": "And it could be that for most people, the tiny droplets don't have enough virus to infect someone else."}, {"time": 10654, "text": "But there's one observation about this virus that's really interesting."}, {"time": 10658, "text": "And that is that 80% of transmissions are done by 20% of the people, of the infected people."}, {"time": 10666, "text": "Not every infected person transmits."}, {"time": 10669, "text": "That's been borne out in multiple studies."}, {"time": 10671, "text": "And in fact, there's a study at University of Colorado where they quantified the viral RNA loads in all the swabs that had been done of students for like a six month period."}, {"time": 10683, "text": "And most of the infectious virus, most of the RNA copies were found in 15 to 20% of the people."}, {"time": 10694, "text": "The rest had really low and that's probably why they don't transmit."}, {"time": 10698, "text": "So those are the ones that might get enough virus in the tiny droplets to be able to infect someone at a distance."}, {"time": 10706, "text": "And I think that's entirely possible."}, {"time": 10708, "text": "Why is it hard to study?"}, {"time": 10711, "text": "You can't do it in real life because you don't know who's infected."}, {"time": 10715, "text": "And

animal, you just don't know what the relevance of that is to people."}, {"time": 10726, "text": "You'd have to use human and do challenge experiments."}, {"time": 10730, "text": "And we don't do that at this point, at least not for this virus."}, {"time": 10733, "text": "So that's why it's hard to know what's going on."}, {"time": 10735, "text": "So we have to make inferences from epidemiological associations where you're studying, say transmission in a household where people are stuck in the same rooms together and you can get an idea of what kind of droplets were involved."}, {"time": 10750, "text": "So that makes it much harder too."}, {"time": 10751, "text": "If you're leaning on epidemiological stuff as opposed to like biophysics or something like the mechanic."}, {"time": 10758, "text": "So that makes it really hard to then develop solutions like masks, to ask the question, how well do masks work?"}, {"time": 10766, "text": "Because then to answer that question, you can lean on epidemiological stuff again, like looking at populations that wear masks versus don't wear masks."}, {"time": 10776, "text": "As opposed to actually saying, like from an engineering perspective, like what kind of material and what kind of tightness by which amount decreases the viral load that's received on the other end."}, {"time": 10792, "text": "But some experiments have been done with masks and just droplets with no virus in them, right?"}, {"time": 10798, "text": "And you can measure the efficiency of different mask materials at keeping those in."}, {"time": 10804, "text": "So if I say that this mask stops 70% of this or larger size droplet, that leads to this percent decreased transmission."}, {"time": 10818, "text": "And also on both the generation and the receiving end and the giving end."}, {"time": 10828, "text": "So how well do masks protect you from others?"}, {"time": 10830, "text": "How well do you do mask protect others from you?"}, {"time": 10834, "text": "Like all of those things seem like they could be more rigorously studied."}, {"time": 10841, "text": "And now is the time because once this is over, nobody's gonna do it."}, {"time": 10847, "text": "Nobody's gonna care."}, {"time": 10849, "text": "But it seems like to me, so tests is one thing, but masks, like the good mask, whatever the good means, whatever that means, like some level of quality of material on your face, if it's shown to actually like thoroughly shown to work well, that seems like an obvious solution to reopen society with."}, {"time": 10874, "text": "If you have a good understanding of how well they work."}, {"time": 10877, "text": "Because if you don't have a good understanding, if there's a lot of uncertainty, that's when you get, and you have people speaking from authority, that's when you start getting the politicization of the solution."}, {"time": 10889, "text": "No, the data, there are some data, most, they're mostly epidemiological and they show some effect in some countries, right?"}, {"time": 10899, "text": "But they could be way better."}, {"time": 10901, "text": "And, but the fact that they're not perfect, then people take advantage of and say, well, look, they don't work that well, so I'm not gonna wear it."}, {"time": 10909, "text": "I think, as you said, people can use it as an excuse."}, {"time": 10913, "text": "But even if it works, so Daniel always says, a mask will cut down transmission by 50 to 60%, and then distance will do another 30%."}, {"time": 10923, "text": "Yeah, those numbers are made up though."}, {"time": 10925, "text": "I mean, they're not made up, but they're estimates."}, {"time": 10929, "text": "And many of them are made based on models, right?"}, {"time": 10933, "text": "We make this model, and let's say the mask cuts down this much, what will be the effect on it?"}, {"time": 10937, "text": "I mean, yeah, they're models, and it's for the same reason."}, {"time": 10940, "text": "I don't believe the transmission of the variants because it's all based on statistical models as well, not biological experiments done in a lab."}, {"time": 10949, "text": "So in that sense, vaccine data is much better than mask data."}, {"time": 10953, "text": "For sure, for sure."}, {"time": 10954, "text": "So my problem with the mask data, which I always thought was fascinating, I stopped talking about it."}, {"time": 10959, "text": "I was in a paper about masks."}, {"time": 10961, "text": "I stopped talking about it because what started happening is masks created assholes on both sides."}, {"time": 10968, "text": "The people that were like in Silicon Valley, the friends of mine that were wearing masks, the way they look at others who don't is like... Well, that's a whole nother issue, right?"}, {"time": 10979, "text": "That happens when you don't have solid science."}, {"time": 10982, "text": "Understood."}, {"time": 10983, "text": "They now start judging you like you're a lesser human being."}, {"time": 10987, "text": "You're not only dumb, but you're almost like evil."}, {"time": 10991, "text": "You're doing bad for society by not wearing a mask."}, {"time": 10994, "text": "And then the people looking in the other way are seeing you for the asshole that you're being for judging them unrightly."}, {"time": 11002, "text": "So they almost wanna say F you by not wearing the mask."}, {"time": 11004, "text": "And there's this division that's created that was heartbreaking to me because masks like testing is a solution that was available early on."}, {"time": 11013, "text": "And if understood well, it could be deployed in a mass scale, and it seems like there's some historical evidence for other viruses where it does very well."}, {"time": 11022, "text": "And so like the fact that this was politicized, yeah, it was a little bit heartbreaking."}, {"time": 11028, "text": "You can find in the literature studies, mostly of healthcare workers and influenza, where you can actually, because you see the people every day that can sample them, you can actually see what masking does."}, {"time": 11040, "text": "And some of them show an effect and others do not, then that's the problem."}, {"time": 11045, "text": "Like any trial, sometimes if it's not big enough and then people latch onto that, see, it doesn't really work."}, {"time": 11051, "text": "But I think the main issue is that in January, both CDC and WHO said masks don't work, don't use them."}, {"time": 11060, "text": "That was the kiss of death for masks because when they then changed their mind, they didn't say we screwed up."}, {"time": 11068, "text": "They just said wear masks."}, {"time": 11069, "text": "If they had said we made a mistake, we were wrong, I think more people would have worn masks."}, {"time": 11076, "text": "And like you said, admitting you're wrong is like a real big part of it."}, {"time": 11081, "text": "And I also think almost the better way is not just saying you're wrong, but in January saying, like revealing the uncertainty under which we operate."}, {"time": 11092, "text": "Like actually, like reveal what was done with the Spanish flu at the beginning of the previous century, because there's a lot of mass controversy then too."}, {"time": 11103, "text": "It went back and forth."}, {"time": 11104, "text": "And that was actually the source of a lot of distrust there too."}, {"time": 11106, "text": "So, and then look at influenza, like how is it effective with that?"}, {"time": 11111, "text": "And just reveal this, we don't know, but like with some probability, this is the best option we got currently."}, {"time": 11120, "text": "And then in a month or two, adjust it, saying that, you know what, our like uncertainty decreased a little bit."}, {"time": 11127, "text": "We have a better idea."}, {"time": 11129, "text": "Like that was an incorrect estimate, but reveal that you're struggling."}, {"time": 11134, "text": "It's not like this weird binary clock that goes one direction or the other."}, {"time": 11138, "text": "You're struggling with uncertainty."}, {"time": 11141, "text": "And like trusting, people maybe criticize me sometimes for this, but I think most people are actually intelligent."}, {"time": 11148, "text": "Like trusting the public to be intelligent with if you give them, if you have transparent and give them information in a real authentic way, like don't look like you're hiding something."}, {"time": 11159, "text": "I think they're intelligent enough to use that data to make decisions."}, {"time": 11163, "text": "It's the same thing as with the testing, is if you put that power in the people's hands to know if they're sick or not, they're gonna make unmasked the right decision, I think."}, {"time": 11174, "text": "The masks and the testing has been a bit heartbreaking."}, {"time": 11178, "text": "I think that's a good point though, that most people don't seem to have an objection to testing."}, {"time": 11184, "text": "And then obviously Macamina makes that point brilliantly."}, {"time": 11187, "text": "And still there's very little excitement around that."}, {"time": 11193, "text": "But he said he was going to do it."}, {"time": 11195, "text": "I mean, I haven't spoken to him since then."}, {"time": 11197, "text": "So I

kinds of things very difficult."}, {"time": 11217, "text": "And then there's not much money to be made on it without that."}, {"time": 11221, "text": "I think there's just economic pressures against it."}, {"time": 11224, "text": "And because so much investment was placed on the vaccines and obviously there's an incentive mechanism there where the companies, lobbyists and all those, there's this

the obvious thing to be working is the vaccines from their perspective, but it's not obvious at all to me."}, {"time": 11263, "text": "I think you should have both."}, {"time": 11264, "text": "I think have vaccines and good testing and that covers you really well because you're always gonna have people who don't get vaccinated."}, {"time": 11272, "text": "I don't know if you've been paying

billions of terms to one or two or a handful of terms."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So we're getting insights into symmetries and all of a sudden the math is becoming simple because we're not doing something silly."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "We're not adding up all these loops in space time."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "We're doing something far deeper."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "But they don't

structures like guessing is really fun."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So these really brilliant guys, generic brilliant men and women who are doing this work, physicists, are making guesses about these

make in space time, like locality."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "So they make these brilliant guesses."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "And of course, most of the time you're gonna be wrong, but once you get one or two that start to pay off and then you get some lucky breaks."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "So they got a lucky break back in 1986."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor took the scattering amplitude for two gluons coming in at high energy and four gluons going out at low energy."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "So that kind of scattering thing."}, {"time": 1107,

you need to."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "So you needed to compute them."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "It was billions of terms and they couldn't do it even though for the supercomputers couldn't do that

out to be equivalent."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "So billions of terms reduced to one term, that so called famous Park Taylor formula, 1986."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "And that was like, okay, where did that come from?"}, {"time": 1154, "text": "This is a pointer into a deep realm, beyond space and time, but no one, I mean, what can you do with it?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "And they thought maybe it was a one off, but then other formulas started coming up."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And then eventually Neymar, Connie, Hamid and his team found this thing called the amplituhedron, which

it's time for a new trick."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "But now you need to go deeper and show, but by the way, this doesn't mean we throw away everything we've done, not by a long shot."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "Every new idea that we come up with beyond space time must project precisely into space time."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "And it better give us back everything that we know and love in

wrong."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So that's a strong constraint on this work."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "So even the evolution by natural selection and quantum field theory could be interfaces into something that doesn't look anything like, like you mentioned."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "I mean, it's interesting to think that evolution might be a very crappy interface into something much deeper."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "They're both telling us that the framework that you've had can only go so far and it has to stop."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "And there's something beyond."},

it even further."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So the relationship between what evolution is telling us and what the physicists are telling us is that in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space time

of the relationship between them."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So it's the perceptual space time that evolution is telling us is just a user interface effectively."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And then the physicists are finding that even the mathematical extension of that into the Einsteinian formulation has to be as well, not the final story, there's something deeper."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces as we march forward from Newtonian physics to quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "These are all, in your view, interfaces."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "Are we getting closer to objective reality?"}, {"time": 1379, "text": "How do we know if these interfaces in the process of science, the reason we like those interfaces is because they're predictive of some aspects, strongly predictive about some aspects of our reality."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Is that completely deviating from our understanding of that reality or is it helping us get closer and closer and closer?"}, {"time": 1402, "text": "Well, of course, one critical constraint on all of our theories is that they are empirically tested and pass the experiments that we have for them."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "So no one's arguing against experiments being important and wanting to test all of our current theories and any new theories on that."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "So that's all there."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "But we have good reason to believe that science will never get a theory of everything."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "Everything, everything, right."},

consciousness, is to show how dynamical systems of conscious agents could lead to what we call space and time and neurons and brain activity."}, {"time": 6776, "text": "In other words, we have to show how you get space time and physical objects entirely from a theory of conscious agents outside of space time, with the dynamics outside of space time."}, {"time": 6790, "text": "So that's, and I can

really tough, because it's consciousness without form versus the various forms that consciousness takes for the experiences that it has."}, {"time": 6895, "text": "So when I write down a probability

that."}, {"time": 7047, "text": "So we would solve the hard problem, not by showing how brains create consciousness, but how networks of conscious agents create what we call the symbols that we call

small talk thing, that I'm curious if you have this experience, but I find it fantastic to have a career where I'm known for anti small talk kinds of topics, because it means that anywhere I go, like

linger on this."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "So this story is kind of the book, the kind of defining book of the Beats, of the Beats generation."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And it's basically a story of a writer who takes a road trip across the United States a couple of times and experiences a few close friends and a few strangers along the way."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "And there's a lot of just those melancholy goodbyes along the way."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "You meet all these people with interesting lives."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "Some of them are defined by struggle."}, {"time": 1547,

second and realizing that fate is just ripping that out, which is similar to this idea of it sucks to say goodbye just when you met, but it's especially true when you fall in love just a little bit with that stranger with all the possibilities that could lay there."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "So there's a few lines of written down."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "I went down this whole rabbit hole of

just captures this kind of in the moment appreciation of the beauty of the world and a sadness over the fact that time passes and you leave the people you love behind, you leave the places you love behind, or at least the way they were at the time that you really enjoyed them."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "And you just leave that, all that, just the sadness you feel when you, something about it, like looking at a picture, looking at your kids grow up, looking at old friends getting old, something makes you realize that time passes."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "And somewhere deep in there is probably a realization of your mortality."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "And then it just makes you somehow first sad that everything comes to an end."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "And then that's immediately followed by sort of an appreciation of the moment, like a gratitude that you get to experience this moment."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "Yeah, I know it exactly."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "I mean, that's the whole reason that I wrote Bitter Sweet."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "It's all about that."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "And so I know intensely what you're talking about."}, {"time": 1726,

on to the next one."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think that's the deepest essence of human nature, the feeling of longing for some kind of state of perfect completeness, completion, perfect love, the Garden of Eden, all of it."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "And the feeling that you're never gonna quite attain it, but you get glimpses of it here and there."}, {"time": 1770, "text":

thing."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "They're just a glimpse."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "It's a glimpse of what we long for."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "So the sadness that we might feel is always connected to the ways in which we fall short from the perfect thing that we're, like there's always a thing you're longing for."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "And the sadness has to do with getting a glimpse of it, but not quite getting a hold of it."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "So it's always losing."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "It's always losing, but it's also always, but it's not, that sounds really depressing, but it's not, you know it's not depressing because you experience this all the time."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "It's also, those are the most beautiful moments I think life offers."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "I mean, it's intense, intense beauty in those moments because it's getting closer to the real thing that we long for."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "So what about like loss, losing love?"}, {"time": 1831, "text": "Is that also a beautiful thing?"}, {"time": 1836, "text": "Well, the moments you're talking about, I think it's easier to appreciate the beauty of it all in the moment because you're experiencing, you're kind of experiencing the loss and the love all at the same time."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "Whereas if you're talking about straight up loss, like a betrayal or a bereavement or whatever it is, that's, it's different, it's quite overwhelming."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "So losing a loved one kind of thing."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "Losing a loved one."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "I mean, I will say that the truth that I think that we can come to after a lot of time on this earth is the idea that love exists not only in its particular forms, so not only in the form of the one person, that one person we love or that other person we love, but love itself is a state that we have access to."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "And so over time, the loss of person A can heal and you can tap into a kind of bigger river of love."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I had this, it comes from Louis C.K."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "in a show, damn I love that line."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "I mean, there's a, he talks to an older gentleman and Louis is all like sad about losing a loved one or like getting rejected essentially, like a breakup."},

most, this is the best part."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "Like losing love is the best part because that's, the real loss is when you forget."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "Like feeling shitty about having gone through a breakup is when you most intensely appreciate what that person meant to you."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "Like you most intensely feel love in some strange way by realizing that you've lost it, by missing it, wishing at this moment, I wish I had that."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "Like that feeling, that's when you feel that love the most, the absence of it, and so the older gentleman gives advice that that's the best part."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "And it can, if you're good with it, it can last for the longest."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "It could be the most sort of prolonged experience of deep appreciation and emotion and so on."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "So that's kind of a, that's a nice way to look at loss, which is a reminder of how much somebody meant to us."},

always a signpost to the direction you really wanna go to."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "That's always what it is."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "Yeah, and it's interesting to see the way that the mystical versions of many of the great religions all point in this direction."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "Whether you're looking at Sufism or the Kabbalah or in Christian mysticism, you see this idea that the longing for what you lack is the very thing that gives you what you're longing for."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "So the longing is the cure."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "I mean, that's the way the Sufi poet Rumi puts it."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "The longing is the cure."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And he says, be thirsty."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "Like be as thirsty as you possibly can."},

just broke up and they'll be like, shut up, asshole, advice sucks."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "I wish I had her and back."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "Those are the kinds of life lessons that only work when you kind of step away for a while."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "They don't work in the moment of excruciation."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "There is something about the fact of knowing that all humans are in that experience together that is also incredibly uplifting."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "Well, that takes time for people to realize."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "Like heartbreak in your early teenage years or something like that could feel like this is completely the most novel and the most dramatic pain that any human has ever felt, right?"}, {"time": 2104, "text": "Or maybe even when you're younger."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "And then one of the things you realize is that everybody goes through this."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "That can be an awakening to the fact that we're all in this together."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "This human condition is not just a personal experience."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "It's an experience we all share."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "And that's a kind of love, the unity of it."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "Yeah, that's a really deep kind of love."}, {"time": 2127, "text": "And I feel like we are prevented from perceiving that love as it's actually like the most obvious kind of love and it's right there and it happens all the time."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "But we're prevented from perceiving it because we're not really supposed to talk about things like that."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "It's like there's something unseemly about it."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "Well, it's also in the West is this individualist society."},

obviously sort of communicated or talked about as part of the culture."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "Yeah, it's not part of the culture."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "And yet, you see it in our behaviors because we're humans."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "So, why do people listen to sad music?"}, {"time": 2175, "text": "I mean, one reason is they're hearing expressed for them."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "Like the musician is basically saying to them, this thing that you have experienced, I've experienced it too, so have lots of other people."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "But they're saying it all without words and it's transformed into something beautiful."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "And there's something about that that's just incredibly elevating."}, {"time": 2197, "text": "And people don't know it, but like there's one study that I have in Bittersweet that found that people whose favorite songs are their happy songs, play it on their playlist about 175 times, but the people who love sad music play them about 800 times."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "And they say that they feel connected to the sublime when they're listening to that music."}, {"time": 2223, "text": "So, what is it in music that connects us to the sublime through sadness?"}, {"time": 2231, "text": "I mean, I have a bunch of different theories."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "Like the whole reason I started writing this book is because I kept having this reaction reliably to sad music."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "And I realized that for people who I knew who were religious believers, the way they described their experience of God was what I was experiencing when I would hear that music."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "Like all the time."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "It happens over and over again."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "So, you wonder what that is?"}, {"time": 2262, "text": "Yeah, so I started wondering what that is."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "And lots of people have tried to figure out what that's all about."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "And there are different theories that it's expressing, it's like a kind of catharsis for our difficult emotions, that it's, as we were saying, a sense of being in it together."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "We don't react in that sort of uplifted way when you just see like a slideshow of sad faces, which is something researchers have actually tested."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "No one really cares when they're seeing the sad faces."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "But the sad music, they're really reacting."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "And also, they don't really react when they're hearing music expressing other negative emotions, like Marshall music or something like that."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "It's just the sad music that gives people this elevated sense of wonder."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "So, I think it's the combination of the sadness and the beauty."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "And I think it's just tapping into the essence of the human source code, which is a kind of spiritual longing, whether we're atheists or believers."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "There's this feeling of longing for a state and a place of perfect love and perfect unity and perfect truth and all of it."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "And like an acute awareness that we're not there in this world."}, {"time": 2336, "text": "In religions, we express that through the longing for Mecca or Eden or Zion."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "And artistically, we express it with Dorothy longing for somewhere over the rainbow or Harry Potter enters the story at the precise moment that he's become an orphan."}, {"time": 2354, "text": "So, he's now gonna spend the rest of his life longing for these parents who he can never remember."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "And there's something about

introverts are public speakers, actually, like this is one of, I knew this from the studies, but then also when I started going out on the lecture circuit, I realized that all my fellow speakers at all these conferences I was going to, they're all introverts, because they're all people who spent years figuring out some idea and now they're out there talking about it."}, {"time": 3319, "text":

how to be a public speaker."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "I can totally give that advice because I used to, before I would give speeches, if I had to do it in law school, if I knew like today was the day

the feeling of being all alone in the spotlight through others sharing it with you."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "And you would answer some questions about where do you grow up?"}, {"time": 3447, "text": "Where do you go to school?"}, {"time": 3449, "text": "And you declare victory and you're done."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "And then little by little by little, you keep ratcheting up the exercises until you get to the point where you can do it."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "And then you start having successes and you realize, oh, you know, actually I can do this."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "What about like writing versus improvising?"}, {"time": 3466, "text": "Because I knew a few people, sort of the colleagues of mine that were working on TED talks and it feels like you're supposed to like

lecture or any of that."}, {"time": 3484, "text": "Like I know it's really good to do, but do you find that relieves some of your anxiety preparing well or are you now able to do not preparing well at all?"}, {"time": 3495, "text": "I definitely like to prepare before, but the kind of preparation that I've done for my TED talks is completely different from what I've done for everything else."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "Because TED talks are more like a theatrical event where it's like a one person show."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "And of course, if you were going to go on Broadway with a monologue, you'd know every word."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "So it's kind of like that."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And so I would rehearse it over and over the way you would do that."}, {"time": 3521,

forget something?"}, {"time": 3532, "text": "I mean, they do things like the last TED talk I gave, I actually did forget something halfway through."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "Like I just couldn't remember the next line."}, {"time": 3542, "text": "And so I had to walk over, like over there were my notes."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "And so I did that and the audience like very kindly clapped while I did that."}, {"time": 3551, "text": "And then I came back to the spotlight and kept going and they edit that out."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "Nice, so there's a failure mode."}, {"time": 3558, "text": "It seems really, it seems really stressful."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "Like I'm now, I'm not sure if I'll ever publish it, but I've been, mostly it's for a personal journey, but I've been working on a series on, wait for it, Hitler and the Third Reich."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "Sort of looking at the historical context of everything because my family was so much affected by that whole part of history."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "So for me to rigorously, I've read a lot about Stalin and Hitler, and for me to force myself, one of the best ways to force yourself to really consider material is to have to talk about it."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "And so that's why I'm doing it, but I'm playing with ideas of some of it, maybe like 20% is written down on paper, but the rest of it is my thoughts in the moment."}, {"time": 3612, "text": "That's a difficult balance to strike because if you write a lot, you're going to be more precise, you're going to be more accurate, but you're

experienced that with the TED Talks."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "It's like you get to a stage, so you're memorizing everything word for word, and at first, in that process, it comes out in a really wooden way, the way you're saying, like the emotion's gone."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "But once you really know it, so you've internalized the words, then all the emotion comes back, and you can say them in a completely different way."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "And you're really speaking it from the heart."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "But you have to know it so well before you can do that."},

lose someone to actual bereavement, you go through a mourning process, and people have thought for thousands of years about how to do that."}, {"time": 5715, "text": "But with something like this, there's no process because you're not even admitting to yourself, especially when you're in your teens and 20s, that you're mourning something."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "But it was the case that for decades, for decades, I could not answer even the simplest question about my mother, like where did she grow up, without tears in my eyes, or more than tears in my eyes, like embarrassing tears."},

last six, seven years writing this book about joy and sorrow and loss and love and all of it, and I've really come to terms with all of it."}, {"time": 5762, "text": "And then the second thing that happened is my mother now has Alzheimer's."}, {"time": 5767, "text": "And in her Alzheimer's, she's still actually the same person, like she's forgotten most things, but she still has these conversational lanes that you can travel down that are like the way she always was."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "And the way that she was when I was a kid, which was like so incredibly loving and so connected and so warm and sweet and funny and all of it, all the things I remembered, like it's all come back."}, {"time": 5795, "text": "And for all these decades, I had been wondering whether that Garden of Eden I remembered had actually happened, or whether that was just like the fantasy of a child, and maybe it was always difficult and I had not seen it."}, {"time": 5812, "text": "But I'm seeing her now, and I realize that it was all true, everything I remember, it was all true."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "It all happened, because it's happening again."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "And you return to the Garden of Eden for a time."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "And to childhood."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "It's always a question of whether you can return to that place."}, {"time": 5834,

"text": "You feel different?"}, {"time": 5849, "text": "No, I mean, I'm the same person in terms of my need for love and love of love and all of that, but I don't look, I'm not dependent on my mother for it the way I was then, and that makes the experience really different."}, {"time": 5863, "text": "Yeah, when you're younger, she's a god figure."}, {"time": 5868, "text": "What is that, that the roots, the parents, such a funny civilization will live."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "And there's a depth of connection to parents that's probably more powerful than anything else in terms of its formative effect on who you are."}, {"time": 5882, "text": "I think it's the most powerful."}, {"time": 5882, "text": "And in fact, when this started happening, I got to college and I took a class in creative writing, and I tried to write a story, a fictionalized version of what was happening."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "And I called it The Most Passionate Love, because of what you just said."},

though."}, {"time": 5920, "text": "I mean, I do think everybody goes through experiences in this life where you're experiencing a fundamental pain of separation and desire for a union."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "And it takes so many different forms."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "And this was my primal form of it."}, {"time": 5938, "text": "But for someone else, it's a betrayal or a bereavement or an exile from a country of their birth or whatever it is."}, {"time": 5947, "text": "And then you get to solve that puzzle for the rest of your life."}, {"time": 5951, "text": "Yeah, the fact of like, I really do believe that the original love that we long for, like that one of the great things that you learn as you grow older is that the love exists in some plane that's more general than the particularized form in which you first knew it."}, {"time": 5969, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's why, despite all the creepy interpretations, even though Sigmund Freud is probably wrong in the details, he was the first one to sort of suggest that our experiences..."}, {"time": 5982, "text": "I mean, he said that that was really controversial at the time when young people, they start having sexual thoughts like at age two or something, whatever the hell he said."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "So you develop this kind of connection to the opposite sex or whatever, to your mother, to your parents."}, {"time": 6000, "text": "And I think while a lot of that is shown to be probably not true, what is like a deeper truth there is your first early experiences of love or depth of connection are probably somehow strongly formative of your conception of love and your definition of the perfect thing you're reaching for for the rest of your life."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "And you can really see it when you become a parent, too."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "You know, you can just see like, there's... Don't screw it up."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "You know, I have to say, like, I mean, knock on wood, I actually feel like, like, we're doing pretty well."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "Like, my kids are teenagers now."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "And I really had thought that I wasn't going to repeat the issues that I had been through with my mom."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "And I can say, I really am not."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "Yeah, like, my mom, for various reasons, just had a lot of trouble with my independence."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "And I just don't feel that at all."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "So... Yeah, there might be other things you're totally blind to."}, {"time": 6063, "text": "I guess that's possible."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "Isn't that the way of parenting?"}, {"time": 6064, "text": "You solve the problems of the past."}, {"time": 6068, "text": "But there's some other new one."}, {"time": 6068, "text": "I guess I'll find out in 10 or 20 years."}, {"time": 6068, "text": "But like, so far, so good."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "What wisdom about parenting can you give from your own experience and from your writing?"}, {"time": 6080, "text": "Yeah, well, oh my god, there's a lot to say."}, {"time": 6080, "text": "So, on the bittersweet side of things, the wisdom that I would give is that, especially for kids who are growing up in relative comfort with everything going pretty well, they get the idea that real life is when things are going well."}, {"time": 6107, "text": "And when things don't go well, it's like a detour from the main road, as opposed to understanding that it's all the main road."}, {"time": 6115, "text": "And I tell this story in the book of this time that we went on this family vacation where we rented a house in the countryside."}, {"time": 6123, "text": "And the house was next to this field where lived two donkeys that our kids fell in love with."}, {"time": 6130, "text": "They were like really little at the time, two boys."}, {"time": 6130, "text": "And they're spending all this time feeding carrots to the donkeys and it's all beautiful."}, {"time": 6138, "text": "And then comes the day where they realize that we're leaving in like two days and they're never going to see these donkeys again."}, {"time": 6144, "text": "And they start crying themselves to sleep."}, {"time": 6144, "text": "And the usual things that parents might say at a moment like that of like, you know, maybe we'll come back or another family will feed them, will feed these donkeys."}, {"time": 6156, "text": "None of that made any difference."}, {"time": 6156,

is natural."}, {"time": 6177, "text": "That's when they stopped crying because I think that's when they stopped resisting."}, {"time": 6183, "text": "Like it's one thing to feel the pain of goodbye and it's another thing to be feeling like this isn't supposed to be happening."}, {"time": 6190, "text": "It's the resistance part of this isn't supposed to be happening that makes life really difficult as opposed to a more clear eyed view of what it really is."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "This is indeed supposed to be happening."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "There's a show called Yellowstone that I recently started watching."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "Yeah, no, I've heard of it."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "We actually started watching it, but only a few minutes and didn't get into it."},

of it that way because you think you die, but he really framed it as killed because he's like, there's no such thing as dying of old age."}, {"time": 6251, "text": "Let's medically, let's discuss that a bit, but basically there's something, whether it's a truck or a bacteria, something's going to kill you in the end."}, {"time": 6265, "text": "And that was an interesting way to look at it because we tend to think of humans aren't supposed to be killed."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "We think of murder as one of the sins, sort of one of the things that you don't do in society."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "We do, that's a more technical discussion, whether we ultimately get killed by something in the end."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "But to some degree that's true, at least for most of us, that there's something that gets us, whether it's cancer, those kinds of things."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "But yeah, it's that reframing of it's not, it's supposed to be, this is the way of the world."},

beauty."}, {"time": 6316, "text": "And at the same time, there's a part of me that's just like, yeah, but give me the magic wand to make the world different."}, {"time": 6326, "text": "I don't know how much of this is a female thing, too."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "Like I was watching with my son, my 12 year old the other day, we were watching this show about the battle of Thermopylae."},

world where you didn't have to do all this in order for everyone just to live their lives?"}, {"time": 6354, "text": "And he just looked at me completely puzzled."}, {"time": 6357, "text": "Like, no, you know, like to him, it all just seemed self evident that the world would be structured that way."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "You know, and he had like the 12 year old admiration for the valor of it

consciousness."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "You are turning the noises coming out of my face hole into ideas in your mind, and you have no conscious awareness of how that process is occurring."},
