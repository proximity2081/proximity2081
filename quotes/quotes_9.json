there's a car in front of me, but to help people build an intuition of what computer vision is by showing some of the uncertainty."}, {"time": 353, "text": "Well, I think it's, in my car, I always look at the sort of the debug view."}, {"time": 357, "text": "And there's, there's two debug views."}, {"time": 359, "text": "Uh, one is augmented vision, uh, where, which I'm sure you've seen where it's basically, we draw boxes and labels around objects that are recognized."}, {"time": 370, "text": "And then there's a work called the visualizer, which is basically vector space representation, summing up the input from all sensors that doesn't, that doesn't, does not show any pictures, but it shows, uh, all of the, it's basically shows the car's view of, of, of the world in vector space."}, {"time": 392, "text": "Um, but I think this is very difficult for people to know, normal people to understand, they would not know what they're looking at."}, {"time": 399, "text": "So it's almost an HMI challenge to the current things that are being displayed is optimized for the general public understanding of what the system is capable of."}, {"time": 408, "text": "It's like, if you have no idea what, how computer vision works or anything, you can sort of look at the screen and see if the car knows what's going on."}, {"time": 415, "text": "And then if you're, you know, if you're a development engineer or if you're, you know, if you're, if you have the development build like I do, then you can see, uh, you know, all the debug information, but those would just be like total diverse to most people."}, {"time": 431, "text": "What's your view on how to best distribute effort."}, {"time": 434, "text": "So there's three, I would say technical aspects of autopilot that are really important."}, {"time": 438, "text": "So it's the underlying algorithms, like the neural network architecture, there's the data, so that the strain on, and then there's a hardware development."}, {"time": 446, "text": "There may be others, but so look, algorithm, data, hardware, you don't, you only have so much money, only have so much time, what do you think is the most important thing to, to, uh, allocate resources to, or do you see it as pretty evenly distributed between those three?"}, {"time": 463, "text": "We automatically get a fast amounts of data because all of our cars have eight external facing cameras and radar, and usually 12 ultrasonic sensors, uh, GPS, obviously, um, and, uh, IMU."}, {"time": 482, "text": "And so we basically have a fleet that has, uh, and we've got about 400,000 cars on the road that have that level of data, I think you keep quite close track of it actually."}, {"time": 495, "text": "So we're, we're approaching half a million cars on the road that have the full sensor suite."}, {"time": 501, "text": "Um, so this is, I'm, I'm not sure how many other cars on the road have the sensor suite, but I would be surprised if it's more than 5,000, which means that we have 99% of all the data."}, {"time": 515, "text": "So there's this huge inflow of data."}, {"time": 517, "text": "Massive inflow of data, and then we, it's, it's taken us about three years, but now we've finally developed our full self driving computer, which can process, uh, and in order of magnitude as much as the Nvidia system that we currently have in the, in the cars, and it's really just a, to use it, you've unplugged the Nvidia computer and plug the Tesla computer in and that's it."}, {"time": 541, "text": "And it's, it's, uh, in fact, we're not even, we're still exploring the boundaries of capabilities, uh, but we're able to run the cameras at full frame rate, full resolution, uh, not even crop the images and it's still got headroom even on one of the systems, the harder full self driving computer is really two computers, two systems on a chip that are fully redundant."}, {"time": 563, "text": "So you could put a bolt through basically any part of that system and it still works."}, {"time": 567, "text": "The redundancy, are they perfect copies of each other or also it's purely for redundancy as opposed to an argue machine kind of architecture where they're both making decisions."}, {"time": 577, "text": "This is purely for redundancy."}, {"time": 579, "text": "I think it would more like it's, if you have a twin engine aircraft, uh, commercial aircraft, the system will operate best if both systems are operating, but it's, it's capable of operating safely on one."}, {"time": 593, "text": "So, but as it is right now, we can just run, we're, we haven't even hit the, the, the edge of performance."}, {"time": 601, "text": "So there's no need to actually distribute functionality across both SOCs."}, {"time": 610, "text": "We can actually just run a full duplicate on, on, on each one."}, {"time": 613, "text": "Do you haven't really explored or hit the limit of this?"}, {"time": 617, "text": "Not yet at the limiter."}, {"time": 618, "text": "So the magic of deep learning is that it gets better with data."}, {"time": 622, "text": "You said there's a huge inflow of data, but the thing about driving the really valuable data to learn from is the edge cases."}, {"time": 632, "text": "So how do you, I mean, I've, I've heard you talk somewhere about, uh, autopilot disengagements being an important moment of time to use."}, {"time": 642, "text": "Is there other edge cases where you can, you know, you can, you can, you can drive, is there other edge cases or perhaps can you speak to those edge cases?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "What aspects of that might be valuable or if you have other ideas, how to discover more and more and more edge cases in driving?"}, {"time": 660, "text": "Well, there's a lot of things that are learned."}, {"time": 662, "text": "There are certainly edge cases where I say somebody is on autopilot and they, they take over and then, okay, that, that, that, that's a trigger that goes to our system that says, okay, did they take over for convenience or do they take over because the autopilot wasn't working properly."}, {"time": 679, "text": "There's also like, let's say we're, we're trying to figure out what is the optimal spline for traversing an intersection."}, {"time": 687, "text": "Um, then then the ones where there are no interventions and are the right ones."}, {"time": 693, "text": "So you then say, okay, when it looks like this, do the following."}, {"time": 698, "text": "And then, and then you get the optimal spline for a complex, uh, navigating a complex, uh, intersection."}, {"time": 704, "text": "So that's for this."}, {"time": 706, "text": "So there's kind of the common case you're trying to, uh, capture a huge amount of samples of a particular intersection, how, when things went right, and then there's the edge case where, uh, as you said, not for convenience, but something didn't go exactly right."}, {"time": 721, "text": "Somebody took over, somebody asserted manual control from autopilot."}, {"time": 725, "text": "And really like the way to look at this as view all input is error."}, {"time": 728, "text": "If the user had to do input, it does something all input is error."}, {"time": 732, "text": "That's a powerful line."}, {"time": 733, "text": "That's a powerful line to think of it that way, because they may very well be error, but if you want to exit the highway, or if you want to, uh, it's a navigation decision that all autopilot is not currently designed to do."}, {"time": 745, "text": "Then the driver takes over."}, {"time": 747, "text": "How do you know the difference?"}, {"time": 748, "text": "That's going to change with navigate an autopilot, which we were just released and without still confirm."}, {"time": 753, "text": "So the navigation, like lane change based, like a certain control in order to change, do a lane change or exit a freeway or, or doing a highway under change, the vast majority of that will go away with, um, the release that just went out."}, {"time": 769, "text": "So that, that I don't think people quite understand how big of a step that is."}, {"time": 774, "text": "Yeah, they don't."}, {"time": 775, "text": "So if you drive the car, then you do."}, {"time": 778, "text": "So you still have to keep your hands on the steering wheel currently when it does the automatic lane change."}, {"time": 783, "text": "What are, so there's, there's these big leaps through the development of autopilot through its history and what stands out to you as the big leaps?"}, {"time": 793, "text": "I would say this one, navigate an autopilot without, uh, confirm without having to confirm is a huge leap."}, {"time": 801, "text": "It is a huge leap."}, {"time": 802, "text": "It also automatically overtakes low cars."}, {"time": 804, "text": "So it's, it's both navigation, um, and seeking the fastest lane."}, {"time": 811, "text": "So it'll, it'll, it'll, you know, overtake a slow cause, um, and exit the freeway and take highway interchanges."}, {"time": 818, "text": "And, and then, uh, we have, uh, traffic lights, uh, recognition, which introduced initially as a, as a warning."}, {"time": 830, "text": "I mean, on the development version that I'm driving, the car fully, fully stops and goes at traffic lights."}, {"time": 836, "text": "So those are the steps, right?"}, {"time": 838, "text": "You've just mentioned something sort of inkling a step towards full autonomy."}, {"time": 842, "text": "What would you say are the biggest technological roadblocks to full self driving?"}, {"time": 848, "text": "Actually, I don't think, I think we just, the full self driving computer that we just, uh, that the Tesla, what we call the FSD computer, uh, that that's now in production."}, {"time": 860, "text": "Uh, so if you order, uh, any model SRX or any model three that has the full self driving package, you'll get the FSD computer."}, {"time": 869, "text": "That, that was, that's important to have enough, uh, base computation, uh, then refining the neural net and the control software, uh, which, but all of that can just be provided as an over there update."}, {"time": 913, "text": "So essentially buying a car today is an investment in the future."}, {"time": 916, "text": "You're essentially buying a car, you're buying the, I think the most profound thing is that if you buy a Tesla today, I believe you are buying an appreciating asset, not a depreciating asset."}, {"time": 930, "text": "So that's a really important statement there because if hardware is capable enough, that's the hard thing to upgrade usually."}, {"time": 937, "text": "So then the rest is a software problem."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Software has no marginal cost really."}, {"time": 944, "text": "But what's your intuition on the software side?"}, {"time": 948, "text": "How hard are the remaining steps to, to get it to where, um, you know, uh, the, the experience, uh, not just the safety, but the full experience is something that people would, uh, enjoy."}, {"time": 966, "text": "Well, I think people enjoy it very much so on, on, on the highways."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "In terms of enjoyability and something that people would, uh, would actually find a lot of use from the parking lot is a, is a really, you know, it's, it's rich of annoyance when you have to do it manually."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "So there's a lot of benefit to be gained from automation there."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "So let me start injecting the human into this discussion a little bit."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "Uh, so let's talk about, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, about full autonomy."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "If you look at the current level four vehicles being tested on road, like Waymo and so on, they're only technically autonomous."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "They're really level two systems with just the different design philosophy, because there's always a safety driver in almost all cases and they're monitoring the system."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "Do you see Tesla's full self driving as still for a time to come requiring supervision of the human being."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "So it's capabilities are powerful enough to drive, but nevertheless requires the human to still be supervising, just like a safety driver is in a other fully autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "I think it will require detecting hands on wheel for at least, uh, six months or something like that from here."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "It really is a question of like, from a regulatory standpoint, uh, what, how much safer than a person does autopilot need to be for it to be okay to not monitor the car, you know, and, and this is a debate that one can have it."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "And then if you, but you need, you know, a large sample, a large amount of data."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Um, so you can prove with high confidence, statistically speaking, that the car is dramatically safer than a person, um, and that adding in the person monitoring does not materially affect the safety."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So it might need to be like two or 300% safer than a person."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "And how do you prove that incidents per mile incidents per mile crashes and fatalities, fatalities would be a factor, but there, there are just not enough fatalities to be statistically significant at scale, but there are enough."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "Crashes, you know, there are far more crashes than there are fatalities."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "So you can assess what is the probability of a crash that then there's another step which probability of injury and probability of permanent injury, the probability of death, and all of those need to be a much better than a person, uh, by at least perhaps 200%."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "And you think there's, uh, the ability to have a healthy discourse with the regulatory bodies on this topic?"}, {"time": 1176, "text": "I mean, there's no question that, um, but, um, regulators pay just disproportionate amount of attention to that, which generates press."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "This is just an objective fact."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Um, and Tesla generates a lot of press."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "So the, you know, in the United States, this, I think almost, you know, uh, in the United States, this, I think almost 40,000 automotive deaths per year."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "Uh, but if there are four in Tesla, they'll probably receive a thousand times more press than anyone else."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "So the, the psychology of that is actually fascinating."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "I don't think we'll have enough time to talk about that, but I have to talk to you about the human side of things."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "So myself and our team at MIT recently released the paper on functional vigilance of drivers while using autopilot."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "This is work we've been doing since autopilot was first released publicly over three years ago, collecting video of driver faces and driver body."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "So I saw that you tweeted a quote from the abstract, so I can at least, uh, guess that you've glanced at it."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Yeah, I read it."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "Can I talk you through what we found?"}, {"time": 1246, "text": "So it appears that in the data that we've collected, that drivers are maintaining functional vigilance such that we're looking at 18,000 disengagement from autopilot, 18,900 and annotating, were they able to take over control in a timely manner?"}, {"time": 1265, "text": "So they were there present looking at the road, uh, to take over control."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "So this, uh, goes against what, what many would predict from the body of literature on vigilance with automation."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Now, the question is, do you think these results hold across the broader population?"}, {"time": 1283, "text": "So ours is just a small subset."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "Do you think, uh, one of the criticism is that, you know, there's a small minority of drivers that may be highly responsible where their vigilance decrement would increase with autopilot use?"}, {"time": 1298, "text": "I think this is all really going to be swept."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "I mean, the system's improving so much, so fast that this is going to be a mood point very soon where vigilance is like, if something's many times safer than a person, then adding a person, uh, does the, the, the effect on safety is, is limited."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "Um, and in fact, uh, it could be negative."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "So the, uh, the, so the fact that a human may, some percent of the population may, uh, exhibit a vigilance decrement will not affect overall statistics numbers of safety."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "No, in fact, I think it will become, uh, very, very quickly, maybe even towards the end of this year, but I'd say I'd be shocked if it's not next year."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "At the latest, that, um, having the person, having a human intervene will decrease safety decrease."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "It's like, imagine if you're an elevator and it used to be that there were elevator operators, um, and, and you couldn't go on an elevator by yourself and work the lever to move between floors."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "Um, and now, uh, nobody wants it an elevator operator because the automated elevator that stops the floors is much safer than the elevator operator."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "And in fact, it would be quite dangerous to have someone with a lever that can move the elevator between floors."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "So that's a, that's a really powerful statement and really interesting one."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "But I also have to ask from a user experience and from a safety perspective, one of the passions for me algorithmically is a camera based detection of, uh, of just sensing the human, but detecting what the driver is looking at, cognitive load, body pose on the computer vision side, that's a fascinating problem."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "But do you, and there's many in industry believe you have to have camera based driver monitoring."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Do you think there could be benefit gained from driver monitoring?"}, {"time": 1419, "text": "If you have a system that's, that's at, that's at or below a human level reliability, then driver monitoring makes sense."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "But if your system is dramatically better, more likely to be better, more liable than, than a human, then drive monitoring monitoring is not just not help much."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And, uh, like I said, you, you, just like, as an, you wouldn't want someone into like, you wouldn't want someone in the elevator, if you're in an elevator, do you really want someone with a big lever, some, some random person operating the elevator between floors?"}, {"time": 1452, "text": "I wouldn't trust that or rather have the buttons."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "You're optimistic about the pace of improvement of the system that from what you've seen with the full self driving car computer, the rate of improvement is exponential."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "So one of the other very interesting design choices early on that connects to this is the operational design domain of autopilot."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "So where autopilot is able to be turned on the, so contrast another vehicle system that we're studying is the Cadillac SuperCrew system."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "That's in terms of ODD, very constrained to particular kinds of highways, well mapped, tested, but it's much narrower than the ODD of Tesla vehicles."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "What's there's, there's pros and..."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "It's like ADD."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "That's a, that's a good line."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "Uh, what was the design decision, uh, what, in that different philosophy of thinking where there's pros and cons, what we see with, uh, a wide ODD is drive Tesla drivers are able to explore more the limitations of the system, at least early on, and they understand together with the instrument cluster display, they start to understand what are the capabilities."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "So that's a benefit."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "The con is you go, you're letting drivers use it basically anywhere."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "So anyway, that could detect lanes with confidence."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Was there a philosophy, uh, design decisions that were challenging that were being made there or from the very beginning, was that, uh, done on purpose with intent?"}, {"time": 1554, "text": "Well, I mean, I think it's frankly, it's pretty crazy giving it, letting people drive a two ton death machine manually."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "Uh, that's crazy."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Like, like in the future of people who are like, I can't believe anyone was just allowed to drive for one of these two ton death machines and they just drive wherever they wanted."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Just like elevators."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "He was like, move the elevator with that lever, wherever you want."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "It can stop at halfway between floors if you want."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "It's pretty crazy."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So it's going to seem like a mad thing in the future that people were driving cars."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "So I have a bunch of questions about the human psychology, about behavior and so on that would become that because, uh, you have faith in the AI system, uh, not faith, but, uh, the, both on the hardware side and the deep learning approach of learning from data will make it just far safer than humans."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "Recently, there are a few hackers who, uh, tricked autopilot to act in unexpected ways with adversarial examples."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "So we all know that neural network systems are very sensitive to minor disturbances to these adversarial examples on input."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "Do you think it's possible to defend against something like this for the broader, for the industry?"}, {"time": 1635, "text": "So can you elaborate on the, on the confidence behind that answer?"}, {"time": 1642, "text": "Um, well the, you know, neural net is just like a basic bunch of matrix math."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Or you have to be like a very sophisticated, somebody who really understands neural nets and like basically reverse engineer how the matrix is being built and then create a little thing that's just exactly, um, causes the matrix math to be slightly off."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "But it's very easy to then block it, block that by, by having basically anti negative recognition."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "It's like if you, if the system sees something that looks like a matrix hack, uh, exclude it, so it's such an easy thing to do."}]}, {"title": "Gavin Miller: Adobe Research | Lex Fridman Podcast #23", "id": "q0mokx-iiws", "quotes": [{"time": 300, "text": "So I was kind of in love with this idea of magical realism and whether it was possible to do that with technology."}, {"time": 304, "text": "So that was a case where the sort of the agent sort of intrigued me from a literary point of view and became a personality."}, {"time": 310, "text": "I think more recently, I've also written plays and when plays you write dialogue and obviously you write a fixed set of dialogue that follows a linear narrative."}, {"time": 323, "text": "But with modern agents, as you design a personality or a capability for conversation, you're sort of thinking of, I kind of have imaginary dialogue in my head."}, {"time": 333, "text": "And then I think, what would it take not only to have that be real, but for it to really know what it's talking about."}, {"time": 338, "text": "So it's easy to fall into the uncanny valley with AI where it says something it doesn't really understand, but it sounds good to the person."}, {"time": 348, "text": "But you rapidly realize that it's kind of just stimulus response."}, {"time": 348, "text": "It doesn't really have real world knowledge about the thing it's describing."}, {"time": 355, "text": "And so when you get to that point, it really needs to have multiple ways of talking about the same concept."}, {"time": 361, "text": "So it sounds as though it really understands it."}, {"time": 365, "text": "Now, what really understanding means is in the eye of the beholder, right?"}, {"time": 365, "text": "But if it only has one way of referring to something, it feels like it's a canned response."}, {"time": 371, "text": "But if it can reason about it, or you can go at it from multiple angles and give a similar kind of response that people would, then it starts to seem more like there's something there that's sentient."}, {"time": 388, "text": "You can say the same thing, multiple things from different perspectives."}, {"time": 388, "text": "I mean, with the automatic image captioning that I've seen the work that you're doing, there's elements of that, right?"}, {"time": 397, "text": "Being able to generate different kinds of statements about the same picture."}, {"time": 400, "text": "So in my team, there's a lot of work on turning a medium from one form to another, whether it's auto tagging imagery or making up full sentences about what's in the image, then changing the sentence, finding another image that matches the new sentence or vice versa."}, {"time": 418, "text": "And in the modern world of GANs, you sort of give it a description and it synthesizes an asset that matches the description."}, {"time": 426, "text": "So I've sort of gone on a journey."}, {"time": 426, "text": "My early days in my career were about 3D computer graphics, the sort of pioneering work, sort of before movies had special effects done with 3D graphics, and sort of rode that revolution."}, {"time": 437, "text": "And that was very much like the Renaissance where people would model light and color and shape and everything."}, {"time": 445, "text": "And now we're kind of in another wave where it's more impressionistic and it's sort of the idea of something can be used to generate an image directly, which is sort of the new frontier in computer image generation using AI algorithms."}, {"time": 463, "text": "So the creative process is more in the space of ideas or becoming more in the space of ideas versus in the raw pixels?"}, {"time": 470, "text": "Well, it's interesting."}, {"time": 470, "text": "I think at Adobe, we really want to span the entire range from really, really good, what you might call low level tools by low level as close to say, analog workflows as possible."}, {"time": 482, "text": "So what we do there is we make up systems that do really realistic oil paint and watercolor simulations."}, {"time": 488, "text": "So if you want every bristle to behave as it would in the real world and leave a beautiful analog trail of water and then flow after you've made the brushstroke, you can do that."}, {"time": 498, "text": "And that's really important for people who want to create something really expressive or really novel because they have complete control."}, {"time": 506, "text": "And then as certain other tasks become automated, it frees the artists up to focus on the inspiration and less of the perspiration."}, {"time": 515, "text": "So thinking about different ideas, obviously."}, {"time": 515, "text": "Once you finish the design, there's a lot of work to, say, do it for all the different aspect ratio of phones or websites and so on."}, {"time": 528, "text": "And that used to take up an awful lot of time for artists."}, {"time": 531, "text": "It still does for many what we call content velocity."}, {"time": 531, "text": "And one of the targets of AI is actually to reason about from the first example of what are the likely intent for these other formats?"}, {"time": 543, "text": "Maybe if you change the language to German and the words are longer, how do you reflow everything so that it looks nicely artistic in that way?"}, {"time": 552, "text": "And so the person can focus on the really creative bit in the middle, which is what is the look and style and feel and what's the message and what's the story and the human element?"}, {"time": 561, "text": "So I think creativity is changing."}, {"time": 561, "text": "So that's one way in which we're trying to just make it easier and faster and cheaper to do so that there can be more of it, more demand because it's less expensive."}, {"time": 573, "text": "So everyone wants beautiful artwork for everything from a school website to Hollywood movie."}, {"time": 579, "text": "On the other side, as some of these things have automatic versions of them, people will possibly change role from being the hands on artisan to being either the art director or the conceptual artist."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And then the computer will be a partner to help create polished examples of the idea that they're exploring."}, {"time": 599, "text": "Let's talk about Adobe products, AI and Adobe products."}, {"time": 602, "text": "Just so you know where I'm coming from, I'm a huge fan of Photoshop for images, Premiere for video, Audition for audio."}, {"time": 612, "text": "I'll probably use Photoshop to create the thumbnail for this video, Premiere to edit the video, Audition to do the audio."}, {"time": 619, "text": "That said, everything I do is really manually and I set up, I use this old school Kinesis keyboard and I have auto hotkey that just, it's really about optimizing the flow."}, {"time": 632, "text": "Of just making sure there's as few clicks as possible, so just being extremely efficient, something you started to speak to."}, {"time": 639, "text": "So before we get into the fun sort of awesome deep learning things, where does AI, if you could speak a little more to it, AI or just automation in general, do you see in the coming months and years or in general, prior in 2018, fitting into making the life, the low level pixel work flow easier?"}, {"time": 664, "text": "Yeah, that's a great question."}, {"time": 665, "text": "So we have a very rich array of algorithms already in Photoshop, just classical procedural algorithms as well as ones based on data."}, {"time": 674, "text": "In some cases, they end up with a large number of sliders and degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 680, "text": "So one way in which AI can help is just an auto button, which comes up with default settings based on the content itself rather than default values for the tool."}, {"time": 689, "text": "At that point, you then start tweaking."}, {"time": 691, "text": "So that's a very kind of make life easier for people whilst making use of common sense from other example images."}, {"time": 699, "text": "So like smart defaults."}, {"time": 700, "text": "Smart defaults, absolutely."}, {"time": 702, "text": "Another one is something we've spent a lot of work over the last 20 years I've been at Adobe, or 19, thinking about selection, for instance, where, you know, with quick select, you would look at color boundaries and figure out how to sort of flood fill into regions that you thought were physically connected in the real world."}, {"time": 723, "text": "But that algorithm had no visual common sense about what a cat looks like or a dog."}, {"time": 728, "text": "It would just do it based on rules of thumb, which were applied to graph theory."}, {"time": 732, "text": "And it was a big improvement over the previous work where you had sort of almost click everything by hand."}, {"time": 739, "text": "Or if it just did similar colors, it would do little tiny regions that wouldn't be connected."}, {"time": 744, "text": "But in the future, using neural nets to actually do a great job with, say, a single click or even in the case of well known categories like people or animals, no click where you just say select the object

quality results or they can be a great start for like tweaking it."}, {"time": 771, "text": "So, for example, background removal."}, {"time": 774, "text": "Like one thing I'll, in a thumbnail, I'll take a picture of you right now and essentially remove the background behind you."}, {"time": 781, "text": "And I want to make that as easy as possible."}, {"time": 784, "text": "You don't have flowing hair, like rich at the moment."}, {"time": 788, "text": "I had it in the past."}, {"time": 790, "text": "It may come again in the future."}, {"time": 793, "text": "So that sometimes makes it a little more challenging to remove the background."}, {"time": 797, "text": "How difficult do you think is that problem for AI for basically making the quick selection tool smarter and smarter and smarter?"}, {"time": 805, "text": "Well, we have a lot of research on that already."}, {"time": 806, "text": "If you want a sort of quick, cheap and cheerful, look, I'm pretending I'm in Hawaii, but it's sort of a joke, then you don't need perfect boundaries."}, {"time": 816, "text": "And you can do that today with a single click with the algorithms we have."}, {"time": 820, "text": "We have other algorithms where with a little bit more guidance on the boundaries, like you might need to touch it up a little bit."}, {"time": 828, "text": "We have other algorithms that can pull a nice mat from a crude selection."}, {"time": 833, "text": "So we have combinations of tools that can do all of that."}, {"time": 837, "text": "And at our recent Max conference at Adobe Max, we demonstrated how very quickly, just by drawing a simple polygon around the object of interest, we could not only do it for a single still, but we could pull a mat, well, pull at least a selection mask from a moving target, like a person dancing in front of a brick wall or something."}, {"time": 859, "text": "And so it's going from hours to a few seconds for workflows that are really nice, and then you might go in and touch up a little."}, {"time": 868, "text": "So that's a really interesting question."}, {"time": 870, "text": "You mentioned the word robust."}, {"time": 871, "text": "You know, there's like a journey for an idea, right?"}, {"time": 876, "text": "And what you presented probably at Max has elements of just sort of, it inspires the concept, it can work pretty well in a majority of cases."}, {"time": 885, "text": "But how do you make something that works, well, in majority of cases, how do you make something that works, maybe in all cases, or it becomes a robust tool that can... Well, there are a couple of things."}, {"time": 897, "text": "So that really touches on the difference between academic research and industrial research."}, {"time": 902, "text": "So in academic research, it's really about who's the person to have the great new idea that shows promise."}, {"time": 909, "text": "And we certainly love to be those people too."}, {"time": 912, "text": "But we have sort of two forms of publishing."}, {"time": 915, "text": "One is academic peer review, which we do a lot of, and we have great success there as much as some universities."}, {"time": 922, "text": "But then we also have shipping, which is a different type of... And then we get customer review, as well as, you know, product critics."}, {"time": 930, "text": "And that might be a case where it's not about being perfect every single time, but perfect enough of the time, plus a mechanism to intervene and recover where you do have mistakes."}, {"time": 943, "text": "So we have the luxury of very talented customers."}, {"time": 946, "text": "We don't want them to be overly taxed doing it every time."}, {"time": 950, "text": "But if they can go in and just take it from 99 to 100 with the touch of a mouse or something, then for the professional end, that's something that we definitely want to support as well."}, {"time": 963, "text": "And for them, it went from having to do that tedious task all the time to much less often."}, {"time": 969, "text": "So I think that gives us an out."}, {"time": 969, "text": "If it had to be 100% automatic all the time, then that would delay the time at which we could get to market."}, {"time": 979, "text": "So on that thread, maybe you can untangle something."}, {"time": 983, "text": "Again, I'm sort of just speaking to my own experience."}, {"time": 988, "text": "Maybe that is the most useful."}, {"time": 990, "text": "So I think Photoshop, as an example, or Premiere, has a lot of amazing features that I haven't touched."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "And so in terms of AI helping make my life or the life of creatives easier, this collaboration between human and machine, how do you learn to collaborate better?"}, {"time": 1017, "text": "How do you learn the new algorithms?"}, {"time": 1018, "text": "Is it something where you have to watch tutorials and you have to watch videos and so on?"}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Or do you think about the experience itself through exploration, being the teacher?"}, {"time": 1030, "text": "We absolutely do."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "So I'm glad that you brought this up."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "We sort of think about two things."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "One is helping the person in the moment to do the task that they need to do, but the other is thinking more holistically about their journey learning a tool."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "And when it's like, think of it as Adobe University, where you use the tool long enough, you become an expert."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "And not necessarily an expert in everything."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "It's like living in a city."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "You don't necessarily know every street, but you know the important ones you need to get to."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "So we have projects in research, which actually look at the thousands of hours of tutorials online and try to understand what's being taught in them."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And then we had one publication at CHI where it was looking at, given the last three or four actions you did, what did other people in tutorials do next?"}, {"time": 1074, "text": "So if you want some inspiration for what you might do next, or you just want to watch the tutorial and see, learn from people who are doing similar workflows to you, you can without having to go and search on keywords and everything."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "So really trying to use the context of your use of the app to make intelligent suggestions, either about choices that you might make, or in a more assistive way, where it could say, if you did this next, we could show you."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And that's basically the frontier that we're exploring now, which is, if we really deeply understand the domain in which designers and creative people work, can we combine that with AI and pattern matching of behavior to make intelligent suggestions, either through, you know, verbal, possibilities, or just showing the results of if you try this."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And that's really the sort of, you know, I was in a meeting today thinking about these things."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "Well, it's still a grand challenge."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "You know, we'd all love an artist over one shoulder and a teacher over the other, right?"}, {"time": 1137, "text": "And we hope to get there."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "And the right thing to do is to give enough at each stage that it's useful in itself, but it builds a foundation for the next stage."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Give enough at each stage that it's useful in itself, but it builds a foundation for the next level of expectation."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "Are you aware of this gigantic medium of YouTube that's creating just a bunch of creative people, both artists and teachers of different kinds?"}, {"time": 1166, "text": "And the more we can understand those media types, both visually and in terms of transcripts and words, the more we can bring the wisdom that they embody into the guidance that's embedded in the tool."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "That would be brilliant to remove the barrier from having to yourself type in the keyword searching, so on."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And then in the longer term, an interesting discussion is, does it ultimately not just assist with learning the interface we have, but does it modify the interface to be simpler?"}, {"time": 1196, "text": "Or do you fragment into a variety of tools, each of which has a different level of visibility of the functionality?"}, {"time": 1202, "text": "I like to say that if you add a feature to a GUI, you have to have yet more visual complexity confronting the new user."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "Whereas if you have an assistant with a new skill, if you know they have it, so you know to ask for it, then it's sort of additive without being more intimidating."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "So we definitely think about new users and how to onboard them."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Many actually value the idea of being able to master that complex interface and keyboard shortcuts like you were talking about earlier, because with great familiarity, it becomes a musical instrument for expressing your visual ideas."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And other people just want to get something done quickly in the simplest way possible."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "And that's where a more assistive version of the same technology might be useful, maybe on a different class of device, which is more in context for CAPTCHA, say."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "Whereas somebody who's in a deep post production workflow maybe want to be on a laptop or a big screen desktop and have more knobs and dials to really express the subtlety of what they want to do."}, {"time": 1295,

replace is interesting because we talked about selection being sort of an atomic operation."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "It's almost like if you think of an assembly language, it's like a single instruction."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "Whereas sky replace is a compound action where you automatically select the sky, you look for stock content that matches the geometry of the scene."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "You try to have variety in your choices so that you do coverage of different moods."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "It then mats in the sky behind the foreground."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "But then importantly, it uses the foreground of the other image that you just searched on to recolor the foreground of the image that you're editing."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "So if you say go from a midday sky to an evening sky, it will actually add sort of an orange glow to the foreground objects as well."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "I was a big fan in college of Magritte and he has a number of paintings where it's surrealism because he'll like do a composite, but the foreground building will be at night and the sky will be during the day."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "There's one called The Empire of Light, which was on my wall in college."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "And we're trying not to do surrealism."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "It can be a choice, but we'd rather have it be natural by default rather than it looking fake."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "And then you have to do a whole bunch of post production to fix it."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "So that's a case where we're kind of capturing an entire workflow into a single action and doing it in about a second rather than a minute or two."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And when you do that, you can not just do it once, but you can do it for say like 10 different backgrounds."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "And then you're almost back to this inspiration idea of I don't know quite what I want, but I'll know it when I see it."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And you can just explore the design space as close to final production value as possible."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And then when you really pick one, you might go back and slightly tweak the selection mask just to make it perfect and do that kind of polish that professionals like to bring to their work."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "So then there's this idea of, you mentioned the sky, replacing it to different stock images of the sky."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "But in general, you have this idea."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "Or it could be on your disc or whatever."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Disc, right."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "But making even more intelligent choices about ways to search stock images, which is really interesting."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "It's kind of spatial."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "So that was something we called concept canvas."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "So normally when you do a say an image search, you would I assuming it's just based on text, you would give the keywords of the things you want to be in the image, and it would find the nearest one that had those tags."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "For many tasks, you really want, you know, to be able to say I want a big person in the middle or in a dog to the right and umbrella above the left because you want to leave space for the text or whatever for the and so concept canvas lets you assign spatial regions to the keywords."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "And then we've already pre indexed the images to know where the important concepts are in the picture."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "So we then go through that index matching to assets."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "And even though it's just another form of search, because you're doing spatial design or layout, it starts to feel like design, you sort of feel oddly responsible for the image that comes back as if you invented it."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "So it's, it's a it's a good example where giving enough control starts to make people have a sense of ownership over the outcome of the event."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "And then we also have technologies in Photoshop, we physically can move the dog in post as well."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "But for concept canvas, it was just a very fast way to sort of loop through and be able to lay things out."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "And in terms of being able to remove objects from a scene and fill in the background, right, automatically."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "I so that's extremely exciting."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "And that's so neural networks are stepping in there."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "I just talked this week, Ian Goodfellow, so the GANs for doing that is definitely one approach."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "So that is that is that a really difficult problem?"}, {"time": 1556, "text": "Is it as difficult as it looks, again, to take it to a robust product level?"}, {"time": 1561, "text": "Well, there are certain classes of image for which the traditional algorithms like content aware fill work really well, like if you have a naturalistic texture, like a gravel path or something, because it's patch based, it will make up a very plausible looking intermediate thing and fill in the hole."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "And then we use some algorithms to sort of smooth out the lighting so you don't see any brightness contrast in that region, or you've gradually ramped from one from dark to light, if it straddles the boundary, where it gets complicated as if you have to infer invisible structure behind behind the person in front."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "And that really requires a common sense knowledge of the world to know what, you know, if I see three quarters of a house, do I have a rough sense of what the rest of the house looks like?"}, {"time": 1605, "text": "If you just fill it in with patches, it can end up sort of doing things that make sense locally, but you look at the global structure, and it looks like it's just sort of crumpled or messed up."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "And so what GANs and neural nets bring to the table is this common sense learned from the training set."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "And the challenge right now is that the generative methods that can make up missing holes using that kind of technology are still only stable at low resolutions."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And so you either need to then go from a low resolution to a high resolution using some other algorithm, or we need to push the state of the art and it's still in research to get to that point."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "Of course, if you show it something, say it's trained on houses, and then you show it an octopus, it's not going to do a very good job of showing common sense about octopuses."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "So again, you're asking about how you know that it's ready for primetime."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "You really need a very diverse training set of images."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "And ultimately, that may be a case where you put it out there with some guardrails where you might do a detector which looks at the image and sort of estimates its own competence of how well a job could this algorithm do."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "So eventually, there may be this idea of what we call an ensemble of experts where any particular expert is specialized in certain things."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And then there's sort of a, either they vote to say how confident they are about what to do, this is sort of more future looking, or there's some dispatcher which says you're good at houses, you're good at trees."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "So I mean, all this adds up to a lot of work because each of those models will be a whole bunch of work."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "But I think over time, you'd gradually fill out the set and initially focus on certain workflows and then sort of branch out as you get more capable."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "You mentioned workflows, and have you considered maybe looking far into the future?"}, {"time": 1763, "text": "And this is a big topic in the whole world of AI is what data can you gather and why?"}, {"time": 1767, "text": "At one level, a way to think about it is we not only want to train our customers in how to use our products, but we want them to teach us what's important and what's useful."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "At the same time, we want to respect their privacy."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "And obviously, we wouldn't do things without their explicit permission."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "And I think the modern spirit of the age around this is you have to demonstrate to somebody how they're benefiting from sharing their data with the tool."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "Either it's helping in the short term to understand their intent, so you can make better recommendations, or if they're friendly to your cause, or your tool, or they want to help you evolve quickly, because they depend on you for their livelihood, they may be willing to share some of their workflows or choices with the data set to be then trained."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "There are technologies for looking at learning without necessarily storing all the information permanently, so that you can sort of learn on the fly, but not keep a record of what somebody did."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "So we're definitely exploring all of those possibilities."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "It's nice for you to say that."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "I mean, I think there are some professional workflows where people might be very protective of what they're doing, such as if I was preparing evidence for a legal case, I wouldn't want any of that, you know, phoning home to help train the algorithm or anything."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "There may be other cases where people are, say, having a trial version, or they're doing some, I'm not saying we're doing this today, but there's a future scenario where somebody has a more permissive relationship with Adobe, where they explicitly say, I'm fine, I'm only doing hobby projects, or things which are non confidential."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "And in exchange for some benefit, tangible or otherwise, I'm willing to share very fine grained data."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "So another possible scenario is to capture relatively crude, high level things from more people, and then more detailed knowledge from people who are willing to participate."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "We do that today with explicit customer studies where, you know, we go and visit somebody and ask them to try the tool and we human observe what they're doing."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "In the future, to be able to do that enough to be able to train an algorithm, we'd need a more systematic process."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "But we'd have to do it very consciously, because is one of the things people treasure about Adobe is a sense of trust."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And we don't want to endanger that through overly aggressive data collection."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "So we have a chief privacy officer."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "And it's definitely front and center of thinking about AI rather than an afterthought."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Well, when you start that program, sign me up."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "Okay, happy to."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "Is there other projects that you wanted to mention that that I didn't perhaps that pop into mind?"}, {"time": 1967, "text": "Well, you covered the number, I think you mentioned Project Puppetron, I think that one is interesting, because it's, you might think of Adobe as only thinking in 2d."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "And that's a good example where we're actually thinking more three dimensionally about how to assign features to faces so that we can, you know, if you take so what puppet run does, it takes either a still or a video of a person talking, and then it can take a painting of somebody else and then apply the style of the painting to the person who's talking in the video."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "And it's unlike a sort of screen door post filter effect that you sometimes see online, it really looks as though it's sort of somehow attached or reflecting the motion of the face."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "And so that's the case where even to do a 2d workflow, like stylization, you really need to infer more about the 3d structure of the world."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And I think, as 3d computer vision algorithms get better, initially, they'll focus on particular domains, like faces, where you have a lot of prior knowledge about structure, and you can maybe have a parameterized template that you fit to the image."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "But over time, this should be possible for more general content."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And it might even be invisible to the user that you're doing 3d reconstruction, but under the hood, but it

that extent, it's a bit like a really, really widescreen television, where it sort of snaps you out of your context and puts you in a new one."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "And I think it's still evolving in terms of the hardware."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "I actually worked on VR in the 90s trying to solve the latency and sort of nausea problem, which we did, but it was very expensive and a bit early."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "There's a new wave of that now, I think."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "And increasingly, those devices are becoming all in one rather than something that's tethered to a box."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "I think the market seems to be bifurcating into things for consumers and things for professional use cases, like for architects and people designing where your product is a building and you really want to experience it better than looking at a scale model or a drawing, I think, or even than a video."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "So I think for that, where you need a sense of scale and spatial relationships, it's great."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "I think AR holds the promise of sort of taking digital assets off the screen and putting them in context in the real world on the table in front of you, on the wall behind you."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "And that has the corresponding need that the assets need to adapt to the physical context in which they're being placed."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "I mean, it's a bit like having a live theater troupe come to your house and put on Hamlet."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "My mother had a friend who used to do this at Stately Homes in England for the National Trust."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "And they would adapt the scenes and even they'd walk the audience through the rooms to see the action based on the country house they found themselves in for two days."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "And I think AR will have the same issue that, you know, if you have a tiny table and a big living room or something, it'll try to figure out what can you change and what's fixed."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "And there's a little bit of a tension between fidelity where if you captured, say, Nureyev doing a fantastic ballet, you'd want it to be sort of exactly reproduced."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "And maybe all you could do is scale it down."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "Whereas somebody telling you a story might be walking around the room doing some gestures and that could adapt to the room in which they were telling the story."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "And do you think fidelity is that important in that space or is it more about the storytelling?"}, {"time": 2230, "text": "I think it may depend on the characteristic of the media."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "If it's a famous celebrity, then it may be that you want to catch every nuance and they don't want to be reanimated by some algorithm."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "It could be that if it's really, you know, a lovable frog telling you a story and it's about a princess and a frog, then it doesn't matter if the frog moves in a different way."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "I think a lot of the ideas that have sort of grown up in the game world will now come into the broader commercial sphere once they're needing adaptive characters in AR."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "Are you thinking of engineering tools that allow creators to create in the augmented world, basically making a Photoshop for the augmented world?"}, {"time": 2276, "text": "Well, we have shown a few demos of sort of taking a Photoshop layer stack and then expanding it into 3D."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "That's actually been shown publicly as one example in AR."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "Where we're particularly excited at the moment is in 3D."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "3D design is still a very challenging space."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "And we believe that it's a worthwhile experiment to try to figure out if AR or immersive makes 3D design more spontaneous."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "Can you give me an example of 3D design, just like applications?"}, {"time": 2306, "text": "Literally, a simple one would be laying out objects, right?"}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So on a conventional screen, you'd sort of have a plan view and a side view and a perspective view, and you'd sort of be dragging it around with a mouse."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "And if you're not careful, it would go through the wall and all that."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "Whereas if you were really laying out objects, say, in a VR headset, you could literally move your head to see a different viewpoint."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "They'd be in stereo."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "So you'd have a sense of depth because you're already wearing the depth glasses, right?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "So it would be those sort of big gross motor move things around kind of skills seem much more spontaneous, just like they are in the real world."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "The frontier for us, I think, is whether that same medium can be used to do fine grained design tasks, like very accurate constraints on, say, a CAD model or something that may be better done on a desktop, but it may just be a matter of inventing the right UI."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "So we're hopeful that because there will be this potential explosion of demand for 3D assets driven by AR and more real time animation on conventional screens, that those tools will also help with, or those devices will help with designing the content as well."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "You've mentioned quite a few interesting sort of new ideas."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "And at the same time, there's old timers like me that are stuck in their old ways and are... Well, I think I'm the old timer."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "But the opposed all change at all costs."}, {"time": 2397, "text": "When you're thinking about creating new interfaces, do you feel the burden of just this giant user base that loves the current product?"}, {"time": 2402, "text": "So anything new you do, any new idea comes at a cost that you'll be resisted?"}, {"time": 2413, "text": "Well, I think if you have to trade off control for convenience, then our existing user base would definitely be offended by that."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "I think if there are some things where you have more convenience and just as much control, that may be more welcome."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "We do think about not breaking well known metaphors for things."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "So things should sort of make sense."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "Photoshop has never been a static target."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "It's always been evolving and growing."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "And to some extent, there's been a lot of brilliant thought along the way of how it works today."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "So we don't want to just throw all that out."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "If there's a fundamental breakthrough, like a single click is good enough to select an object rather than having to do lots of strokes, that actually fits in quite nicely to the existing toolset, either as an optional mode or as a starting point."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "I think where we're looking at radical simplicity, where you could encapsulate an entire workflow with a much simpler UI, then sometimes that's easier to do in the context of either a different device, like a mobile device, where the affordances are naturally different."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "Or in a tool that's targeted at a different workflow, where it's about spontaneity and velocity rather than precision."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "And we have projects like Rush, which can let you do professional quality video editing for a certain class of media output that is targeted very differently in terms of users and the experience."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "And ideally, people would go, if I'm feeling like doing Premiere, big project, I'm doing a four part television series, that's definitely a Premiere thing."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "But if I want to do something to show my recent vacation, maybe I'll just use Rush because I can do it in the half an hour I have free at home rather than the four hours I need to do it at work."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "And for the use cases, which we can do well, it really is much faster to get the same output."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "But the more professional tools obviously have a much richer toolkit and more flexibility in what they can do."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And then at the same time with the flexibility and control, I like this idea of smart defaults, of using AI to coach you to like what Google has, I'm feeling lucky button."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "Or one button kind of gives you a pretty good set of settings."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "And then that's almost an educational tool to show."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "Because sometimes when you have all this control, you're not sure about the correlation between the different bars that control different elements of the image and so on."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "And sometimes there's a degree of, you don't know what the optimal is."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "And then some things are sort of on demand, like help, right?"}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Where I'm stuck, I need to know what to look for."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "I'm not quite sure what it's called."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "And something that was proactively making helpful suggestions or, you could imagine a make a suggestion button where you'd use all of that knowledge of workflows and everything to maybe suggest something to go and learn about or just to try or show the answer."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "And maybe it's not one intelligent default, but it's like a variety of defaults."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And then you go, I like that one."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "Several options."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "So back to poetry."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "We're going to interleave."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "So first few lines of a recent poem of yours before I ask the

the ocean glass, but I was still just me."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "This is a poem about you leaving your phone behind and feeling quite liberated because of it."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "So this is kind of a difficult topic and let's see if we can talk about it, figure it out."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "But so with the help of AI more and more, we can create sort of versions of ourselves, versions of reality that are in some ways more beautiful than actual reality."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "And some of the creative ways that we can do that, some of the creative effort there is part of creating this illusion."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "So of course this is inevitable, but how do you think we should adjust as human beings to live in this digital world that's partly artificial, that's better than the world that we lived in a hundred years ago when you didn't have Instagram and Facebook versions of ourselves and the online Oh, this is sort of showing off better versions of ourselves."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "We're using the tooling of modifying the images or even with artificial intelligence ideas of deep fakes and creating adjusted or fake versions of ourselves and reality."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "I think it's an interesting question."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "You're all sort of historical bent on this."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "So I actually wonder if 18th century aristocrats who commissioned famous painters to paint portraits of them had portraits that were slightly nicer than they actually looked in practice."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "So human desire to put your best foot forward has always been true."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "I think it's interesting."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "You sort of framed it in two ways."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "One is if we can imagine alternate realities and visualize them, is that a good or bad thing?"}, {"time": 2742, "text": "In the old days, you do it with storytelling and words and poetry, which still resides sometimes on websites, but we've become a very visual culture in particular."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "In the 19th century, we're very much a text based culture."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "People would read long tracks, political speeches were very long."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "Nowadays, everything's very kind of quick and visual and snappy."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "I think it depends on how harmless your intent."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "A lot of it's about intent."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "So if you have a somewhat flattering photo that you pick out of the photos that you have in your inbox to say, this is what I look like, it's probably fine."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "If someone's going to judge you by how you look, then they'll decide soon enough when they meet you whether the reality, you know."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "I think where it can be harmful is if people hold themselves up to an impossible standard, which they then feel bad about themselves for not meeting."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "I think that definitely can be an issue."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "But I think the ability to imagine and visualize an alternate reality, which sometimes you then go off and build later, can be a wonderful thing too."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "People can imagine architectural styles, which they then, you know, have a startup, make a fortune, and then build a house that looks like their favorite video game."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "Is that a terrible thing?"}, {"time": 2837, "text": "I think I used to worry about exploration, actually, that part of the joy of going to the moon."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "When I was a tiny child, I remember it in grainy black and white, was to know what it would look like when you got there."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And I think now we have such good graphics for visualizing the experience before it happens, that I slightly worry that it may take the edge off actually wanting to go, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 2860, "text": "Because we've seen it on TV."}, {"time": 2860, "text": "We kind of, oh, you know, by the time we finally get to Mars, we'll go, yeah, yeah, so it's Mars."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "That's what it looks like."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "But then, you know, the outer exploration, I mean, I think Pluto was a fantastic recent discovery where nobody had any idea what it looked like."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "And it was just breathtakingly varied and beautiful."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "So I think expanding the ability of the human toolkit to imagine and communicate on balance is a good thing."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "I think there are abuses, we definitely take them seriously and try to discourage them."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "I think there's a parallel side where the public needs to know what's possible through events like this, right?"}, {"time": 2901, "text": "So that you don't believe everything you read in print anymore."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "And it may over time become true of images as well."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "Or you need multiple sets of evidence to really believe something rather than a single media asset."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So I think it's a constantly evolving thing."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "It's been true forever."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "There's a famous story about Anne of Cleves and Henry VIII where luckily for Anne, they didn't get married, right?"}, {"time": 2925, "text": "So, or they got married and broke up in it."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "What's the story?"}, {"time": 2934, "text": "Oh, so Holbein went and painted a picture and then Henry VIII wasn't pleased and, you know, history doesn't record whether Anne was pleased, but I think she was pleased not to be married more than a day or something."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "So, I mean, this has gone on for a long time, but I think it's just a part of the magnification of human capability."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "You've kind of built up an amazing research environment here, research culture, research lab, and you've written that the secret to a thriving research lab is interns."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "Can you unpack that a little bit?"}, {"time": 2966, "text": "So a couple of reasons."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "As you see looking at my personal history, there are certain ideas you bond with at a certain stage of your career and you tend to keep revisiting them through time."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "If you're lucky, you pick one that doesn't just get solved in the next five years and then you're sort of out of luck."}, {"time": 2983, "text": "So I think a constant influx of new people brings new ideas with it."}, {"time": 2988, "text": "From the point of view of industrial research, because a big part of what we do is really taking those ideas to the point where they can ship as very robust features, you end up investing a lot in a particular idea."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "And if you're not careful, people can get too conservative in what they choose to do next, knowing that the product teams will want it."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "And interns let you explore the more fanciful or unproven ideas in a relatively lightweight way, ideally leading to new publications for the intern and for the researcher."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "And it gives you then a portfolio from which to draw which idea am I going to then try to take all the way through to being robust in the next year or two to ship."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "So it sort of becomes part of the funnel."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "It's also a great way for us to identify future full time researchers."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "Many of our greatest researchers were former interns."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "It builds a bridge to university departments so we can get to know and build an enduring relationship with the professors whom we often do academic give funds to as well as an acknowledgement of the value the interns add in their own collaborations."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "So it's sort of a virtuous cycle."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "And then the long term legacy of a great research lab hopefully will be not only the people who stay, but the ones who move through and then go off and carry that same model to other companies."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "And so we believe strongly in industrial research and how it can complement academia."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "And we hope that this model will continue to propagate and be invested in by other companies, which makes it harder for us to recruit, of course, but that's a sign of success."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And a rising tide lifts all ships in that sense."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And where's the idea born with the interns?"}, {"time": 3094, "text": "Is there brainstorming?"}, {"time": 3094, "text": "Is there discussions about, you know, like what?"}, {"time": 3102, "text": "Where do the ideas come from?"}, {"time": 3103, "text": "As I'm asking the question, I realize how dumb it is, but I'm hoping you have a better answer."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "A question I ask at the beginning of every summer."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "So what will happen is we'll send out a call for interns."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "They'll, we'll have a number of resumes come in."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "People will contact the candidates, talk to them about their interests."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "They'll usually try to find some, somebody who has a reasonably good match to what they're already doing, or just has a really interesting domain that they've been pursuing in their PhD."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "And we think we'd love to do one of those projects too."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "And then the intern stays in touch with the mentor, as we call them."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "And then they come and at the end of two weeks, they have to decide."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "So they'll often have a general sense by the time they arrive."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "And we'll have internal discussions about what are all the general ideas that we're wanting to pursue to see whether two people have the same idea, and maybe they should talk and all that."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "But then once the intern actually arrives, sometimes the idea goes linearly."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "And sometimes it takes a giant left turn."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "And we go, that sounded good."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "But when we thought about it, there's this other project, or it's already been done."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "And we found this paper, we were scooped."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "But we have this other great idea."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "So it's pretty, pretty flexible at the beginning."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "One of the questions for research labs is who's deciding what to do?"}, {"time": 3182, "text": "And then who's to blame if it goes wrong?"}, {"time": 3188, "text": "Who gets the credit if it goes right?"}, {"time": 3188, "text": "And so in Adobe, we push the needle very much towards freedom of choice of projects by the researchers and the interns."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "But then we reward people based on impact."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "So if the projects ultimately end up impacting the products and having papers and so on."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "And so your alternative model, just to be clear, is that you have one lab director who thinks he's a genius and tells everybody what to do, takes all the credit if it goes well, blames everybody else if it goes badly."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "So we don't want that model."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "And this helps new ideas percolate up."}, {"time": 3225, "text": "The art of running such a lab is that there are strategic priorities for the company."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "And there are areas where we do want to invest and pressing problems."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "And so it's a little bit of a trickle down and filter up meets in the middle."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "And so you don't tell people you have to do X, but you say X would be particularly appreciated this year."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "And then people reinterpret X through the filter of things they want to do and they're interested in."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "And miraculously, it usually comes together very well."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "One thing that really helps is Adobe has a really broad portfolio of products."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "So if we have a good idea, there's usually a product team that is intrigued or interested."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "So it means we don't have to qualify things too much ahead of time."}, {"time": 3270, "text": "Once in a while, the product teams sponsor extra intern, because they have a particular problem that they really care about, in which case it's a little bit more, we really need one of these."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "And then we sort of say, great, I get an extra intern, we find an intern who thinks that's a great problem."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "But that's not the typical model."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "That's sort of the icing on the cake as far as the budget is concerned."}, {"time": 3288, "text": "And all of the above end up being important."}, {"time": 3288, "text": "It's really hard to predict at the beginning of the summer, which we all have high hopes of all of the intern projects, but ultimately, some of them pay off and some of them sort of are a nice paper, but don't turn into a feature."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "Others turn out not to be as novel as we thought, but they'd be a great feature, but not a paper."}, {"time": 3309, "text": "And then others, we make a little bit of progress and we realize how much we don't know."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And maybe we revisit that problem several years in a row until it, finally we have a breakthrough and then it becomes more on track to impact a product."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "Jumping back to a big overall view of Adobe research, what are you looking forward to in 2019 and beyond?"}, {"time": 3332, "text": "What is, you mentioned there's a giant suite of products, a giant suite of ideas, new interns, a large team of researchers."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "What do you think the future holds?"}, {"time": 3352, "text": "In terms of the technological breakthroughs?"}, {"time": 3354, "text": "Technological breakthroughs, especially ones that will make it into product, will get to impact the world."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "So I think the creative or the analytics assistants that we talked about where they're constantly trying to figure out what you're trying to do and how can they be helpful and make useful suggestions is a really hot topic."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "And it's very unpredictable as to when it'll be ready, but I'm really looking forward to seeing how much progress we make against that."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "I think some of the core technologies like generative adversarial networks are immensely promising and seeing how quickly those become practical for mainstream use cases at high resolution with really good quality is also exciting."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "And they also have this sort of strange way of even the things they do oddly are odd in an interesting way."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "So it can look like dreaming or something."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "So that's fascinating."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "I think internally, we have a Sensei platform, which is a way in which we're pulling our neural nets and other intelligence models into a central platform, which can then be leveraged by multiple product teams at once."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "So we're in the middle of transitioning from once you have a good idea, you pick a product team to work with and they sort of hand design it for that use case to a more sort of Henry Ford standard up in a standard way, which can be accessed in a standard way, which should mean that the time between a good idea and impacting our products will be greatly shortened."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "And when one product has a good idea, many of the other products can just leverage it too."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "So it's sort of an economy of scale."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "So that's more about the how than the what."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "But that combination of this sort of renaissance in AI, there's a comparable one in graphics with real time ray tracing and other really exciting emerging technologies."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "And when these all come together, you'll sort of basically be dancing with light, right, where you'll have real time shadows, reflections and as if it's a real world in front of you."},

we can ask is, if you look at all the air safety violations, all the crashes that occurred, would they have happened if the plane were truly autonomous?"}, {"time": 978, "text": "And I think you'll find that in many of the cases, because of pilot error, we made silly decisions."}, {"time": 984, "text": "And so in some sense, even in air traffic, commercial air traffic, there's a lot of applications, although we only see autonomy being enabled at very high altitudes when the plane is an autopilot."}, {"time": 998, "text": "The plane is an autopilot."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "There's still a role for the human and that kind of autonomy is, you're kind of implying, I don't know what the right word is, but it's a little dumber than it could be."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "Right, so in the lab, of course, we can afford to be a lot more aggressive."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "And the question we try to ask is, can we make robots that will be able to make decisions without any kind of external infrastructure?"}, {"time": 1034, "text": "So the most common piece of infrastructure that airplanes use today is GPS."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "GPS is also the most brittle form of information."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "If you have driven in a city, try to use GPS navigation, in tall buildings, you immediately lose GPS."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "And so that's not a very sophisticated way of building autonomy."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "I think the second piece of infrastructure they rely on is communications."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "Again, it's very easy to jam communications."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "In fact, if you use wifi, you know that wifi signals drop out, cell signals drop out."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So to rely on something like that is not good."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "The third form of infrastructure we use, and I hate to call it infrastructure, but it is that, in the sense of robots, is people."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "So you could rely on somebody to pilot you."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "And so the question you wanna ask is, if there are no pilots, there's no communications with any base station, if there's no knowledge of position, and if there's no a priori map, a priori knowledge of what the environment looks like, a priori model of what might happen in the future, can robots navigate?"}, {"time": 1109, "text": "So that is true autonomy."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "So that's true autonomy, and we're talking about, you mentioned like military application of drones."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "Okay, so what else is there?"}, {"time": 1118, "text": "You talk about agile, autonomous flying robots, aerial robots, so that's a different kind of, it's not winged, it's not big, at least it's small."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "So I use the word agility mostly, or at least we're motivated to do agile robots, mostly because robots can operate and should be operating in constrained environments."}, {"time": 1142,

building, for example, for search and rescue, or to locate an active shooter, or you wanna navigate under the canopy in an orchard to look at health of plants, or to look for, to count fruits, to measure the tree trunks."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "These are things we do, by the way."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "There's some cool agriculture stuff you've shown in the past, it's really awesome."},

1185, "text": "What it really means is you see the unexpected and you're able to maneuver in a safe way, and in a way that gets you the most information about the thing you're trying to do."},

it take to make a thing with four motors fly, a quadcopter, one of these little flying robots?"}, {"time": 1241, "text": "How hard is it to make it fly?"}, {"time": 1243, "text": "How do you coordinate the four motors?"}, {"time": 1246, "text": "How do you convert those motors into actual movement?"}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So this is an interesting question."}, {"time": 1254, "text":

didn't anticipate this boom in IMUs."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "But if you look, subsequently what happened is that every car manufacturer had to put an airbag in, which meant you had to have an

interesting, the connection there."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "And that's why research is very, it's very hard to predict the outcomes."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "And again, the federal government spent a ton of money on things that they thought were useful for resonators, but it ended up enabling these small UAVs, which is great, because I could have never raised that much money and sold this

one."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "How do you coordinate the motors to develop this?"}, {"time": 1360, "text": "But over the last 10 years, everything is commoditized."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "A high school kid today can pick up a Raspberry Pi kit and build this."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "All the low levels functionality is all automated."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "But basically at some level,

what the angular velocity is."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "And those are important pieces of information."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "In addition to that, you need some kind of local position or velocity information."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "For example, when we walk, we implicitly have this information because we kind of know what our stride length is."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "We also are looking at images fly past our retina, if you will, and so we can estimate velocity."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "We also have accelerometers in our head, and we're able to integrate all these pieces of information to determine where we are as we walk."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "And so robots have to do something very similar."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "You need an IMU, you need some kind of a camera or other sensor that's measuring velocity, and then you need some kind of a global reference frame if you really want to think about doing something in a world coordinate system."}, {"time": 1461,

of the four motors is what allows you to, first of all, fly and hover, and then you can change the orientation and the velocity and so on."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "So it's a bunch of degrees of freedom that you're complaining about."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "There's six degrees of freedom, but you only have four inputs, the four motors."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And it turns out to be a remarkably versatile configuration."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "You think at first, well, I only have four motors, how do I go sideways?"}, {"time": 1495, "text": "But it's not too hard to say, well, if I tilt myself, I can go sideways, and then you have four motors pointing up, how do I rotate in place about a vertical axis?"}, {"time": 1505, "text": "Well, you rotate them at different speeds and that generates reaction moments and that allows you to turn."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "So it's actually a pretty, it's an optimal configuration from an engineer standpoint."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "It's very simple, very cleverly done, and very versatile."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "So if you could step back to a time, so I've always known flying robots as, to me, it was natural that a quadcopter should fly."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "But when you first started working with it, how surprised are you that you can make, do so much with the four motors?"}, {"time": 1545, "text": "How surprising is it that you can make this thing fly, first of all, that you can make it hover, that you can add control to it?"}, {"time": 1552, "text": "Firstly, this is not, the four motor configuration is not ours."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "You can, it has at least a hundred year history."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "And various people, various people try to get quadrotors to fly without much success."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "As I said, we've been working on this since 2000."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "Our first designs were, well, this is way too complicated."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Why not we try to get an omnidirectional flying robot?"}, {"time": 1578, "text": "So our early designs, we had eight rotors."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "And so these eight rotors were arranged uniformly on a sphere, if you will."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "So you can imagine a symmetric configuration."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And so you should be able to fly anywhere."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "But the real challenge we had is the strength to weight ratio is not enough."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "And of course, we didn't have the sensors and so on."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So everybody knew, or at least the people who worked with rotorcrafts knew, four rotors will get it done."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "So that was not our idea."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "But it took a while before we could actually do the onboard sensing and the computation that was needed for the kinds of agile maneuvering that we wanted to do in our little aerial robots."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "And that only happened between 2007 and 2009 in our lab."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "Yeah, and you have to send the signal maybe a hundred times a second."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "So the compute there, everything has to come down in price."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "And what are the steps of getting from point A to point B?"}, {"time": 1641, "text": "So we just talked about like local control."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "But if all the kind of cool dancing in the air that I've seen you show, how do you make it happen?"}, {"time": 1654, "text": "How do you make a trajectory?"},

trajectory."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "It has to be safe."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "It has to be efficient."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "So everybody's familiar with that."}, {"time": 1686, "text":

you're looking for safe, optimal motions."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "The other thing you have to think about is can you actually compute a reasonable trajectory in a small amount of time?"}, {"time": 1720, "text": "Cause you have a time budget."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "So the optimal becomes suboptimal, but in our lab we focus on synthesizing smooth trajectory that satisfy all the constraints."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "In other words, don't violate any safety constraints and is as efficient as possible."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "And when I say efficient, it could mean I want to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible, or I want to get to it as gracefully as possible, or I want to consume as little energy as possible."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "But always staying within the safety constraints."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "But yes, always finding a safe trajectory."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "So there's a lot of excitement and progress in the field of machine learning and reinforcement learning and the neural network variant of that with deep reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "Do you see a role of machine learning in, so a lot of the success of flying robots did not rely on machine learning, except for maybe a little bit of the perception on the computer vision side."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "On the control side and the

out in my work, called out learning, but even this very simple idea of being able to fly through a constrained space."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "The first time you try it, you'll invariably, you might get it wrong if the task is challenging."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "And the reason is to get it perfectly right, you have to model everything in the environment."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And flying is notoriously hard to model."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "There are aerodynamic effects that we constantly discover."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "Even just before I was talking to you, I was talking to a student about how blades flap when they fly."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And that ends up changing how a rotorcraft is accelerated in the angular direction."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "Does he use like micro flaps or something?"}, {"time": 1846, "text": "It's not micro flaps."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "So we assume that each blade is rigid, but actually it flaps a little bit."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "It bends."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "Interesting, yeah."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "And so the models rely on the fact, on the assumption that they're not rigid."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "On the assumption that they're actually rigid, but that's not true."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "If you're flying really quickly, these effects become significant."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "If you're

be tremendous."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "Plus, to get everything right would be awfully tedious."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "So the way we do this is over time, we figure out how to adapt to these conditions."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "So early on, we use the form of learning that we call iterative learning."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "So this idea, if you want to perform a task, there are a few things that you need to change and iterate over a few parameters that over time you can figure out."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "So I could call it policy gradient reinforcement learning, but actually it was just iterative learning."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "Iterative learning."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "And so this was there way back."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "I think what's interesting is, if

forward, the right way to think about these things is data driven approaches, learning based approaches, in concert with model based approaches, which is the traditional way of doing things."},

up from by the propellers, the downwash kicks up dust."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "I challenge you to get a computer vision algorithm to work there."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "So we use LIDARs in that

"text": "So what's your intuition there?"}, {"time": 2115, "text": "So look, if you have a corner case and your algorithm doesn't work, your instinct is to go get data about the corner case and patch it up, learn how to deal with that corner case."}, {"time": 2127, "text": "But at some point, this is gonna saturate, this approach is not viable."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "So today, computer vision

wanna go from 99% to 99.9%."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "That's even more data."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "So I think if you look at wanting accuracy on the X axis and look at the amount of data on the

it's exponential."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "And the other thing you have to think about is that this process is a very, very power hungry process to run data farms or servers."}, {"time": 2192,

it is an energy processing problem."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "And so unless we figured out better ways of doing this, I don't think this is viable."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "So talking about driving, which is a safety critical application and some aspect of flight is safety critical, maybe philosophical question, maybe an engineering one, what problem do you think is harder to solve,

those exist in the three dimensional space as well."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "So they do."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "So the question also implies how difficult are obstacles in the three dimensional space in flight?"}, {"time": 2303, "text": "So that's the downside."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "I think in three dimensional space, you're modeling three dimensional world, not just because you want to avoid it, but you want to reason about it, and you want to work in the three dimensional environment, and that's significantly harder."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "So that's one disadvantage."},

applications."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So there's a lot of applications of flying robots, but do you see a time in the future where there's tens of thousands, or maybe hundreds of thousands of

minutes."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "So just delivering drugs, retrieving samples for testing vaccines, I think there's huge potential here."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "So I think the challenges are not technological, but the challenge is economical."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "The one thing I'll tell you that nobody thinks about is the fact that we've not made huge strides in battery technology."},

2428, "text": "And if you look at the energy density and the power density, those are two fundamentally limiting numbers."}, {"time": 2438, "text": "So power density is important because for a UAV to take off vertically into the air, which most drones do, they don't have a runway, you consume roughly 200 watts per kilo at the small size."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "That's a lot, right?"}, {"time": 2453, "text": "In contrast, the human brain consumes less than 80 watts, the whole of the human brain."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "So just imagine just lifting yourself into the air is like two or three light bulbs, which makes no sense to me."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "Yeah, so you're going to have to at scale solve the energy problem then, charging the batteries, storing the energy and so on."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "And then the storage is the second problem, but storage limits the range."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "But you have to remember that you have to burn a lot of it per given time."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "So the burning is another problem."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "Which is a power question."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "Yes, and do you think just your intuition, there are breakthroughs in batteries on the horizon?"}, {"time": 2504, "text": "How hard is that problem?"}, {"time": 2506, "text": "Look, there are a lot of companies that are promising flying cars that are autonomous and that are clean."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "I think they're over promising."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "The autonomy piece is doable."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "The clean piece, I don't think so."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "There's another company that I work with called JetOptra."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "They make small jet engines."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "And they can get up to 50 miles an hour very easily and lift 50 kilos."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "But they're jet engines, they're efficient, they're a little louder than electric vehicles, but they can build flying cars."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "So your sense is that there's a lot of pieces that have come together."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "So on this crazy question, if you look at companies like Kitty Hawk, working on electric, so the clean, talking to Sebastian Thrun, right?"}, {"time": 2565, "text": "It's a crazy dream, you know?"}, {"time": 2568, "text": "But you work with flight a lot."}, {"time":

look, there are a lot of smart people working on this and you never say something is not possible when you have people like Sebastian Thrun working on it."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "So I totally think it's viable."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "I question, again, the electric piece."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "The electric piece, yeah."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "And again, for short distances, you can do it."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "And there's no reason to suggest that these all just have to be rotorcrafts."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "You take off vertically, but then you morph into a forward flight."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "I think there are a lot of interesting designs."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "The question to me is, are these economically viable?"}, {"time": 2636, "text": "And if

that that difference is 0%."}, {"time": 959, "text": "In that case, fairness is specified when two groups, however, they're defined are given to you."}, {"time": 967, "text": "So the, and then you can sort of mathematically start describing the algorithm."}, {"time": 971, "text": "But nevertheless, the part where the two groups are given to you, I mean, unlike running time, you know, we don't in computer science talk about how fast an algorithm feels like when it runs."}, {"time": 989, "text": "We measure it and ethical starts getting into feelings."}, {"time": 993, "text": "So, for example, an algorithm runs, you know, if it runs in the background, it doesn't disturb the performance of my system."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "It'll feel nice."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "I'll be okay with it."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "But if it overloads the system, it'll feel unpleasant."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "So in that same way, ethics, there's a feeling of how socially acceptable it is."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "How does it represent the moral standards of our society today?"}, {"time": 1015, "text": "So in that sense, and sorry to linger on that first of high, low philosophical questions."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "Do you have a sense we'll be able to measure how ethical an algorithm is?"}, {"time": 1025, "text": "First of all, I didn't, certainly didn't mean to give the impression that you can kind of measure, you know, memory speed trade offs, you know, and that there's a complete mapping from that onto kind of fairness, for instance, or ethics and accuracy, for example."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "In the type of fairness definitions that are largely the objects of study today and starting to be deployed, you as the user of the definitions, you need to make some hard decisions before you even get to the point of designing fair algorithms."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "One of them, for instance, is deciding who it is that you're worried about protecting, who you're worried about being harmed by, for instance, some notion of discrimination or unfairness."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "And then you need to also decide what constitutes harm."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "So, for instance, in a lending application, maybe you decide that, you know, falsely rejecting a creditworthy individual, you know, sort of a false negative, is the real harm and that false positives, i.e."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "people that are not creditworthy or are not gonna repay your loan, that get a loan, you might think of them as lucky."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And so that's not a harm, although it's not clear that if you don't have the means to repay a loan, that being given a loan is not also a harm."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "So, you know, the literature is sort of so far quite limited in that you sort of need to say, who do you want to protect and what would constitute harm to that group?"}, {"time": 1117, "text": "And when you ask questions like, will algorithms feel ethical?"}, {"time": 1122, "text": "One way in which they won't, under the definitions that I'm describing, is if, you know, if you are an individual who is falsely denied a loan, incorrectly denied a loan, all of these definitions basically say like, well, you know, your compensation is the knowledge that we are also falsely denying loans to other people, you know, in other groups at the same rate that we're doing it to you."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "And, you know, and so there is actually this interesting even technical tension in the field right now between these sort of group notions of fairness and notions of fairness that might actually feel like real fairness to individuals, right?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "They might really feel like their particular interests are being protected or thought about by the algorithm rather than just, you know, the groups that they happen to be members of."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Is there parallels to the big O notation of worst case analysis?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "So, is it important to looking at the worst violation of fairness for an individual?"}, {"time": 1185, "text": "Is it important to minimize that one individual?"}, {"time": 1188, "text": "So like worst case analysis, is that something you think about or?"}, {"time": 1192, "text": "I mean, I think we're not even at the point where we can sensibly think about that."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So first of all, you know, we're talking here both about fairness applied at the group level, which is a relatively weak thing, but it's better than nothing."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "And also the more ambitious thing of trying to give some individual promises, but even that doesn't incorporate, I think something that you're hinting at here is what I might call subjective fairness, right?"}, {"time": 1220, "text": "So a lot of the definitions, I mean, all of the definitions in the algorithmic fairness literature are what I would kind of call received wisdom definitions."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "It's sort of, you know, somebody like me sits around and things like, okay, you know, I think here's a technical definition of fairness that I think people should want or that they should, you know, think of as some notion of fairness, maybe not the only one, maybe not the best one, maybe not the last one."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "But we really actually don't know from a subjective standpoint, like what people really think is fair."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "And to my knowledge, there's not a large literature in which ordinary people are asked about, you know, they have sort of notions of their subjective fairness elicited from them."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "It's mainly, you know, kind of scholars who think about fairness kind of making up their own definitions."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "And I think this needs to change actually for many social norms, not just for fairness, right?"}, {"time": 1310, "text": "So there's a lot of discussion these days in the AI community about interpretable AI or understandable AI."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And as far as I can tell, everybody agrees that deep learning or at least the outputs of deep learning are not very understandable, and people might agree that sparse linear models with integer coefficients are more understandable."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "But nobody's really asked people."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "You know, there's very little literature on, you know, sort of showing people models and asking them, do they understand what the model is doing?"}, {"time": 1345, "text": "And I think that in all these topics, as these fields mature, we need to start doing more behavioral work."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Yeah, which is one of my deep passions is psychology."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "And I always thought computer scientists will be the best future psychologists in a sense that data is, especially in this modern world, the data is a really powerful way to understand and study human behavior."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "And you've explored that with your game theory side of work as well."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "Yeah, I'd like to think that what you say is true about computer scientists and psychology from my own limited wandering into human subject experiments."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "We have a great deal to learn, not just computer science, but AI and machine learning more specifically, I kind of think of as imperialist research communities in that, you know, kind of like physicists in an earlier generation, computer scientists kind of don't think of any scientific topic that's off limits to them."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "They will like freely wander into areas that others have been thinking about for decades or longer."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And, you know, we usually tend to embarrass ourselves in those efforts for some amount of time."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "Like, you know, I think reinforcement learning is a good example, right?"}, {"time": 1421, "text": "So a lot of the early work in reinforcement learning, I have complete sympathy for the control theorists that looked at this and said like, okay, you are reinventing stuff that we've known since like the forties, right?"}, {"time": 1435, "text": "But, you know, in my view, eventually this sort of, you know, computer scientists have made significant contributions to that field, even though we kind of embarrassed ourselves for the first decade."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "So I think if computer scientists are gonna start engaging in kind of psychology, human subjects type of research, we should expect to be embarrassing ourselves for a good 10 years or so, and then hope that it turns out as well as, you know, some other areas that we've waded into."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "So you kind of mentioned this, just to linger on the idea of an ethical algorithm, of idea of groups, sort of group thinking and individual thinking."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "And we're struggling that."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "One of the amazing things about algorithms and your book and just this field of study is it gets us to ask, like forcing machines, converting these ideas into algorithms is forcing us to ask questions of ourselves as a human civilization."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "So there's a lot of people now in public discourse doing sort of group thinking, thinking like there's particular sets of groups that we don't wanna discriminate against and so on."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And then there is individuals, sort of in the individual life stories, the struggles they went through and so on."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Now, like in philosophy, it's easier to do group thinking because you don't, it's very hard to think about individuals."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "There's so much variability, but with data, you can start to actually say, you know what group thinking is too crude."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "You're actually doing more discrimination by thinking in terms of groups and individuals."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Can you linger on that kind of idea of group versus individual and ethics?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And is it good to continue thinking in terms of groups in algorithms?"}, {"time": 1541, "text": "So let me start by answering a very good high level question with a slightly narrow technical response, which is these group definitions of fairness, like here's a few groups, like different racial groups, maybe gender groups, maybe age, what have you."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "And let's make sure that for none of these groups, do we have a false negative rate, which is much higher than any other one of these groups."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "Okay, so these are kind of classic group aggregate notions of fairness."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "And you know, but at the end of the day, an individual you can think of as a combination of all of their attributes, right?"}, {"time": 1579, "text": "They're a member of a racial group, they have a gender, they have an age, and many other demographic properties that are not biological, but that are still very strong determinants of outcome and personality and the like."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "So one, I think, useful spectrum is to sort of think about that array between the group and the specific individual, and to realize that in some ways, asking for fairness at the individual level is to sort of ask for group fairness simultaneously for all possible combinations of groups."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "So the optimization, actually, that's a fascinating way to put it."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "So you're just optimizing, the one way to achieve the optimizing fairness for individuals is just to add more and more definitions of groups that each individual belongs to."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "So, you know, at the end of the day, we could think of all of ourselves as groups of size one because eventually there's some attribute that separates you from me and everybody else in the world, okay?"}, {"time": 1677, "text": "And so it is possible to put, you know, these incredibly coarse ways of thinking about fairness and these very, very individualistic specific ways on a common scale."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "And you know, one of the things we've worked on from a research perspective is, you know, so we sort of know how to, you know, in relative terms, we know how to provide fairness guarantees at the core system of the scale."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "We don't know how to provide kind of sensible, tractable, realistic fairness guarantees at the individual level, but maybe we could start creeping towards that by dealing with more refined subgroups."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "I mean, we gave a name to this phenomenon where, you know, you protect, you enforce some definition of fairness for a bunch of marginal attributes or features, but then you find yourself discriminating against a combination of them."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "We call that fairness gerrymandering because like political gerrymandering, you know, you're giving some guarantee at the aggregate level, but when you kind of look in a more granular way at what's going on, you realize that you're achieving that aggregate guarantee by sort of favoring some groups and discriminating against other ones."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And so there are, you know, it's early days, but there are algorithmic approaches that let you start creeping towards that, you know, individual end of the spectrum."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "Does there need to be human input in the form of weighing the value of the importance of each kind of group?"}, {"time": 1773, "text": "So for example, is it like, so gender, say crudely speaking, male and female, and then different races, are we as humans supposed to put value on saying gender is 0.6 and race is 0.4 in terms of in the big optimization of achieving fairness?"}, {"time": 1799, "text": "Is that kind of what humans are supposed to do here?"}, {"time": 1801, "text": "I mean, of course, you know, I don't need to tell you that, of course, technically one could incorporate such weights if you wanted to into a definition of fairness."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "You know, fairness is an interesting topic in that having worked in the book being about both fairness, privacy, and many other social norms, fairness, of course, is a much, much more loaded topic."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So privacy, I mean, people want privacy, people don't like violations of privacy, violations of privacy cause damage, angst, and bad publicity for the companies that are victims of them."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "But sort of everybody agrees more data privacy would be better than less data privacy."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "And you don't have these, somehow the discussions of fairness don't become politicized along other dimensions like race and about gender and, you know, whether we, and, you know, you quickly find yourselves kind of revisiting topics that have been kind of unresolved forever, like affirmative action, right?"}, {"time": 1872, "text": "Sort of, you know, like, why are you protecting, and some people will say, why are you protecting this particular racial group?"}, {"time": 1880, "text": "And others will say, well, we need to do that as a matter of retribution."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Other people will say, it's a matter of economic opportunity."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "And I don't know which of, you know, whether any of these are the right answers, but you sort of, fairness is sort of special in that as soon as you start talking about it, you inevitably have to participate in debates about fair to whom, at what expense to who else."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "I mean, even in criminal justice, right, you know, where people talk about fairness in criminal sentencing or, you know, predicting failures to appear or making parole decisions or the like, they will, you know, they'll point out that, well, these definitions of fairness are all about fairness for the criminals."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "And what about fairness for the victims, right?"}, {"time": 1936, "text": "So when I basically say something like, well, the false incarceration rate for black people and white people needs to be roughly the same, you know, there's no mention of potential victims of criminals in such a fairness definition."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "And that's the realm of public discourse."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "I should actually recommend, I just listened to people listening, Intelligence Squares debates, US edition just had a debate."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "They have this structure where you have old Oxford style or whatever they're called, debates, you know, it's two versus two and they talked about affirmative action and it was incredibly interesting that there's really good points on every side of this issue, which is fascinating to listen to."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "Yeah, yeah, I agree."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And so it's interesting to be a researcher trying to do, for the most part, technical algorithmic work, but Aaron and I both quickly learned you cannot do that and then go out and talk about it and expect people to take it seriously if you're unwilling to engage in these broader debates that are entirely extra algorithmic, right?"}, {"time": 2008, "text": "They're not about, you know, algorithms and making algorithms better."}, {"time": 2011, "text":

fairness, whether in the constraints and the objective function, there's an immediate kind of analysis you can perform, which is saying, if you care about fairness in gender, this is the amount that you have to pay for it in terms of the performance of the system."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "Like do you, is there a role for statements like that in a table, in a paper, or do you want to really not touch that?"}, {"time": 2046, "text": "No, no, we want to touch that and we do touch it."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "So I mean, just again, to make sure I'm not promising your viewers more than we know how to provide, but if you pick a definition of fairness, like I'm worried about gender discrimination and you pick a notion of harm, like false rejection for a loan, for example, and you give me a model, I can definitely, first of all, go audit that model."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "It's easy for me to go, you know, from data to kind of say like, okay, your false rejection rate on women is this much higher than it is on men, okay?"}, {"time": 2081, "text": "But once you also put the fairness into your objective function, I mean, I think the table that you're talking about is what we would call the Pareto curve, right?"}, {"time": 2091, "text": "You can literally trace out, and we give examples of such plots on real data sets in the book, you have two axes."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "On the X axis is your error, on the Y axis is unfairness by whatever, you know, if it's like the disparity between false rejection rates between two groups."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "And you know, your algorithm now has a knob that basically says, how strongly do I want to enforce fairness?"}, {"time": 2119, "text": "And the less unfair, you know, if the two axes are error and unfairness, we'd like to be at zero, zero."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "We'd like zero error and zero unfairness simultaneously."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "Anybody who works in machine learning knows that you're generally not going to get to zero error period without any fairness constraint whatsoever."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "So that's not going to happen."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "But in general, you know, you'll get this, you'll get some kind of convex curve that specifies the numerical trade off you face."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "You know, if I want to go from 17% error down to 16% error, what will be the increase in unfairness that I experienced as a result of that?"}, {"time": 2162, "text": "And so this curve kind of specifies the, you know, kind of undominated models."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "Models that are off that curve are, you know, can be strictly improved in one or both dimensions."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "You can, you know, either make the error better or the unfairness better or both."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "And I think our view is that not only are these objects, these Pareto curves, you know, with efficient frontiers as you might call them, not only are they valuable scientific objects, I actually think that they in the near term might need to be the interface between researchers working in the field and stakeholders in given problems."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "So you know, you could really imagine telling a criminal jurisdiction, look, if you're concerned about racial fairness, but you're also concerned about accuracy."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "You want to, you know, you want to release on parole people that are not going to recommit a violent crime and you don't want to release the ones who are."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "So you know, that's accuracy."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "But if you also care about those, you know, the mistakes you make not being disproportionately on one racial group or another, you can show this curve."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "I'm hoping that in the near future, it'll be possible to explain these curves to non technical people that are the ones that have to make the decision, where do we want to be on this curve?"}, {"time": 2250, "text": "Like, what are the relative merits or value of having lower error versus lower unfairness?"}, {"time": 2258, "text": "You know, that's not something computer scientists should be deciding for society, right?"}, {"time": 2263, "text": "That, you know, the people in the field, so to speak, the policymakers, the regulators, that's who should be making these decisions."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "But I think and hope that they can be made to understand that these trade offs generally exist and that you need to pick a point and like, and ignoring the trade off, you know, you're implicitly picking a point anyway, right?"}, {"time": 2286, "text": "You just don't know it and you're not admitting it."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "Just to linger on the point of trade offs, I think that's a really important thing to sort of think about."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "So you think when we start to optimize for fairness, there's almost always in most system going to be trade offs."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "Can you like, what's the trade off between just to clarify, there have been some sort of technical terms thrown around, but sort of a perfectly fair world."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "Why will somebody be upset about that?"}, {"time": 2323, "text": "The specific trade off I talked about just in order to make things very concrete was between numerical error and some numerical measure of unfairness."}, {"time": 2333, "text": "What is numerical error in the case of... Just like say predictive error, like, you know, the probability or frequency with which you release somebody on parole who then goes on to recommit a violent crime or keep incarcerated somebody who would not have recommitted a violent crime."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "So in the case of awarding somebody parole or giving somebody parole or letting them out on parole, you don't want them to recommit a crime."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "So it's your system failed in prediction if they happen to do a crime."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "Okay, so that's one axis."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "And what's the fairness axis?"}, {"time": 2371, "text": "So then the fairness axis might be the difference between racial groups in the kind of false positive predictions, namely people that I kept incarcerated predicting that they would recommit a violent crime when in fact they wouldn't have."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "And the unfairness of that, just to linger it and allow me to in eloquently to try to sort of describe why that's unfair, why unfairness is there."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "The unfairness you want to get rid of is that in the judge's mind, the bias of having being brought up to society, the slight racial bias, the racism that exists in the society, you want to remove that from the system."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Another way that's been debated is sort of equality of opportunity versus equality of outcome."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "And there's a weird dance there that's really difficult to get right."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "And we don't, affirmative action is exploring that space."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "And then this also quickly bleeds into questions like, well, maybe if one group really does recommit crimes at a higher rate, the reason for that is that at some earlier point in the pipeline or earlier in their lives, they didn't receive the same resources that the other group did."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "And so there's always in kind of fairness discussions, the possibility that the real injustice came earlier, right?"}, {"time": 2471, "text": "Earlier in this individual's life, earlier in this group's history, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "And so a lot of the fairness discussion is almost, the goal is for it to be a corrective mechanism to account for the injustice earlier in life."}, {"time": 2485, "text": "By some definitions of fairness or some theories of fairness, yeah."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "Others would say like, look, it's not to correct that injustice, it's just to kind of level the playing field right now and not falsely incarcerate more people of one group than another group."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "But I mean, I think just it might be helpful just to demystify a little bit about the many ways in which bias or unfairness can come into algorithms, especially in the machine learning era, right?"}, {"time": 2515, "text": "I think many of your viewers have probably heard these examples before, but let's say I'm building a face recognition system, right?"}, {"time": 2524, "text": "And so I'm kind of gathering lots of images of faces and trying to train the system to recognize new faces of those individuals from training on a training set of those faces of individuals."}, {"time": 2573, "text": "Now, there's a bunch of ways you could think about addressing this."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "One is to deliberately put into the objective of the algorithm not to optimize the error at the expense of this discrimination, and then you're kind of back in the land of these kind of two dimensional numerical trade offs."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "A valid counter argument is to say like, well, no, you don't have to, there's no, you know, the notion of the tension between error and accuracy here is a false one."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "You could instead just go out and get much more data on these other groups that are in the minority and, you know, equalize your data set, or you could train a separate model on those subgroups and, you know, have multiple models."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "The point I think we would, you know, we tried to make in the book is that those things have cost too, right?"}, {"time": 2625, "text": "Going out and gathering more data on groups that are relatively rare compared to your plurality or more majority group that, you know, it may not cost you in the accuracy of the model, but it's going to cost, you know, it's going to cost the company developing this model more money to develop that, and it also costs more money to build separate predictive models and to implement and deploy them."}, {"time": 2647, "text": "So even if you can find a way to avoid the tension between error and accuracy in training a model, you might push the cost somewhere else, like money, like development time, research time and the like."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "There are fundamentally difficult philosophical questions, in fairness, and we live in a very divisive political climate, outraged culture."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "There is alt right folks on 4chan, trolls."}, {"time": 2678, "text": "There is social justice warriors on Twitter."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "There's very divisive, outraged folks on all sides of every kind of system."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "How do you, how do we as engineers build ethical algorithms in such divisive culture?"}, {"time": 2697, "text": "Do you think they could be disjoint?"}, {"time": 2699, "text": "The human has to inject your values, and then you can optimize over those values."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "But in our times, when you start actually applying these systems, things get a little bit challenging for the public discourse."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "How do you think we can proceed?"}, {"time": 2714, "text": "Yeah, I mean, for the most part in the book, a point that we try to take some pains to make is that we don't view ourselves or people like us as being in the position of deciding for society what the right social norms are, what the right definitions of fairness are."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "Our main point is to just show that if society or the relevant stakeholders in a particular domain can come to agreement on those sorts of things, there's a way of encoding that into algorithms in many cases, not in all cases."}, {"time": 2750, "text": "One other misconception that hopefully we definitely dispel is sometimes people read the title of the book and I think not unnaturally fear that what we're suggesting is that the algorithms themselves should decide what those social norms are and develop their own notions of fairness and privacy or ethics, and we're definitely not suggesting that."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "The title of the book is Ethical Algorithm, by the way, and I didn't think of that interpretation of the title."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "I mean, especially these days where people are concerned about the robots becoming our overlords, the idea that the robots would also sort of develop their own social norms is just one step away from that."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "But they had to make, so if we look at people at the heads of companies and so on, they had to make those decisions, right?"}, {"time": 2822, "text": "There has to be decisions, so there's two options, either you kind of put your head in the sand and don't think about these things and just let the algorithm do what it does, or you make decisions about what you value, you know, of injecting moral values into the algorithm."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "Look, I never mean to be an apologist for the tech industry, but I think it's a little bit too far to sort of say that explicit decisions were made about these things."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "So let's, for instance, take social media platforms, right?"}, {"time": 2854, "text": "So like many inventions in technology and computer science, a lot of these platforms that we now use regularly kind of started as curiosities, right?"}, {"time": 2865, "text": "I remember when things like Facebook came out and its predecessors like Friendster, which nobody even remembers now, people really wonder, like, why would anybody want to spend time doing that?"}, {"time": 2876, "text": "I mean, even the web when it first came out, when it wasn't populated with much content and it was largely kind of hobbyists building their own kind of ramshackle websites, a lot of people looked at this and said, well, what is the purpose of this thing?"}, {"time": 2889, "text": "Why is this interesting?"}, {"time": 2891, "text": "Who would want to do this?"}, {"time": 2892, "text": "And so even things like Facebook and Twitter, yes, technical decisions were made by engineers, by scientists, by executives in the design of those platforms, but, you know, I don't think 10 years ago anyone anticipated that those platforms, for instance, might kind of acquire undue, you know, influence on political discourse or on the outcomes of elections."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And I think the scrutiny that these companies are getting now is entirely appropriate, but I think it's a little too harsh to kind of look at history and sort of say like, oh, you should have been able to anticipate that this would happen with your platform."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "And in this sort of gaming chapter of the book, one of the points we're making is that, you know, these platforms, right, they don't operate in isolation."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "So unlike the other topics we're discussing, like fairness and privacy, like those are really cases where algorithms can operate on your data and make decisions about you and you're not even aware of it, okay?"}, {"time": 2956, "text": "Things like Facebook and Twitter, these are, you know, these are systems, right?"}, {"time": 2960, "text": "These are social systems and their evolution, even their technical evolution because machine learning is involved, is driven in no small part by the behavior of the users themselves and how the users decide to adopt them and how to use them."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "And so, you know, I'm kind of like who really knew that, you know, until we saw it happen, who knew that these things might be able to influence the outcome of elections?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "Who knew that, you know, they might polarize political discourse because of the ability to, you know, decide who you interact with on the platform and also with the platform naturally using machine learning to optimize for your own interest that they would further isolate us from each other and, you know, like feed us all basically just the stuff that we already agreed with."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "So I think, you know, we've come to that outcome, I think, largely, but I think it's something that we all learned together, including the companies as these things happen."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "You asked like, well, are there algorithmic remedies to these kinds of things?"}, {"time": 3029, "text": "And again, these are big problems that are not going to be solved with, you know, somebody going in and changing a few lines of code somewhere in a social media platform."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "But I do think in many ways, there are definitely ways of making things better."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "I mean, like an obvious recommendation that we make at some point in the book is like, look, you know, to the extent that we think that machine learning applied for personalization purposes in things like newsfeed, you know, or other platforms has led to polarization and intolerance of opposing viewpoints."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "As you know, right, these algorithms have models, right, and they kind of place people in some kind of metric space, and they place content in that space, and they sort of know the extent to which I have an affinity for a particular type of content."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "And by the same token, they also probably have that same model probably gives you a good idea of the stuff I'm likely to violently disagree with or be offended by, okay?"}, {"time": 3092, "text": "So you know, in this case, there really is some knob you could tune that says like, instead of showing people only what they like and what they want, let's show them some stuff that we think that they don't like, or that's a little bit further away."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "And you could even imagine users being able to control this, you know, just like everybody gets a slider, and that slider says like, you know, how much stuff do you want to see that's kind of, you know, you might disagree with, or is at least further from your interest."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "It's almost like an exploration button."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "So just get your intuition."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "Do you think engagement, so like you staying on the platform, you're staying engaged."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "Do you think fairness, ideas of fairness won't emerge?"}, {"time": 3139, "text": "Like how bad is it to just optimize for engagement?"}, {"time": 3143, "text": "Do you think we'll run into big trouble if we're just optimizing for how much you love the platform?"}, {"time": 3149, "text": "Well, I mean, optimizing for engagement kind of got us where we are."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "So do you, one, have faith that it's possible to do better?"}, {"time": 3159, "text": "And two, if it is, how do we do better?"}, {"time": 3164, "text": "I mean, it's definitely possible to do different, right?"}, {"time": 3167, "text": "And again, you know, it's not as if I think that doing something different than optimizing for engagement won't cost these companies in real ways, including revenue and profitability potentially."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "In the short term at least."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "In the short term."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "And again, you know, if I worked at these companies, I'm sure that it would have seemed like the most natural thing in the world also to want to optimize engagement, right?"}, {"time": 3192, "text": "And that's good for users in some sense."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "You want them to be, you know, vested in the platform and enjoying it and finding it useful, interesting, and or productive."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "But you know, my point is, is that the idea that there is, that it's sort of out of their hands as you said, or that there's nothing to do about it, never say never, but that strikes me as implausible as a machine learning person, right?"}, {"time": 3214, "text": "I mean, these companies are driven by machine learning and this optimization of engagement is essentially driven by machine learning, right?"}, {"time": 3222, "text": "It's driven by not just machine learning, but you know, very, very large scale A, B experimentation where you kind of tweak some element of the user interface or tweak some component of an algorithm or tweak some component or feature of your click through prediction model."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "And my point is, is that anytime you know how to optimize for something, you, you know, by def, almost by definition, that solution tells you how not to optimize for it or to do something different."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "Engagement can be measured."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "So sort of optimizing for sort of minimizing divisiveness or maximizing intellectual growth over the lifetime of a human being are very difficult to measure."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And I'm not claiming that doing something different will immediately make it apparent that this is a good thing for society and in particular, I mean, I think one way of thinking about where we are on some of these social media platforms is that, you know, it kind of feels a bit like we're in a bad equilibrium, right?"}, {"time": 3290, "text": "That these systems are helping us all kind of optimize something myopically and selfishly for ourselves and of course, from an individual standpoint at any given moment, like why would I want to see things in my newsfeed that I found irrelevant, offensive or, you know, or the like, okay?"}, {"time": 3309, "text": "But you know, maybe by all of us, you know, having these platforms myopically optimized in our interests, we have reached a collective outcome as a society that we're unhappy with in different ways."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "Let's say with respect to things like, you know, political discourse and tolerance of opposing viewpoints."}, {"time": 3328, "text": "And if Mark Zuckerberg gave you a call and said, I'm thinking of taking a sabbatical, could you run Facebook for me for six months?"}, {"time": 3337, "text": "What would you, how?"}, {"time": 3339, "text": "I think no thanks would be my first response, but there are many aspects of being the head of the entire company that are kind of entirely exogenous to many of the things that we're discussing here."}, {"time": 3353, "text": "And so I don't really think I would need to be CEO of Facebook to kind of implement the, you know, more limited set of solutions that I might imagine."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "But I think one concrete thing they could do is they could experiment with letting people who chose to, to see more stuff in their newsfeed that is not entirely kind of chosen to optimize for their particular interests, beliefs, et cetera."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "So the, the kind of thing, so I could speak to YouTube, but I think Facebook probably does something similar is they're quite effective at automatically finding what sorts of groups you belong to, not based on race or gender or so on, but based on the kind of stuff you enjoy watching in the case of YouTube."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "Sort of, it's a, it's a difficult thing for Facebook or YouTube to then say, well, you know what?"}, {"time":

Netflix prize, when you can start combining stuff together."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "So this is exactly the problem with these notions, right?"}, {"time": 4145, "text": "Is that notions of a anonymization, removing personally identifiable information, the kind of fundamental conceptual flaw is that, you know, these definitions kind of pretend as if the data set in question is the only

other allegedly anonymized data sets and maybe publicly available information about you."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "You know, for people who don't know the Netflix prize was, was being publicly

just another paper on this in science or nature of about a month ago that, you know, kind of 18 attributes."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "So we live in this era where, you know, even the apparently

you can kind of, you know, do a join between that kind of data and allegedly anonymized data, you have real trouble."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "So is there hope for any kind of privacy in a world where a few likes can identify you?"}, {"time": 4318, "text": "So there is differential privacy, right?"}, {"time": 4320, "text": "What is differential privacy?"}, {"time": 4321, "text": "Yeah, so differential privacy basically is a kind of alternate, much stronger notion of privacy than these anonymization ideas."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "And, you know, it's a technical definition, but like the spirit of it is we compare two alternate worlds, okay?"}, {"time": 4340, "text": "So let's suppose I'm a researcher and I want to do, you know, there's a database of medical records and one of them is yours, and I want to use that database of medical records to build a predictive model for some disease."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "So based on people's symptoms and test results and the like, I want to, you know, build a probably model predicting the probability that people have disease."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "So, you know, this is the type of scientific research that we would like to be allowed to continue."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "And in differential privacy, you ask a very particular counterfactual question."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "We basically compare two alternatives."}, {"time": 4377, "text": "One is when I do this, I build this model on the database of medical records, including your medical record."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "And the other one is where I do the same exercise with the same database with just your medical record removed."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "So basically, you know, it's two databases, one with N records in it and one with N minus one records in it."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "The N minus one records are the same, and the only one that's missing in the second case is your medical record."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "So differential privacy basically says that any harms that might come to you from the analysis in which your data was included are essentially nearly identical to the harms that would have come to you if the same analysis had been done without your medical record included."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "So in other words, this doesn't say that bad things cannot happen to you as a result of data analysis."}, {"time": 4439, "text": "It just says that these bad things were going to happen to you already, even if your data wasn't included."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "And to give a very concrete example, right, you know, like we discussed at some length, the study that, you know, in the 50s that was done that established the link between smoking and lung cancer."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "And we make the point that, like, well, if your data was used in that analysis and, you know, the world kind of knew that you were a smoker because, you know, there was no stigma associated with smoking before those findings, real harm might have come to you as a result of that study that your data was included in."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "In particular, your insurer now might have a higher posterior belief that you might have lung cancer and raise your premium."}, {"time": 4484, "text": "So you've suffered economic damage."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "But the point is, is that if the same analysis has been done with all the other N minus one medical records and just yours missing, the outcome would have been the same."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "Or your data wasn't idiosyncratically crucial to establishing the link between smoking and lung cancer because the link between smoking and lung cancer is like a fact about the world that can be discovered with any sufficiently large database of medical records."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "But that's a very low value of harm."}, {"time": 4518, "text": "So that's showing that very little harm is done."}, {"time": 4521, "text": "But how what is the mechanism of differential privacy?"}, {"time": 4524, "text": "So that's the kind of beautiful statement of it."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "It's the mechanism by which privacy is preserved."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "So it's basically by adding noise to computations, right?"}, {"time": 4534, "text": "So the basic idea is that every differentially private algorithm, first of all, or every good differentially private algorithm, every useful one, is a probabilistic algorithm."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "So it doesn't, on a given input, if you gave the algorithm the same input multiple times, it would give different outputs each time from some distribution."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "And the way you achieve differential privacy algorithmically is by kind of carefully and tastefully adding noise to a computation in the right places."}, {"time": 4565, "text": "And to give a very concrete example, if I wanna compute the average of a set of numbers, the non private way of doing that is to take those numbers and average them and release like a numerically precise value for the average."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "In differential privacy, you wouldn't do that."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "You would first compute that average to numerical precisions, and then you'd add some noise to it, right?"}, {"time": 4590, "text": "You'd add some kind of zero mean, Gaussian or exponential noise to it so that the actual value you output is not the exact mean, but it'll be close to the mean, but it'll be close..."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "The noise that you add will sort of prove that nobody can kind of reverse engineer any particular value that went into the average."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "So noise is a savior."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "How many algorithms can be aided by adding noise?"}, {"time": 4621, "text": "Yeah, so I'm a relatively recent member of the differential privacy community."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "My co author, Aaron Roth is really one of the founders of the field and has done a great deal of work and I've learned a tremendous amount working with him on it."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "It's a pretty grown up field already."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "Yeah, but now it's pretty mature."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "But I must admit, the first time I saw the definition of differential privacy, my reaction was like, wow, that is a clever definition and it's really making very strong promises."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "And I first saw the definition in much earlier days and my first reaction was like, well, my worry about this definition would be that it's a great definition of privacy, but that it'll be so restrictive that we won't really be able to use it."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "We won't be able to compute many things in a differentially private way."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "So that's one of the great successes of the field, I think, is in showing that the opposite is true and that most things that we know how to compute, absent any privacy considerations, can be computed in a differentially private way."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "So for example, pretty much all of statistics and machine learning can be done differentially privately."}, {"time": 4689, "text": "So pick your favorite machine learning algorithm, back propagation and neural networks, cart for decision trees, support vector machines, boosting, you name it, as well as classic hypothesis testing and the like in statistics."}, {"time": 4704, "text": "None of those algorithms are differentially private in their original form."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "All of them have modifications that add noise to the computation in different places in different ways that achieve differential privacy."}, {"time": 4719, "text": "So this really means that to the extent that we've become a scientific community very dependent on the use of machine learning and statistical modeling and data analysis, we really do have a path to provide privacy guarantees to those methods and so we can still enjoy the benefits of the data science era while providing rather robust privacy guarantees to individuals."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "So perhaps a slightly crazy question, but if we take the ideas of differential privacy and take it to the nature of truth that's being explored currently."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "So what's your most favorite and least favorite food?"},

campaign bloggers and so on of bots saying that you like cauliflower?"}, {"time": 4791, "text": "So like this kind of the same kind of noise ideas, I mean if you think of in our politics today there's this idea of Russia hacking our elections."}, {"time": 4801, "text": "What's meant there I believe is bots spreading different kinds of information."}, {"time": 4807, "text": "Is that a kind of privacy or is that too much of a stretch?"}, {"time": 4810, "text": "No it's not a stretch."}, {"time": 4812, "text": "I've not seen those ideas, you know, that is not a technique that to my knowledge will provide differential privacy, but to give an example like one very specific example about what you're discussing is there was a very interesting project at NYU I think led by Helen Nissenbaum there in which they basically built a browser plugin that tried to essentially obfuscate your Google searches."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "So you know it's like a weed and chaff thing so you know out of every thousand queries let's say that Google was receiving from your browser one of them was one that you put in but the other 999 were not okay so it's the same kind of idea kind of you know privacy by obfuscation."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "So I think that's an interesting idea, doesn't give you differential privacy."}, {"time": 4952, "text": "So where do you think we'll land in this algorithm driven society in terms of privacy?"}, {"time": 4956, "text": "So sort of China like Kai Fuli describes you know it's collecting a lot of data on its citizens but in the best form it's actually able to provide a lot of sort of protect human rights and provide a lot of amazing services and it's worst forms that can violate those human rights and limit services."}, {"time": 4981,

control of privacy with kind of societally and commercially beneficial uses of data not unrelated to differential privacy or suggestions that say like well individuals should have control of their data."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "They should be able to limit the uses of that data."}, {"time": 5023, "text": "They should even you know there's you know fledgling discussions going on in research circles about allowing people selective use of their data and being compensated for it."}, {"time": 5034, "text": "And then you get to sort of very interesting economic questions like pricing right."}, {"time": 5039, "text": "And one interesting idea is that maybe differential privacy would also you know be a conceptual framework in which you could talk about the relative value of different people's data like you know to demystify this a little bit."}, {"time": 5052, "text": "If I'm trying to build a predictive model for some rare disease and I'm trying to use machine learning to do it, it's easy to get negative examples because the disease is rare right."}, {"time": 5063, "text": "But I really want to have lots of people with the disease in my data set okay."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "And so somehow those people's data with respect to this application is much more valuable to me than just like the background population."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "And so maybe they should be compensated more for it."}, {"time": 5083, "text": "And so you know I think these are kind of very, very fledgling conceptual questions that maybe we'll have kind of technical thought on them sometime in the coming years."}, {"time": 5094, "text": "But I do think we'll you know to kind of get more directly answer your question."}, {"time": 5096, "text": "I think I'm optimistic at this point from what I've seen that we will land at some you know better compromise than we're at right now where again you know privacy guarantees are few far between and weak and users have very, very little control."}, {"time": 5115, "text": "And I'm optimistic that we'll land in something that you know provides better privacy overall and more individual control of data and privacy."}, {"time": 5122, "text": "But you know I think to get there it's again just like fairness it's not going to be enough to propose algorithmic solutions."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "There's going to have to be a whole kind of regulatory legal process that prods companies and other parties to kind of adopt solutions."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And I think you've mentioned the word control a lot and I think giving people control that's something that people don't quite have in a lot of these algorithms and that's a really interesting idea of giving them control."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "Some of that is actually literally an interface design question sort of just enabling because I think it's good for everybody to give users control."}, {"time": 5160, "text": "It's almost not a trade off except that you have to hire people that are good at interface design."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "I mean the other thing that has to be said right is that you know it's a cliche but you know we as the users of many systems platforms and apps you know we are the product."}, {"time": 5181, "text": "We are not the customer."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "The customer are advertisers and our data is the product."},

"That's just crazy to me."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "Maybe I'm silly, maybe you can educate me, but that seems crazy."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "It gives me just positive human civilization has been able to create a system that has so much credit."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So that's a long way to ask, do you think credit is good or bad for society?"}, {"time": 1785, "text": "That system of that's so fundamentally based on credit."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "I think credit is great, even though people often overdo it."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "Credit is that somebody has earned money."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "And what happens is they lend it to somebody else who's got better ideas and they cut a deal."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "And then that person with the better ideas is gonna pay it back."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "And if it works well, it helps resource allocations go well, providing people like the entrepreneurs and all of those, they need capital."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "They don't have capital themselves."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "And so somebody is gonna give them capital and they'll give them credit along those lines."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "Then what happens is it's not managed well in a variety of ways."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "So I did another book on principles, principles of big debt crises that go into that."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "And it's free, by the way, I put it free online as a PDF."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "So if you go online and you look principles of a big debt crisis is under my name, you can download it in a PDF or you can buy a print book of it."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "And it goes through that particular process."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "And so you always have it overdone in always the same way."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "Everything, by the way, almost everything happens over and over again for the same reasons, okay?"}, {"time": 1867, "text": "So these debt crisis is all happened over and over again for the same reasons."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "They get it overdone."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "In the book, it explains how you identify whether it's overdone or not."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "And then you go through the process of making the adjustments according that and it explains how they can use the levers and so on."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "If you didn't have credit, then you would be sort of everybody sort of be stuck."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "So credit is a good thing, but it can easily be overdone."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "So now we get into the, what is money?"}, {"time": 1899, "text": "What is credit?"}, {"time": 1901, "text": "Okay, you get into money and credit."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "So if you're holding credit and you think that's worthwhile, keep in mind that the central bank, let's say it can print the money."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "What is that problem?"}, {"time": 1911, "text": "You have an IOU and the IOU says you're gonna get a certain number of dollars, let's say, or yen or euros."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "And that is what the IOU is."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "And so the question is, will you get that money and what will it be worth?"}, {"time": 1927, "text": "And then also you have a government, which is a participant in that process because they are on the hook, they owe money."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "And then will they print the money to make it easy for everybody to pay?"}, {"time": 1940, "text": "So you have to pay attention to those two."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "I would suggest like you recommend to other people, just take that 30 minutes and it comes across pretty clearly."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "But my conclusion is that of course you want it."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "And even if you understand it and the cycles well, you can benefit from those cycles rather than to be hurt by those cycles."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Because I don't know the way the cycle works is somebody gets over indebted, they have to sell an asset."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "Okay, then I don't know, that's when assets become cheaper."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "How do you acquire the asset?"}, {"time": 1977, "text": "It's a whole process."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "So again, maybe another dumb question, but..."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "There are no such things as dumb questions."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "But what is money?"}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So you've mentioned credit and money."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "Another thing that if I just zoom out from an alien perspective and look at human civilization, it's incredible that we've created a thing that only works because currency, because we all agree it has value."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "So I guess my question is how do you think about money as this emergent phenomenon?"}, {"time": 2018, "text": "And what do you think is the future of money?"}, {"time": 2021, "text": "You've commented on Bitcoin, other forms."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "What do you think is its history and future?"}, {"time": 2028, "text": "How do you think about money?"}, {"time": 2031, "text": "There are two things that money is for."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "It's a medium of exchange and it's a storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "So money, so you could say something's a medium of exchange, and then you could say, is it a storehold of wealth?"}, {"time": 2051, "text": "And money is that vehicle that is those things and can be used to pay off your debt."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "So when you have a debt and you provide it, it pays off your debt."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "So that's that process."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "And it's, I apologize to interrupt, but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth when everybody recognizes it to be of value."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "And so you see in the history around the world and you go to places, I was in an island in the Pacific in which they had as money these big stones."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "I've seen beads in different places, shells converted to this and mediums of exchange."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "And when we look at what we've got, you're exactly right."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "It is the notion that if I give it to you, I can then take it and I can buy something with it."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "And that's, so it's a matter of perception."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "And then we go through then the history of money and the vulnerabilities of money."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And what we have is there's, through history, there's been two types of money."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "Those that are claims on something of value, like the connection to gold or something."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "That would be."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "Or they just are money without any connection, and then we have a system now, which is a fiat monetary system."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "So that's what money is."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "Then it will last as long as it's kept a value and it works that way."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "So let's say central banks, when they get in the position of like they owe a lot of money, like we have in the case, it's increasingly the case, and they also in our mind and they have the printing press to print the money and get out of that."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "And you have a lot of people might be in that position."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "Then you can print it and then it could be devalued in there."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "And so history has shown, forget about today, history has shown that no currency, every currency has either ended as being a currency or devalued as a currency over periods of time, long periods of time."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "So it evolves and it changes, but everybody needs that medium of exchange and everybody needs that storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "So it keeps changing what is money over a period of time."}, {"time": 2232, "text": "But so much is being digitized today and there's this ideas that are based on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "So if all currencies, like all empires come to an end, what do you think, well, do you think something like Bitcoin might emerge as a common store of value, a store of wealth and a medium of exchange?"}, {"time": 2257, "text": "The problem with Bitcoin is that it's not an effective medium of exchange."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "Like it's not easy for me to go in there and buy things with it."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "And then it's not an effective storehold of value because it has a volatility that's based on speculation and the like, so it's not a very effective saving."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "That's very different from Facebook's of a stable value currency, which would be effective as both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "Because if you were to hold it and the way it's linked to number of things that it's linked to would mean that it could be a very effective storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And then you have a digital currency that could be a very effective medium exchange and storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So in my opinion, some digital currencies are likely to succeed more or less based on that ability to do it."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "Then the question is what happens?"}, {"time": 2317, "text": "Okay, what happens is do central banks allow that to happen?"}, {"time": 2322, "text": "I really do believe it's possible to get a better form of money that central banks don't control."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "Okay, a better force of money that the central banks don't control."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "But then that's not yet happened."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "And we also have to, and so they've got to go through that evolutionary process."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "In order to go through that evolutionary process, first of all, governments have got to allow that to happen, which is to some extent a threat to them in terms of their power."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "And that's an issue."}, {"time": 2354, "text": "And then you have to also build the confidence in all of the components of it to say, okay, that's going to be effective because I won't have problems owning it."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So I think that digital currencies have some element of potential, but there's a lot of hurdles that are going to have to be gotten over."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "I think that it'll be a very long time, possibly never, but anyway, a very long time before we have that, let's say, get into a position that would be effective means relative to gold, let's say, if you were to think of that."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "Because gold has a track record of thousands of years."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "All across countries, it has its mobility, it has the ability to put it down, it has certain abilities."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "It's got disadvantages relative to digital currencies, but central banks will hold it."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "Like there's central banks that worry about others, other countries, central banks might worry about whether the U.S. dollar is going to print or not."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "And so the thing they're going to go to is not going to be the digital currency."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "The thing they're going to go to is gold or something else, some other currency, they got to pick it."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "And so I think it's a long way to go."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "Well, you think it's possible that one day we don't even have a central bank because of a currency that doesn't, that cannot be controlled by the central bank is the primary currency?"}, {"time": 2449, "text": "Or does that seem very unlikely?"}, {"time": 2450, "text": "It would be very remote possibility or very long in the future."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "Again, maybe a dumb question, but romanticize one."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "When you sit back and you look, you describe these transactions between individuals, somehow creating short term debt cycles, long term debt cycles, there's productivity growth."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "Does it amaze you that this whole thing works?"}, {"time": 2482, "text": "That there's however many million, hundreds of millions of people in the United States, globally over seven billion people, that this thing between individual transactions, it just, it works."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "It amazes me."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "Like I go back and forth between being in it and then I think, like, how did a credit card, how is that really possible?"}, {"time": 2509, "text": "I'm still used, I look up credit card, I put it on, the guy doesn't know me."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "It's all strangers."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "It signs, okay."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "We're making the digital entries."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "Is that really secure enough and that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 2521, "text": "And then it goes back and it goes this and it clears and it all happens."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "And what I marvel at that and those types of things is because of the capacity of the human mind to create abstractions that are true."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "It's imagination and then the ability to go from one level and then if these things are true, then you go to the next level and if those things are true, then you go to the next level."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "And all those miracles that we almost become common, it's like when I'm flying in a plane or when I'm looking at all of the things that happen."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "When I get communications in the middle of, I don't know, Africa or Antarctica and we're communicating in the ways where I see the face on my iPad of somebody, my grandkid and someplace else and I look at this and I say, wow, yes, it all amazes me."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "So while being amazing, do you have a sense, the principles you described, that the whole thing is stable somehow also?"}, {"time": 2586, "text": "Or is this, are we just lucky?"}, {"time": 2588, "text": "So the principles that you described, are those describing a system that is stable, robust and will remain so?"}, {"time": 2598, "text": "Or is it a lucky accident of our early history?"}, {"time": 2602, "text": "My area of expertise is economics and markets so I get down to like a real nitty gritty."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "I can't tell you whether the plane is gonna fall out of the sky because of its particular fundamentals."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "I don't know enough about that but it happens over and over again and so on, it gives me faith, okay?"}, {"time": 2619, "text": "So without me knowing it."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "In the markets and the economy, I know those things well enough, in a sense, to say that by and large, that structure is right, what we're seeing is right."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "Now, whether there are disruptions and it has effects that can come, not because that structure is right, and I believe it's right, but whether it can be hurt by let's say connectivity or journal entries, they could take all the money away from you through your digital entries."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "There's all sorts of things that can happen in various ways that means that that money is worthless or the system falls but from what I see in terms of its basic structure and those complexities that still take my breath away, I would say knowing enough about the mechanics of them, that doesn't worry me."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "Have you seen disruptions in your lifetime that really surprised you?"}, {"time": 2678, "text": "Major disruptions?"}, {"time": 2678, "text": "Oh, all the time."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "This is one of the great lessons of my life is that many times I've seen things that I was very surprised about and that I realized almost all of those I was surprised about because they just, they were just the first time it happened to me, they didn't happen in my lifetime before but when I researched them, they happened in other places or other people lifetimes."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "So for example, I remember 1971, the dollar, there was no such thing as a devaluation of a currency, it didn't experience it and the dollar was connected to gold and I was watching events happen and then you get on and that definition of money all of a sudden went out the window because it was not tied to gold and then you have this devaluation."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So and then, or the first oil shock or the second oil shock or so many of these things."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "But almost always I realized that they, when I looked in history, they happened before, they just happened in other people's lifetimes which led me to realize that I needed to study history and what happened in other people's lifetimes and what happened in other countries and places so that I would have timeless and universal principles for dealing with that thing."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "So I've, oh yeah, I've been, you know, the implausible happening but it's like a one in a hundred year storm, okay?"}, {"time": 2779, "text": "Or it's or."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "They've happened before."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Yeah, they've happened."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "Just not to you."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "Let me talk about, if we could, about AI a little bit."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "So we've, Bridgewater Associates manage about $160 billion in assets and our artificial intelligence systems algorithms are pretty good with data."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "What role in the future do you see AI play in analysis and decision making in this kind of data rich and impactful area of investment?"}, {"time": 2815, "text": "I'm gonna answer that not only in investment but I give a more all encompassing rule for AI."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "As I think you know, for the last 25 years, we have taken our thinking and put them in algorithms and so we make decisions."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "The computer takes those criteria, algorithms, and they put them, they're in there and it takes data and they operate as an independent decision maker in parallel with our decision making."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "So for me, it's like there's a chess game playing and I'm a person with my chess game and I'm saying it made that move and I'm making the move and how do I compare those two moves?"}, {"time": 2860, "text": "So we've done a lot but let me give you a rule."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "If the future can be different from the past and you don't have deep understanding, you should not rely on AI, okay?"}, {"time": 2879, "text": "Those two things."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "Deep understanding of?"}, {"time": 2882, "text": "The cause of fact relationships that are leading you to place that bet in anything, okay?"}, {"time": 2888, "text": "Anything important."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "Let's say if it was do surgeries and you would say, how do I do surgeries?"}, {"time": 2894, "text": "I think it's a good idea to do surgeries but I think it's totally fine to watch all the doctors do the surgeries."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "That appendicitis or whatever it is will be handled the same way, the surgery, that's fine."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "However, what happens with AI is for the most part is it takes a lot of data with a high enough sample size and then it puts together its own algorithms."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "Okay, there are two ways you can come up with algorithms."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "You can either take your thinking and express them in algorithms or you can say, put the data in and say, what is the algorithm?"}, {"time": 2966, "text": "That's machine learning."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "And when you have machine learning, it'll give you equations which quite often are not understandable."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "If you would try to say, okay, now describe what it's telling you, it's very difficult to describe and so they can escape understanding."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "And so it's very good for doing those things that could be done over and over again if you're watching and you're not taking that."}, {"time": 2989, "text": "But if the future is different from the past and you have that, then if the future is different from the past and you don't have deep understanding,

ways, I think it's particularly good for processing."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "But the notion of what you want to do is better most of the time determined by the human mind."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "What are the principles?"}, {"time": 3024, "text": "Like, okay, how should I raise my children?"}, {"time": 3027, "text": "It's gonna be a long time before AI, you're going to say, it has a good enough judgment to do that."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "Who should I marry?"}, {"time": 3034, "text": "All of those things."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "Maybe you can get the computer to help you but if you just took data and do machine learning, it's not gonna find it."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "If you were to then take one of my criteria for any of those questions and then say, put them into an algorithm and you'd be a lot better off than if you took AI to do it."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "But by and large, the mind should be used for inventing and those creative things."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "And then the computer should be used for processing because it could process a lot more information, a lot faster, a lot more accurately and a lot less emotionally."}, {"time": 3072, "text":

brain, operating in a way where you can say, ah, that makes sense."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "You know, the process of reducing your understanding down to principles is kind of like the process, the first one you mentioned, type of AI algorithm where you're encoding your expertise, you're trying to program, write a program, the human is trying to write a program."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "How do you think that's attainable?"}, {"time": 3113, "text": "The process of reducing principles to a computer program or when you say, when you write about, when you think about principles, is there still a human element that's not reducible to an algorithm?"}, {"time": 3132, "text": "My experience has been that almost all things, including those things that I thought were pretty much impossible to express, I've been able to express in algorithms, but that doesn't constitute all things."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "So you can express far more than you can imagine you'll be able to express."},

"text": "Okay, at what age, what school?"}, {"time": 3171, "text": "And the way to do that, in my experience, is to take that and when you're in the moment of making a decision or just past making a decision, to take the time and to write down your criteria for making that decision in words."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "Okay, that way you'll get your principles down on paper."}, {"time": 3196,

get it on Android."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "It'll be, in a few months it'll be on Android."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "But it has an app in there that helps people write down their own principles."},

choosing the school for your child or whatever that might be, and you write down your criteria or whatever they are, those principles, you write down and that will at that moment make you articulate your principles in a very valuable way."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "And if you have the way that we operate that you have easy access, so then the next time that comes along, you can go to that, or you can show those principles to others to see if they're the right principles."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "You will get a clarity of that principle that's really invaluable in words and that'll help you a lot."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "But then you start to think, how do I express that in data?"}, {"time": 3266, "text": "And it'll shock you about how you can do that."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "You'll form an equation that will show the relationship between these particular parts and then essentially the variables that are going to go into that particular equation and you will be able to do that."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "And you take that little piece and you put it into the computer."}, {"time": 3288, "text": "And then take the next little piece and you put that into the computer."},

the notion that opportunity, education, development, creating equality, so that people say there's equal opportunity and is the most important thing."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "And then to find out

good education that they're receiving are the most important things in that person's development."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "The ability to be able to be prepared to go out there and then to go into a market that's an equal opportunity job market, to be able to then go into that kind of market is a system that creates not only fairness, anything else is not fair."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "And then in addition to that, it also is a more effective economic system because the consequences of not doing that to a society are devastating."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "If you look at what the difference in outcomes for somebody who completes high school or doesn't complete high school, or does each one of those state changes."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "And you look at what that means in terms of

so what I would want above all else is to provide that."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "So with that in mind, now we'll talk about universal basic income."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "Start with that, now we can talk about UBI."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "Right, because you have to have that."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "Now the question is what's the best way to provide that?"}, {"time": 4299, "text": "So when I look at UBI, I really think is what is going to happen with that $1,000, okay?"}, {"time": 4306, "text": "And will that $1,000 come from another program?"}, {"time": 4310, "text": "Does that come from an early childhood developmental program?"}, {"time": 4314, "text": "Who are you giving the $1,000 to and what will they do for that $1,000?"}, {"time": 4319, "text": "I mean, like my reaction would be, I think it's a great thing that everybody should have almost $1,000 in their bank and so on."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "But when do they get to make decisions or who's the parent?"}, {"time": 4330, "text": "A lot of times you can give $1,000 to somebody and it could have a negative result."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "It can have, they can use that money detrimentally,

and give a check, doesn't mean its outcomes are going to be good in providing those things that I think are so fundamental important."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "If it was just everybody can have $1,000 and use it so when the time comes."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "Use it well, right."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "And use it well, that would be really, really good because it's almost like everybody, you'd wish everybody could have $1,000 worth of wiggle room in their lives, okay."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "And I think that would be great."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "But I wanna make sure that these other things that are taken care of."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "So if it comes out of that budget and I don't want it to come out of that budget that's gonna be doing those things."},

wiggle room to use for the benefit of their children."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "Wow, that sounds great."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "If you put it in the hands of let's say an alcoholic or drug

contain a three and the guys I'm pointing to contain the numbers one, two, and six."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "So by putting it informally and also I convert it into a dialogue statement, that helps

thing that makes my book different from a lot of others is that I try to, not only present the algorithm, but I try to analyze them, which means quantitatively I say, not only does it work, but it works this fast."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "Okay, and so I need math for that."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "And then there's the standard way to structure data inside and represent information in the computer."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "So that's all volume one."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "Volume two talks, it's called Seminumerical Algorithms."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "And here we're writing programs, but we're also dealing with numbers."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "Algorithms deal with any kinds of objects, but specific when there's objects or numbers, well then we have certain special paradigms that apply to things that involve numbers."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "And so there's arithmetic on numbers and there's matrices full of numbers, there's random numbers, and there's power series full of numbers."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "There's different algebraic concepts that have numbers in structured ways."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "And arithmetic in the way a computer would think about arithmetic, so floating point."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Floating point arithmetic, high precision arithmetic, not only addition, subtraction, multiplication, but also comparison of numbers."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "So then volume three talks about."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "I like that one, sorting and search."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Sorting and search."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "I love sorting."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "Right, so here we're not dealing necessarily with numbers because you sort letters and other objects and searching we're doing all the time with Google nowadays, but I mean, we have to find stuff."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "So again, algorithms that underlie all kinds of applications."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "None of these volumes is about a particular application, but the applications are examples of why people want to know about sorting, why people want to know about random numbers."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "So then volume four goes into combinatorial algorithm."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "This is where we have zillions of things to deal with and here we keep finding cases where one good idea can make something go more than a million times faster."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "And we're dealing with problems that are probably never gonna be solved efficiently, but that doesn't mean we give up on them and we have this chance to have good ideas and go much, much faster on them."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "So that's combinatorial algorithms and those are the ones that are, I mean, you said sorting is most fun for you."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "It's true, it's fun, but combinatorial algorithms are the ones that I always enjoyed the most because that's when my skillet programming had most payoff."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "The difference between an obvious algorithm that you think up first thing and an interesting, subtle algorithm that's not so obvious, but run circles around the other one, that's where computer science really comes in."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "And a lot of these combinatorial methods were found first in applications to artificial intelligence or cryptography."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "And in my case, I just liked them and it was associated more with puzzles."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Do you like them most in the domain of graphs and graph theory?"}, {"time": 1984, "text": "Graphs are great because they're terrific models of so many things in the real world and you throw numbers on a graph, you got a network and so there you have many more things."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "But combinatorial in general is any arrangement of objects that has some kind of higher structure, nonrandom structure and is it possible to put something together satisfying all these conditions?"}, {"time": 2019, "text": "Like I mentioned arrows a minute ago, is there a way to put these numbers on a bunch of boxes that are pointing to each other?"}, {"time": 2027, "text": "Is that gonna be possible at all?"}, {"time": 2028, "text": "That's volume four."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "What does the future hold?"}, {"time": 2032, "text": "Volume four A was part one."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "And what happened was in 1962, when I started writing down a table of contents, it wasn't gonna be a book about computer programming in general, it was gonna be a book about how to write compilers."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "And I was asked to write a book explaining how to write a compiler."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "And at that time, there were only a few dozen people in the world who had written compilers and I happened to be one of them."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "And I also had some experience writing for like the campus newspaper and things like that."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So I said, okay, great."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "I'm the only person I know who's written a compiler but hasn't invented any new techniques for writing compilers."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "And all the other people I knew had super ideas but I couldn't see that they would be able to write a book that would describe anybody else's ideas with their own."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "So I could be the journalist and I could explain what all these cool ideas about compiler writing were."}, {"time": 2104, "text": "And then I started putting down, well, yeah, you need to have a chapter about data structures."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "You need to have some introductory material."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "I wanna talk about searching because a compiler writer has to look up the variables in a symbol table and find out which, when you write the name of a variable in one place, it's supposed to be the same as the one you put somewhere else."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "So you need all these basic techniques and I kinda know some arithmetic and stuff."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "So I threw in these chapters and I threw in a chapter on combinatorics because that was what I really enjoyed programming the most but there weren't many algorithms known about combinatorial methods in 1962."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "So that was a kind of a short chapter but it was sort of thrown in just for fun."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "And chapter 12 was gonna be actual compilers, applying all the stuff in chapters one to 11 to make compilers."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "Well, okay, so that was my table of contents from 1962."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "And during the 70s, the whole field of combinatorics went through a huge explosion."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "People talk about a combinatorial explosion and they usually mean by that that the number of cases goes up, you know, you change end to end plus one and all of a sudden your problem has gotten more than 10 times harder."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "But there was an explosion of ideas about combinatorics in the 70s to the point that like take 1975, I bet you more than half of all the journals of computer science were about combinatorial methods."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "What kind of problems were occupying people's minds?"}, {"time": 2212, "text": "What kind of problems in combinatorics?"}, {"time": 2214, "text": "Was it satisfiability, graph theory?"}, {"time": 2217, "text": "Yeah, graph theory was quite dominant."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "I mean, but all of the NP hard problems that you have like Hamiltonian path."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "Travel salesman."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "Going beyond graphs, you had operation research whenever there was a small class of problems that had efficient solutions and they were usually associated with matron theory, special mathematical construction."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "But once we went to things that involve three things at a time instead of two, all of a sudden things got harder."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So we had satisfiability problems where if you have clauses, every clause has two logical elements in it, then we can satisfy it in linear time."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "We can test for satisfiability in linear time, but if you allow yourself three variables in the clause, then nobody knows how to do it."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "So these articles were about trying to find better ways to solve cryptography problems and graph theory problems."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "We have lots of data, but we didn't know how to find the best subsets of the data."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "Like with sorting, we could get the answer."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "Didn't take long."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "So how did it continue to change from the 70s to today?"}, {"time": 2296, "text": "Yeah, so now there may be half a dozen conferences whose topic is combinatorics, a different kind, but fortunately I don't have to rewrite my book every month like I had to in the 70s."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "But still there's huge amount of work being done and people getting better ideas on these problems that don't seem to have really efficient solutions, but we still do a lot more with them."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "And so this book that I'm finishing now is, I've got a whole bunch of brand new methods that as far as I know, there's no other book that covers this particular approach."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "And so I'm trying to do my best of exploring the tip of the iceberg and I try out lots of things and keep rewriting as I find better method."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "So what's your writing process like?"}, {"time": 2358, "text": "What's your thinking and writing process like every day?"}, {"time": 2364, "text": "What's your routine even?"}, {"time": 2366, "text": "Yeah, I guess it's actually the best question because I spend seven days a week doing it."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "You're the most prepared to answer it."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "So the chair I'm sitting in is where I do..."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "It's where the magic happens."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "Well, reading and writing, the chair is usually sitting over there where I have other books, some reference books, but I found this chair which was designed by a Swedish guy anyway."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "It turns out this is the only chair I can really sit in for hours and hours and not know that I'm in a chair."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "But then I have the standup desk right next to us and so after I write something with pencil and eraser, I get up and I type it and revise and rewrite."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "I'm standing up."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "The kernel of the idea is first put on paper."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "And I'll write maybe five programs a week, of course, literate programming."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "And these are, before I describe something in my book, I always program it to see how it's working and I try it a lot."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "So for example, I learned at the end of January, I learned of a breakthrough by four Japanese people who had extended one of my methods in a new direction."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And so I spent the next five days writing a program to implement what they did."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "And then they had only generalized part of what I had done so then I had to see if I could generalize more parts of it."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "And then I had to take their approach and I had to try it out on a couple of dozen of the other problems I had already worked out with my old methods."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "And so that took another couple of weeks."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "And then I started to see the light and I started writing the final draft and then I would type it up, involve some new mathematical questions."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "And so I wrote to my friends who might be good at solving those problems and they solved some of them."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "So I put that in as exercises."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "And so a month later, I had absorbed one new idea that I learned and I'm glad I heard about it in time."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "Otherwise, I wouldn't put my book out before I'd heard about the idea."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "On the other hand, this book was supposed to come in at 300 pages and I'm up to 350 now."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "That added 10 pages to the book."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "But if I learn about another one, my publisher is gonna shoot me."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "Well, so in that process, in that one month process, are some days harder than others?"}, {"time": 2539, "text": "Are some days harder than others?"}, {"time": 2540, "text": "Well, yeah, my work is fun, but I also work hard and every big job has parts that are a lot more fun than others."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "And so many days I'll say, why do I have to have such high standards?"}, {"time": 2555, "text": "Why couldn't I just be sloppy and not try this out and just report the answer?"}, {"time": 2560, "text": "But I know that people are calling me to do this and so, okay, so, okay, Don, I'll grit my teeth and do it."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "And then the joy comes out when I see that actually, I'm getting good results and I get even more when I see that somebody has actually read and understood what I wrote and told me how to make it even better."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "I did wanna mention something about the method."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "So I got this tablet here, where I do the first, the first writing of concepts, okay, so."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "And what language is that in?"}, {"time": 2607, "text": "Right, so take a look at it, but you know, here, random say, explain how to draw such skewed pixel diagrams, okay, so."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "I got this paper about 40 years ago when I was visiting my sister in Canada and they make tablets of paper with this nice large size and just the right."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "A very small space between lines."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "Small spaces, yeah, yeah, take a look."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "Maybe also just show it."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "You know, I've got these manuscripts going back to the 60s."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "And those are where I'm getting my ideas on paper, okay."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "But I'm a good typist."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "In fact, I went to typing school when I was in high school and so I can type faster than I think."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "So then when I do the editing, stand up and type, then I revise this and it comes out a lot different than what, you know, for style and rhythm and things like that come out at the typing stage."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "And you type in tech."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "And I type in tech."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "And can you think in tech?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "To a certain extent, I have only a small number of idioms that I use."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "Like, you know, I'm beginning with theorem, I do something for displayed equation, I do something and so on."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "But I have to see it and."}, {"time": 2693, "text": "In the way that it's on paper here."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "So for example, Turing wrote, what, The Other Direction."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "You don't write macros, you don't think in macros."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "Not particularly, but when I need a macro, I'll go ahead and do it."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "But the thing is, I also write to fit."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "I mean, I'll change something if I can save a line."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "You know, it's like haiku."}, {"time": 2719, "text": "I'll figure out a way to rewrite the sentence so that it'll look better on the page."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "And I shouldn't be wasting my time on that, but I can't resist because I know it's only another 3% of the time or something like that."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "And it could also be argued that that is what life is about."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "Ah, yes, in fact, that's true."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "Like, I work in the garden one day a week and that's kind of a description of my life is getting rid of weeds, you know, removing bugs for programs."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "So, you know, a lot of writers talk about, you know, basically suffering, the writing processes, having, you know, it's extremely difficult."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "And I think of programming, especially, or technical writing that you're doing can be like that."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "Do you find yourself, methodologically, how do you every day sit down to do the work?"}, {"time": 2776, "text": "Is it a challenge?"}, {"time": 2778, "text": "You kind of say it's, you know, it's fun."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "But it'd be interesting to hear if there are non fun parts that you really struggle with."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "Yeah, so the fun comes when I'm able to put together ideas of two people who didn't know about each other."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "And so I might be the first person that saw both of their ideas."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "And so then, you know, then I get to make the synthesis and that gives me a chance to be creative."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "But the dredge work is where I've got to chase everything down to its root."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "This leads me into really interesting stuff."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "I mean, I learn about Sanskrit and I try to give credit to all the authors."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "And so I write to people who know the authors if they're dead or I communicate this way."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "And I got to get the math right."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "And I got to tackle all my programs, try to find holes in them."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "And I rewrite the programs after I get a better idea."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "Is there ever dead ends?"}, {"time": 2848, "text": "Oh yeah, I throw stuff out, yeah."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "One of the things that I spend a lot of time preparing, a major example based on the game of baseball."}, {"time": 2860, "text": "And I know a lot of people for whom baseball is the most important thing in the world."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "But I also know a lot of people for whom cricket is the most important in the world or soccer or something."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "You know, and I realized that if I had a big example, I mean, it was gonna have a fold out illustration and everything."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "And I was saying, well, what am I really teaching about algorithms here where I had this baseball example?"}, {"time": 2886, "text": "And if I was a person who knew only cricket, wouldn't they, what would they think about this?"}, {"time": 2892, "text": "And so I've ripped the whole thing out."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "But I had something that would have really appealed to people who grew up with baseball as a major theme in their life."}, {"time": 2904, "text": "Which is a lot of people, but still a minority."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "Small minority, I took out bowling too."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "Even a smaller minority."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "What's the art in the art of programming?"},

from the same root, saying that this is something that was created by human beings."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "And then it's gotten a further meaning often of fine art, which has this beauty to the mix."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "And so we have things that are artistically done, and this means not only done by humans, but also done in a way that's elegant and brings joy."}, {"time": 2975,

program and make a work of art."}, {"time": 3019, "text": "So now, in terms of surprising, what ideas in writing from search to the combinatorial algorithms, what ideas have you come across that were particularly surprising to you that changed the way you see a space of problems?"}, {"time": 3048, "text": "I get a surprise every time I have a bug in my program, obviously."}, {"time": 3051, "text":

about data structure called BDD, Boolean Decision Diagram."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "Because I sort of had the feeling that as an old timer, and I've been programming since the 50s, and BDDs weren't invented until 1986."}, {"time": 3083, "text": "And here comes a brand new idea that revolutionizes the way to represent a Boolean function."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "And Boolean functions are so

thought that was cut and dried and everything was known."}, {"time": 3115, "text": "But here comes Randy Bryant and discovers that BDDs are incredibly powerful."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "Then, so

pages, which is all about material, mostly about material that was discovered in this century."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "And I had to start from scratch and meet all the people in the field and write 15 different SAT solvers that I wrote while preparing that."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "Seven of them are described in the book."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "Others were from my own experience."},

years, are gonna show why machine learning doesn't solve everything."}, {"time": 3236, "text": "But I'm not only worried about the worst case, I get a huge delight when I can actually solve a problem that I couldn't solve before."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "Even though I can't solve the problem that it suggests is a further problem, I know that I'm way better than I was before."}, {"time": 3254,

case?"}, {"time": 3285, "text": "That something good, pragmatically can be done with this algorithm."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "Yeah, I like a good case that is maybe only a million times faster than

small group of people."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "And I realized that, in fact, it was very useful to be able to have a notation for something that we don't know exactly what it is, but we only know partial about it."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "And so instead, so for example, instead of big O notation, let's just take a much simpler notation where I'd say zero or one, or zero, one or two."},

the plastic water bottle walls or is it purely magnetic fields?"}, {"time": 930, "text": "Well, actually what we do need walls, those walls must be kept away from the plasma because otherwise they'd be melted or the plasma must be kept away from them inside of them."}, {"time": 942, "text": "But the main purpose of the walls is not to keep the plasma in, it's to keep the atmosphere out."},

that."}, {"time": 991, "text": "What we don't quite know how to do is to make a confinement device that isolates the plasma well enough so that it's able to keep itself burning with its own reaction."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "So maybe can you talk about what a tokamak is?"}, {"time": 1007, "text": "The Russian acronym from which the word tokamak is built just means toroidal magnetic chamber."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "So it's a toroidal chamber, a torus is a geometric shape which is like a doughnut with a hole down the middle."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "And so it's the meat of the doughnut, that's the torus, and it's got a magnetic field."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So that's really all tokamak means."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "But the particular configuration that is very widespread and is the sort of best prospect in the least in the near term for making fusion energy work is one in which there's a very strong magnetic field the long way around the doughnut, around the torus."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "So you've got to imagine that there's this doughnut shape with an embedded magnetic field just going round and round the long way."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "The big advantage of that is that plasma particles when they're in the presence of a magnetic field feel strong forces from the magnetic field and those forces make the particles gyrate around the direction of the magnetic field line."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "So basically the particles follow helical orbits following like a spring that's directed along the magnetic field."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "Well if you make the magnetic field go inside this toroidal chamber and just simply go round and round the chamber then because of this helical orbit the particles can't move fast across the magnetic field but they can move very quickly along the magnetic field."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "And if you have a magnetic field that doesn't leave the chamber it doesn't matter if they move along the magnetic field it doesn't mean they're going to exit the chamber."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "But if you just had a straight magnetic field for example coming from a Helmholtz coil or a bar magnet then you'd have to have ends that would come to the ends of the chamber somewhere and the particles would hit the ends and they would lose their energy."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "So that's why it's toroidal and that's why we have a strong magnetic field."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "It's providing a confinement against motion in the in the direction that would lead the particles to leave the chamber."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "It turns out that here we're getting a little bit technical but turns out that a toroidal field alone is not enough and so you need more fields to produce true true confinement of plasma and we get those by passing a current as well through the plasma itself."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "I can make sure it stays on track."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "Well that what that does is makes the field lines themselves into much bigger helices and that for reasons that are too complicated to explain that clinches the confinement of the particles at least in terms of their single particle orbits so they don't leave the chamber."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "So when the particles are flying along this this this donut the inside of the donut are they what's where's the generation of the energy coming from?"}, {"time": 1203, "text": "Are they smashing into each other?"}, {"time": 1207, "text": "Yeah eventually I mean in a fusion reactor there will be deuterons and tritons and they will be smashing in."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "They will be very hot there'll be a hundred million degrees Celsius or something so they're moving thermally with very large thermal energies in random directions and they will collide with one another and have fusion reactions."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "When those fusion reactions take place energy is released large amounts of energy is released in the form of particles."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "One of the particles that's released is an alpha particle which is also charged and it's also confined and that alpha particle stays in the in the in the donut and heats the other particles that are in that donut so it transfers its energy to those and they it keeps them hot."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "There are there's some leaking of heat all the time a little bit of radiation some transport and so forth."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "There's also a neutron released from that reaction the neutron carries out four fifths of the fusion energy and that will have to be captured in a blanket that surrounds the chamber in which we take the energy drive some kind of electrical generator from you know thermal thermal engine gas turbine or something like that and power the power."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "You got energy."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "So where do we stand?"}, {"time": 1289, "text": "I'm getting this thing to be something that actually works that generates energy."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "Well there have been experiments that have generated net nuclear energies or nuclear powers in the vicinity of you know a few tens of megawatts for a few seconds."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "So that's you know 10 megajoules that's not much energy it's a few donuts worth of energy okay."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "A literal donut."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "But we have studied how well tokamaks can find plasmas and so we now understand in rather great detail the way they work and we're able to predict what is going to be required in order to build a tokamak that becomes self sustaining that becomes essentially ignited or very so close to ignited that it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "And at the moment at least if you use the modest magnetic field values still very strong but limited magnetic field values you have to build a very big device."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "And so we are at the

"It's been an objective that is in many ways motivated my entire career and the career of many people like me in the field."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "I have to admit though that one of the problems with ITER is that it's an extremely big and expensive and long time to build experiment and so it won't even come into operation until about 2025 even though it's been being built for 10 years and it was designed for 30 years before that."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "And so that's actually one of the big disappointments of my career in a certain sense which is that we won't get to burning fusion reaction until well past the first operation of ITER and whether I'm alive or not I don't know but I certainly will be well and truly retired by the time that happens."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And so when I realized maybe some years ago that that was going to be the case it was a discouragement to me let's put it like that."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "But if we can try to look maybe in a

that to break down food to get energy to store energy, and then ultimately to use it."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And all life here has some kind of byproduct in doing all that, some kind of waste product that goes into the atmosphere."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "So I like to think that life everywhere uses chemistry."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "Some people have imagined, like, let's imagine like a windmill, like mechanical energy, just getting energy and using it without storing it."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "And if there was life like that, it might not need to output a gas."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "So we make this basic assumption of chemistry, that's the first thing."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "The second more complicated thing that I and my team work on is what happens to the gas once it is produced by life, it goes into the atmosphere."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "And a lot of gas is just destroyed immediately, actually, by ultraviolet radiation or by oxygen."}, {"time": 1499,

feels like there's no tool to answer that question."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "And then what you kind of provided is this cool idea that it might be possible to answer that by looking at the gases."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "I mean, that's a really interesting, that's a beautiful idea."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "And yeah, so we could just pause on like, that's a powerful tool, I think, to build the

life who were very skeptical about this notion."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "Well, maybe I'm not sure, but generally you would want to be skeptical, it's like, well, all these kinds of other things could generate gases, you know, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "Oh, that's so true."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And that's a big part of this growing field is how to make sure that this gas isn't produced by another effect."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "But I do want to, you know, again, pausing on that and going back a bit."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "It's incredible to think, but like, at least almost 100 years ago, there's a record of someone talking about the idea of a gas being an indicator of life elsewhere."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "That idea was floating about somewhere."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "Yes, it was totally floating about."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "And it comes down to oxygen, which on our planet fills our atmosphere to 20% by volume."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "And you know, we rely on oxygen to breathe."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "You know, when you hear about the people in Mount Everest running out of air, they're really running out of oxygen, well, they're running out of oxygen because the air is getting thinner as they climb up the mountain."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "But without plants and bacteria, there's bacteria that also photosynthesizes and produces oxygen as a waste product."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "Without those, we would have virtually no oxygen."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "Our atmosphere would be devoid of oxygen."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "So yeah, if you were to analyze Earth, is oxygen the strong indicator here?"}, {"time": 1641, "text": "Oxygen is a huge indicator."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "And that's what we're hoping, that there is an intelligent civilization not too far from here around a planet orbiting a nearby star with the kind of telescopes we're trying to build."}, {"time": 1652,

type of gases that are on the planet from a distance?"}, {"time": 1675, "text": "And that's going back to that, that's what people were skeptical about."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "When I first started working on exoplanets a long time ago, people didn't believe we would ever, ever, ever study an exoplanet atmosphere of any kind."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "And now dozens of them are studied."},

1990s."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "That was a big deal."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Kind of vaguely remember that."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "Well, at the time it was a big deal, but it was also incredibly controversial."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "Because in exoplanets, we only had one example of a planetary system, our own solar system."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "And in our solar system, Jupiter, our big massive planet, is really far from our star."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "And this first exoplanet around a sun like star was incredibly close to its star, so close that people just couldn't believe it was a planet actually."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "So maybe zoom out, what the heck is an exoplanet?"}, {"time": 1740, "text": "An exoplanet is our name, like is the name that we call a planet orbiting a star other than our sun."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "Extrasolar, I guess is another."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "You can call it extrasolar."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "Exoplanet is simpler."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "But I think it's worth pausing to remember that each one of those stars out there in our night sky is a sun."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And you know, our sun has planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "And so for a long time, people have wondered, do those other stars or other suns have planets?"}, {"time": 1769, "text": "And they do."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And it appears that nearly every star has a planet, has a planet we call exoplanet."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "And there are thousands of known exoplanets already."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So there's already, yeah, like, there's so many things about space that it's hard to put into one's brain, because it starts filling it with awe."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "So yeah, if you visualize the fact that the stars that we see in the sky aren't just stars, they're like, they're suns."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "And they very likely, as you're saying, would have planets around them."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "There's all these planets roaming about in this like, dimly lit darkness, with potentially life."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "I mean, it's just mind blowing."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "But maybe can you give a brief, like, history of discovering all the exoplanets?"}, {"time": 1823, "text": "So there's no exoplanets in the 90s."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "And then there's a lot of exoplanets now."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "So how did that come about?"}, {"time": 1829, "text": "So many planets."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "How did it come about?"}, {"time": 1832, "text": "Well, maybe another way to ask is, what is the methodology that was used to discover them?"}, {"time": 1838, "text": "I can say that."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "But I'd like to just say something else first where, so exoplanets, you know, the line between what is considered completely crazy."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "And what is considered mainstream research, legit, is constantly shifting."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "So before, when I started on exoplanets, it was still sketchy."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "Like, it wasn't considered a career, a thing, a place where you should be investing."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And right now, now, today, it's so many people are working in this field, a good, I don't know, at least 1000, probably more."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "I don't know if that sounds like a lot to you, but it's a lot."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "No, it's a legitimate field of inquiry."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "Legitimate field of inquiry."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "And what's helped us is everything that's helped everyone else."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "It's software, it's computers, it's hardware."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "It's like our phones."}, {"time": 1882, "text": "You have a fantastic detector in there."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "Like, they didn't always have that."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "I don't know if you remember the so called olden days."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "We didn't have digital cameras."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "We had film."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "You take a film camera, you send the film away, and eventually it comes back, and then you see your pictures."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "And they could all be horrible."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "So yeah, I mean, digital."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "It just changed everything."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "Data changed everything."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "Yeah, and so one thing that really helped exoplanets were detectors that were very sensitive."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "Because when we're looking for the transiting planets, what we're doing is we're monitoring a star's brightness as a function of time."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "It's like click, taking a picture of the stars every few seconds or minutes."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "And we're measuring the brightness of a star, like every frame."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "And we're looking for a drop in brightness that's characteristic of a planet going in front of the star, and then finishing its so called transit."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "And to make that measurement, we have to have precise detectors."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "And the detectors that are making the measurement, can you do it from Earth?"}, {"time": 1942, "text": "Are they floating about in space, like what kind of telescope?"}, {"time": 1945, "text": "So on the ground, people are using telescopes, small telescopes that are almost just like a glorified telephoto lens."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "And they're looking at big swaths of the sky."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "And from the ground, people can find giant planets like the size of Jupiter."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "So it's about 10 to 12 times the size of Earth."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "We can find big planets, because we can reach about 1% precision."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "So not sure how technical you want to get."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "Well, how many pixels are we talking about?"}, {"time": 1973, "text": "You mentioned phones, there's a bunch of megapixels, I think."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "So for exoplanets, you want to think about it as like a pixel or less than a pixel, we're not getting any information."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "But to be more technical, our telescope spreads the light out over many pixels, but we're not getting information."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "We're not tiling the planet with pixels."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "It's just like a point of light, or in most cases, we don't even see the planet itself, just the planet's effect on the star."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "But another thing that really helped was computers, because transiting planets are actually quite rare."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "I mean, they don't all go in front of their star."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "And so to find transiting planets, we look at a big part of the sky at once, or we look at tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, or even in some cases, millions of stars at one time."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "And so you're not going to do this by hand, going through a million stars, counting up the brightness."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "So we have computer software and computer code that does the job for us and counts the brightness and looks for a signal that could be due to a transiting planet."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And I just finished a job called Deputy Science Director for the MIT led NASA mission test."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "And it was my purview to make sure that we got the planet candidates, the transiting light curves, out to the community so people could follow them up and figure out if they're actual planets or false positives."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "So publish the data so that people could just, all the data scientists out there could crunch and see if they can discover something."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "They can discover something."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "And in fact, the NASA policy for this mission is that all the data becomes public as soon as possible."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "It's not as easy as it sounds, though, to download the data and look for planets."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "But there is a group called PlanetHunters.org, and they take the data and they actually crowdsource it out to people to look for planets."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "And they often find signals that our computers and our team missed."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "So we mentioned exoplanets."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "What about Earth like, or I don't know what the right distinction is, is it habitable or is it Earth like planets, but what are those different categories and how can we tell the difference and detect each?"}, {"time": 2098, "text": "So we're not at Earth like planets yet."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "All the planets we're finding are so different from what we have in our solar system."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "They're just easier planets to find, but like..."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "For example, there could be a Jupiter sized planet where an Earth should be."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "We find planets that are the same size as Earth, but are orbiting way closer to their star than Mercury is to our sun."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "They're so close that, because close to a star means they also orbit faster."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "And some of these hot super Earths we call them, their year, their time to go around their star is less than a day."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And they're heated so much by their star, they're heated so much by the star."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "So instead of running out by the bay or the river, you'll have like liquid lava."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "There'll be liquid lava lakes on these planets, we think."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "And life can't survive."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "Way too hot."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "The molecules needed for life just wouldn't be able to survive those temperatures."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "We have some other planets."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "One of the most mysterious things out there, factoid, if you will, is that the most common type of planet we know about so far is a planet that's in between Earth and Neptune size."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "It's two to three times the size of Earth."}, {"time": 2175, "text": "And we have no solar system counterpart of that planet."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "That is like going outside to the forest and finding some kind of creature or animal that just no one has ever seen before and then discovering that is the most common thing out there."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "And so we're not even sure what they are."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "We have a lot of thoughts as to the different types of planet it could be, but people don't really know."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "I mean, what are your thoughts about what it could be?"}, {"time": 2197, "text": "Well, one thought, and this is more when we want to be rather than might be, is that these so called mini Neptunes, we call them, that they are water worlds, that they could be scaled up versions of Jupiter's icy moons, such that they are planets that are made of more than half of water by mass."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "And what's the connection between water and life and the possibility of seeing that from a gas perspective?"}, {"time": 2223, "text": "Okay, so all life on Earth needs liquid water."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "And so there's been this idea in astronomy or astrobiology for a long time called follow the water, find water, that will give you a chance of finding life, but we could still zoom out and the community consensus is that we need some kind of liquid for life to originate and to survive because molecules have to react."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "You don't have a way that molecules can interact with each other."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "You can't really make anything."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "And so when we think of all the liquids out there, water is the most abundant liquid in terms of planetary materials."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "There really aren't that many liquids."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "Like I mentioned, liquid rock, way too hot for life."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "We have some really cold liquids, like almost gasoline, like ethane and methane lakes that have been found on one of Saturn's moons, Titan."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "That's so cold though."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And for exoplanets, we can't study really cold planets because they're just simply too dark and too cold."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "So we usually are just left with looking for planets with liquid water."}, {"time": 2285, "text": "And to your point, remember as we talked about how planets are less than a pixel in that way to say, so we can't see oceans on planet."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "We're not going to see continents and oceans, not yet anyway, but we can see gases in the atmosphere."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And if it's a small rocky planet, and this is going into some more detail, if we see a small rocky planet with water vapor in the atmosphere, we're pretty sure that means there has to be a liquid water reservoir because it's not intuitive in any way, but water is broken up by ultraviolet radiation from the star or from the sun."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "And on most planets when water is broken up into H and O, the H, the hydrogen will escape to space."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "Because just like when you think of a child letting go of a helium filled balloon, it floats upwards and hydrogen is a light gas and will leave from the planet."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So ultimately if you have water, unless there's an ocean, like a way to keep replenishing water vapor in the atmosphere, that water vapor should be destroyed by ultraviolet radiation."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "Got it, so there's a, okay, so there's a need for liquid, I mean, I guess it was water."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "Is water essential or are the liquids, I mean, the chemistry here is probably super complicated."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "It does, but you know, there's not an infinite number of liquids."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "There's maybe like five liquids that can exist inside or on the surface of a planet."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "And water is the one that exists for the largest range of temperatures and pressures."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "And it's also the easiest type of planet for us to find and study is one with water vapor rather than a cold planet that has ethane and methane lakes."}, {"time":

life is just super abundant out there."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "Yeah, the dream, yes, the dream condition is that life is super abundant and it's based on the thought that if there is a planet with

will form."}, {"time": 2438, "text": "That's what we're holding on to."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "With a relatively high probability."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "Yes, that's it."}, {"time": 2443,

right now."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "Another one was that star shade, even though it's looking at a star, light from our own sun could hit the edges of the star shade and bounce off into the telescope, believe it or not."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "And that would actually ruin it because we're trying to see this tiny, tiny signal."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "So then the question is how do you make a razor thin edge?"}, {"time": 3955, "text": "Those pedal edges would have to be like a razor."}, {"time": 3958, "text": "What materials can you use?"}, {"time": 3959, "text": "So there's a series of problems like that."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "So there's a materials problem in there?"}, {"time": 3963, "text": "Some of them."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "And there's one."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "So we almost finished solving all those problems and then it's just a matter of building one and testing it in a full scale size facility and then building the telescope."}, {"time": 3978, "text": "It's just a matter of time to build everything and get it, get it up for launch."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "So this is an engineering close engineering project."}, {"time": 3986, "text": "It's a real engineering project."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "I actually can tell you about two other projects that are not mine."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "I like to call, call star shade mine because it was my project that I helped make it mainstream without line is constantly shifting."}, {"time": 4000, "text": "When I started, when I got this leadership role on star shade, I remember telling people about it and it was definitely not on the mainstream okay line."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "It was on the giggle factor side of the line and people would just laugh like that's dead."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "Like you can never formation fly or they'd say, why are you working on that?"}, {"time": 4015, "text": "That's just so not, it's not so awesome."}, {"time": 4018, "text": "There's a, there's a few things you've done in your life and that's when I first saw star shade, I was like, what, really?"}, {"time": 4024, "text": "And then like it sinks in."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "I mean, it's the same thing I felt with like Elon Musk or certain people who do crazy stuff and like, and then, and they get, they actually make it work."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "I mean, if you get star shade information flying to like together, I mean, how awesome is that if you actually make that happen, even like from a robot, I'm sorry, from the robotics perspective, even if it doesn't give us good data, that's just like a cool thing to get out there."}, {"time": 4053, "text": "I mean, it's really exciting."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "Really cool."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "So there's two other topics that aren't mine, but I still love them."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "One of them, let's just talk about it briefly because it's not a probe, but it's the idea to send a telescope very far away to 500 times the earth sun distance."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "And this is way farther than the Voyager spacecrafts are right now."}, {"time": 4071, "text": "And to use our sun as a gravitational lens, to use our sun to magnify something that's behind it."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "It's got to sink in for a minute."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "But I mean, I don't know what the physics of that is, like how to use the sun."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "In astronomy, and Einstein thought about this initially, we can use a massive objects, bend space."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "And so light that should be traveling like straight, it actually travels around the warped space."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "And somehow you figure out a way to use that for magnification."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "You have a way to use that for magnification."}, {"time": 4106, "text": "There are galaxies that are lensed, so called gravitational lens by intervening galaxy clusters actually."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "And there are microlensing events where stars get magnified as an unseen gravitational lens star passes in between us and that very distant star."}, {"time": 4123, "text": "It's actually a real tool in astronomy."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "Yeah, using gravitational lensing to magnify because it bends more rays towards you than normally you'd normally see."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "And again, we're trying to get more higher resolution images that are basically boiled down to light."}, {"time": 4139, "text": "Well, it boils down to light."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "And then you can maybe get more information about."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "Well, in this case, you would ask me, let's say, if this thing could get built, it would take like something like they like to say 25 years to get from here to there, 25 years and then it could send some information back to us."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "And then you'd say, so Sarah, how many pixels?"}, {"time": 4160, "text": "And I wouldn't say one or less than one."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "I'd say, you know, it could be like 10 by 10 pixels, it could be 100 pixels, which would be awesome."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "I mean, that's still crazy that we can get a lot of information from that."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "Crazy, right."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "And it's crazy for a lot of other reasons, because again, you have to line up the sun and your target."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "You'd only have one telescope per target, because every star is behind the sun in a different way."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "So it's a lot of complicated things."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "What about the second?"}, {"time": 4184, "text": "The second one, it's called star shot."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "You know, star shot means like big dreams and it's an initiative by the Breakthrough Foundation."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "And star shot is the concept to send thousands of little tiny spacecraft, which they now call star chip."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "So instead of star ship, it's star chip."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "And there's a little chip and the star chip, so like sending like thousands of little turtles being born, they're not all going to make it."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "The idea is to send lots of them, and each of these star chips, once they're launched into, I guess, low Earth orbit, they will deploy a solar sail that's a few meters in diameter."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "And the idea is that on Earth, we would have a bank of, this one is still a bit on the other side of the line, but we'd have a bank of telescopes with lasers that would be like a gigawatt power and these lasers would momentarily shine upwards and accelerate, they'd hit these sails."}, {"time": 4249, "text": "They'd be like a power source for the sail and would accelerate the sails to travel at about a 20th the speed of light."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "Is that as crazy as it sounds?"}, {"time": 4259, "text": "Well, like any good engineering project, it has to be broken down into the crazy parts."}, {"time": 4265, "text": "And the Breakthrough Initiative, like to their huge credit, is sponsoring, you know, getting over these, actually, they've listed initially, they listed 19 challenges, so it's broken down to concrete things."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "Like one of them is, well, you have to buy the land and make sure the airspace is okay with you sending up that much power overhead."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "Another one is you have to have material on the sail where the lasers won't just vaporize it."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "So there's a lot of issues, but anyway, these sails would be accelerated to 20th the speed of light and their journey to the nearest star would no longer be tens of thousands of years, but could be 20 years, okay, 20, so it's not as bad as tens of thousands."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "And these thousands or whatever, however many make it, they'll go by the nearest star system and snap some images and radio the information back to Earth because they're traveling so fast they can't slow down, but they'll zoom by, take some photos, send it back."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "Hi, Rez."}, {"time": 4322, "text": "See, just what I want you to pause on for a second is that just by making that a real concept and the money given won't make it happen, but what it's done is it's planted the seed and it's shifted that line from what is crazy to what is a real project."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "It's shifted it just ever so slightly enough, I think, to plant the seed that we have to find a way to somehow find a way to get there."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "That is, again, to stay on that, that is so powerful."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "Make a big, crazy idea and break it down into smaller, crazy ideas, order it in a list, and knock it out one at a time."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "I don't know, I've never heard anything more

out loud, PSO 1.522, so a Rogue Planet, which is just this poetic, beautiful vision of a planet that, as you write, lurches across the galaxy like a rudderless ship wrapped in perpetual darkness, its surface swept by constant storms, its black skies raining molten iron."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "Just like the vision of that, the scary, the darkness, just how not pleasant it is for human life, just the intensity of that metaphor, I don't know."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "And the reason you use that is to paint in a feeling of loneliness, I think, and despair."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "And

feel pretty good being part of this solar system."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "It felt like we have a sun, we have like a little family, and it felt like it sucked for the rogue planet to just floating

intelligence?"}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So maybe you would have language, for instance, and you'd have motion."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "And so you would start drawing notes with these things."},

"text": "Is it a tree mostly or is it a graph too, like a tree?"}, {"time": 1025, "text": "Oh, it's more of a graph than a tree."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "And it's not limited to just writing down words."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "You can also draw things."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And it's not supposed to be purely hierarchical, right?"}, {"time": 1041, "text": "The point is that once you start writing it down, you can start reorganizing it so that it makes more sense, so that it's connected in a more effective way."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "See, but I'm so OCD that you just mentioned intelligence and language and motion."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "I would start becoming paranoid that the categorization isn't perfect."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "Like that I would become paralyzed with the mind map that like this may not be."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "So like the, even though you're just doing associative kind of connections, there's an implied hierarchy that's emerging."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "And I would start becoming paranoid that it's not the proper hierarchy."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "So you're not just, one way to see mind maps is you're putting thoughts on paper."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "It's like a stream of consciousness, but then you can also start getting paranoid."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "Well, is this the right hierarchy?"}, {"time": 1095,

something if you don't write it down, right?"}, {"time": 1122, "text": "If you do that, the thing is that it imposes much more syntactic structure over your ideas, which is not required with mind maps."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "So mind map is kind of like a lower level, more freehand way of organizing your thoughts."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "And once you've drawn it, then you can start actually voicing your thoughts in terms of, you know, paragraphs."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "It's a two dimensional aspect of layout too, right?"}, {"time": 1149, "text": "It's a kind of flower, I

more like a subway map."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "So it ends up more like a graph, a topological graph without a root node."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "Yeah, so like in a subway map, there are some nodes that are more connected than others."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "And there are some nodes that are more important than others."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "So there are destinations, but it's not going to be purely like a tree, for instance."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Yeah, it's fascinating to think that if there's something to that about the way our mind thinks."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "By the way, I just kind of remembered obvious thing that I have probably thousands of documents in Google Doc at this point, that are bullet point lists, which is, you can probably map a mind map to a

comforting."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "If you have thousands of documents with your own thoughts in Google Docs, why don't you write some kind of search engine, like maybe a mind map, a piece of

really have the concept of distance."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "You only have the concept of whether there is a train going from station A to station B."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "And what we do in

environment is."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "That's a big part of intelligence."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "And intelligence is more precisely, you know, how efficiently you're able to adapt, how efficiently you're able to basically master your environment, how efficiently you can acquire new skills."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "And I think there's a big distinction to be drawn between intelligence, which is a process, and the output of that process, which is skill."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "So for instance, if you have a very smart human brain, so for instance, if you have a very smart human programmer that considers the game of chess, and that writes down a static program that can play chess, then the intelligence is the process of developing that program."}, {"time": 1760,

intelligence, the entity that is capable of that process is the human programmer."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "So we should be able to tell the difference between the process and its output."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "We should not confuse the output and the process."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "It's the same as, you know, do not confuse a road building company and one specific road, because one

but it's also to play devil's advocate a little bit."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "You know, it's possible that there's something more fundamental than us humans."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "So you kind of said the programmer creates the difference between the choir, the skill and the skill itself."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "There could be something like, you could argue the universe is more intelligent."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "Like the base intelligence that we should be trying to measure is something that created humans."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "We should be measuring God or the source of the universe as opposed to, like there could be a deeper intelligence."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "There's always deeper intelligence, I guess."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "You can argue that,

1867, "text": "And you see that in particular in the fact that humans are capable of handling situations and tasks that are quite different from anything that any of our evolutionary ancestors has ever encountered."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "So we are capable of generalizing very much out of distribution, if you consider our evolutionary history as being in a way our training data."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "Of course, evolutionary biologists would argue that we're not going too far out of the distribution."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "We're like mapping the skills we've learned previously, desperately trying to like jam them into like these new situations."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "I mean, there's definitely a little bit of that, but it's pretty clear to me that we're able to, most of the things we do any given day in our modern civilization are things that are very, very different from what our ancestors a million years ago would have been doing in a given day."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "And your environment is very different."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "So I agree that everything we do, we do it with cognitive building blocks that we acquired over the course of evolution, right?"}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And that anchors our cognition to a certain context, which is the human condition very much."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "But still our mind is capable of a pretty remarkable degree of generality far beyond anything we can create in artificial systems today."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "Like the degree in which the mind can generalize from its evolutionary history, can generalize away from its evolutionary history is much greater than the degree to which a deep learning system today can generalize away from its training data."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "And like the key point you're making, which I think is quite beautiful is like, we shouldn't measure, if we're talking about measurement, we shouldn't measure the skill."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "We should measure like the creation of the new skill, the ability to create that new skill."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "But it's tempting, like it's weird because the skill is a little bit of a small window into the system."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "So whenever you have a lot of skills, it's tempting to measure the skills."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "I mean, the skill is the only thing you can objectively measure, but yeah."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "So the thing to keep in mind is that when you see skill in the human, it gives you a strong signal that that human is intelligent because you know they weren't born with that skill typically."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "Like you see a very strong chess player, maybe you're a very strong chess player yourself."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "I think you're saying that because I'm Russian and now you're prejudiced, you assume."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "All Russians are good at chess."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "I'm biased, exactly."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "I'm biased, yeah."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "Well, you're definitely biased."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "So if you see a very strong chess player, you know they weren't born knowing how to play chess."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "So they had to acquire that skill with their limited resources, with their limited lifetime."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "And they did that because they are generally intelligent."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "And so they may as well have acquired any other skill."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "You know they have this potential."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "And on the other hand, if you see a computer playing chess, you cannot make the same assumptions because you cannot just assume the computer is generally intelligent."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "The computer may be born knowing how to play chess in the sense that it may have been programmed by a human that has understood chess for the computer and that has just encoded the output of that understanding in a static program."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "And that program is not intelligent."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "So let's zoom out just for a second and say like, what is the goal on the measure of intelligence paper?"}, {"time": 2097, "text": "Like what do you hope to achieve with it?"}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So the goal of the paper is to clear up some longstanding misunderstandings about the way we've been conceptualizing intelligence in the AI community and in the way we've been evaluating progress in AI."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "There's been a lot of progress recently in machine learning and people are extrapolating from that progress that we are about to solve general intelligence."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "And if you want to be able to evaluate these statements, you need to precisely define what you're talking about when you're talking about general intelligence."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "And you need a formal way, a reliable way to measure how much intelligence, how much general intelligence a system processes."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "And ideally this measure of intelligence should be actionable."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "So it should not just describe what intelligence is."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "It should not just be a binary indicator that tells you the system is intelligent or it isn't."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "It should be actionable."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "It should have explanatory power, right?"}, {"time": 2165, "text": "So you could use it as a feedback signal."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "It would show you the way towards building more intelligent systems."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "So at the first level, you draw a distinction between two divergent views of intelligence."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "As we just talked about, intelligence is a collection of task specific skills and a general learning ability."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "So what's the difference between kind of this memorization of skills and a general learning ability?"}, {"time": 2197, "text": "We've talked about it a little bit, but can you try to linger on this topic for a bit?"}, {"time": 2203, "text": "Yeah, so the first part of the paper is an assessment of the different ways we've been thinking about intelligence and the different ways we've been evaluating progress in AI."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "And this tree of cognitive sciences has been shaped by two views of the human mind."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "And one view is the evolutionary psychology view in which the mind is a collection of fairly static special purpose ad hoc mechanisms that have been hard coded by evolution over our history as a species for a very long time."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "And early AI researchers, people like Marvin Minsky, for instance, they clearly subscribed to this view."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "And they saw the mind as a kind of collection of static programs similar to the programs they would run on like mainframe computers."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "And in fact, I think they very much understood the mind through the metaphor of the mainframe computer because that was the tool they were working with, right?"}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And so you had these static programs, this collection of very different static programs operating over a database like memory."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "And in this picture, learning was not very important."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "Learning was considered to be just memorization."}, {"time": 2285, "text": "And in fact, learning is basically not featured in AI textbooks until the 1980s with the rise of machine learning."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "It's kind of fun to think about that learning was the outcast."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "Like the weird people working on learning, like the mainstream AI world was, I mean, I don't know what the best term is, but it's non learning."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "It was seen as like reasoning would not be learning based."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "Yes, it was considered that the mind was a collection of programs that were primarily logical in nature."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "And that's all you needed to do to create a mind was to write down these programs and they would operate over knowledge, which would be stored in some kind of database."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "And as long as your database would encompass, you know, everything about the world and your logical rules were comprehensive, then you would have a mind."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "So the other view of the mind is the brain as a sort of blank slate, right?"}, {"time": 2351, "text": "This is a very old idea."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "You find it in John Locke's writings."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "This is the tabula rasa."},

skills from experience, right?"}, {"time": 2374, "text": "So it's a sponge that reflects the complexity of the world, the complexity of your life experience, essentially."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "That everything you know and everything you can do is a reflection of something you found in the outside world, essentially."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "So this is an idea that's very old."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "That was not very popular, for instance, in the 1970s."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "But that gained a lot of vitality recently with the rise of connectionism, in particular deep learning."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "And so today, deep learning is the dominant paradigm in AI."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "And I feel like lots of AI researchers are conceptualizing the mind via a deep learning metaphor."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "Like they see the mind as a kind of randomly initialized neural network that starts blank when you're born."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "And then that gets trained via exposure to trained data that acquires knowledge and skills via exposure to trained data."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "By the way, it's a small tangent."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "I feel like people who are thinking about intelligence are not conceptualizing it that way."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "I actually haven't met too many people who believe that a neural network will be able to reason, who seriously think that rigorously."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "Because I think it's actually an interesting worldview."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And we'll talk about it more, but it's been impressive what neural networks have been able to accomplish."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "And to me, I don't know, you might disagree, but it's an open question whether like scaling size eventually might lead to incredible results to us mere humans will appear as if it's general."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "I mean, if you ask people who are seriously thinking about intelligence, they will definitely not say that all you need to do is, like the mind is just a neural network."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "However, it's actually a view that's very popular, I think, in the deep learning community that many people are kind of conceptually intellectually lazy about it."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "Right, it's a, but I guess what I'm saying exactly right, it's, I mean, I haven't met many people and I think it would be interesting to meet a person who is not intellectually lazy about this particular topic and still believes that neural networks will go all the way."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "I think Yama is probably closest to that with self supervised."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "There are definitely people who argue that current deep learning techniques are already the way to general artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "And that all you need to do is to scale it up to all the available trained data."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "And that's, if you look at the waves that OpenAI's GPT3 model has made, you see echoes of this idea."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "So on that topic, GPT3, similar to GPT2 actually, have captivated some part of the imagination of the public."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "There's just a bunch of hype of different kind."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "That's, I would say it's emergent."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "It's not artificially manufactured."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "It's just like people just get excited for some strange reason."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "And in the case of GPT3, which is funny, that there's, I believe, a couple months delay from release to hype."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "Maybe I'm not historically correct on that, but it feels like there was a little bit of a lack of hype and then there's a phase shift into hype."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "But nevertheless, there's a bunch of cool applications that seem to captivate the imagination of the public about what this language model that's trained in unsupervised way without any fine tuning is able to achieve."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "So what do you make of that?"}, {"time": 2600, "text": "What are your thoughts about GPT3?"}, {"time": 2602, "text": "Yeah, so I think what's interesting about GPT3 is the idea that it may be able to learn new tasks after just being shown a few examples."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "So I think if it's actually capable of doing that, that's novel and that's very interesting and that's something we should investigate."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "That said, I must say, I'm not entirely convinced that we have shown it's capable of doing that."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "It's very likely, given the amount of data that the model is trained on, that what it's actually doing is pattern matching a new task you give it with a task that it's been exposed to in its trained data."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "It's just recognizing the task instead of just developing a model of the task, right?"}, {"time": 2645, "text": "But there's, sorry to interrupt, there's a parallel as to what you said before, which is it's possible to see GPT3 as like the prompts it's given as a kind of SQL query into this thing that it's learned, similar to what you said before, which is language is used to query the memory."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "So is it possible that neural network is a giant memorization thing, but then if it gets sufficiently giant, it'll memorize sufficiently large amounts of things in the world or it becomes, or intelligence becomes a querying machine?"}, {"time": 2680, "text": "I think it's possible that a significant chunk of intelligence is this giant associative memory."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "I definitely don't believe that intelligence is just a giant associative memory, but it may well be a big component."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "So do you think GPT3, 4, 5, GPT10 will eventually, like, what do you think, where's the ceiling?"}, {"time": 2708, "text": "Do you think you'll be able to reason?"}, {"time": 2711, "text": "No, that's a bad question."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "Like, what is the ceiling is the better question."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "How well is it gonna scale?"}, {"time": 2718, "text": "How good is GPTN going to be?"}, {"time": 2722, "text": "So I believe GPTN is gonna."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "GPTN."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "Is gonna improve on the strength of GPT2 and 3, which is it will be able to generate, you know, ever more plausible text in context."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Just monotonically increasing performance."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Yes, if you train a bigger model on more data, then your text will be increasingly more context aware and increasingly more plausible in the same way that GPT3 is much better at generating plausible text compared to GPT2."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "But that said, I don't think just scaling up the model to more transformer layers and more trained data is gonna address the flaws of GPT3, which is that it can generate plausible text, but that text is not constrained by anything else other than plausibility."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "So in particular, it's not constrained by factualness or even consistency, which is why it's very easy to get GPT3 to generate statements that are factually untrue."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Or to generate statements that are even self contradictory."}, {"time": 2790, "text": "Because it's only goal is plausibility, and it has no other constraints."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "It's not constrained to be self consistent, for instance."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "And so for this reason, one thing that I thought was very interesting with GPT3 is that you can predetermine the answer it will give you by asking the question in a specific way, because it's very responsive to the way you ask the question."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "Since it has no understanding of the content of the question."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "And if you have the same question in two different ways that are basically adversarially engineered to produce certain answer, you will get two different answers, two contradictory answers."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "It's very susceptible to adversarial attacks, essentially."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "So in general, the problem with these models, these generative models, is that they are very good at generating plausible text, but that's just not enough."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "I think one avenue that would be very interesting to make progress is to make it possible to write programs over the latent space that these models operate on."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "That you would rely on these self supervised models to generate a sort of like pool of knowledge and concepts and common sense."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "And then you would be able to write explicit reasoning programs over it."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "Because the current problem with GPT3 is that it can be quite difficult to get it to do what you want to do."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "If you want to turn GPT3 into products, you need to put constraints on it."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "You need to force it to obey certain rules."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "So you need a way to program it explicitly."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "Yeah, so if you look at its ability to do program synthesis, it generates, like you said, something that's plausible."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "Yeah, so if you try to make it generate programs, it will perform well for any program that it has seen in its training data."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "But because program space is not interpretive, right?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "It's not going to be able to generalize to problems it hasn't seen before."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "Now that's currently, do you think sort of an absurd, but I think useful, I guess, intuition builder is, you know, the GPT3 has 175 billion parameters."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "Human brain has 100, has about a thousand times that or more in terms of number of synapses."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "Do you think, obviously, very different kinds of things, but there is some degree of similarity."},

{"time": 2979, "text": "Like, because you've criticized GPT3 very effectively now."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "So to begin with, the bottleneck with scaling up GPT3, GPT models, generative pre trained transformer models, is not going to be the size of the model or how long it takes to train it."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "The bottleneck is going to be the trained data because OpenAI is already training GPT3 on a core of basically the entire web, right?"}, {"time": 3008, "text": "And that's a lot of data."}, {"time": 3009, "text": "So you could imagine training on more data than that, like Google could train on more data than that, but it would still be only incrementally more data."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And I don't recall exactly how much more data GPT3 was trained on compared to GPT2, but it's probably at least like a hundred, maybe even a thousand X. I don't have the exact number."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "You're not going to be able to train a model on a hundred more data than what you're already doing."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "So it's easier to think of compute as a bottleneck and then arguing that we can remove that bottleneck."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "But we can remove the compute bottleneck."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "I don't think it's a big problem."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "If you look at the pace at which we've improved the efficiency of deep learning models in the past few years, I'm not worried about train time bottlenecks or model size bottlenecks."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "The bottleneck in the case of these generative transformer models is absolutely the trained data."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "What about the quality of the data?"}, {"time": 3068, "text": "So the quality of the data is an interesting point."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "The thing is, if you're going to want to use these models in real products, then you want to feed them data that's as high quality, as factual, I would say as unbiased as possible, that there's not really such a thing as unbiased data in the first place."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "But you probably don't want to train it on Reddit, for instance."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "It sounds like a bad plan."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "So from my personal experience, working with large scale deep learning models."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "So at some point I was working on a model at Google that's trained on 350 million labeled images."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "It's an image classification model."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "That's a lot of images."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "That's like probably most publicly available images on the web at the time."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "And it was a very noisy data set because the labels were not originally annotated by hand, by humans."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "They were automatically derived from like tags on social media, or just keywords in the same page as the image was found and so on."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "So it was very noisy."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "And it turned out that you could easily get a better model, not just by training, like if you train on more of the noisy data, you get an incrementally better model, but you very quickly hit diminishing returns."}, {"time": 3155, "text": "On the other hand, if you train on smaller data set with higher quality annotations, quality annotations that are actually made by humans, you get a better model."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "And it also takes less time to train it."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "It's the self supervised learning."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "There's a way to get better doing the automated labeling."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "Yeah, so you can enrich or refine your labels in an automated way."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "Do you have a hope for, I don't know if you're familiar with the idea of a semantic web."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "Is a semantic web just for people who are not familiar and is the idea of being able to convert the internet or be able to attach like semantic meaning to the

3219, "text": "That was kind of a dream for, I think the semantic web papers in the nineties, it's kind of the dream that, you know, the internet is full of rich, exciting information."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "Even just looking at Wikipedia, we should be able to use that as data for machines."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "And so far it's not, it's not really in a format that's available to machines."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "So no, I don't think the semantic web will ever work simply because it would be a lot of work, right?"}, {"time": 3248, "text": "To make, to provide that

knowledge on the web available to machines is actually something closer to unsupervised deep learning."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "So GPT3 is actually a bigger step in the direction of making the knowledge of the web available to machines than the semantic web was."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "Yeah, perhaps in a human centric sense, it feels like GPT3 hasn't learned anything that could be used to reason."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "But that might be just the early days."}, {"time": 3292, "text": "Yeah, I think that's correct."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "I think the forms of reasoning that you see it perform are basically just reproducing patterns that it has seen in string data."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "So of course, if you're trained on the entire web, then you can produce an illusion

had, you could train on every bit of data ever generated in the history of humanity."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "It remains, that model would be capable of anticipating many different possible situations."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "But it remains that the future is going to be something different."}, {"time": 3348, "text": "For instance, if you train a GPT3 model on data from the year 2002,

even going to be missing vocabulary and so on."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "Yeah, it's interesting that GPT3 even doesn't have, I think, any information about the coronavirus."}, {"time": 3374, "text":

distance, like L5 self driving, for instance."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "Google had a paper a couple of years back showing that something like 30 million different road situations were actually completely insufficient to train a driving model."}, {"time": 3429, "text": "It wasn't even L2, right?"}, {"time": 3432, "text": "That's a lot more data than the 20 or 30 hours of driving that a human

asleep?"}, {"time": 3469, "text": "Yeah, L5 is basically human level."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "Well, with driving, we have to be careful saying human level, because that's the most of the drivers."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "Yeah, that's the clearest example of cars will most likely be much safer than humans in many situations where humans fail."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "It's the vice versa question."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "I'll tell you, the thing is the amount of trained data you would need to anticipate for pretty much every possible situation you learn content in the real

data."}, {"time": 3512, "text": "We don't necessarily need actual cars on the road for everything."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "But it's a massive effort."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "And it turns out you can create a system that's much more adaptive, that can generalize much better if you just add explicit models of the surroundings of the car."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "And if you use deep learning for what it's good at, which is to provide perceptive information."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "So in general, deep learning is a way to encode perception and a way to encode intuition."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "But it is not a good medium for any sort of explicit reasoning."}, {"time": 3551, "text": "And in AI systems today, strong generalization tends to come from explicit models, tend to come from abstractions in the human mind that are encoded in program form by a human engineer."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "These are the abstractions you can actually generalize, not the sort of weak abstraction that is learned by a neural network."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "Yeah, and the question is how much reasoning, how much strong abstractions are required to solve particular tasks like driving."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "Or human life existence."}, {"time": 3588, "text": "How much strong abstractions does existence require?"}, {"time": 3593, "text": "But more specifically on

problem, how hard is this problem?"}, {"time": 3611, "text": "How much intelligence does this problem actually require?"}, {"time": 3614, "text": "So we get to cheat because we get to look at the problem."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "It's not like you get to close our eyes and completely new to driving."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "We get to do what we do as human beings, which is for the majority

3636, "text": "We get to watch."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "We get to see movies about cars."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "We get to observe all this stuff."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "And that's similar to what neural networks are doing."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "It's getting a lot of data, and the question is, yeah, how many leaps of reasoning genius is required to be able to actually effectively drive?"}, {"time": 3659, "text": "I think it's a good example of driving."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "I mean, sure, you've seen a lot of cars in your life before you learned to drive."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "But let's say you've learned to drive in Silicon Valley, and now you rent a car in Tokyo."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "Well, now everyone is driving on the other side of the road, and the signs are different, and the roads are more narrow and so on."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "So it's a very, very different environment."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "And a smart human, even an average human, should be able to just zero shot it, to just be operational in this very different environment right away, despite having had no contact with the novel complexity that is contained in this environment."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "And that novel complexity is not just an interpolation over the situations that you've encountered previously, like learning to drive in the US."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "I would say the reason I ask is one of the most interesting tests of intelligence we have today actively, which is driving, in terms of having an impact on the world."}, {"time": 3726, "text": "When do you think we'll pass that test of intelligence?"}, {"time": 3729, "text": "So I don't think driving is that much of a test of intelligence, because again, there is no task for which skill at that task demonstrates intelligence, unless it's a kind of meta task that involves acquiring new skills."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "So I don't think, I think you can actually solve driving without having any real amount of intelligence."}, {"time": 3755, "text": "For instance, if you did have infinite trained data, you could just literally train an end to end deep learning model that does driving, provided infinite trained data."}, {"time": 3765, "text": "The only problem with the whole idea is collecting a data set that's sufficiently comprehensive, that covers the very long tail of possible situations you might encounter."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "And it's really just a scale problem."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "So I think there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this plan, with this idea."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "It's just that it strikes me as a fairly inefficient thing to do, because you run into this scaling issue with diminishing returns."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "Whereas if instead you took a more manual engineering approach, where you use deep learning modules in combination with engineering an explicit model of the surrounding of the cars, and you bridge the two in a clever way, your model will actually start generalizing much earlier and more effectively than the end to end deep learning model."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "So why would you not go with the more manual engineering oriented approach?"}, {"time": 3827, "text": "Even if you created that system, either the end to end deep learning model system that's running infinite data, or the slightly more human system, I don't think achieving L5 would demonstrate general intelligence or intelligence of any generality at all."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "Again, the only possible test of generality in AI would be a test that looks at skill acquisition over unknown tasks."}, {"time": 3854, "text": "For instance, you could take your L5 driver and ask it to learn to pilot a commercial airplane, for instance."}, {"time": 3862, "text": "And then you would look at how much human involvement is required and how much strength data is required for the system to learn to pilot an airplane."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "And that gives you a measure of how intelligent that system really is."}, {"time": 3875, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, that's a big leap."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "I get you."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "But I'm more interested, as a problem, I would see, to me, driving is a black box that can generate novel situations at some rate, what people call edge cases."}, {"time": 3893, "text": "So it does have newness that keeps being like, we're confronted, let's say, once a month."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "It is a very long tail, yes."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "It's a long tail."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "That doesn't mean you cannot solve it just by training a statistical model and a lot of data."}, {"time": 3908, "text": "Huge amount of data."},

situations."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "Or, I mean, the data is so large that the rate of new situations is very low."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "That's not intelligent."}, {"time": 3934, "text": "So if we go back to your kind of definition of intelligence, it's the efficiency."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "With which you can adapt to new situations, to truly new situations, not situations you've seen

which you acquire new skills."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "If you require, if in order to pick up a new skill, you require a very extensive training data set of most possible situations that can occur in the practice of that skill, then the system is not intelligent."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "It is mostly just a lookup table."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "Well, likewise, if in order to acquire a skill, you need a human engineer to write down a bunch of rules that cover most or every possible situation."}, {"time": 3986, "text": "Likewise, the system is not intelligent."}, {"time": 3989,

bit."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "No, deep learning does generalize a little bit."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "Generalization is not binary."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "It's more like a spectrum."},

the distance of how far you can, how new, how radically new something is, and how efficiently you're able to deal with that."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "So you can think of intelligence as a measure of an information conversion ratio."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "Imagine a space of possible situations."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "And you've covered some of them."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "So you have some amount of information about your space of possible situations that's provided by the situations you already know."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "And that's, on the other hand, also provided by the prior knowledge that the system brings to the table, the prior knowledge embedded in the system."}, {"time": 4123, "text": "So the system starts with some information about the problem, about the task."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "And it's about going from that information to a program, what we would call a skill program, a behavioral program, that can cover a large area of possible situation space."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "And essentially, the ratio between that area and the amount of information you start with is intelligence."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "So a very smart agent can make efficient use of very little information about a new problem and very little prior knowledge as well to cover a very large area of potential situations in that problem without knowing what these future new situations are going to be."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "So one of the other big things you talk about in the paper, we've talked about a little bit already, but let's talk about it some more, is the actual tests of intelligence."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "So if we look at human and machine intelligence, do you think tests of intelligence should be different for humans and machines, or how we think about testing of intelligence?"}, {"time": 4194, "text": "Are these fundamentally the same kind of intelligences that we're after, and therefore, the tests should be similar?"}, {"time": 4203, "text": "So if your goal is to create AIs that are more humanlike, then it would be super valuable, obviously, to have a test that's universal, that applies to both AIs and humans, so that you could establish a comparison between the two, that you could tell exactly how intelligent, in terms of human intelligence, a given system is."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "So that said, the constraints that apply to artificial intelligence and to human intelligence are very different."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "And your test should account for this difference."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "Because if you look at artificial systems, it's always possible for an experimenter to buy arbitrary levels of skill at arbitrary tasks, either by injecting hardcoded prior knowledge into the system via rules and so on that come from the human mind, from the minds of the programmers, and also buying higher levels of skill just by training on more data."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "For instance, you could generate an infinity of different Go games, and you could train a Go playing system that way, but you could not directly compare it to human Go playing skills."}, {"time": 4288, "text": "Because a human that plays Go had to develop that skill in a very constrained environment."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "They had a limited amount of time."}, {"time": 4296, "text": "They had a limited amount of energy."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "And of course, this started from a different set of priors."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "This started from innate human priors."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "So I think if you want to compare the intelligence of two systems, like the intelligence of an AI and the intelligence of a human, you have to control for priors."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "You have to start from the same set of knowledge priors about the task, and you have to control for experience, that is to say, for training data."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "So what's priors?"}, {"time": 4334, "text": "So prior is whatever information you have about a given task before you start learning about this task."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "And how's that different from experience?"}, {"time": 4345, "text": "Well, experience is acquired."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "So for instance, if you're trying to play Go, your experience with Go is all the Go games you've played, or you've seen, or you've simulated in your mind, let's say."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "And your priors are things like, well, Go is a game on the 2D grid."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "And we have lots of hardcoded priors about the organization of 2D space."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "And the rules of how the dynamics of the physics of this game in this 2D space?"}, {"time": 4380, "text": "And the idea that you have what winning is."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "And other board games can also share some similarities with Go."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "And if you've played these board games, then, with respect to the game of Go, that would be part of your priors about the game."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "Well, it's interesting to think about the game of Go is how many priors are actually brought to the table."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "When you look at self play, reinforcement learning based mechanisms that do learning, it seems like the number of priors is pretty low."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "But you're saying you should be expec..."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "There is a 2D special priors in the carbonate."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "But you should be clear at making those priors explicit."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "So in particular, I think if your goal is to measure a humanlike form of intelligence, then you should clearly establish that you want the AI you're testing to start from the same set of priors that humans start with."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "So I mean, to me personally, but I think to a lot of people, the human side of things is very interesting."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "So testing intelligence for humans."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "What do you think is a good test of human intelligence?"}, {"time": 4454, "text": "Well, that's the question that psychometrics is interested in."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "There's an entire subfield of psychology that deals with this question."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "So what's psychometrics?"}, {"time": 4465, "text": "The psychometrics is the subfield of psychology that tries to measure, quantify aspects of the human mind."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "So in particular, our cognitive abilities, intelligence, and personality traits as well."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "So what are, it might be a weird question, but what are the first principles of psychometrics this operates on?"}, {"time": 4492, "text": "What are the priors it brings to the table?"}, {"time": 4495, "text": "So it's a field with a fairly long history."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "So psychology sometimes gets a bad reputation for not having very reproducible results."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "And psychometrics has actually some fairly solidly reproducible results."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "So the ideal goals of the field is a test should be reliable, which is a notion tied to reproducibility."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "It should be valid, meaning that it should actually measure what you say it measures."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "So for instance, if you're saying that you're measuring intelligence, then your test results should be correlated with things that you expect to be correlated with intelligence like success in school or success in the workplace and so on."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Should be standardized, meaning that you can administer your tests to many different people in some conditions."}, {"time": 4550, "text": "And it should be free from bias."}, {"time": 4552, "text": "Meaning that, for instance, if your test involves the English language, then you have to be aware that this creates a bias against people who have English as their second language or people who can't speak English at all."}, {"time": 4567, "text": "So of course, these principles for creating psychometric tests are very much an ideal."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "I don't think every psychometric test is really either reliable, valid, or free from bias."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "But at least the field is aware of these weaknesses and is trying to address them."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "So it's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "Ultimately, you're only able to measure, like you said previously, the skill."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "But you're trying to do a bunch of measures of different skills that correlate, as you mentioned, strongly with some general concept of cognitive ability."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "So what's the G factor?"}, {"time": 4606, "text": "So right, there are many different kinds of tests of intelligence."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "And each of them is interesting in different aspects of intelligence."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "Some of them will deal with language."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "Some of them will deal with spatial vision, maybe mental rotations, numbers, and so on."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "When you run these very different tests at scale, what you start seeing is that there are clusters of correlations among test results."}, {"time": 4634, "text": "So for instance, if you look at homework at school, you will see that people who do well at math are also likely statistically to do well in physics."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "And what's more, people who do well at math and physics are also statistically likely to do well in things that sound completely unrelated, like writing an English essay, for instance."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "And so when you see clusters of correlations in statistical terms, you would explain them with the latent variable."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "And the latent variable that would, for instance, explain the relationship between being good at math and being good at physics would be cognitive ability."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "And the G factor is the latent variable that explains the fact that every test of intelligence that you can come up with results on this test end up being correlated."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "So there is some single unique variable that explains these correlations."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "That's the G factor."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "So it's a statistical construct."}, {"time": 4700, "text": "It's not really something you can directly measure, for instance, in a person."}, {"time": 4705, "text": "But it's there."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "It's there at scale."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "And that's also one thing I want to mention about psychometrics."}, {"time": 4713, "text": "Like when you talk about measuring intelligence in humans, for instance, some people get a little bit worried."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "They will say, that sounds dangerous."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "Maybe that sounds potentially discriminatory, and so on."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "And they're not wrong."}, {"time": 4726, "text": "And the thing is, personally, I'm not interested in psychometrics as a way to characterize one individual person."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "Like if I get your psychometric personality assessments or your IQ, I don't think that actually tells me much about you as a person."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "I think psychometrics is most useful as a statistical tool."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "So it's most useful at scale."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "It's most useful when you start getting test results for a large number of people."}, {"time": 4757, "text": "And you start cross correlating these test results."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "Because that gives you information about the structure of the human mind, in particular about the structure of human cognitive abilities."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "So at scale, psychometrics paints a certain picture of the human mind."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "And that's what's relevant to AI, the structure of human cognitive abilities."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "Yeah, it gives you an insight into it."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "I mean, to me, I remember when I learned about G factor, it seemed like it would be impossible for it to be real, even as a statistical variable."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "Like it felt kind of like astrology."}, {"time": 4799, "text": "Like it's like wishful thinking among psychologists."}, {"time": 4801, "text": "But the more I learned, I realized that there's some."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "I mean, I'm not sure what to make about human beings, the fact that the G factor is a thing."}, {"time": 4810, "text": "There's a commonality across all of human species, that there does seem to be a strong correlation between cognitive abilities."}, {"time": 4817, "text": "That's kind of fascinating, actually."}, {"time":

intelligence, that encompass a broad set of possible kinds of tasks that are all related."}, {"time": 4857, "text": "And then you have narrow cognitive abilities at the last level, which is closer to task specific skill."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "And there are actually different theories of the structure of cognitive abilities that just emerge from different statistical analysis of IQ test results."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "But they all describe a hierarchy with a kind of G factor at the top."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "And you're right that the G factor, it's not quite real in the

data."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "One thing I want to mention is that the fact that there is a G factor does not really mean that human intelligence is general in a strong sense."}, {"time": 4905,

not quite what it means."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "I think one popular analogy to understand it is the sports analogy."}, {"time": 4923, "text": "If you consider the concept of physical fitness, it's a concept that's very similar to intelligence because it's a useful concept."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "It's something you can intuitively understand."}, {"time": 4934, "text": "Some people are fit,

ran these tests over many different people, you would start seeing correlations in test results."}, {"time": 4981, "text": "For instance, people who are good at soccer are also good at sprinting."},

cognitive abilities."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "And at the top of the hierarchy of physical abilities that you would be able to observe, you would have a G factor, a physical G factor, which would map to physical fitness."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "And as you just said, that doesn't mean that people with high physical fitness can't fly."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "It doesn't mean human morphology

really appropriate for most of problem space, potential problem space by volume."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "So we have very strong cognitive biases, actually, that mean that there are certain types of

exam."}, {"time": 5409, "text": "It's very similar to what you've been trained on."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "And a difficult exam is one that really probes your understanding because it forces you to improvise."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "It forces you to do things that are different from what you were exposed to before."}, {"time": 5424, "text": "So that said, it doesn't mean that the exam that

stuff that, despite being new to the students, it's not new to you, right?"}, {"time": 5442, "text": "So it can only be difficult with respect to what the test taker already knows and with respect to the information that the test taker has about the task."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "So that's what I mean by controlling for priors what the information you bring to the table."}, {"time": 5459,

intelligent test for machines?"}, {"time": 5767, "text": "All right, so in the paper I outline a number of requirements that you expect of such a test."}, {"time": 5774, "text": "And in particular, we should start by acknowledging the priors that we expect to be required in order to perform the test."}, {"time": 5785, "text": "So we should be explicit about the priors, right?"}, {"time": 5788,

be novel and should not be something that you can anticipate."}, {"time": 5815, "text": "So for instance, it should not be possible to brute force the space of possible questions, right?"}, {"time":

we're talking about here?"}, {"time": 5892, "text": "Yes, so a researcher has done a lot of work on what exactly are the knowledge priors that are innate to humans is Elizabeth Spelke from Harvard."},

rotations."}, {"time": 6222, "text": "One famous experiment that people did in the..."}, {"time": 6225, "text": "I don't remember which was exactly, but in the 70s was that people found that if you

actually follow every principle, but it is what I was able to do given the constraints."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "So the format of ARC is very similar to classic IQ tests, in particular Raven's

know what that is, probably."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "Or at least you've seen it, even if you don't know what it's called."}, {"time": 6326, "text": "And so you have a set of tasks, that's what they're called."}, {"time": 6332, "text": "And for each task, you have training data, which is a set of input and output pairs."}, {"time": 6340, "text": "So an input or output pair is a grid of colors, basically."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "The grid, the size of the grid is variables."}, {"time": 6348, "text": "The size of the grid is variable."}, {"time": 6351, "text": "And you're given an input, and you must transform it into the proper output."}, {"time": 6359, "text": "And so you're shown a few demonstrations of a task in the form of existing input output pairs, and then you're given a new input."}, {"time": 6366, "text": "And you must provide, you must produce the correct output."}, {"time": 6372, "text": "And the assumptions in Arc is that every task should only require core

our human experience, like trees, dogs, cats, and so on."}, {"time": 6404, "text": "So only reasoning tasks that are built on top of core knowledge priors."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "And some of the tasks are actually explicitly trying to probe specific forms of abstraction."}, {"time": 6422, "text": "Part of the reason why I wanted to create Arc is I'm a big believer in when you're faced with a problem as murky as understanding how to autonomously generate abstraction in a machine, you have to coevolve the solution and the problem."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "And so part of the reason why I designed Arc was to clarify my ideas about the nature of abstraction."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "And some of the tasks are actually designed to probe bits of that theory."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "And there are things that turn out to be very easy for humans to perform, including young kids, but turn out to be near impossible for machines."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "So what have you learned from the nature of abstraction from designing that?"}, {"time": 6479, "text": "One of the things you wanted to try to understand was this idea of abstraction."}, {"time": 6486, "text": "Yes, so clarifying my own ideas about abstraction by forcing myself to produce tasks that would require the ability to produce that form of abstraction in order to solve them."}, {"time": 6500, "text": "OK, so and by the way, just the people should check out."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "I'll probably overlay if you're watching the video part."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "But the grid input output with the different colors on the grid, that's it."}, {"time": 6514, "text": "I mean, it's a very simple world, but it's kind of beautiful."}, {"time": 6517, "text": "It's very similar to classic IQ tests."},

tests."}, {"time": 6528, "text": "So you make it explicit that everything should only be built on top of core knowledge priors."}, {"time": 6533, "text": "I also think it's generally more diverse than IQ tests in general."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "And it perhaps requires a bit more manual work to produce solutions, because you have to click around on a grid for a while."}, {"time": 6548, "text":

questions?"}, {"time": 6559, "text": "Was it mostly you that came up with the questions?"}, {"time": 6563, "text": "How difficult is it to come up with a question?"}, {"time": 6565, "text": "Is this

possible, you could argue, that it needs to be scalable."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "So there are 1,000 questions, 1,000 tasks, including the test set, the prior test set."}, {"time": 6589, "text": "I think it's fairly difficult in the sense that a big requirement is that every task should be novel and unique and unpredictable."}, {"time": 6600, "text": "You don't want to create your own little world that is simple enough that it would be possible for a human to reverse and generate and write down an algorithm that could generate every possible arc task and their solution."}, {"time": 6617,

unfakeable novelty."}, {"time": 6627, "text": "And one thing I found is that, as a human, you are not a very good source of unfakeable novelty."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "And so you have to base the creation of these tasks quite a bit."}, {"time": 6641, "text": "There are only so many unique tasks that you can do in a given day."}, {"time": 6645, "text": "So that means coming up with truly original new ideas."}, {"time": 6649, "text": "Did psychedelics help you at all?"}, {"time": 6652, "text": "No, I'm just kidding."}, {"time": 6653, "text": "But I mean, that's fascinating to think about."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "So you would be walking or something like that."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "Are you constantly thinking of something totally new?"}, {"time": 6666, "text": "This is hard."}, {"time": 6667, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying you've done anywhere near a perfect job at it."}, {"time": 6672, "text": "There is some amount of redundancy, and there are many imperfections in ARC."}, {"time": 6676, "text": "So that said, you should consider ARC as a work in progress."}, {"time": 6679, "text": "It is not the definitive state."}, {"time": 6685, "text": "The ARC tasks today are not the definitive state of the test."}, {"time": 6689, "text": "I want to keep refining it in the future."}, {"time": 6692, "text": "I also think it should be possible to open up the creation of tasks to a broad audience to do crowdsourcing."}, {"time": 6700, "text": "That would involve several levels of filtering, obviously."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "But I think it's possible to apply crowdsourcing to develop a much bigger and much more diverse ARC data set."}, {"time": 6711, "text": "That would also be free of potentially some of my own personal biases."},

is not accessible to the people developing these algorithms."}, {"time": 6735, "text": "Because otherwise, what's going to happen is that the human engineers are just going to solve the tasks themselves and encode their solution in program form."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "But that, again, what you're seeing here is the process of intelligence happening in the mind of the human."}, {"time": 6751, "text": "And then you're just capturing its crystallized output."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "But that crystallized output is not the same thing as the process it generated."}, {"time": 6760, "text": "It's not intelligent in itself."}, {"time": 6761, "text": "So what, by the way, the idea of crowdsourcing it is fascinating."}, {"time": 6765, "text": "I think the creation of questions is really exciting for people."}, {"time": 6771, "text": "I think there's a lot of really brilliant people out there that love to create these kinds of stuff."}, {"time": 6776, "text": "Yeah, one thing that kind of surprised me that I wasn't expecting is that lots of people seem to actually enjoy ARC as a kind of game."}, {"time": 6785, "text": "And I was releasing it as a test, as a benchmark of fluid general intelligence."}, {"time": 6794, "text": "And lots of people just, including kids, just started enjoying it as a game."}, {"time": 6798, "text": "So I think that's encouraging."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "Yeah, I'm fascinated by it."}, {"time": 6802, "text": "There's a world of people who create IQ questions."}, {"time": 6805, "text": "I think that's a cool activity for machines and for humans."}, {"time": 6812, "text": "And humans are themselves fascinated by taking the questions, like measuring their own intelligence."}, {"time": 6822, "text": "I mean, that's just really compelling."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "It's really interesting to me, too."}, {"time": 6827, "text": "One of the cool things about ARC, you said, is kind of inspired by IQ tests or whatever follows a similar process."}, {"time": 6833, "text": "But because of its nature, because of the context in which it lives, it immediately forces you to think about the nature of intelligence as opposed to just the test of your own."}, {"time": 6844, "text": "It forces you to really think."}, {"time": 6846, "text": "I don't know if it's within the question, inherent in the question, or just the fact that it lives in the test that's supposed to be a test of machine intelligence."}, {"time": 6855, "text": "As you solve ARC tasks as a human, you will be forced to basically introspect how you come up with solutions."}, {"time": 6867, "text": "And that forces you to reflect on the human problem solving process."}, {"time": 6873, "text": "And the way your own mind generates abstract representations of the problems it's exposed to."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "I think it's due to the fact that the set of core knowledge priors that ARC is built upon is so small."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "It's all a recombination of a very, very small set of assumptions."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "OK, so what's the future of ARC?"}, {"time": 6902, "text": "So you held ARC as a challenge, as part of like a Kaggle competition."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "Kaggle competition."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "And what do you think?"}, {"time": 6911, "text": "Do you think that's something that continues for five years, 10 years, like just continues growing?"}, {"time": 6918, "text": "So ARC itself will keep evolving."}, {"time": 6921, "text": "So I've talked about crowdsourcing."}, {"time": 6922, "text": "I think that's a good avenue."}, {"time": 6926, "text": "Another thing I'm starting is I'll be collaborating with folks from the psychology department at NYU to do human testing on ARC."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "And I think there are lots of interesting questions you can start asking, especially as you start correlating machine solutions to ARC tasks and the human characteristics of solutions."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "Like for instance, you can try to see if there's a relationship between the human perceived difficulty of a task and the machine perceived."}, {"time": 6959, "text": "Yes, and exactly some measure of machine perceived difficulty."}, {"time": 6962, "text": "Yeah, it's a nice playground in which to explore this very difference."}, {"time": 6966, "text": "It's the same thing as we talked about the autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 6969, "text": "The things that could be difficult for humans might be very different than the things that are difficult."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "And formalizing or making explicit that difference in difficulty may teach us something fundamental about intelligence."}, {"time": 6982, "text": "So one thing I think we did well with ARC is that it's proving to be a very actionable test in the sense that machine performance on ARC started at very much zero initially, while humans found actually the task very easy."}, {"time": 7003, "text": "And that alone was like a big red flashing light saying that something is going on and that we are missing something."}, {"time": 7012, "text": "And at the same time, machine performance did not stay at zero for very long."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "Actually, within two weeks of the Kaggle competition, we started having a nonzero number."}, {"time": 7023, "text": "And now the state of the art is around 20% of the test set solved."}, {"time": 7030, "text": "And so ARC is actually a challenge where our capabilities start at zero, which indicates the need for progress."}, {"time": 7038,

"text": "At the same time, we are still very far from having solved it."}, {"time": 7049, "text": "And that's actually a very positive outcome of the competition is that the competition has proven that there was no obvious shortcut to solve these tasks."}, {"time": 7061, "text": "Yeah, so the test held up."}, {"time": 7064, "text": "That was the primary reason to use the Kaggle competition is to check if some clever person was going to hack the benchmark that did not happen."}, {"time": 7076, "text": "People who are solving the task are essentially doing it."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "Well, in a way, they're actually exploring some flaws of ARC that we will need to address in the future, especially they're essentially anticipating what sort of tasks may be contained in the test set."}, {"time": 7093, "text": "Right, which is kind of, yeah, that's the kind of hacking."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "It's human hacking of the test."}, {"time": 7100, "text": "Yes, that said, with the state of the art, it's like 20% we're still very, very far from human level, which is closer to 100%."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "And I do believe that it will take a while until we reach human parity on ARC."}, {"time": 7120, "text": "And that by the time we have human parity, we will have AI systems that are probably pretty close to human level in terms of general fluid intelligence, which is, I mean, they are not going to be necessarily human like."}, {"time": 7134, "text": "They're not necessarily, you would not necessarily recognize them as being an AGI."}, {"time": 7141, "text": "But they would be capable of a degree of generalization that matches the generalization performed by human fluid intelligence."}, {"time": 7151, "text": "I mean, this is a good point in terms of general fluid intelligence to mention in your paper."}, {"time": 7157, "text": "You describe different kinds of generalizations, local, broad, extreme."}, {"time": 7163, "text": "And there's a kind of a hierarchy that you form."}, {"time": 7165, "text": "So when we say generalizations, what are we talking about?"}, {"time": 7171, "text": "What kinds are there?"}, {"time": 7173, "text": "Right, so generalization is a very old idea."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "I mean, it's even older than machine learning."}, {"time": 7179, "text": "In the context of machine learning, you say a system generalizes if it can make sense of an input it has not yet seen."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "And that's what I would call system centric generalization, generalization with respect to novelty for the specific system you're considering."}, {"time": 7202, "text": "So I think a good test of intelligence should actually deal with developer aware generalization, which is slightly stronger than system centric generalization."}, {"time": 7213, "text": "So developer aware generalization would be the ability to generalize to novelty or uncertainty that not only the system itself has not access to, but the developer of the system could not have access to either."}, {"time": 7229, "text": "That's a fascinating meta definition."}, {"time": 7232, "text": "So the system is basically the edge case thing

generalization if, let's say, it's designed and trained for cooking, for instance."}, {"time": 7399, "text": "And if I buy the robot and if it's able to teach itself gardening in a couple of weeks, it

are Marine squadrons that go out to the aircraft carriers, but most of them are land based, you know, to support the Marines."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "Cause there are that, that unit, that whole

got winged."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "It took me two years to the day from the time I graduated the Naval Academy until I got my wings and, uh, through some luck, uh, I ended up getting A6s, uh, on

person?"}, {"time": 1287, "text": "One person, with the exception of, I'll probably, someone will yell at me, but really with the exception of the F15E Strike Eagle and the F18F Super Hornet, which is the F is a two seater and the G is also a two seater, but it's more of an electronic attack by say full up fighter bomber."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "So most of the time that you've flown in your, like I said, 18 year career is, was it two seater?"}, {"time": 1312, "text": "That was about half and half."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "So I started off in A6 was a two seater."}, {"time": 1315,

the Super Hornets and I've flown both of those, the E's and the S, but I deployed when I had command of VFA 41, I had the two seat, they were F squadron."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "So you eventually ended up commanding the, the Strike Fighter Squadron 41."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "I love the, the name, the Black Aces."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "What, uh, is there some parts of that journey that

switch that I can go one seat, two seat, one seat, two seat."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "Because when you fly two seat, there's a lot of stuff that the pilot will offload and take the advantage of the weapon systems operator."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And it's not that one plus one equals two in that environment because it really, there's a huge amount of capabilities that the single seat has and

you do this low level routes where you're going to, you're going to fly in the mountains at night."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "You're going to be at, you know, 500 to a thousand feet above the ground, ripping through like fog layers, cause you don't need to see outside."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "You're literally flying a little TV screen and radar."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "What are you looking at most of the time?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "So you're just at a screen."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "It's this really primitive."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "If you look at it now, what we did, you'd think, wow, that was crazy, but it was really fun."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "So is it similar to like the FLIR stuff?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Is that, is, no, this thing is totally radar based."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "Now the airplane had a FLIR ball as a target recognition and multi sensor was called a tram."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "You're looking at like basically like dots of hard objects."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "No, actually what it is is the, the bomb of your navigator had a radar and he was getting raw feed off of a pulse radar in front."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "So it's just basically mapping the mountain."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "So if you look at a mountain on a radar and you're coming up on it, the front side is going to be, it's going to give you a really bright return."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "And then the backside, it's just going to be a giant shadow because you can't see on the other side."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "So the Bombardier navigators would do that and we, they would have charts and they could shade their charts knowing that, Hey, if we turn a little bit left here, we can get in this valley."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "We can sneak up this valley and then go around the backside of the mountain, which is what the airplane would do."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "And so, and sorry to interrupt, I'm going to just keep asking dumb questions, I apologize."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "But the pilot, can you, can you at a high level say what the pilot does versus the Bombardier?"}, {"time": 1630, "text": "So you're, you're actually just control."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "I'm flying the jet."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "The throttle's the stick and I have a, it's about a, probably a four inch or six inch wide by maybe four inches, five inches high."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "It looks like it's literally a CRT."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "That's how old it is."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "A CRT screen."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "And what it would do, what the radar would do is the, the, the Bombardier navigator is looking at his radar and he's looking out about 12 and a half miles in front of the airplane."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "So he has the range really scoped down cause the radar can see a lot further."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "He's looking at about 12 and a half miles when we're in the terrain mode where we're dodging mountains and stuff."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And what the pilot has is there's, they're called range bins and there's eight of them."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "So the very far range bin is the 12 and a half mile, you know, and the closest range bin, it's a thing and it'll be like between like a half a mile and or a quarter mile to three quarters of a mile."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "And the next one might be three quarters of a mile to two miles."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "And then it just keeps going out like that."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "So if there's a mountain in front, let's say we're on a flat plane and there's a mountain out in the distance at 15 miles."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "And we were just driving right at it."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "So when we get to the point where it hits 12 and a half miles where the radar is going to see it on his scope, my 12th, my range bin for that would pop up and it would show like a big bump, like a mountain."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "And then as I got closer to it, the next range bin would pop up and show it."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "And I could see that that bump was moving towards me."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "And then if I turned a little bit, you know, to go over here, I'd see the mountain go over to the right hand side and I could do that, but it wasn't like a video game."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "It's literally like, if you think of the original Atari's."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "But you build up, I imagine that you start to get a really deep sense of like the actual 3D environment based on that little Atari's solid display."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "You're exactly right."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And you have to, you have to train."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "So there's been studies, as a matter of fact, a lot of the basis and people probably argue with me, but it's true."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "There were studies done watching A6 crews in our simulators, we call it the WIST, the systems trainer, and it was not even a motion, it just kind of sat there and you just, you could fly these things and they had terrain that they would inject into the system."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "But the crew coordination, so you get, so my first fleet bombardier navigator, who I'll name him, his name's Chris Sato, he works at Apple, pretty high up, MIT grad, I think computer engineering, he's scary smart."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "So Chris could really work, as a matter of fact, all the guys I flew with, so there's another guy, Matt, who also worked at Apple, who's now at SAP, we did our first night traps together."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "The bond between us, I mean, it's one of those things that you just, you're never going to forget, but Chris and I, when we started flying together, we were actually the most junior crew in the squadron."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "We'd spent a lot of time training and Chris was amazing at how he could work the system, one because he was extremely brilliant and he had that inquisitive mind of, oh, we can do all these different things and there's all these degradation modes."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "But we spent a lot of time to see how good we could actually get, because, and it's, you almost talk in partials."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "So as the BN is looking at his radar scope, Chris would say, I've got rising terrain, that's just what they say, showing rising terrain at 12 miles."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "And I'd see the little bump and I'd say, got it."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "This is going to go to your question on the autonomy and how you work with two heads."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "So when you first get together, the interaction, it's almost like you have to rehearse it, you have to know, and you talk in full sentences."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "The more and more we fly together, Chris could go, I'm showing and he'd get like rising out and before he finished, I'd say, I've got it."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "So you end up starting to talk in partials because I have to trust him like, I mean, there can be no, I can have no doubt that he knows how to do his job because I'm literally looking at this little scope that's not giving me this continuous picture of that mountain moving."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "Remember the mountain's here and then it's going to pop up here and then it's going to pop up here because there's gaps in the coverage on how the system was set up."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "Remember it's an analog system to where he is telling me, like, I can't see all the way to the left and he's got a wider scope on the radar, but my screen doesn't show that."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So he's telling me, start a left turn, start a hard turn, you know, and we would do that."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "So my truck."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "And this is all happening quick?"}, {"time": 1892, "text": "Very quick."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "Well, you're doing, we would typically fly between 420 and 480 knots of ground speed."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "How many miles an hour?"}, {"time": 1899, "text": "Well, 420 is seven miles a minute."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "Or eight, between seven and eight miles a minute is what you're flying."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "That's fast."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "At night."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "I mean, I broke out of clouds."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "I mean, I remember him and I flying, we were on, it's the IR, it's called an IR route, an instrument route that's low, they're all around the country."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "There's the IR 344 that we used to fly, which would coast in off of Oregon, you'd fly from the land, you go out over the ocean, turn around and then you could practice actually coming in on a coastline and we were flying and we ended up in the clouds."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "Keep in mind, we're between 500 and a thousand feet in the mountains and we're in the clouds."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "You can't see anything."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "And I had to turn off our red lights that flash, you know, they're called the anti collision lights because it was reflecting off the clouds and it starts to bother you, just gets annoying."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So I turned it off and we were flying, we're flying, we're flying."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "We break out of that coastal marine layer and poof, we break out and it's a decent night."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "And this is right by Mount St. Helens."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "This is kind of where we're coming in."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "So we're coming in from the east and we're just north of Mount St. Helens is where the route goes."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And you look up, you know, cause you can kind of see the silhouette of this mountain that's right next to you, but you're flying along."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "You're just like, you know, you got to trust and you can see houses, you can see the lights, they're above you."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "We're literally below people's houses flying down these valleys and stuff."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "So just incredible experience."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "So when you take that and then you move into an F18F."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "So now we're into modern technology that was actually built in this century and you're flying."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "So now, you know, the WIZO is behind us and we're not doing those night low levels, but that same type of crew coordination that has to happen because what you're doing is you're sharing the load."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "So most of the communications that go out of the airplane, the WIZO does all the talk and he's got actually, he uses his feet."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "That's the weapon systems operator in the back of an F18F."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "So he's going to run, well, the radar kind of runs itself now, but we have a situational awareness display and it's linked to all the other airplanes."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "Just out of curiosity, what's the situational awareness display?"}, {"time": 2011, "text": "Because that term comes up a lot."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "Think of it as a God's eye view."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "So if you have the back of the Super Hornet has, well, the Block IIs has about an eight by 10 display for the WIZOs that they can look at."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "The pilot's is smaller."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "It's down between his, it's a six by six between his legs and they're getting ready to redesign that Boeing is."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "But when you looked, it'd be like if you put your airplane and you're looking down."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "So all the stuff, like if your radar seeing bad guys out in front of you, it'd be like looking down and going, oh, I'm right here."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And now there's bad guys out here and my wingman is over here."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "And it shows everything."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "It's just like, it gives you, you can look at that display and go, oh, I can see where everything's at."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "I can see if one guy's trying to target another guy, it shows you all this."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "It's an incredible amount of knowledge that comes up for the crews to maintain the overall picture of what's going on because it's happening so fast and this is where that autonomy piece, this is the third brain."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "So we're all looking at it and the third brain is doing fusion."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "It's pulling stuff together going, oh, this is all this guy."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "This is this guy."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "It's sending it out through the link."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "So all the airplanes are talking to each other through this digital network that we don't even see."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "It just says, that airplane says, hey, I'm over here."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "And it tells us and we go, oh, he's right there."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "And then we can go, his airplane says, oh, I'm looking at this airplane, this bad guy."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "And it shows us, oh, he's over there and he's looking at this guy."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "I mean, it's an incredible amount of visual intake because your eye, you can hear a lot, but when you look down at stuff, it's, you know, you can sell the picture really quick."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "The third brain is doing the sensor fusion, the integration of the different sensors and gives you a big picture view."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "What about the control?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "Like, is there, and I apologize as if this is a dumb question, but you know, people use the high level term of autopilot."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "How much is there, let's use a loose term of AI."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "How much automation is there?"}, {"time": 2124, "text": "How much AI is there in helping you control there?"}, {"time": 2127, "text": "The AI piece would be more of a control loop because of the digital flight controls."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "So the airplane actually, they had to make the airplane easier to fly."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And when I say easy, it's relative because people go, I could do it because I did it on flight sim."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "Real life is a lot different."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "In flight sim, you have no apparent fear of death."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "You'll do things on a simulator that you would never do in real life."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "But the autonomy in the airplane to allow you to manage, I mean, because you think about it, you've got a radar that's feeding you data."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "You've got a targeting pod that's feeding you data."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "All that stuff is hooked to your head because you've got a joint helmet mounted cueing system on that basically maps the magnetic field in the cockpit so it can tell where your head's at looking."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "So if I turn my head to the right, the radar will actually look to the right."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "The targeting flare will look to the right."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "And oh, by the way, the backseater has a helmet on too, so he can look to the left and he can do things."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "So depending on what sensor he's controlling, so if he's got control of the targeting pod and he looks left, the targeting pod looks left."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "But if I have something where I want to lock a guy up that I don't see, that maybe the radar didn't see, but I can get over and now point the radar, you know, get the, because it's a phased array radar now, it doesn't really scan."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "There's all kinds of cool stuff that that technology brings."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "Because if you just, if you went back 30 years and said, hey, or 40 years ago and said, hey, we're gonna have this helmet and you're gonna be able to slew everything to your head."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "And I don't mean a mechanical setup, but I mean literally you're just gonna map magnetic resonance and go, oh, look, and I can literally slew my sensors this fast and then mash a button and transfer, you know, high quality coordinates from a system into a joint, you know, a JDAM, which is a joint direct attack munition that is the GPS bombs that you see all the time, and then let that thing fly."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "And I'm solving this problem in seconds, vice minutes, or, hey, I got it, we're gonna have to menstruate coordinates and, you know, you bring back the data and then they do all the targeting for it and then they send another group out to get it instead of all that."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "Now it's that fast."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "So there's a, okay, I mean, we probably don't have enough time to talk about the beautiful fusion of minds that happens when two people are flying, controlling the plane."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "But at a high level, this is a really interesting question for people who don't know what they're talking about, like me, which is, what is the difference between a human being and an AI system?"}, {"time": 2267, "text": "Like what can, what is the ceiling of a current AI technology for controlling the plane?"}, {"time": 2274, "text": "Like how much does the human contribute?"}, {"time": 2277, "text": "Is it possible to have automated flight, for example, like what is the hardest part about flying that a human does expertly that an AI system cannot in warfare situations in flying a fighter jet plane?"}, {"time": 2295, "text": "So I would say AI systems are usually black and white."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "When you write the algorithm for an AI system, it's really, it's basically you're taking thought and turning it into a giant math problem is really what you're doing, right?"}, {"time": 2310, "text": "So you've got this logical math problem."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "Math problems are, there's a line that says I can or I can't."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And it's a very finite line, but you can go up to the line where a human, we all have gray areas where we go, eh, maybe, eh, I'll try it."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "So humans can operate within that gray."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "So if you took, if you take an airplane and say, and I'll just take a Hornet for a while, a Super Hornet, it doesn't matter, any airplane, and you go, here is the flight performance model of the airplane."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So if you know what an EM diagram is, the energy, so it basically says the airplane can fly as slow as this, it can go as fast as this, it can pull this many Gs, force of gravity, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and then based on the airfoil design and everything else and how it can pull, here's how it's going to fly, because it's really physics based."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "Well, if you, depending on how you write the AI, but typically AI, you don't want the airplane to leave controlled flight, right?"}, {"time": 2365, "text": "You want to maintain it so that it is flying in a controlled envelope."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "Where there are times, and you can go back to World War I, where people intentionally departed the airplane from controlled flight in order to obtain an advantage, which is, that's where the human goes, can I do this?"}, {"time": 2382, "text": "I know it's outside of where I would normally go, but I can do that."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "So you can do some crazy things now, especially since the flight control logic in modern airplanes with digital flight controls, they're extremely forgiving."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "So you can literally, I've done things in Super Hornets that literally, even as a pilot inside the airplane, you're just like, wow, I cannot believe it just did that."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "Like it'll flop ends, which defies most logic, and I guess in a way you could probably program it, but I still think when you get to the edges that may or may not give you an advantage, there are things that a human will do that AI won't."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "And I don't think we've got to the point, because how do you map illogical solutions?"}, {"time": 2429, "text": "Most AI is logical."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "It's based on some type of premise when you write the algorithm to control it."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "There's bounds."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "Yeah, there's this giant mess, like you said, the difference between the simulator and real life also gets at that somehow."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "That there is somehow the fear of death, all of that beautiful mess comes into play."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "Is there a comment you can make on commercial flight, like with Sully landing that plane famously versus the simulator, all of those discussions, is there some?"}, {"time": 2464, "text": "Well, it's very similar to what I was talking about earlier with the A6."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "So one is when you're flying with a crew, there's standardization."}, {"time": 2473, "text": "So you got to remember when Sully flew, when his first officer, that's the co

the same guy all the time is slim and none."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "Where in the Navy, we were crewed."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "So I had a primary and a secondary whizzo that flew with me."},

a forward air controller, we're in the air actually controlling ground assets and supporting ground troops."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "If you're in a high threat area, which is crazy busy, you have to be melded when you do that."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "You have to have trained to do that job, otherwise you're going to be ineffective."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "So when you get to the commercial world, and I've got tons of friends that fly commercial, there is a standardization."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "Like we know that at this point, I'm going to put this switch, you're going to do that."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "And everyone, they know their roles."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "Captain's going to do this, first officer's going to do this."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "And they know that when the emergency breaks out, so in Sully's case, when they take the birds and they know they've got a problem, and if you've listened to the cockpit recordings of the two of them talking, you got to remember, they're talking to each other when you hear the full tapes, but they're also talking to the air traffic controllers in the New York area."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "And it's like, we got a bird strike and the first officer already knows, hey, silence the alarm."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "They silence the alarm."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "The first officer is pulling out the book, he's going through the procedures while Sully's actually flying the airplane, knowing that they've lost their motors."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And you got to think his decision process, like they're trying to get him to go into an airport in New Jersey, and he realizes, not happening, we're going to put this thing."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "And he made a decision soon enough so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane that he was going to put this thing in the Hudson River."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "And he did it flawlessly."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "I mean, every single person

decisions."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "So when you look at what he did or the way we train, because the commercial industry and the Navy and the Air Force, for all that, we have what's called, we have emergency procedures that we have to know."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "Like engines on fire, the first three steps, you just have to know what they are, right?"}, {"time": 2632, "text": "So they know."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "The airline, same type, they go, hey, I know this is, they pull the book out because the airplanes are designed, they're built to have some time."}, {"time": 2640,

a trade."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "So you have, this is, this is really important when you're, when you're fighting airplanes and you're really max performing."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "So when you

other piece is, is I can trade some of that kinetic energy for performance."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Because I know if I do a nice, easy turn, the airplane will make it at what doesn't bleed

probably about, by the time this all hits, we're price, I don't know, 80, 100, I don't know, but somewhere out, it's pretty far off the coast, but from 20,000 feet, you'd be amazed."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "You can do the calculation."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "You can see stuff, you know, you'll see land 50 miles away, you know, you can see, you know, and when you're looking at a continent, it's really easy to see you're not looking at an island."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "I mean, you're looking at Mexico."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "And you can see on the whitecaps in the water, if there is any."}, {"time": 4784, "text": "Oh yeah, they're easy."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "For us, we look at it because we know if it's natural wind or, so if it's a really whitecap windy day, then the ships just kind of barely be moving when we land on it."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "It makes it actually easier."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "If the ship has to move or it's got a big weight because it has to make its own wind when we land, which is the day that it was this day, you go, oh, okay."}, {"time": 4802, "text": "And it creates what's called, we call the burble, but when the air flows across the flight deck, it drops behind the ship, you know, and then it kicks back up."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "So when you're coming board to land, it's going to make you go up a little bit and then you're going to fall and you got to anticipate that to stay on glideslope."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "So we're pretty conscious of what's going on out there with the waves and the wind."}, {"time": 4821, "text": "So there's no waves, there's no wind, there's no whitecaps, and we look down and we see whitewater."}, {"time": 4828, "text": "So if you put a piece of land, a seamount below the surface, like, you know, even 20 feet below the surface, it's big enough."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "As the waves come in, you know, waves have height and length."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "When they come in, that's what happens on the shore, when a wave comes in, it hits and then it starts to collapse and it pushes the wave height up because it can't go anymore and then it breaks over the top and that's where you get the weight."}, {"time": 4849, "text": "So what happens is at sea, when you get a seamount, you'll see stuff come in, the wave will crash and you'll get whitewater."}, {"time": 4855, "text": "You can go out when it's high tide in any one of the coasts, you can go out here off of Boston and go, hey, at low tide, I can see those rocks and at high tide, I can't see the rocks are covered, but there'll be whitewater around those rocks."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "You'll be able to tell there's something underneath the surface."}, {"time": 4869, "text": "So that's what it was."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "We don't see an object because there's all kinds of, oh, they saw another craft below the wave."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "We didn't see anything below the water."},

of a 737."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "So it looks like if you took a 737, put it about 15, 20 feet below the water so the wave is breaking over the top and you're going to get whitewater where the plane is at, you'd see this kind of shape."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "So it looks like a cross."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "So as we're looking down off the right side, the backseater in the other airplane, Jim, says this is that talking in partials again."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "He says, hey, Skipper, do you?"}, {"time": 4903, "text": "And that's about what he gets out of his mouth."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "And I go, what the hell is that?"}, {"time": 4907, "text": "In a nice way."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "Do you see that essentially is what he's saying?"}, {"time": 4909, "text": "So we see the whitewater and that's what draws our eyes down there."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "Otherwise we'd have never seen it."}, {"time": 4913, "text": "So we see this whitewater."}, {"time": 4914, "text": "I would have loved to see the look on your face when you see that."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "And then we see this little white tic tac because we're about 20,000 feet above it and it's doing, it's going basically north, south, and then east, west, north, and it's abrupt."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "It's very abrupt."}, {"time": 4926, "text": "So it's not like a helicopter, if a helicopter is going sideways and it goes once, it's going sideways left and it goes right, what it'll do is it'll go, it's got a speed, it slows down because there's inertia and it stops and then it goes back the other way."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "This thing's not, it's like left, right, left, right with no."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "So moving in ways that doesn't feel intuitive to you of the things you've seen in the past."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "So as a pilot, the first thing you think is it's a helicopter, right?"}, {"time": 4951, "text": "So you go, oh, what is, cause when we see it's moving, we're like, oh, helicopter."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "So the first thing you look for to see if it's a helicopter when they're doing that, because usually when they get down there towards that 50 feet, you'll get rotor wash. You see it in the movies when the helicopter's by the water, it kicks, the water comes up the sides cause the downdraft, you know, like a thunderstorm will do that."}, {"time": 4970, "text": "It pushes the air down and then it has to come up the sides."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "So you see it and you go, well, there's no, there's no rotor wash. What is that thing?"}, {"time": 4978, "text": "So by this time we're driving around."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "So as we're, if we were at the six oclock, we're driving around towards that nine oclock position and we're just watching this thing."}, {"time": 4984, "text": "And it's just, it's still pointing north, south, and it's going left, right, and it's kind of moving around the object."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "And if it had, if I had to say it biased itself, it was biased towards the bottom half."}, {"time": 4993, "text": "So if you've got the east, west, and then the north, south kind of across, it's hanging out on the southern thing that's hanging out."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "It's just kind of moving around up, down, left, and it's crossing over it and it's going up."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "It's just kind of, so now we're like, what the hell is that?"}, {"time": 5005, "text": "So then I go, hey, I'm going to go check it out."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "And the other pilot says, I'm going to stay up here."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "And I said, yeah, stay up high."}, {"time": 5012, "text": "Because now we get, we get a different perspective."}, {"time": 5015,

and the Tic Tac."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "So she gets a God's eye view of everything that's going on, which is really important."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "You know, you can hear people say it's high cover, whatever."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "She's watching me, which is, it's perfect as the story goes on, because it gives us two perspectives, you know, of a perspective that's about 8,000 feet above us when that thing disappears."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "And they don't, you know, because if it's just like, oh, I lost it and they go, no, it's over to the right."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "We can still see it."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "We all lost it at the same time."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "So as we come down, we get to about 12 oclock and I'm descending and it's an easy descent."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "I'm doing about 300 knots, which is a really good airspeed for the airplane for maneuvering because I have, I have everything available to me at that speed."},

the West and starts coming up."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "So now it's obviously knows that we're there."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "Whatever this thing is, it knows that we're there."}, {"time": 5073,

thing is like, this is like five minutes."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "This is not like we saw it and it was gone or, oh, I saw lights in the sky and they were gone."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "We watched this thing on a crystal clear day with four trained observers, watch this thing fly around."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "So we're like, okay."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "So I get over to the eight oclock position and I'm a little, I'm a couple thousand feet above it and it's about, so I'm probably at about 15 K I think it is."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "I think that's my story is about 15."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "It's just estimating."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "So you can see it's just a really easy descent because."}, {"time": 5105, "text": "So what's 15 K?"}, {"time": 5106,

feet."}, {"time": 5114, "text": "So they're driving around and I'm descending."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "They're staying up there."}, {"time": 5117, "text": "So I'm kind of doing this as they drive around."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "So I'm looking at this thing and it's about the two oclock position."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "We're about the eight oclock position and I'm like, oh, I've got,

about a half mile away, which you think, well, a half mile is pretty far."}, {"time": 5147, "text": "Half mile in aviation isn't, it's nothing."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "It's I mean, you can tell

like right there and it's coming across my nose."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "So now I'm basically pointing back towards east."}, {"time": 5160, "text": "So I'm cutting across cause I'm going to the three oclock position."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "It's at two oclock and I'm going to meet it at three oclock."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "So as I do this, it goes, it just accelerates and

"So now you go."}, {"time": 5202, "text": "And I remember telling the guy in my backseat, like a dude, I'm, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty weirded out because this is, I mean, you know, I had at the time like 30 some hundred hours of flying."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "I'd been doing it for 18 years."}, {"time": 5213, "text": "It's nothing like anything you've seen."}, {"time": 5216,

responsible to do that."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "So, Hey, let's go back."}, {"time": 5234, "text": "And the, the, the guy who's going to be the bad guys is the CEO of the Marine squadron."},

Hornets, the legacy Hornets, the F18Cs don't have as much gas as the Super Hornets."}, {"time": 5250, "text": "So he had launched first and they were going to do him."}, {"time": 5253, "text": "And

a cap point by the way?"}, {"time": 5263, "text": "That's where we hold."}, {"time": 5264, "text": "So it's called a combat air patrol point."}, {"time": 5266, "text": "So we're just going to hold at one end."}, {"time": 5268, "text": "He's going to hold at the other end."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "It's kind of like, Hey, you guys are going to get, it's, it's, if it's a football field, we're going to sit on one goal line."}, {"time": 5274, "text": "He's going to sit on the other goal line."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "And when they say go, we're going to run at each other and then try and do

just listening."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "We don't talk to him at all."}, {"time": 5286, "text": "He's just listening."}, {"time": 5287, "text": "He just dials up."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "Cause they know that we all know the frequencies."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "So he's listening to what's going on because he's like, cause they canceled training."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "So what else is he going to do?"}, {"time": 5293, "text": "He's just going to hang out there and do circles while he's waiting for him and his wingman."}, {"time": 5296, "text": "So they just, they're listening to all this go on."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "And then at this point you move on."}, {"time": 5301, "text": "We come back up to train."}, {"time": 5302, "text": "We go back as we're flying back the

showed back up."}, {"time": 5318, "text": "It just popped up."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "This is like 60 miles away."}, {"time": 5321, "text": "It just reappears."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "We're like, Oh, okay."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "So we got the radars out."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "We're looking for it."}, {"time": 5325, "text": "Uh, we get out there."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "We

whatever, whatever the heck you saw, whatever the heck happened, it's, you know, one of the most fascinating things, um, events in recent history."}, {"time": 5395, "text": "So whatever it was, it's interesting to talk about it, different kinds of angles."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "There's no good answers, but it's interesting to ask some dumb questions here."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "Uh, so first of all, you mentioned, see, you saw at some point X, Y, and then, uh, somebody in the Princeton said, you're not going to believe this, sir."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "It's at your cap point

tell it, we don't broadcast it, we have a waypoint in the system, but I don't know."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "Maybe it knew where we were going."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "Cause we use the same one

they're like, well, I go, dude, and I go, and I told him, I said, dude, get video."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "And he goes, and so, and that's how he is."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "He's like, I'm going to go."}, {"time": 5449, "text": "And he, he was, he, he was determined that he was going to find this thing."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "So when you look at his video, and this is the stuff that isn't out, that they don't see because not all the, all you see is the FLIR tape."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "That's the targeting pod, the forward looking infrared receiver."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "I'll probably overlay the video for people to see."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "When he goes out, it's you know, what he's looking at on his displays is he has basically two radar displays up."}, {"time": 5472, "text": "He has azimuth and range on the right one, and he has azimuth and elevation on the left one."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "So this is called the Azel display."}, {"time": 5478, "text":

this."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "It's taken a cone because a radar really looks left and right from a point and it squares it out."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "So the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us because they do this."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "They square it off."}, {"time": 5495, "text": "So, so he goes out and when he first sees it, he gets a radar return on it because when he's not trying to lock it."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "So the radar is just throwing energy out and getting it, you know, it's a Doppler radar."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "So when it's in search mode, that's all it's doing."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "It's going, oh, I can see you."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "And it's looking for return."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So he gets a return."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "So he wants to see what it is because all you get is a little green square, unless it builds a track file on it, but a little green square is just sitting there."}, {"time": 5515,

energy on it, but he's telling the radar, stare down that line of sight and whatever's there, I want you to grab it and build a track file on it, which will tell us how high it is, how fast it is and the direction that it's going."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "So the radar is smart enough that when the signal comes back, if it's been messed with, it will tell you, it'll give you indications that I'm being jammed."}, {"time": 5541, "text": "So that's all it is, is you send a signal out, something, it manipulates the signal either in range and velocity or whatever, and it sends it back and the

about every mode you can possibly see because everything comes up and this aspect gets along, it's all kinds of, I don't want to get into details, but you can tell it's being jammed."}, {"time": 5570,

then in the back seat, so they don't have a stick and throttle, they have their side stick controllers so they can control all the sensors and they can just toggle around and do stuff."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "So he has the ability to just move one switch real quick and it will go from that azimuth elevation on the radar to the targeting pod."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "Well, as soon as he commanded the radar to look at that target, the targeting pod goes, oh, what's over there?"}, {"time": 5603, "text": "And it'll stare because it goes down the line of sight because all the systems are hooked together."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "You can decouple them, but they're going to automatically couple up."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "So when he castles over, it's a switch, it looks like a castle switch, what's a castle?"}, {"time": 5614, "text": "So when he moves that thing to the left and he swaps the displays out and he says, instead of looking at the radar, I want to look at the targeting pod, he sees it on the targeting pod because the targeting pod's already looking there."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "And now he's on a passive track because he's not literally sending any energy out, he's just receiving IR energy from the tic tac and then the system itself will track the pixels and the contrast differences, it depends on what mode you're in."}, {"time": 5636, "text":

the modes, so there's a narrow, medium and wide."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "So wide is far away, medium and then narrow."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "And then there's the TV mode and he goes from IR mode to the TV mode."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "The cool thing with the TV mode is narrow IR mode is only medium TV mode."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "So you can actually get closer with narrow TV mode."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "It's got a better zoom capability when you go into TV mode."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "So he goes through all those things and that's when you see it going from a black background to a white background."}, {"time": 5676, "text": "So you can figure out what the heck is this?"}, {"time": 5677, "text": "Well, yeah, and he wants to get as much data as he can on it

was on Strangeland and YouTube, someone pulled off of a secret, it looks like a rack."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "There's tape machines in there and it gets converted to digital and stored on a hard drive and they pulled it off that hard drive and they put it on YouTube."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "No, it's just like, anytime, even a digital media, the more you copy digital media, there's some quality that gets, it degrades."}, {"time": 6207, "text": "So this, you don't know how many times this has been copied."}, {"time": 6209, "text": "So we were looking, the videos I've seen are right off the original, they're Hi8 tapes, it's basically pulled off the back of the display, so it's not filmed with cameras, it's literally a digital feed that's pulled off the back and put onto a Hi8

were still in that process of slowly, because originally we had little cameras here that shine, so if the light hit, it would wash out the displays."}, {"time": 6232, "text": "So it's a pretty good feed, when you put it on, so instead of looking at it on your tiny little computer monitor or whatever, I'm looking at it on like a 19 inch, because it was still normal TVs back there, we had just put flat screens in the ready room that I had bought, so we could watch movies."}, {"time": 6247, "text": "A nice, huge 19 inch screen."}, {"time": 6251, "text": "It's maybe 20, it was nice."}, {"time":

to five so we can pay you well, right?"}, {"time": 8910, "text": "To do the research."}, {"time": 8911, "text": "But, oh, by the way, the research is, it's not classified, but it's controlled."},

everybody's converged towards this local minima or local maxima, whatever you think about it."}, {"time": 8974, "text": "And it's again, same as with the TICTAC, thinking outside the box is not accepted and it probably should be."}, {"time": 8985, "text": "But it's hard because if you go back, go back to Einstein, back to the original, he was out of the box."}, {"time": 8993, "text": "He did not think the norm."}, {"time": 8994, "text": "That's true genius."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "Had he not thought out of the box and came up with some of his theories, where would we be?"}, {"time":

had."}, {"time": 9011, "text": "I have to kind of bring up some debunking stuff because I think not the actual facts of the debunking, but the nature of the true believers versus the debunkers hurts

"Like how, how did you know it was about 40 feet long?"}, {"time": 9105, "text": "I go, okay, so 16 years flying against other airplanes, know what stuff looks like."}, {"time": 9113, "text": "You know, I've looked down on things."}, {"time": 9114, "text": "So if I know, I know, here's the known things."}, {"time": 9116, "text": "I know when we saw the Tic Tac, I was at 20,000 feet ish, right around there."}, {"time": 9122, "text": "So when I look down, I know what a Hornet looks like looking down on them cause I've done it for all those years."}, {"time": 9127, "text": "I mean, I got a good idea."}, {"time": 9128, "text": "So that's, that's why I said 40 feet cause it's about Hornet size."}, {"time": 9131, "text": "So and as I go around, you know, you get to the point where you have to be able to judge distance when we fly out of experience and you can tell if something small or big, you know."}, {"time": 9143, "text": "So I would argue the fact of, you know, peer experiences, you know, professional observers, which is what we're actually trained to do."}, {"time": 9153, "text": "And having done it for so long, no, it was, and everyone came back with the same thing."},

eyes, what you see is the incorrect state of things."}, {"time": 9173, "text": "So like how often do you make mistakes with vision?"}, {"time": 9177, "text": "You actually, you make vision issues a lot because you're, and the sad part is, is your brain believes what your eyes see."}, {"time": 9184, "text": "We are actually trained to do the opposite of that, especially when you instrument fly because your brain and eyes can tell you one thing, but you got to trust your instruments."}, {"time": 9194, "text": "Let's go back to landing at night."}, {"time": 9196, "text": "So your eyes assume that the runway and your brain assumes that the runway is fixed, but you know that the runway is moving."}, {"time": 9206, "text": "So if I try and do stuff visually, I would, you die every time, not every time, but you die close to every time trying to land on a boat."}, {"time": 9214, "text": "So we actually use instruments, which are counter to your brain."}, {"time": 9217, "text": "So, and there's actually all kinds of things that we go through in training."}, {"time": 9221, "text": "They have this thing, I think they still use it."}, {"time": 9223, "text": "It's called the MSDD multi

think the thing goes really fast and they can, you can make yourself think that I'm descending or climbing, but we were actually only going around in circles at a very slow rate, as fast as a human can talk."}, {"time": 9244, "text": "But as they spin you around in a little sub thing and slow it down and speed it up, your body does this and you, you know, and then by visuals of showing you like they can spin it sideways to the outside wall, but they can show like lines that are, they can make the line stand still because they're moving the same velocity."}, {"time": 9258, "text": "They can move the other way and you'll think you're screaming."}, {"time": 9260, "text": "You see it in amusement parks all the time."}, {"time": 9263, "text": "You do all that because it gives you a sense of the A, but you're really not doing, you're sitting there."}, {"time": 9269, "text": "So we get trained on all that stuff."}, {"time": 9270, "text": "So if you, if you want to look at it and go, well, you're, you're disoriented or this, I'd be like, I'd argue going, no, I'm not."}, {"time": 9275, "text": "Because you know, when I'm flying the airplane, even as I'm looking at the Tic Tac, I've got a heads up display that tells me what my airplane's doing."}, {"time": 9282, "text": "So I've got, I know what I'm doing."}, {"time": 9284, "text": "I can look outside."}, {"time": 9285, "text": "I've

saying."}, {"time": 9313, "text": "You'd be amazed at how good, so here's a, here's another example."}, {"time": 9315, "text": "So if we go out over the water, so there's no land in sight and we're going to fight."}, {"time": 9320, "text": "So when we fight, you know, two airplanes, we're going to dog fight."}, {"time": 9325, "text": "As an instructor and I was for all, most of my time, you have to come back and you have to recreate it."}, {"time": 9331, "text": "So we call it drawing arrows."}, {"time": 9333, "text": "So you have to recreate that stuff."}, {"time": 9337, "text": "So you get pretty good at going, you know, like I would take off and say, all right, we're starting heading due east and I know where the sun is at because in the short couple minutes that we're going to fight,

right?"}, {"time": 9356, "text": "So I'm starting going east and it's actually be down off my right hand side."}, {"time": 9360, "text": "So now I know as I'm fighting, cause in the water you don't have any reference."}, {"time": 9363, "text": "Like I pass land."}, {"time": 9364, "text": "I pass land."}, {"time": 9365, "text": "No, you don't."}, {"time": 9366, "text": "And you can't use clouds

ended heading 355."}, {"time": 9374, "text": "And then you recreate the turns and the amount of turns and use the sun relative."}, {"time": 9378, "text": "So you can create this entire battle that

trained to do all that."}, {"time": 9396, "text": "And I take all the notes, why I'm flying, you can do it."}, {"time": 9399, "text": "But usually it's, you memorize it all and you get done and then

anything, then there's no learning to be had."}, {"time": 9464, "text": "Because the whole thing is the debrief when we get back and we talk about, that's really where the learning is."}, {"time":

this world and looking at it, I'm a little bit more skeptical."}, {"time": 9603, "text": "So your eye account, I think, is the most fascinating story."}, {"time": 9606, "text": "And that I think that's inspiring to me and should be inspiring to a lot of scientists out there on so many levels, just like we said, an engineering level that maybe there's propulsion systems we can actually build that can do some crazy, amazing stuff."}, {"time": 9624, "text": "So it's at the very least intriguing and at the best inspiring."}, {"time": 9630, "text": "I just want to say that."}, {"time": 9631, "text": "But on the video side, it's like it's the videos for the Flir video, the go fast and the gimbal video."}, {"time": 9645, "text": "They are only interesting to me to me in the context of your story."}, {"time": 9653, "text": "Like without that, they're kind of low resolution."}, {"time": 9656, "text": "It's like it it's easier to build a debunking story to be skeptical."}, {"time": 9662, "text": "So this is where I'm coming from."}, {"time": 9664, "text": "Maybe you can convince me otherwise."}, {"time": 9666, "text": "But so to bring up Mick West one more time, he looks at the Flir video and he says that one of the most amazing video parts of the Flir video for people haven't seen it is at the end of it, the Tic Tac flies or appears to fly very quickly to the left off the screen."}, {"time": 9691, "text": "And what Mick West says is that, you know, Mick West, probably others, that the way to explain that is the tracking system."}, {"time": 9702, "text": "Like we said, this vision based tracking simply loses the like the object."}, {"time": 9708, "text": "The tracking loses it."}, {"time": 9710, "text": "And so it simply allows the object to float off screen because it's no longer tracking it."}, {"time": 9718, "text": "So I find that at least a plausible explanation of that video."}, {"time": 9724, "text": "Looking at your face, you do not."}, {"time": 9727,

could have done this with the car and you'd have won the race."}, {"time": 9747, "text": "You know, and Lewis Hamilton right now is, you know, defending world champion two time ways, four time, four

driving a Formula One car."}, {"time": 9763, "text": "So I can't tell you how many times I've watched."}, {"time": 9765, "text": "You got to remember when we looked at this thing, when when Chad came back with the video, we sat there and watched that."}, {"time": 9770, "text": "I mean, I can't tell you how many times I watched it off the original tapes going, all right, right."}, {"time": 9775,

9780, "text": "And if you actually watch all that stuff, it doesn't do that."}, {"time": 9782, "text": "It actually when the vehicle starts to move, the bars, the tracking gate starts to open up and the people at Raytheon could probably add to this because they built the pod."}, {"time": 9791, "text": "The tracking gate will start to open up."}, {"time": 9792, "text": "And but the thing when it leaves so fast off the screen, the pod can't move fast enough."}, {"time": 9797, "text": "It has gimbal rates on how fast that thing can move around because there's another theory that, oh, the pods looking forward when the pod passes underneath the airplane."}, {"time": 9804, "text": "So if I'm looking at you and you pass underneath me as it does this, the ball will actually flip around to kind of finish off and it'll it'll it swaps ends because it has, you know, it's a gimbal."}, {"time": 9814, "text": "It can't just it's not free floating."}, {"time": 9818, "text": "But there's a theory on one of them."}, {"time": 9819, "text": "Oh, it's here and it flipped over."}, {"time": 9820, "text": "It doesn't do that when it's looking out in front."}, {"time": 9821, "text": "It stays like this."}, {"time": 9823, "text": "So yet another another debunker who doesn't know this."}, {"time": 9825, "text": "So, you know, and Mick has had several theories on other of some of the other videos like one of them, the go fast as a bird."}, {"time": 9833, "text": "And Jeremy Corbell actually did a nice job of saying, no, it's not because he's on he's on black hot."}, {"time": 9838, "text": "So the white object is actually colder than the ocean."}, {"time": 9843, "text": "If they were colder than the ocean, they'd be dead."}, {"time": 9845, "text": "So the gimbal video to comment on the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation, the apparent rotation of the object."}, {"time": 9855, "text": "That is something that is not possible to do with systems that we know of."}, {"time": 9862, "text": "And Mick West suggests that a flare like reflections or whatever can explain."}, {"time": 9870, "text": "Now, because what Mick West doesn't see is so when they take because I've talked to the one of them, actually, I work with."}, {"time": 9877, "text": "So I know him."}, {"time": 9878, "text": "I know I talk to him all the time."}, {"time": 9880, "text": "So and it's his best friend actually shot the video, one of his best friends for the video, the movie and both of them that go fast in the game were shot by the same person."}, {"time": 9891, "text": "OK, so and they were in each other's wedding."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "So that's how well they know each other."}, {"time": 9895, "text": "OK, so what you don't see is."}, {"time": 9898, "text": "So the airplanes, airplanes still super hornets, but they have the APG 79, which is the new phased array radar that's made by Raytheon, things incredible, OK?"}, {"time": 9908, "text": "It doesn't usually if it's if it's out there and it sees it, it's real."}, {"time": 9911, "text": "So at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing stuff."}, {"time": 9913, "text": "And then they actually threw one of the targeting pods out there."}, {"time": 9916, "text": "Well, the targeting pod, there's heat signature and you go, hey, dot heat signature, something's there."}, {"time": 9921, "text": "It's not you're not picking up some extraneous thing."}, {"time": 9922, "text": "So what you see in the gimbal video of the thing and it rotates and you go, holy shit, look at that thing."}, {"time": 9928, "text": "And it's in the wind and it's going against the wind while it's doing this."}, {"time": 9932, "text": "You know, someone goes, oh, it's an airplane."}, {"time": 9933, "text": "No, if an airplane does this, it's eventually going to start to change aspect because it's in a turn."}, {"time": 9937, "text": "This thing doesn't change aspect."}, {"time": 9938, "text": "It just rotates."},

that they identify is their number one priority or their launch and steering."}, {"time": 9951, "text": "So when they designate that, that's where the targeting pod is going to look."}, {"time": 9954,

what are we trying to do here, right?"}, {"time": 523, "text": "So we have these beasts called computers that are very good at specific kinds of things and we think it's useful to have them do it for us, right?"}, {"time": 532, "text": "Now you have this question of how best to express that because you have a human brain still that has an idea in its head and you want to achieve something, right?"}, {"time": 540, "text": "So, well, there's lots of ways of doing this."}, {"time": 543, "text": "You can go directly to the machine and speak assembly language and then you can express directly what the computer understands, that's fine."}, {"time": 550, "text": "You can then have higher and higher and higher levels of abstraction up until machine learning and you're designing a neural net to do the work for you."}, {"time": 558, "text": "The question is where along this way do you want to stop and what benefits do you get out of doing so?"}, {"time": 563, "text": "And so programming languages in general, you have C, you have Fortran, Java and Ada, Pascal, Swift, you have lots of different things."}, {"time": 573, "text": "They'll have different trade offs and they're tackling different parts of the problems."}, {"time": 576, "text": "Now, one of the things that most programming languages do is they're trying to make it so that you have pretty basic things like portability across different hardware."}, {"time": 585, "text": "So you've got, I'm gonna run on an Intel PC, I'm gonna run on a RISC 5 PC, I'm gonna run on a ARM phone or something like that, fine."}, {"time": 593, "text": "I wanna write one program and have it portable."}, {"time": 595, "text": "And this is something that assembly doesn't do."}, {"time": 597, "text": "Now, when you start looking at the space of programming languages, this is where I think it's fun because programming languages all have trade offs and most people will walk up to them and they look at the surface level of syntax and say, oh, I like curly braces or I like tabs or I like semi colons or not or whatever, right?"}, {"time": 617, "text": "Subjective, fairly subjective, very shallow things."}, {"time": 621, "text": "But programming languages when done right can actually be very powerful."}, {"time": 624, "text": "And the benefit they bring is expression."}, {"time": 630, "text": "Okay, and if you look at programming languages, there's really kind of two different levels to them."}, {"time": 634, "text": "One is the down in the dirt, nuts and bolts of how do you get the computer to be efficient, stuff like that, how they work, type systems, compiler stuff, things like that."}, {"time": 643, "text": "The other is the UI."}, {"time": 645, "text": "And the UI for programming language is really a design problem and a lot of people don't think about it that way."}, {"time": 650, "text": "And the UI, you mean all that stuff with the braces and?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "Yeah, all that stuff's the UI and what it is and UI means user interface."}, {"time": 658, "text": "And so what's really going on is it's the interface between the guts and the human."}, {"time": 664, "text": "And humans are hard, right?"}, {"time": 665, "text": "Humans have feelings, they have things they like, they have things they don't like."}, {"time": 670, "text": "And a lot of people treat programming languages as though humans are just kind of abstract creatures that cannot be predicted."}, {"time": 677, "text": "But it turns out that actually there is better and worse."}, {"time": 681, "text": "Like people can tell when a programming language is good or when it was an accident, right?"}, {"time": 686, "text": "And one of the things with Swift in particular is that a tremendous amount of time by a tremendous number of people have been put into really polishing and making it feel good."}, {"time": 696, "text": "But it also has really good nuts and bolts underneath it."}, {"time": 699, "text": "You said that Swift makes a lot of people feel good."}, {"time": 702, "text": "How do you get to that point?"}, {"time": 705, "text": "So how do you predict that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are going to enjoy using this user experience of this programming language?"}, {"time": 717, "text": "Well, you can look at it in terms of better and worse, right?"}, {"time": 719, "text": "So if you have to write lots of boilerplate or something like that, you will feel unproductive."}, {"time": 723, "text": "And so that's a bad thing."}, {"time": 725, "text": "You can look at it in terms of safety."}, {"time": 726, "text": "If like C for example, is what's called a memory unsafe language."}, {"time": 730, "text": "And so you get dangling pointers and you get all these kinds of bugs that then you have spent tons of time debugging and it's a real pain in the butt and you feel unproductive."}, {"time": 737, "text": "And so by subtracting these things from the experience, you get happier people."}, {"time": 742, "text": "But again, keep interrupting."}, {"time": 745, "text": "I'm sorry, but so hard to deal with."}, {"time": 749, "text": "If you look at the people that are most productive on Stack Overflow, they have a set of priorities that may not always correlate perfectly with the experience of the majority of users."}, {"time": 763, "text": "If you look at the most upvoted, quote unquote, correct answer on Stack Overflow, it usually really sort of prioritizes like safe code, proper code, stable code, you know, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 781, "text": "As opposed to like, if I wanna use go to statements in my basic, right?"}, {"time": 788, "text": "I wanna use go to statements."}, {"time": 789, "text": "Like what if 99% of people wanna use go to statements?"}, {"time": 792, "text": "So you use completely improper, you know, unsafe syntax."}, {"time": 796, "text": "I don't think that people actually, like if you boil it down and you get below the surface level, people don't actually care about go tos or if statements or things like this."}, {"time": 804, "text": "They care about achieving a goal, right?"}, {"time": 806, "text": "So the real question is I wanna set up a web server and I wanna do a thing, whatever."}, {"time": 812, "text": "Like how quickly can I achieve that, right?"}, {"time": 814, "text": "And so from a programming language perspective, there's really two things that matter there."}, {"time": 819, "text": "One is what libraries exist and then how quickly can you put it together and what are the tools around that look like, right?"}, {"time": 827, "text": "And when you wanna build a library that's missing, what do you do?"}, {"time": 830, "text": "Okay, now this is where you see huge divergence in the force between worlds, okay?"}, {"time": 835, "text": "And so you look at Python, for example."}, {"time": 837, "text": "Python is really good at assembling things, but it's not so great at building all the libraries."}, {"time": 842, "text": "And so what you get because of performance reasons, other things like this, is you get Python layered on top of C, for example, and that means that doing certain kinds of things well, it doesn't really make sense to do in Python."}, {"time": 853, "text": "Instead you do it in C and then you wrap it and then you have, you're living in two worlds and two worlds never is really great because tooling and the debugger doesn't work right and like all these kinds of things."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Can you clarify a little bit what you mean by Python is not good at building libraries, meaning it doesn't make it conducive."}, {"time": 870, "text": "Certain kinds of libraries."}, {"time": 871, "text": "No, but just the actual meaning of the sentence, meaning like it's not conducive to developers to come in and add libraries or is it the duality of the, it's a dance between Python and C and... Well, so Python's amazing."}, {"time": 889, "text": "Python's a great language."}, {"time": 890, "text": "I did not mean to say that Python is bad for libraries."}, {"time": 893, "text": "What I meant to say is there are libraries that Python's really good at that you can write in Python, but there are other things, like if you wanna build a machine learning framework, you're not gonna build a machine learning framework in Python because of performance, for example, or you want GPU acceleration or things like this."}, {"time": 910, "text": "Instead, what you do is you write a bunch of C or C++ code or something like that, and then you talk to it from Python, right?"}, {"time": 918, "text": "And so this is because of decisions that were made in the Python design and those decisions have other counterbalancing forces."}, {"time": 927, "text": "But the trick when you start looking at this from a programming language perspective, you start to say, okay, cool."}, {"time": 933, "text": "How do I build this catalog of libraries that are really powerful?"}, {"time": 937, "text": "And how do I make it so that then they can be assembled into ways that feel good and they generally work the first time?"}, {"time": 944, "text": "Because when you're talking about building a thing, you have to include the debugging, the fixing, the turnaround cycle, the development cycle, all that kind of stuff into the process of building the thing."}, {"time": 956, "text": "It's not just about pounding out the code."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And so this is where things like catching bugs at compile time is valuable, for example."}, {"time": 964, "text": "But if you dive into the details in this, Swift, for example, has certain things like value semantics, which is this fancy way of saying that when you treat a variable like a value, it acts like a mathematical object would."}, {"time": 981, "text": "Okay, so you have used PyTorch a little bit."}, {"time": 985, "text": "In PyTorch, you have tensors."}, {"time": 986, "text": "Tensors are n dimensional grid of numbers, very simple."}, {"time": 991, "text": "You can do plus and other operators on them."}, {"time": 994, "text": "It's all totally fine."}, {"time": 995, "text": "But why do you need to clone a tensor sometimes?"}, {"time": 999, "text": "Have you ever run into that?"}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Okay, and so why is that?"}, {"time": 1002, "text": "Why do you need to clone a tensor?"}, {"time": 1003, "text": "It's the usual object thing that's in Python."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So in Python, and just like with Java and many other languages, this isn't unique to Python."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "In Python, it has a thing called reference semantics, which is the nerdy way of explaining this."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And what that means is you actually have a pointer do a thing instead of the thing, okay?"}, {"time": 1021, "text": "Now, this is due to a bunch of implementation details that you don't want to go into."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "But in Swift, you have this thing called value semantics."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And so when you have a tensor in Swift, it is a value."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "If you copy it, it looks like you have a unique copy."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And if you go change one of those copies, then it doesn't update the other one because you just made a copy of this thing, right?"}, {"time": 1041, "text": "So that's like highly error prone in at least computer science, math centric disciplines about Python, that like the thing you would expect to behave like math."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "Like math, it doesn't behave like math."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "And in fact, quietly it doesn't behave like math and then can ruin the entirety of your math thing."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "Well, and then it puts you in debugging land again."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Right now, you just want to get something done and you're like, wait a second, where do I need to put clone?"}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And what level of the stack, which is very complicated, which I thought I was reusing somebody's library and now I need to understand it to know where to clone a thing, right?"}, {"time": 1079, "text": "And hard to debug, by the way."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "And so this is where programming languages really matter."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "Right, and so in Swift having value semantics so that both you get the benefit of math, working like math, right?"}, {"time": 1092, "text": "But also the efficiency that comes with certain advantages there, certain implementation details there really benefit you as a programmer, right?"}, {"time": 1098, "text": "Can you clarify the value semantics?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "Like how do you know that a thing should be treated like a value?"}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Yeah, so Swift has a pretty strong culture and good language support for defining values."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And so if you have an array, so tensors are one example that the machine learning folks are very used to."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "Just think about arrays, same thing, where you have an array, you create an array, you put two or three or four things into it, and then you pass it off to another function."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "What happens if that function adds some more things to it?"}, {"time": 1131, "text": "Well, you'll see it on the side that you pass it in, right?"}, {"time": 1134, "text": "This is called reference semantics."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Now, what if you pass an array off to a function, it scrolls it away in some dictionary or some other data structure somewhere, right?"}, {"time": 1144, "text": "Well, it thought that you just handed it that array, then you return back and that reference to that array still exists in the caller, and they go and put more stuff in it, right?"}, {"time": 1155, "text": "The person you handed it off to may have thought they had the only reference to that, and so they didn't know that this was gonna change underneath the covers."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "And so this is where you end up having to do clone."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "So like I was passed a thing, I'm not sure if I have the only version of it, so now I have to clone it."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "So what value semantics does is it allows you to say, hey, I have a, so in Swift, it defaults to value semantics."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Oh, so it defaults to value semantics, and then because most things should end up being like values, then it makes sense for that to be the default."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "And one of the important things about that is that arrays and dictionaries and all these other collections that are aggregations of other things also have value semantics."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "And so when you pass this around to different parts of your program, you don't have to do these defensive copies."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And so this is great for two sides, right?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "It's great because you define away the bug, which is a big deal for productivity, the number one thing most people care about, but it's also good for performance because when you're doing a clone, so you pass the array down to the thing, it's like, I don't know if anybody else has it, I have to clone it."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "Well, you just did a copy of a bunch of data."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "It could be big."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "And then it could be that the thing that called you is not keeping track of the old thing."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "So you just made a copy of it, and you may not have had to."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "And so the way the value semantics work in Swift is it uses this thing called copy on write, which means that you get the benefit of safety and performance."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "And it has another special trick because if you think certain languages like Java, for example, they have immutable strings."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "And so what they're trying to do is they provide value semantics by having pure immutability."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "Functional languages have pure immutability in lots of different places, and this provides a much safer model and it provides value semantics."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "The problem with this is if you have immutability, everything is expensive."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "Everything requires a copy."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "For example, in Java, if you have a string X and a string Y, you append them together, we have to allocate a new string to hold X, Y."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "If they're immutable."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "Well, strings in Java are immutable."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "And if there's optimizations for short ones, it's complicated, but generally think about them as a separate allocation."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "And so when you append them together, you have to go allocate a third thing because somebody might have a pointer to either of the other ones, right?"}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And you can't go change them."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "So you have to go allocate a third thing."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "Because of the beauty of how the Swift value semantics system works out, if you have a string in Swift and you say, hey, put in X, right?"}, {"time": 1300, "text": "And they say, append on Y, Z, W, it knows that there's only one reference to that."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "And so it can do an in place update."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "And so you're not allocating tons of stuff on the side."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "You don't have all those problems."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "When you pass it off, you can know you have the only reference."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "If you pass it off to multiple different people, but nobody changes it, they can all share the same thing."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "So you get a lot of the benefit of purely immutable design."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "And so you get a really nice sweet spot that I haven't seen in other languages."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "Yeah, that's interesting."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "I thought there was going to be a philosophical narrative here that you're gonna have to pay a cost for it."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "Cause it sounds like, I think value semantics is beneficial for easing of debugging or minimizing the risk of errors, like bringing the errors closer to the source, bringing the symptom of the error closer to the source of the error, however you say that."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "But you're saying there's not a performance cost either if you implement it correctly."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "Well, so there's trade offs with everything."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "And so if you are doing very low level stuff, then sometimes you can notice a cost, but then what you're doing is you're saying, what is the right default?"}, {"time": 1376, "text": "So coming back to user interface, when you talk about programming languages, one of the major things that Swift does that makes people love it, that is not obvious when it comes to designing a language is this UI principle of progressive disclosure of complexity."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Okay, so Swift, like many languages is very powerful."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "The question is, when do you have to learn the power as a user?"}, {"time": 1400, "text": "So Swift, like Python, allows you to start with like, print hello world, right?"}, {"time": 1404, "text": "Certain other languages start with like, public static void main class, like all the ceremony, right?"}, {"time": 1412, "text": "And so you go to teach a new person, hey, welcome to this new thing."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Let's talk about public access control classes."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "Wait, what's that?"}, {"time": 1421, "text": "String system.out.println, like packages, like, God, right?"}, {"time": 1426, "text": "And so instead, if you take this and you say, hey, we need packages, modules, we need powerful things like classes, we need data structures, we need like all these things."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "The question is, how do you factor the complexity?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And how do you make it so that the normal case scenario is you're dealing with things that work the right way in the right way, give you good performance by default, but then as a power user, if you want to dive down to it, you have full C performance, full control over low level pointers."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "You can call malloc if you want to call malloc."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "This is not recommended on the first page of every tutorial, but it's actually really important when you want to get work done, right?"}, {"time": 1463, "text": "And so being able to have that is really the design in programming language design, and design is really, really hard."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "It's something that I think a lot of people kind of, outside of UI, again, a lot of people just think is subjective, like there's nothing, you know, it's just like curly braces or whatever."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "It's just like somebody's preference, but actually good design is something that you can feel."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "And how many people are involved with good design?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "So if we looked at Swift, but look at historically, I mean, this might touch like, it's almost like a Steve Jobs question too, like how much dictatorial decision making is required versus collaborative, and we'll talk about how all that can go wrong or right, but."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "Yeah, well, Swift, so I can't speak to in general, all design everywhere."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "So the way it works with Swift is that there's a core team, and so a core team is six or seven people ish, something like that, that is people that have been working with Swift since very early days, and so."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "And by early days is not that long ago."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Okay, yeah, so it became public in 2014, so it's been six years public now, but so that's enough time that there's a story arc there."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "Okay, yeah, and there's mistakes have been made that then get fixed, and you learn something, and then you, you know, and so what the core team does is it provides continuity, and so you wanna have a, okay, well, there's a big hole that we wanna fill."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "We know we wanna fill it, so don't do other things that invade that space until we fill the hole, right?"}, {"time": 1559, "text": "There's a boulder that's missing here, we wanna do, we will do that boulder, even though it's not today, keep out of that space."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "And the whole team remembers the myth of the boulder that's there."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "Yeah, yeah, there's a general sense of what the future looks like in broad strokes, and a shared understanding of that, combined with a shared understanding of what has happened in the past that worked out well and didn't work out well."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "The next level out is you have the, what's called the Swift evolution community, and you've got, in that case, hundreds of people that really care passionately about the way Swift evolves, and that's like an amazing thing to, again, the core team doesn't necessarily need to come up with all the good ideas."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "You got hundreds of people out there that care about something, and they come up with really good ideas too, and that provides this rock tumbler for ideas."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And so the evolution process is, a lot of people in a discourse forum, they're like hashing it out and trying to talk about, okay, well, should we go left or right, or if we did this, what would be good?"}, {"time": 1640, "text": "So does that group represent like the, how much people will love the user interface?"}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Like, do you think they're able to capture that?"}, {"time": 1649, "text": "Well, I mean, it's something we talk about a lot, it's something we care about."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "How well we do that's up for debate, but I think that we've done pretty well so far."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "Is the beginner in mind?"}, {"time": 1658, "text": "Like, because you said the progressive disclosure complexity."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "Yeah, so we care a lot about that, a lot about power, a lot about efficiency, a lot about, there are many factors to good design, and you have to figure out a way to kind of work your way through that, and."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So if you think about, like the language I love is Lisp, probably still because I use Emacs, but I haven't done anything, any serious work in Lisp, but it has a ridiculous amount of parentheses."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "I've also, you know, with Java and C++, the braces, you know, I like, I enjoyed the comfort of being between braces, you know?"}, {"time": 1700, "text": "Yeah, yeah, well, let's talk."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "And then Python is, sorry to interrupt, just like, and last thing to me, as a designer, if I was a language designer, God forbid, is I would be very surprised that Python with no braces would nevertheless somehow be comforting also."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "So like, I could see arguments for all of this."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "But look at this, this is evidence that it's not about braces versus tabs."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "Right, exactly, you're good, that's a good point."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "Right, so like, you know, there's evidence that."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "But see, like, it's one of the most argued about things."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Oh yeah, of course, just like tabs and spaces, which it doesn't, I mean, there's one obvious right answer, but it doesn't actually matter."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Let's not, like, come on, we're friends."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "Like, come on, what are you trying to do to me here?"}, {"time": 1743, "text": "People are gonna, yeah, half the people are gonna tune out."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "Yeah, so these, so you're able to identify things that don't really matter for the experience."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "Well, no, no, no, it's always a really hard, so the easy decisions are easy, right?"}, {"time": 1756, "text": "I mean, fine, those are not the interesting ones."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "The hard ones are the ones that are most interesting, right?"}, {"time": 1761, "text": "The hard ones are the places where, hey, we wanna do a thing, everybody agrees we should do it, there's one proposal on the table, but it has all these bad things associated with it."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "Well, okay, what are we gonna do about that?"}, {"time": 1773, "text": "Do we just take it?"}, {"time": 1774, "text": "Do we delay it?"}, {"time": 1776, "text": "Do we say, hey, well, maybe there's this other feature that if we do that first, this will work out better."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "How does this, if we do this, are we paying ourselves into a corner, right?"}, {"time": 1786, "text": "And so this is where, again, you're having that core team of people that has some continuity and has perspective, has some of the historical understanding, is really valuable because you get, it's not just like one brain, you get the power of multiple people coming together to make good decisions, and then you get the best out of all these people, and you also can harness the community around it."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "And what about the decision of whether in Python having one type or having strict typing?"}, {"time": 1815, "text": "Yeah, let's talk about this."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "So I like how you put that, by the way."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "So many people would say that Python doesn't have types."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "Doesn't have types, yeah."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "I haven't listened to you enough to where, I'm a fan of yours and I've listened to way too many podcasts and videos of you talking about this stuff."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "Oh yeah, so I would argue that Python has one type."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And so like when you import Python into Swift, which by the way works really well, you have everything comes in as a Python object."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Now here are their trade offs because it depends on what you're optimizing for."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "And Python is a super successful language for a really good reason."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "Because it has one type, you get duck typing for free and things like this."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "But also you're pushing, you're making it very easy to pound out code on one hand, but you're also making it very easy to introduce complicated bugs that you have to debug."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "And you pass a string into something that expects an integer and it doesn't immediately die."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "It goes all the way down the stack trace and you find yourself in the middle of some code that you really didn't want to know anything about."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "And it blows up and you're just saying, well, what did I do wrong, right?"}, {"time": 1878, "text": "And so types are good and bad and they have trade offs."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "They're good for performance and certain other things depending on where you're coming from, but it's all about trade offs."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "And so this is what design is, right?"}, {"time": 1888, "text": "Design is about weighing trade offs and trying to understand the ramifications of the things that you're weighing, like types or not, or one type or many types."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "But also within many types, how powerful do you make that type system is another very complicated question with lots of trade offs."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "It's very interesting by the way, but that's like one dimension and there's a bunch of other dimensions, JIT compiled versus static compiled, garbage collected versus reference counted versus manual memory management versus, like in like all these different trade offs and how you balance them are what make a program language good."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "Concurrency."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "So in all those things, I guess, when you're designing the language, you also have to think of how that's gonna get all compiled down to."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "If you care about performance, yeah."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "Well, and go back to Lisp, right?"}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So Lisp also, I would say JavaScript is another example of a very simple language, right?"}, {"time": 1944, "text": "And so one of the, so I also love Lisp."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "I don't use it as much as maybe you do or you did."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "No, I think we're both, everyone who loves Lisp, it's like, you love, it's like, I don't know, I love Frank Sinatra, but like how often do I seriously listen to Frank Sinatra?"}, {"time": 1960, "text": "But you look at that or you look at JavaScript, which is another very different, but relatively simple language."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "And there are certain things that don't exist in the language, but there is inherent complexity to the problems that we're trying to model."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "And so what happens to the complexity?"}, {"time": 1974, "text": "In the case of both of them, for example, you say, well, what about large scale software development?"}, {"time": 1980, "text": "Okay, well, you need something like packages."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "Neither language has a language affordance for packages."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And so what you get is patterns."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "You get things like NPN."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "You get things like these ecosystems that get built around."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "And I'm a believer that if you don't model at least the most important inherent complexity in the language, then what ends up happening is that complexity gets pushed elsewhere."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "And when it gets pushed elsewhere, sometimes that's great because often building things as libraries is very flexible and very powerful and allows you to evolve and things like that."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "But often it leads to a lot of unnecessary divergence in the force and fragmentation."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "And when that happens, you just get kind of a mess."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "And so the question is, how do you balance that?"}, {"time": 2022, "text": "Don't put too much stuff in the language because that's really expensive and it makes things complicated."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "But how do you model enough of the inherent complexity of the problem that you provide the framework and the structure for people to think about?"}, {"time": 2034, "text": "Well, so the key thing to think about with programming languages, and you think about what a programming language is therefore, is it's about making a human more productive, right?"}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And so there's an old, I think it's Steve Jobs quote about it's a bicycle for the mind, right?"}, {"time": 2050, "text": "You can definitely walk, but you'll get there a lot faster if you can bicycle on your way."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "And... A programming language is a bicycle for the mind?"}, {"time": 2060, "text": "Is it basically, wow, that's really interesting way to think about it."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "By raising the level of abstraction, now you can fit more things in your head."}, {"time": 2067, "text": "By being able to just directly leverage somebody's library, you can now get something done quickly."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "In the case of Swift, Swift UI is this new framework that Apple has released recently for doing UI programming."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "And it has this declarative programming model, which defines away entire classes of bugs."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "It builds on value semantics and many other nice Swift things."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "And what this does is it allows you to just get way more done with way less code."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "And now your productivity as a developer is much higher, right?"}, {"time": 2097, "text": "And so that's really what programming languages should be about, is it's not about tabs versus spaces or curly braces or whatever."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "It's about how productive do you make the person."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "And you can only see that when you have libraries that were built with the right intention that the language was designed for."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "And with Swift, I think we're still a little bit early, but Swift UI and many other things that are coming out now are really showing that."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "And I think that they're opening people's eyes."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "It's kind of interesting to think about like how that the knowledge of something, of how good the bicycle is, how people learn about that."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "So I've used C++, now this is not going to be a trash talking session about C++, but I used C++ for a really long time."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "You can go there if you want, I have the scars."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "I feel like I spent many years without realizing like there's languages that could, for my particular lifestyle, brain style, thinking style, there's languages that could make me a lot more productive in the debugging stage, in just the development stage and thinking like the bicycle for the mind that I can fit more stuff into my... Python's a great example of that, right?"}, {"time": 2169, "text": "I mean, a machine learning framework in Python is a great example of that."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "It's just very high abstraction level."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And so you can be thinking about things on a like very high level algorithmic level instead of thinking about, okay, well, am I copying this tensor to a GPU or not, right?"}, {"time": 2183, "text": "It's not what you want to be thinking about."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "And as I was telling you, I mean, I guess the question I had is, how does a person like me or in general people discover more productive languages?"}, {"time": 2196, "text": "Like how I was, as I've been telling you offline, I've been looking for like a project to work on in Swift so I can really try it out."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "I mean, my intuition was like doing a hello world is not going to get me there to get me to experience the power of language."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "You need a few weeks to change your metabolism."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "Exactly, beautifully put."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "That's one of the problems with people with diets, like I'm actually currently, to go in parallel, but in a small tangent is I've been recently eating only meat, okay?"}, {"time": 2230, "text": "And okay, so most people are like, they think that's horribly unhealthy or whatever, you have like a million, whatever the science is, it just doesn't sound right."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "Well, so back when I was in college, we did the Atkins diet, that was a thing."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "Similar, but you have to always give these things a chance."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "I mean, with dieting, I was not dieting, but it's just the things that you like."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "If I eat, personally, if I eat meat, just everything, I can be super focused or more focused than usual."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "I just feel great."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "I mean, I've been running a lot, doing pushups and pull ups and so on."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "I mean, Python is similar in that sense for me."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "Where are you going with this?"}, {"time": 2273, "text": "I mean, literally, I just felt I had like a stupid smile on my face when I first started using Python."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "I could code up really quick things."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "Like I would see the world, I would be empowered to write a script to do some basic data processing, to rename files on my computer."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "Like Perl didn't do that for me, a little bit."}, {"time": 2299, "text": "And again, none of these are about which is best or something like that, but there's definitely better and worse here."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "But it clicks, right?"}, {"time": 2307, "text": "If you look at Perl, for example, you get bogged down in scalars versus arrays versus hashes versus type globs and like all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "And Python's like, yeah, let's not do this."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "And some of it is debugging."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "Like everyone has different priorities."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "But for me, it's, can I create systems for myself that empower me to debug quickly?"}, {"time": 2327, "text": "Like I've always been a big fan, even just crude like asserts, like always stating things that should be true, which in Python, I found in myself doing more because of type, all these kinds of stuff."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "Well, you could think of types in a programming language as being kind of assert."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "They could check the compile time, right?"}, {"time": 2348, "text": "So how do you learn a new thing?"}, {"time": 2350, "text": "Well, so this, or how do people learn new things, right?"}, {"time": 2355, "text": "People don't like to change."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "People generally don't like change around them either."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "And so we're all very slow to adapt and change."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "And usually there's a catalyst that's required to force yourself over this."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "So for learning a programming language, it really comes down to finding an excuse, like build a thing that the language is actually good for, that the ecosystem's ready for."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "And so if you were to write an iOS app, for example, that'd be the easy case."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "Obviously you would use Swift for that, right?"}, {"time": 2386, "text": "There are other... Android."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "So Swift runs on Android."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "Oh, does it?"}, {"time": 2392, "text": "Yeah, Swift runs in lots of places."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "Okay, so Swift is built on top of LLVM."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "LLVM runs everywhere."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "LLVM, for example, builds the Android kernel."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "I didn't realize this."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "Yeah, so Swift is very portable, runs on Windows."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "There's, it runs on lots of different things."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "And Swift, sorry to interrupt, Swift UI, and then there's a thing called UI Kit."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "So can I build an app with Swift?"}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Well, so that's the thing, is the ecosystem is what matters there."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "So Swift UI and UI Kit are Apple technologies."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "And so they happen to, like Swift UI happens to be written in Swift, but it's an Apple proprietary framework that Apple loves and wants to keep on its platform, which makes total sense."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "You go to Android and you don't have that library, right?"}, {"time": 2439, "text": "And so Android has a different ecosystem of things that hasn't been built out and doesn't work as well with Swift."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "And so you can totally use Swift to do like arithmetic and things like this, but building UI with Swift on Android is not a great experience right now."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "So if I wanted to learn Swift, what's the, I mean, the one practical different version of that is Swift for TensorFlow, for example."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "And one of the inspiring things for me with both TensorFlow and PyTorch is how quickly the community can like switch from different libraries, like you could see some of the communities switching to PyTorch now, but it's very easy to see."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "And then TensorFlow is really stepping up its game."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "And then there's no reason why, I think the way it works is basically it has to be one GitHub repo, like one paper steps up."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "It gets people excited."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "It gets people excited and they're like, ah, I have to learn this Swift for, what's Swift again?"}, {"time": 2499, "text": "And then they learn and they fall in love with it."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "I mean, that's what happened, PyTorch has it."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "There has to be a reason, a catalyst."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "And so, and there, I mean, people don't like change, but it turns out that once you've worked with one or two programming languages, the basics are pretty similar."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "And so one of the fun things about learning programming languages, even maybe Lisp, I don't know if you agree with this, is that when you start doing that, you start learning new things."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Cause you have a new way to do things and you're forced to do them."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "And that forces you to explore and it puts you in learning mode."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "And when you get in learning mode, your mind kind of opens a little bit and you can see things in a new way, even when you go back to the old place."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "Yeah, it's totally, well Lisp is functional."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "But yeah, I wish there was a kind of window, maybe you can tell me if there is, there you go."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "This is a question to ask, what is the most beautiful feature in a programming language?"}, {"time": 2550, "text": "Before I ask it, let me say like with Python, I remember I saw Lisp comprehensions."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "Was like, when I like really took it in."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "I don't know, I just loved it."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "It was like fun to do, like it was fun to do that kind of, something about it to be able to filter through a list and to create a new list all in a single line was elegant."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "I could all get into my head and it just made me fall in love with the language."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "So is there, let me ask you a question."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "Is there, what do you use the most beautiful feature in a programming languages that you've ever encountered in Swift maybe and then outside of Swift?"}, {"time": 2595, "text": "I think the thing that I like the most from a programming language."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "So I think the thing you have to think about with the programming language, again, what is the goal?"}, {"time": 2603, "text": "You're trying to get people to get things done quickly."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "And so you need libraries, you need high quality libraries and then you need a user base around them that can assemble them and do cool things with them, right?"}, {"time": 2615, "text": "And so to me, the question is what enables high quality libraries?"}, {"time": 2621, "text": "And there's a huge divide in the world between libraries who enable high quality libraries versus the ones that put special stuff in the language."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "So programming languages that enable high quality libraries?"}, {"time": 2637, "text": "So, and what I mean by that is expressive libraries that then feel like a natural integrated part of the language itself."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "So an example of this in Swift is that int and float and also array and string, things like this, these are all part of the library."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "Like int is not hard coded into Swift."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "And so what that means is that because int is just a library thing defined in the standard library, along with strings and arrays and all the other things that come with the standard library."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Well, hopefully you do like int, but anything that any language features that you needed to define int, you can also use in your own types."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "So if you wanted to find a quaternion or something like this, right?"}, {"time": 2681, "text": "Well, it doesn't come in the standard library."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "There's a very special set of people that care a lot about this, but those people are also important."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "It's not about classism, right?"}, {"time": 2691, "text": "It's not about the people who care about ints and floats are more important than the people who care about quaternions."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "And so to me, the beautiful things about programming languages is when you allow those communities to build high quality libraries, they feel native."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "They feel like they're built into the compiler without having to be."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "What does it mean for the int to be part of not hard coded in?"}, {"time": 2713, "text": "So is it like how, so what is an int?"}, {"time": 2718, "text": "Okay, int is just a integer."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "In this case, it's like a 64 bit integer or something like this."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "But so like the 64 bit is hard coded or no?"}, {"time": 2728, "text": "No, none of that's hard coded."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "So int, if you go look at how it's implemented, it's just a struct in Swift."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "And so it's a struct."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "And then how do you add two structs?"}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Well, you define plus."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "And so you can define plus on int."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Well, you can define plus on your thing too."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "You can define, int is an odd method or something like that on it."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "And so yeah, you can add methods on the things."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "So you can define operators, like how it behaves."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "That's just beautiful when there's something about the language which enables others to create libraries which are not hacky."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "Yeah, they feel native."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And so one of the best examples of this is Lisp, right?"}, {"time": 2770, "text": "Because in Lisp, like all the libraries are basically part of the language, right?"}, {"time": 2775, "text": "You write, turn, rewrite systems and things like this."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "Can you as a counter example provide what makes it difficult to write a library that's native?"}, {"time": 2783, "text": "Is it the Python C?"}, {"time": 2785, "text": "Well, so one example, I'll give you two examples."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "Java and C++, there's Java and C. They both allow you to define your own types, but int is hard code in the language."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "Okay, well, why?"}, {"time": 2799, "text": "Well, in Java, for example, coming back to this whole reference semantic value semantic thing, int gets passed around by value."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "But if you make like a pair or something like that, a complex number, right, it's a class in Java."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "And now it gets passed around by reference, by pointer."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "And so now you lose value semantics, right?"}, {"time": 2822, "text": "You lost math, okay."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "Well, that's not great, right?"}, {"time": 2826, "text": "If you can do something with int, why can't I do it with my type, right?"}, {"time": 2830, "text": "So that's the negative side of the thing I find beautiful is when you can solve that, when you can have full expressivity, where you as a user of the language have as much or almost as much power as the people who implemented all the standard built in stuff, because what that enables is that enables truly beautiful libraries."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "You know, it's kind of weird because I've gotten used to that."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "That's one, I guess, other aspect of program language design."}, {"time": 2859, "text": "You have to think, you know, the old first principles thinking, like, why are we doing it this way?"}, {"time": 2865, "text": "By the way, I mean, I remember, because I was thinking about the walrus operator and I'll ask you about it later, but it hit me that like the equal sign for assignment."}, {"time": 2878, "text": "Like, why are we using the equal sign for assignment?"}, {"time": 2880, "text": "It's wrong, yeah."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And that's not the only solution, right?"}, {"time": 2884, "text": "So if you look at Pascal, they use colon equals for assignment and equals for equality."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "And they use like less than greater than instead of the not equal thing."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "Like, there are other answers here."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "So, but like, and yeah, like I ask you all, but how do you then decide to break convention to say, you know what, everybody's doing it wrong."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "We're gonna do it right."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "So it's like an ROI, like return on investment trade off, right?"}, {"time": 2915, "text": "So if you do something weird, let's just say like not like colon equal instead of equal for assignment, that would be weird with today's aesthetic, right?"}, {"time": 2924, "text": "And so you'd say, cool, this is theoretically better, but is it better in which ways?"}, {"time": 2929, "text": "Like, what do I get out of that?"}, {"time": 2930, "text": "Do I define away class of bugs?"}, {"time": 2932, "text": "Well, one of the class of bugs that C has is that you can use like, you know, if X equals without equals equals X equals Y, right?"}, {"time": 2941, "text": "Well, turns out you can solve that problem in lots of ways."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "Clang, for example, GCC, all these compilers will detect that as a likely bug, produce a warning."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "I feel like they didn't."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "Oh, Clang does."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "GCC didn't."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "It's like one of the important things about programming language design is like, you're literally creating suffering in the world."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "Like, I feel like, I mean, one way to see it is the bicycle for the mind, but the other way is to like minimizing suffering."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "Well, you have to decide if it's worth it, right?"}, {"time": 2973, "text": "And so let's come back to that."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "But if you look at this, and again, this is where there's a lot of detail that goes into each of these things."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "Equal and C returns a value."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "Is it messed up?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "That allows you to say X equals Y equals Z, like that works in C. Yeah."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "You know, most people think it's messed up, I think."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "It is very, by messed up, what I mean is it is very rarely used for good, and it's often used for bugs."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Right, and so."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "That's a good definition of messed up, yeah."}, {"time": 3009, "text": "You could use, you know, in hindsight, this was not such a great idea, right?"}, {"time": 3014, "text": "One of the things with Swift that is really powerful and one of the reasons it's actually good versus it being full of good ideas is that when we launched Swift 1, we announced that it was public, people could use it, people could build apps, but it was gonna change and break, okay?"}, {"time": 3030, "text": "When Swift 2 came out, we said, hey, it's open source, and there's this open process which people can help evolve and direct the language."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "So the community at large, like Swift users, can now help shape the language as it is."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "And what happened as part of that process is a lot of really bad mistakes got taken out."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "So for example, Swift used to have the C style plus plus and minus minus operators."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "Like, what does it mean when you put it before versus after, right?"}, {"time": 3059, "text": "Well, that got cargo culted from C into Swift early on."}, {"time": 3062, "text": "What's cargo culted?"}, {"time": 3063, "text": "Cargo culted means brought forward without really considering it."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "This is maybe not the most PC term, but."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "You have to look it up in Urban Dictionary, yeah."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "Yeah, so it got pulled into C without, or it got pulled into Swift without very good consideration."}, {"time": 3080, "text": "And we went through this process, and one of the first things got ripped out was plus plus and minus minus, because they lead to confusion."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "They have very low value over saying x plus equals one, and x plus equals one is way more clear."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And so when you're optimizing for teachability and clarity and bugs and this multidimensional space that you're looking at, things like that really matter."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "And so being first principles on where you're coming from and what you're trying to achieve and being anchored on the objective is really important."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "Well, let me ask you about the most, sort of this podcast isn't about information, it's about drama."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "Let me talk to you about some drama."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "So you mentioned Pascal and colon equals, there's something that's called the Walrus operator."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "And Python in Python 3.8 added the Walrus operator."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "And the reason I think it's interesting is not just because of the feature, it has the same kind of expression feature you can mention to see that it returns the value of the assignment."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "And then maybe you can comment on that in general, but on the other side of it, it's also the thing that toppled the dictator."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "So it finally drove Guido to step down from BDFL, the toxicity of the community."}, {"time": 3162, "text": "So maybe what do you think about the Walrus operator in Python?"}, {"time": 3167, "text": "Is there an equivalent thing in Swift that really stress tested the community?"}, {"time": 3174, "text": "And then on the flip side, what do you think about Guido stepping down over it?"}, {"time": 3178, "text": "Yeah, well, if I look past the details of the Walrus operator, one of the things that makes it most polarizing is that it's syntactic sugar."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "What do you mean by syntactic sugar?"}, {"time": 3189, "text": "It means you can take something that already exists in the language and you can express it in a more concise way."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "So, okay, I'm going to play dollars advocate."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "So this is great."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "Is that a objective or subjective statement?"}, {"time": 3201, "text": "Like, can you argue that basically anything isn't syntactic sugar or not?"}, {"time": 3207, "text": "No, not everything is syntactic sugar."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "So for example, the type system, like can you have classes versus, like, do you have types or not, right?"}, {"time": 3217, "text": "So one type versus many types is not something that affects syntactic sugar."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "And so if you say, I want to have the ability to define types, I have to have all this like language mechanics to define classes."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "And oh, now I have to have inheritance."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "And I have like, I have all this stuff that's just making the language more complicated."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "That's not about sugaring it."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "Swift has the sugar."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "So like Swift has this thing called if let, and it has a lot of different types and it has various operators that are used to concisify specific use cases."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "So the problem with syntactic sugar, when you're talking about, hey, I have a thing that takes a lot to write and I have a new way to write it."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "You have this like horrible trade off, which becomes almost completely subjective, which is how often does this happen and does it matter?"}, {"time": 3266, "text": "And one of the things that is true about human psychology, particularly when you're talking about introducing a new thing is that people overestimate the burden of learning something."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "And so it looks foreign when you haven't gotten used to it."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "But if it was there from the beginning, of course it's just part of Python."}, {"time": 3282, "text": "Like unquestionably, like this is just the thing I know."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "And it's not a new thing that you're worried about learning."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "It's just part of the deal."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "Now with Guido, I don't know Guido well."}, {"time": 3295, "text": "Yeah, have you passed cross much?"}, {"time": 3296, "text": "Yeah, I've met him a couple of times, but I don't know Guido well."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "But the sense that I got out of that whole dynamic was that he had put the, not just the decision maker weight on his shoulders, but it was so tied to his personal identity that he took it personally and he felt the need and he kind of put himself in the situation of being the person, instead of building a base of support around him."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "I mean, this is probably not quite literally true, but by too much concentrated on him, right?"}, {"time": 3329, "text": "And that can wear you down."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "Well, yeah, particularly because people then say, Guido, you're a horrible person."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "I hate this thing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "And sure, it's like maybe 1% of the community that's doing that, but Python's got a big community."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "And 1% of millions of people is a lot of hate mail."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "And that just from human factor will just wear on you."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "Well, to clarify, it looked from just what I saw in the messaging for the, let's not look at the million Python users, but at the Python core developers, it feels like the majority, the big majority on a vote were opposed to it."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "Okay, I'm not that close to it, so I don't know."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "Okay, so the situation is like literally, yeah, I mean, the majority of the core developers are against it."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "Were opposed to it."}, {"time": 3374, "text": "So, and they weren't even like against it."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "It was, there was a few, well, they were against it, but the against it wasn't like, this is a bad idea."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "They were more like, we don't see why this is a good idea."}, {"time": 3391, "text": "And what that results in is there's a stalling feeling, like you just slow things down."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "Now, from my perspective, that you could argue this, and I think it's very interesting if we look at politics today and the way Congress works, it's slowed down everything."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "It's a dampener."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "Yeah, it's a dampener, but like, that's a dangerous thing too, because if it dampens things like, you know, if the dampening results."}, {"time": 3418, "text": "What are you talking about?"}, {"time": 3419, "text": "Like, it's a low pass filter, but if you need billions of dollars injected into the economy or trillions of dollars, then suddenly stuff happens, right?"}, {"time": 3429, "text": "So you're talking about."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "I'm not defending our political situation, just to be clear."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "But you're talking about like a global pandemic."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "I was hoping we could fix like the healthcare system and the education system, like, you know."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "I'm not a politics person."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "When it comes to languages, the community's kind of right in terms of, it's a very high burden to add something to a language."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "So as soon as you add something, you have a community of people building on it and you can't remove it, okay?"}, {"time": 3458, "text": "And if there's a community of people that feel really uncomfortable with it, then taking it slow, I think, is an important thing to do."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And there's no rush, particularly if it was something that's 25 years old and is very established."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "And, you know, it's not like coming into its own."}, {"time": 3474, "text": "What about features?"}, {"time": 3475, "text": "Well, so I think that the issue with Guido is that maybe this is a case where he realized it had outgrown him and it went from being the language."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "So Python, I mean, Guido's amazing, but Python isn't about Guido anymore."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "It's about the users."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "And to a certain extent, the users own it."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "And, you know, Guido spent years of his life, a significant fraction of his career on Python."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "And from his perspective, I imagine he's like, well, this is my thing."}, {"time": 3505, "text": "I should be able to do the thing I think is right."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "But you can also understand the users where they feel like, you know, this is my thing."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "I use this, like, and I don't know, it's a hard thing."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "But what, if we could talk about leadership in this, because it's so interesting to me."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "I'm gonna make, I'm gonna work."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Hopefully somebody makes it."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "If not, I'll make it a Walrus Operator shirt, because I think it represents, to me, maybe it's my Russian roots or something."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "But, you know, it's the burden of leadership."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "Like, I feel like to push back, I feel like progress can only, like most difficult decisions, just like you said, there'll be a lot of divisiveness over, especially in a passionate community."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "It just feels like leaders need to take those risky decisions that if you like listen, that with some nonzero probability, maybe even a high probability would be the wrong decision."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "But they have to use their gut and make that decision."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "Well, this is like one of the things where you see amazing founders."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "The founders understand exactly what's happened and how the company got there and are willing to say, we have been doing thing X the last 20 years, but today we're gonna do thing Y."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "And they make a major pivot for the whole company."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "The company lines up behind them, they move and it's the right thing."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "But then when the founder dies, the successor doesn't always feel that agency to be able to make those kinds of decisions."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "Even though they're a CEO, they could theoretically do whatever."}, {"time": 3602, "text": "There's two reasons for that, in my opinion, or in many cases, it's always different."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "But one of which is they weren't there for all the decisions that were made."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "And so they don't know the principles in which those decisions were made."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "And once the principles change, you should be obligated to change what you're doing and change direction, right?"}, {"time": 3622, "text": "And so if you don't know how you got to where you are, it just seems like gospel and you're not gonna question it."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "You may not understand that it really is the right thing to do, so you just may not see it."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "That's so brilliant."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "Like it's so much higher burden when as a leader you step into a thing that's already worked for a long time."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "Well, and if you change it and it doesn't work out, now you're the person who screwed it up."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "People always second guess it."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "And the second thing is that even if you decide to make a change, even if you're theoretically in charge, you're just a person that thinks they're in charge."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "Meanwhile, you have to motivate the troops."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "You have to explain it to them in terms they'll understand."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "You have to get them to buy into it and believe in it, because if they don't, then they're not gonna be able to make the turn even if you tell them their bonuses are gonna be curtailed."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "They're just not gonna like buy into it, you know?"}, {"time": 3670, "text": "And so there's only so much power you have as a leader, and you have to understand what those limitations are."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "Are you still BDFL?"}, {"time": 3678, "text": "You've been a BDFL of some stuff."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "You're very heavy on the B, the benevolent, benevolent dictator for life."}, {"time": 3687, "text": "I guess LLVM?"}, {"time": 3689, "text": "Yeah, so I still lead the LLVM world."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "I mean, what's the role of, so then on Swift you said that there's a group of people."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "Yeah, so if you contrast Python with Swift, right, one of the reasons, so everybody on the core team takes the role really seriously, and I think we all really care about where Swift goes, but you're almost delegating the final decision making to the wisdom of the group, and so it doesn't become personal."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "And also, when you're talking with the community, so yeah, some people are very annoyed as certain decisions get made."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "There's a certain faith in the process, because it's a very transparent process, and when a decision gets made, a full rationale is provided, things like this."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "These are almost defense mechanisms to help both guide future discussions and provide case law, kind of like Supreme Court does about this decision was made for this reason, and here's the rationale and what we want to see more of or less of."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "But it's also a way to provide a defense mechanism, so that when somebody's griping about it, they're not saying that person did the wrong thing."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "They're saying, well, this thing sucks, and later they move on and they get over it."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "Yeah, the analogy of the Supreme Court, I think, is really good."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "But then, okay, not to get personal on the SWIFT team, but it just seems like it's impossible for division not to emerge."}, {"time": 3772, "text": "Well, each of the humans on the SWIFT Core Team, for example, are different, and the membership of the SWIFT Core Team changes slowly over time, which is, I think, a healthy thing."}, {"time": 3782, "text": "And so each of these different humans have different opinions."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "Trust me, it's not a singular consciousness by any stretch of the imagination."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "You've got three major organizations, including Apple, Google, and SciFive, all kind of working together."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "And it's a small group of people, but you need high trust."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "You need, again, it comes back to the principles of what you're trying to achieve and understanding what you're optimizing for."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "And I think that starting with strong principles and working towards decisions is always a good way to both make wise decisions in general but then be able to communicate them to people so that they can buy into them."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "And that is hard."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "And so you mentioned LLVM."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "LLVM is gonna be 20 years old this December, so it's showing its own age."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "Do you have like a dragon cake plan?"}, {"time": 3833, "text": "No, I should definitely do that."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "Yeah, if we can have a pandemic cake."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "Pandemic cake."}, {"time": 3838, "text": "Everybody gets a slice of cake and it gets sent through email."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "But LLVM has had tons of its own challenges over time too, right?"}, {"time": 3849, "text": "And one of the challenges that the LLVM community has, in my opinion, is that it has a whole bunch of people that have been working on LLVM for 10 years, right?"}, {"time": 3859, "text": "Because this happens somehow."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "And LLVM has always been one way, but it needs to be a different way, right?"}, {"time": 3865, "text": "And they've worked on it for like 10 years."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "It's a long time to work on something."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "And you suddenly can't see the faults in the thing that you're working on."}, {"time": 3873, "text": "And LLVM has lots of problems and we need to address them and we need to make it better."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "And if we don't make it better, then somebody else will come up with a better idea, right?"}, {"time": 3880, "text": "And so it's just kind of of that age where the community is like in danger of getting too calcified."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "And so I'm happy to see new projects joining and new things mixing it up."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "Fortran is now a new thing in the LLVM community, which is hilarious and good."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "I've been trying to find, on a little tangent, find people who program in Cobalt or Fortran, Fortran especially, to talk to, they're hard to find."}, {"time": 3906, "text": "Yeah, look to the scientific community."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "They still use Fortran quite a bit."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "Well, interesting thing you kind of mentioned with LLVM, or just in general, that as something evolves, you're not able to see the faults."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "So do you fall in love with the thing over time?"}, {"time": 3923, "text": "Or do you start hating everything about the thing over time?"}, {"time": 3926, "text": "Well, so my personal folly is that I see, maybe not all, but many of the faults, and they grate on me, and I don't have time to go fix them."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "Yeah, and they get magnified over time."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "Well, and they may not get magnified, but they never get fixed."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "And it's like sand underneath, you know, it's just like grating against you."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "And it's like sand underneath your fingernails or something."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "It's just like, you know it's there, you can't get rid of it."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "And so the problem is that if other people don't see it, like I don't have time to go write the code and fix it anymore, but then people are resistant to change."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "And so you say, hey, we should go fix this thing."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "They're like, oh yeah, that sounds risky."}, {"time": 3965, "text": "It's like, well, is it the right thing or not?"}, {"time": 3967, "text": "Are the challenges the group dynamics, or is it also just technical?"}, {"time": 3971, "text": "I mean, some of these features like, I think as an observer, it's almost like a fan in the, you know, as a spectator of the whole thing, I don't often think about, you know, some things might actually be technically difficult to implement."}, {"time": 3987, "text": "An example of this is we built this new compiler framework called MLIR."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "MLIR is a whole new framework."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "It's not, many people think it's about machine learning."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "The ML stands for multi level because compiler people can't name things very well, I guess."}, {"time": 4002, "text": "Do we dig into what MLIR is?"}, {"time": 4005, "text": "Yeah, so when you look at compilers, compilers have historically been solutions for a given space."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "So LLVM is a, it's really good for dealing with CPUs, let's just say, at a high level."}, {"time": 4018, "text": "You look at Java, Java has a JVM."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "The JVM is very good for garbage collected languages that need dynamic compilation, and it's very optimized for a specific space."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "And so hotspot is one of the compilers that gets used in that space, and that compiler is really good at that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4034, "text": "Usually when you build these domain specific compilers, you end up building the whole thing from scratch for each domain."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "What's a domain?"}, {"time": 4043, "text": "So what's the scope of a domain?"}, {"time": 4046, "text": "Well, so here I would say, like, if you look at Swift, there's several different parts to the Swift compiler, one of which is covered by the LLVM part of it."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "There's also a high level piece that's specific to Swift, and there's a huge amount of redundancy between those two different infrastructures and a lot of re implemented stuff that is similar but different."}, {"time": 4068, "text": "What does LLVM define?"}, {"time": 4069, "text": "LLVM is effectively an infrastructure."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "So you can mix and match it in different ways."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "It's built out of libraries."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "You can use it for different things, but it's really good at CPUs and GPUs."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "CPUs and like the tip of the iceberg on GPUs."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "It's not really great at GPUs."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "But it turns out."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "A bunch of languages that."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "That then use it to talk to CPUs."}, {"time": 4091, "text": "And so it turns out there's a lot of hardware out there that is custom accelerators."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "So machine learning, for example."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "There are a lot of matrix multiply accelerators and things like this."}, {"time": 4100, "text": "There's a whole world of hardware synthesis."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "So we're using MLIR to build circuits."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "And so you're compiling for a domain of transistors."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "And so what MLIR does is it provides a tremendous amount of compiler infrastructure that allows you to build these domain specific compilers in a much faster way and have the result be good."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "If we're thinking about the future, now we're talking about like ASICs."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "So anything."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "So if we project into the future, it's very possible that the number of these kinds of ASICs, very specific infrastructure architecture things like multiplies exponentially."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "So that's MLIR."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "So what MLIR does is it allows you to build these compilers very efficiently."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "Right now, one of the things that coming back to the LLVM thing, and then we'll go to hardware, is LLVM is a specific compiler for a specific domain."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "MLIR is now this very general, very flexible thing that can solve lots of different kinds of problems."}, {"time": 4169, "text": "So LLVM is a subset of what MLIR does."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "So MLIR is, I mean, it's an ambitious project then."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "Yeah, it's a very ambitious project, yeah."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And so to make it even more confusing, MLIR has joined the LLVM Umbrella Project."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "So it's part of the LLVM family."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "But where this comes full circle is now folks that work on the LLVM part, the classic part that's 20 years old, aren't aware of all the cool new things that have been done in the new thing, that MLIR was built by me and many other people that knew a lot about LLVM, and so we fixed a lot of the mistakes that lived in LLVM."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "And so now you have this community dynamic where it's like, well, there's this new thing, but it's not familiar, nobody knows it, it feels like it's new, and so let's not trust it."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "And so it's just really interesting to see the cultural social dynamic that comes out of that."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "And I think it's super healthy because we're seeing the ideas percolate and we're seeing the technology diffusion happen as people get more comfortable with it, they start to understand things in their own terms."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "And this just gets to the, it takes a while for ideas to propagate, even though they may be very different than what people are used to."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "So maybe let's talk about that a little bit, the world of Asics."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "Actually, you have a new role at SciFive."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "What's that place about?"}, {"time": 4247, "text": "What is the vision for their vision for, I would say, the future of computer?"}, {"time": 4252, "text": "Yeah, so I lead the engineering and product teams at SciFive."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "SciFive is a company who was founded with this architecture called RISC5."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "RISC5 is a new instruction set."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "Instruction sets are the things inside of your computer that tell it how to run things."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "X86 from Intel and ARM from the ARM company and things like this are other instruction sets."}, {"time": 4273, "text": "I've talked to, sorry to interrupt, I've talked to Dave Patterson, who's super excited about RISC5."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "Dave is awesome."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "Yeah, he's brilliant, yeah."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "The RISC5 is distinguished by not being proprietary."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "And so X86 can only be made by Intel and AMD."}, {"time": 4288, "text": "ARM can only be made by ARM."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "They sell licenses to build ARM chips to other companies, things like this."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "MIPS is another instruction set that is owned by the MIPS company, now Wave."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "And then it gets licensed out, things like that."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "And so RISC5 is an open standard that anybody can build chips for."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "And so SciFive was founded by three of the founders of RISC5 that designed and built it in Berkeley, working with Dave."}, {"time": 4312, "text": "And so that was the genesis of the company."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "SciFive today has some of the world's best RISC5 cores and we're selling them and that's really great."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "They're going to tons of products, it's very exciting."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "So they're taking this thing that's open source and just trying to be or are the best in the world at building these things."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "Yeah, so here it's the specifications open source."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "It's like saying TCP IP is an open standard or C is an open standard, but then you have to build an implementation of the standard."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "And so SciFive, on the one hand, pushes forward and defined and pushes forward the standard."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "On the other hand, we have implementations that are best in class for different points in the space, depending on if you want a really tiny CPU or if you want a really big, beefy one that is faster, but it uses more area and things like this."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "What about the actual manufacturer chips?"}, {"time": 4361, "text": "So like, where does that all fit?"}, {"time": 4363, "text": "I'm going to ask a bunch of dumb questions."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "That's okay, this is how we learn, right?"}, {"time": 4368, "text": "And so the way this works is that there's generally a separation of the people who designed the circuits and then people who manufacture them."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "And so you'll hear about fabs like TSMC and Samsung and things like this that actually produce the chips, but they take a design coming in and that design specifies how the, you turn code for the chip into little rectangles that then use photolithography to make mask sets and then burn transistors onto a chip or onto a, onto silicon rather."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "So, and we're talking about mass manufacturing, so."}, {"time": 4408, "text": "Yeah, they're talking about making hundreds of millions of parts and things like that, yeah."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "And so the fab handles the volume production, things like that."}, {"time": 4414, "text": "But when you look at this problem, the interesting thing about the space when you look at it is that these, the steps that you go from designing a chip and writing the quote unquote code for it and things like Verilog and languages like that, down to what you hand off to the fab is a really well studied, really old problem, okay?"}, {"time": 4436, "text": "Tons of people have worked on it."}, {"time": 4437, "text": "Lots of smart people have built systems and tools."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "These tools then have generally gone through acquisitions."}, {"time": 4443, "text": "And so they've ended up at three different major companies that build and sell these tools."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "They're called the EDA tools like for electronic design automation."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "The problem with this is you have huge amounts of fragmentation, you have loose standards and the tools don't really work together."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "So you have tons of duct tape and you have tons of loss productivity."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "Now these are, these are tools for designing."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "So the RISC 5 is a instruction."}, {"time": 4470, "text": "Like what is RISC 5?"}, {"time": 4472, "text": "Like how deep does it go?"}, {"time": 4473, "text": "How much does it touch the hardware?"}, {"time": 4475, "text": "How much does it define how much of the hardware is?"}, {"time": 4478, "text": "Yeah, so RISC 5 is all about given a CPU."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "So the processor and your computer, how does the compiler like Swift compiler, the C compiler, things like this, how does it make it work?"}, {"time": 4490, "text": "So it's, what is the assembly code?"}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And so you write RISC 5 assembly instead of XA6 assembly, for example."}, {"time": 4497, "text": "But it's a set of instructions as opposed to instructions."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "Why do you say it tells you how the compiler works?"}, {"time": 4503, "text": "Sorry, it's what the compiler talks to."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "And then the tooling you mentioned that the disparate tools are for what?"}, {"time": 4510, "text": "For when you're building a specific chip."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "So RISC 5."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "In hardware."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "In hardware, yeah."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "So RISC 5, you can buy a RISC 5 core from SciFive and say, hey, I want to have a certain number of, run a certain number of gigahertz."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "I want it to be this big."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "I want it to be, have these features."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "I want to have like, I want floating point or not, for example."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "And then what you get is you get a description of a CPU with those characteristics."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "Now, if you want to make a chip, you want to build like an iPhone chip or something like that, right?"}, {"time": 4541, "text": "You have to take both the CPU, but then you have to talk to memory."}, {"time": 4544, "text": "You have to have timers, IOs, a GPU, other components."}, {"time": 4549, "text": "And so you need to pull all those things together into what's called an ASIC, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "So a custom chip."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "And then you take that design and then you have to transform it into something that the fabs, like TSMC, for example, know how to take to production."}, {"time": 4567, "text": "So, but yeah, okay."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "And so that process, I will, I can't help but see it as, is a big compiler."}, {"time": 4576, "text": "It's a whole bunch of compilers written without thinking about it through that lens."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "Isn't the universe a compiler?"}, {"time": 4583, "text": "Yeah, compilers do two things."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "They represent things and transform them."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "And so there's a lot of things that end up being compilers."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "But this is a space where we're talking about design and usability and the way you think about things, the way things compose correctly, it matters a lot."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "And so SciFi is investing a lot into that space."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "And we think that there's a lot of benefit that can be made by allowing people to design chips faster, get them to market quicker and scale out because at the alleged end of Moore's law, you've got this problem of you're not getting free performance just by waiting another year for a faster CPU."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "And so you have to find performance in other ways."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "And one of the ways to do that is with custom accelerators and other things and hardware."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "And so, well, we'll talk a little more about ASICs, but do you see that a lot of people, a lot of companies will try to have different sets of requirements that this whole process to go for?"}, {"time": 4648, "text": "So like almost different car companies might use different and like different PC manufacturers."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "So is RISC 5 in this whole process, is it potentially the future of all computing devices?"}, {"time": 4664, "text": "Yeah, I think that, so if you look at RISC 5 and step back from the Silicon side of things, RISC 5 is an open standard."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "And one of the things that has happened over the course of decades, if you look over the long arc of computing, somehow became decades old."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "Is that you have companies that come and go and you have instruction sets that come and go."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "Like one example of this out of many is Sun with Spark."}, {"time": 4689, "text": "Yeah, it's on one way."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "Spark still lives on at Fujitsu, but we have HP had this instruction set called PA RISC."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "So PA RISC was this big server business and had tons of customers."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "They decided to move to this architecture called Itanium from Intel."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "This didn't work out so well."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "Right, and so you have this issue of you're making many billion dollar investments on instruction sets that are owned by a company."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "And even companies as big as Intel don't always execute as well as they could."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "They even have their own issues."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "HP, for example, decided that it wasn't in their best interest to continue investing in the space because it was very expensive."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "And so they make technology decisions or they make their own business decisions."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "And this means that as a customer, what do you do?"}, {"time": 4737, "text": "You've sunk all this time, all this engineering, all this software work, all these, you've built other products around them and now you're stuck, right?"}, {"time": 4745, "text": "What RISC 5 does is provide you more optionality in the space because if you buy an implementation of RISC 5 from SciFive, and you should, they're the best ones."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "But if something bad happens to SciFive in 20 years, right?"}, {"time": 4759, "text": "Well, great, you can turn around and buy a RISC 5 core from somebody else."}, {"time": 4763, "text": "And there's an ecosystem of people that are all making different RISC 5 cores with different trade offs, which means that if you have more than one requirement, if you have a family of products, you can probably find something in the RISC 5 space that fits your needs."}, {"time": 4776, "text": "Whereas with, if you're talking about XA6, for example, it's Intel's only gonna bother to make certain classes of devices, right?"}, {"time": 4785, "text": "I see, so maybe a weird question, but like if SciFive is like infinitely successful in the next 20, 30 years, what does the world look like?"}, {"time": 4798, "text": "So like how does the world of computing change?"}, {"time": 4801, "text": "So too much diversity in hardware instruction sets, I think is bad."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "Like we have a lot of people that are using lots of different instruction sets, particularly in the embedded, the like very tiny microcontroller space, the thing in your toaster that are just weird and different for historical reasons."}, {"time": 4821, "text": "And so the compilers and the tool chains and the languages on top of them aren't there."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "And so the developers for that software have to use really weird tools because the ecosystem that supports is not big enough."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "So I expect that will change, right?"}, {"time": 4835, "text": "People will have better tools and better languages, better features everywhere that then can serve as many different points in the space."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "And I think RISC5 will progressively eat more of the ecosystem because it can scale up, it can scale down, sideways, left, right."}, {"time": 4851, "text": "It's very flexible and very well considered and well designed instruction set."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "I think when you look at SciFive tackling silicon and how people build chips, which is a very different space, that's where you say, I think we'll see a lot more custom chips."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "And that means that you get much more battery life, you get better tuned solutions for your IoT thingy."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "You get people that move faster, you get the ability to have faster time to market, for example."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "So how many custom..."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "So first of all, on the IoT side of things, do you see the number of smart toasters increasing exponentially?"}, {"time": 4890, "text": "So, and if you do, like how much customization per toaster is there?"}, {"time": 4898, "text": "Do all toasters in the world run the same silicon, like the same design, or is it different companies have different design?"}, {"time": 4906, "text": "Like how much customization is possible here?"}, {"time": 4909, "text": "Well, a lot of it comes down to cost, right?"}, {"time": 4912, "text": "And so the way that chips work is you end up paying by the... One of the factors is the size of the chip."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "And so what ends up happening just from an economic perspective is there's only so many chips that get made in a year of a given design."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "And so often what customers end up having to do is they end up having to pick up a chip that exists that was built for somebody else so that they can then ship their product."}, {"time": 4936, "text": "And the reason for that is they don't have the volume of the iPhone."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "They can't afford to build a custom chip."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "However, what that means is they're now buying an off the shelf chip that isn't really good, isn't a perfect fit for their needs."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "And so they're paying a lot of money for it because they're buying silicon that they're not using."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "Well, if you now reduce the cost of designing the chip, now you get a lot more chips."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "And the more you reduce it, the easier it is to design chips."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "The more the world keeps evolving and we get more AI accelerators, we get more other things, we get more standards to talk to, we get 6G, right?"}, {"time": 4970, "text": "You get changes in the world that you wanna be able to talk to these different things."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "There's more diversity in the cross product of features that people want."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "And that drives differentiated chips in another direction."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "And so nobody really knows what the future looks like, but I think that there's a lot of silicon in the future."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "Speaking of the future, you said Moore's law allegedly is dead."}, {"time": 4993, "text": "So do you agree with Dave Patterson and many folks that Moore's law is dead?"}, {"time": 5002, "text": "Or do you agree with Jim Keller, who's standing at the helm of the pirate ship saying it's still alive?"}, {"time": 5012, "text": "Well, so I agree with what they're saying and different people are interpreting the end of Moore's law in different ways."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "So Jim would say, there's another thousand X left in physics and we can continue to squeeze the stone and make it faster and smaller and smaller geometries and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "So Jim is absolutely right that there's a ton of progress left and we're not at the limit of physics yet."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "That's not really what Moore's law is though."}, {"time": 5044, "text": "If you look at what Moore's law is, is that it's a very simple evaluation of, okay, well you look at the cost per, I think it was cost per area and the most economic point in that space."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "And if you go look at the now quite old paper that describes this, Moore's law has a specific economic aspect to it and I think this is something that Dave and others often point out."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "And so on a technicality, that's right."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "I look at it from, so I can acknowledge both of those viewpoints."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "They're both right."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "I'll give you a third wrong viewpoint that may be right in its own way, which is single threaded performance doesn't improve like it used to."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "And it used to be back when you got a, you know, a Pentium 66 or something and the year before you had a Pentium 33 and now it's twice as fast, right?"}, {"time": 5096, "text": "Well, it was twice as fast at doing exactly the same thing."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "Okay, like literally the same program ran twice as fast."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "You just wrote a check and waited a year, year and a half."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "Well, so that's what a lot of people think about Moore's law and I think that is dead."}, {"time": 5111, "text": "And so what we're seeing instead is we're pushing, we're pushing people to write software in different ways."}, {"time": 5117, "text": "And so we're pushing people to write CUDA so they can get GPU compute and the thousands of cores on GPU."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "We're talking about C programmers having to use P threads because they now have, you know, a hundred threads or 50 cores in a machine or something like that."}, {"time": 5131, "text": "You're now talking about machine learning accelerators that are now domain specific."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "And when you look at these kinds of use cases, you can still get performance and Jim will come up with cool things that utilize the silicon in new ways for sure, but you're also gonna change the programming model."}, {"time": 5149, "text": "And now when you start talking about changing the programming model, that's when you come back to languages and things like this too, because often what you see is like you take the C programming language, right?"}, {"time": 5159, "text": "The C programming language is designed for CPUs."}, {"time": 5163, "text": "And so if you want to talk to a GPU, now you're talking to its cousin CUDA, okay?"}, {"time": 5168, "text": "CUDA is a different thing with a different set of tools, a different world, a different way of thinking."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And we don't have one world that scales."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "And I think that we can get there."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "We can have one world that scales in a much better way."}, {"time": 5181, "text": "And a small tangent then, I think most programming languages are designed for CPUs, for single core, even just in their spirit, even if they allow for parallelization."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "So what does it look like for a programming language to have parallelization or massive parallelization as it's like first principle?"}, {"time": 5201, "text": "So the canonical example of this is the hardware design world."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "So Verilog, VHDL, these kinds of languages, they're what's called a high level synthesis language."}, {"time": 5213, "text": "This is the thing people design chips in."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "And when you're designing a chip, it's kind of like a brain where you have infinite parallelism."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "Like you're like laying down transistors."}, {"time": 5225, "text": "Transistors are always running, okay?"}, {"time": 5228, "text": "And so you're not saying run this transistor, then this transistor, then this transistor."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "It's like your brain, like your neurons are always just doing something."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "They're not clocked, right?"}, {"time": 5236, "text": "They're just doing their thing."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "And so when you design a chip or when you design a CPU, when you design a GPU, when you design, when you're laying down the transistors, similarly, you're talking about, well, okay, well, how do these things communicate?"}, {"time": 5251, "text": "And so these languages exist."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "Verilog is a kind of mixed example of that."}, {"time": 5256, "text": "None of these languages are really great."}, {"time": 5257, "text": "You have a very low level, yeah."}, {"time": 5259, "text": "Yeah, they're very low level and abstraction is necessary here."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "And there's different approaches with that."}, {"time": 5264, "text": "And it's itself a very complicated world, but it's implicitly parallel."}, {"time": 5270, "text": "And so having that as the domain that you program towards makes it so that by default, you get parallel systems."}, {"time": 5279, "text": "If you look at CUDA, CUDA is a point halfway in the space where in CUDA, when you write a CUDA kernel for your GPU, it feels like you're writing a scalar program."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "So you're like, you have ifs, you have for loops, stuff like this, you're just writing normal code."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "But what happens outside of that in your driver is that it actually is running you on like a thousand things at once, right?"}, {"time": 5298, "text": "And so it's parallel, but it has pulled it out of the programming model."}, {"time": 5303, "text": "And so now you as a programmer are working in a simpler world and it's solved that for you, right?"}, {"time": 5311, "text": "How do you take the language like Swift?"}, {"time": 5316, "text": "If we think about GPUs, but also ASICs, maybe if we can dance back and forth between hardware and software."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "How do you design for these features to be able to program and get a first class citizen to be able to do like Swift for TensorFlow to be able to do machine learning on current hardware, but also future hardware like TPUs and all kinds of ASICs that I'm sure will be popping up more and more."}, {"time": 5342, "text": "Yeah, well, so a lot of this comes down to this whole idea of having the nuts and bolts underneath the covers that work really well."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "So you need, if you're talking to TPUs, you need MLIR or XLA or one of these compilers that talks to TPUs to build on top of, okay?"}, {"time": 5357, "text": "And if you're talking to circuits, you need to figure out how to lay down the transistors and how to organize it and how to set up clocking and like all the domain problems that you get with circuits."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "Then you have to decide how to explain it to a human."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "What is ZY, right?"}, {"time": 5371, "text": "And if you do it right, that's a library problem, not a language problem."}, {"time": 5376, "text": "And that works if you have a library or a language which allows your library to write things that feel native in the language by implementing libraries, because then you can innovate in programming models without having to change your syntax again."}, {"time": 5391, "text": "Like you have to invent new code formatting tools and like all the other things that languages come with."}, {"time": 5397, "text": "And this gets really interesting."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "And so if you look at the space, the interesting thing once you separate out syntax becomes what is that programming model?"}, {"time": 5407, "text": "And so do you want the CUDA style?"}, {"time": 5410, "text": "I write one program and it runs many places."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "Do you want the implicitly parallel model?"}, {"time": 5416, "text": "How do you reason about that?"}, {"time": 5417, "text": "How do you give developers, chip architects, the ability to express their intent?"}, {"time": 5424, "text": "And that comes into this whole design question of how do you detect bugs quickly?"}, {"time": 5429, "text": "So you don't have to tape out a chip to find out it's wrong, ideally, right?"}, {"time": 5432, "text": "How do you, and this is a spectrum, how do you make it so that people feel productive?"}, {"time": 5438, "text": "So their turnaround time is very quick."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "All these things are really hard problems."}, {"time": 5442, "text": "And in this world, I think that not a lot of effort has been put into that design problem and thinking about the layering in other pieces."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "Well, you've, on the topic of concurrency, you've written the Swift concurrency manifest."}, {"time": 5455, "text": "I think it's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "Anything that has the word manifest on it is very interesting."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "Can you summarize the key ideas of each of the five parts you've written about?"}, {"time": 5467, "text": "So what is a manifesto?"}, {"time": 5469, "text": "How about, we start there."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "So in the Swift community, we have this problem, which is on the one hand, you wanna have relatively small proposals that you can kind of fit in your head, you can understand the details at a very fine grain level that move the world forward."}, {"time": 5486, "text": "But then you also have these big arcs, okay?"}, {"time": 5488, "text": "And often when you're working on something that is a big arc, but you're tackling it in small pieces, you have this question of, how do I know I'm not doing a random walk?"}, {"time": 5497, "text": "Where are we going?"}, {"time": 5498, "text": "How does this add up?"}, {"time": 5499, "text": "Furthermore, when you start the first small step, what terminology do you use?"}, {"time": 5506, "text": "What is better and worse in the space?"}, {"time": 5508, "text": "What are we trying to achieve?"}, {"time": 5510, "text": "And so what a manifesto in the Swift community does is it starts to say, hey, well, let's step back from the details of everything."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "Let's paint a broad picture to talk about what we're trying to achieve."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "Let's give an example design point."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "Let's try to paint the big picture so that then we can zero in on the individual steps and make sure that we're making good progress."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "And so the Swift concurrency manifesto is something I wrote three years ago."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "It's been a while, maybe more."}, {"time": 5536, "text": "Trying to do that for Swift and concurrency."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "It starts with some fairly simple things like making the observation that when you have multiple different computers and multiple different threads that are communicating, it's best for them to be asynchronous."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "And so you need things to be able to run separately and then communicate with each other."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "And this means asynchrony."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "And this means that you need a way to modeling asynchronous communication."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "Many languages have features like this."}, {"time": 5563, "text": "Async await is a popular one."}, {"time": 5565, "text": "And so that's what I think is very likely in Swift."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "But as you start building this tower of abstractions, it's not just about how do you write this, you then reach into the how do you get memory safety because you want correctness, you want debuggability and sanity for developers."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "And how do you get that memory safety into the language?"}, {"time": 5586, "text": "So if you take a language like Go or C or any of these languages, you get what's called a race condition when two different threads or Go routines or whatever touch the same point in memory, right?"}, {"time": 5597, "text": "This is a huge like maddening problem to debug because it's not reproducible generally."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "And so there's tools, there's a whole ecosystem of solutions that built up around this, but it's a huge problem when you're writing concurrent code."}, {"time": 5611, "text": "And so with Swift, this whole value semantics thing is really powerful there because it turns out that math and copies actually work even in concurrent worlds."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "And so you get a lot of safety just out of the box, but there are also some hard problems."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "And it talks about some of that."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "When you start building up to the next level up and you start talking beyond memory safety, you have to talk about what is the programmer model?"}, {"time": 5633, "text": "How does a human think about this?"}, {"time": 5634, "text": "So a developer that's trying to build a program think about this, and it proposes a really old model with a new spin called Actors."}, {"time": 5642, "text": "Actors are about saying, we have islands of single threadedness logically."}, {"time": 5648, "text": "So you write something that feels like it's one program running in a unit, and then it communicates asynchronously with other things."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "And so making that expressive and natural feel good be the first thing you reach for and being safe by default is a big part of the design of that proposal."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "When you start going beyond that, now you start to say, cool, well, these things that communicate asynchronously, they don't have to share memory."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "Well, if they don't have to share memory and they're sending messages to each other, why do they have to be in the same process?"}, {"time": 5678, "text": "These things should be able to be in different processes on your machine."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "And why just processes?"}, {"time": 5683, "text": "Well, why not different machines?"}, {"time": 5684, "text": "And so now you have a very nice gradual transition towards distributed programming."}, {"time": 5689, "text": "And of course, when you start talking about the big future, the manifesto doesn't go into it, but accelerators are things you talk to asynchronously by sending messages to them."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "And how do you program those?"}, {"time": 5703, "text": "Well, that gets very interesting."}, {"time": 5705, "text": "That's not in the proposal."}, {"time": 5707, "text": "And how much do you wanna make that explicit like the control of that whole process explicit to the program?"}, {"time": 5716, "text": "So when you're designing any of these kinds of features or language features or even libraries, you have this really hard trade off you have to make, which is how much is it magic or how much is it in the human's control?"}, {"time": 5729, "text": "How much can they predict and control it?"}, {"time": 5732, "text": "What do you do when the default case is the wrong case?"}, {"time": 5737, "text": "And so when you're designing a system, and so when you're designing a system, I won't name names, but there are systems where it's really easy to get started and then you jump."}, {"time": 5752, "text": "So let's pick like logo."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "Okay, so something like this."}, {"time": 5755, "text": "So it's really easy to get started."}, {"time": 5757, "text": "It's really designed for teaching kids, but as you get into it, you hit a ceiling and then you can't go any higher."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "And then what do you do?"}, {"time": 5764, "text": "Well, you have to go switch to a different world and rewrite all your code."}, {"time": 5767, "text": "And this logo is a silly example here."}, {"time": 5769, "text": "This exists in many other languages."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "With Python, you would say like concurrency, right?"}, {"time": 5775, "text": "So Python has the global interpreter block."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "So threading is challenging in Python."}, {"time": 5779, "text": "And so if you start writing a large scale application in Python, and then suddenly you need concurrency, you're kind of stuck with a series of bad trade offs, right?"}, {"time": 5790, "text": "There's other ways to go where you say like, foist all the complexity on the user all at once, right?"}, {"time": 5797, "text": "And that's also bad in a different way."}, {"time": 5798, "text": "And so what I prefer is building a simple model that you can explain that then has an escape hatch."}, {"time": 5806, "text": "So you get in, you have guardrails, memory safety works like this in Swift, where you can start with, like by default, if you use all the standard things, it's memory safe, you're not gonna shoot your foot off."}, {"time": 5818, "text": "But if you wanna get a C level pointer to something, you can explicitly do that."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "But by default, there's guardrails."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "There's guardrails."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "Okay, so but like, whose job is it to figure out which part of the code is parallelizable?"}, {"time": 5837, "text": "So in the case of the proposal, it is the human's job."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "So they decide how to architect their application."}, {"time": 5844, "text": "And then the runtime in the compiler is very predictable."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "And so this is in contrast to like, there's a long body of work, including on Fortran for auto parallelizing compilers."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "And this is an example of a bad thing in my, so as a compiler person, I can drag on compiler people."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "Often compiler people will say, cool, since I can't change the code, I'm gonna write my compiler that then takes this unmodified code and makes go way faster on this machine."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "Okay, application, and so it does pattern matching."}, {"time": 5875, "text": "It does like really deep analysis."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "Compiler people are really smart."}, {"time": 5878, "text": "And so they like wanna like do something really clever and tricky."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "And you get like 10X speed up by taking like an array of structures and turn it into a structure of arrays or something, because it's so much better for memory."}, {"time": 5889, "text": "Like there's bodies, like tons of tricks."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "They love optimization."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "Yeah, you love optimization."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "Everyone loves optimization."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "Everyone loves it."}, {"time": 5896, "text": "Well, and it's this promise of build with my compiler and your thing goes fast, right?"}, {"time": 5900, "text": "But here's the problem, Lex, you write a program, you run it with my compiler, it goes fast."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "You're very happy."}, {"time": 5907, "text": "Wow, it's so much faster than the other compiler."}, {"time": 5909, "text": "Then you go and you add a feature to your program or you refactor some code."}, {"time": 5912, "text": "And suddenly you got a 10X loss in performance."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "What just happened there?"}, {"time": 5917, "text": "What just happened there is the heuristic, the pattern matching, the compiler, whatever analysis it was doing just got defeated because you didn't inline a function or something, right?"}, {"time": 5928, "text": "As a user, you don't know, you don't wanna know."}, {"time": 5930, "text": "That was the whole point."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "You don't wanna know how the compiler works."}, {"time": 5932, "text": "You don't wanna know how the memory hierarchy works."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "You don't wanna know how it got parallelized across all these things."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "You wanted that abstracted away from you, but then the magic is lost as soon as you did something and you fall off a performance cliff."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "And now you're in this funny position where what do I do?"}, {"time": 5948, "text": "I don't change my code."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "I don't fix that bug."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "It costs 10X performance."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "Now what do I do?"}, {"time": 5953, "text": "Well, this is the problem with unpredictable performance."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "If you care about performance, predictability is a very important thing."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "And so what the proposal does is it provides architectural patterns for being able to lay out your code, gives you full control over that, makes it really simple so you can explain it."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "And then if you wanna scale out in different ways, you have full control over that."}, {"time": 5976, "text": "So in your sense, the intuition is for a compiler, it's too hard to do automated parallelization."}, {"time": 5983, "text": "Cause the compilers do stuff automatically that's incredibly impressive for other things, but for parallelization, we're not close to there."}, {"time": 5994, "text": "Well, it depends on the programming model."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "So there's many different kinds of compilers."}, {"time": 5998, "text": "And so if you talk about like a C compiler or Swift compiler or something like that, where you're writing imperative code, parallelizing that and reasoning about all the pointers and stuff like that is a very difficult problem."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "Now, if you switch domains, so there's this cool thing called machine learning, right?"}, {"time": 6015, "text": "So machine learning nerds among other endearing things like solving cat detectors and other things like that have done this amazing breakthrough of producing a programming model, operations that you compose together that has raised levels of abstraction high enough that suddenly you can have auto parallelizing compilers."}, {"time": 6036, "text": "You can write a model using a TensorFlow and have it run on 1024 nodes of a TPU."}, {"time": 6044, "text": "I didn't even think about like, cause there's so much flexibility in the design of architectures that ultimately boil down to a graph that's parallelized for you."}, {"time": 6054, "text": "And if you think about it, that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "That's pretty cool, yeah."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "And you think about batching, for example, as a way of being able to exploit more parallelism."}, {"time": 6062, "text": "Like that's a very simple thing that now is very powerful."}, {"time": 6065, "text": "That didn't come out of the programming language nerds, those people, like that came out of people that are just looking to solve a problem and use a few GPUs and organically developed by the community of people focusing on machine learning."}, {"time": 6076, "text": "And it's an incredibly powerful abstraction layer that enables the compiler people to go and exploit that."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "And now you can drive supercomputers from Python."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "Well, that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "So just to pause on that, cause I'm not sufficiently low level, I forget to admire the beauty and power of that, but maybe just to linger on it, like what does it take to run a neural network fast?"}, {"time": 6102, "text": "Like how hard is that compilation?"}, {"time": 6105, "text": "So we just skipped, you said like, it's amazing that that's a thing, but yeah, how hard is that of a thing?"}, {"time": 6111, "text":

"text": "Is it the compiler nerds working on that or is it a whole new group of people?"}, {"time": 6124, "text": "Well, it's a full stack problem, including compiler people, including APIs, so like Keras and the module API and PyTorch and Jax."}, {"time": 6134, "text": "And there's a bunch of people pushing on all the different parts of these things, because when you look at it as it's both, how do I express the computation?"}, {"time": 6141, "text": "Do I stack up layers?"}, {"time": 6142, "text": "Well, cool, like setting up a linear sequence of layers is great for the simple case, but how do I do the hard case?"}, {"time": 6148, "text": "How do I do reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 6149, "text": "Well, now I need to integrate my application logic in this."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "Then it's the next level down of, how do you represent that for the runtime?"}, {"time": 6156, "text": "How do you get hardware abstraction?"}, {"time": 6159, "text": "And then you get to the next level down of saying like, forget about abstraction, how do I get the peak performance out of my TPU or my iPhone accelerator or whatever, right?"}, {"time": 6167, "text": "And all these different things."}, {"time": 6168, "text": "And so this is a layered problem with a lot of really interesting design and work going on in the space and a lot of really smart people working on it."}, {"time": 6176, "text": "Machine learning is a very well funded area of investment right now."}, {"time": 6180, "text": "And so there's a lot of progress being made."}, {"time": 6182, "text": "So how much innovation is there on the lower level, so closer to the ASIC, so redesigning the hardware or redesigning concurrently compilers with that hardware?"}, {"time": 6193, "text": "Is that like, if you were to predict the biggest, the equivalent of Moore's law improvements in the inference and the training of neural networks and just all of that, where is that gonna come from, you think?"}, {"time": 6206, "text": "Sure, you get scalability of different things."}, {"time": 6208, "text": "And so you get Jim Keller shrinking process technology, you get three nanometer instead of five or seven or 10 or 28 or whatever."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "And so that marches forward and that provides improvements."}, {"time": 6221, "text": "You get architectural level performance."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "And so the TPU with a matrix multiply unit and a systolic array is much more efficient than having a scalar core doing multiplies and adds and things like that."}, {"time": 6234, "text": "You then get system level improvements."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "So how you talk to memory, how you talk across a cluster of machines, how you scale out, how you have fast interconnects between machines."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "You then get system level programming models."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "So now that you have all this hardware, how to utilize it."}, {"time": 6251, "text": "You then have algorithmic breakthroughs where you say, hey, wow, cool."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "Instead of training in a resonant 50 in a week, I'm now training it in 25 seconds."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "And it's a combination of new optimizers and new just training regimens and different approaches to train."}, {"time": 6272, "text": "And all of these things come together to push the world forward."},

of the stack."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "I'm sure it's also improving significantly."}, {"time": 6309, "text": "I just, it's a nice intuition builder."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "I mean, there's a reason why Moore's Law, that's the beauty of Moore's Law is somebody writes a paper that makes a ridiculous prediction."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "And it becomes reality in a sense."}, {"time": 6327,

becoming real."}, {"time": 6340, "text": "That's an interesting aspect of it."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "Cause like it might've been, we focus with Moore's Law, most of the computing industry really, really focused on the hardware."}, {"time": 6353, "text": "I mean, software innovation, I don't know how much software innovation there was in terms of efficient."}, {"time": 6357, "text": "What Intel Giveth Bill takes away, right?"}, {"time": 6360, "text": "Yeah, I mean, compilers improved significantly also."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "Well, not really."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "So actually, I mean, so I'm joking about how software has gotten slower pretty much as fast as hardware got better, at least through the nineties."}, {"time": 6373, "text": "There's another joke, another law in compilers, which is called, I think it's called Probstine's Law, which is compilers double the performance of any given code every 18 years."}, {"time": 6386, "text": "So they move slowly."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "Yeah, also."}, {"time": 6388, "text": "Well, yeah, it's exponential also."}, {"time": 6390, "text": "Yeah, you're making progress, but there again, it's not about, the power of compilers is not just about how do you make the same thing go faster?"}, {"time": 6399, "text": "It's how do you unlock the new hardware?"}, {"time": 6401, "text": "A new chip came out, how do you utilize it?"}, {"time": 6403, "text": "You say, oh, the programming model, how do we make people more productive?"}, {"time": 6406, "text": "How do we have better error messages?"}, {"time": 6411,

"text": "And it comes back to how do you help people get their job done."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "Yeah, and yeah, and then in this world of exponentially increasing smart toasters, how do you expand computing to all these kinds of devices?"}, {"time": 6436, "text": "Do you see this world where just everything is a computing surface?"}, {"time": 6440, "text": "You see that possibility?"}, {"time": 6442, "text": "Just everything is a computer?"}, {"time": 6443, "text": "Yeah, I don't see any reason that that couldn't be achieved."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "It turns out that sand goes into glass and glass is pretty useful too."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "And why not?"}, {"time": 6455, "text": "So very important question then, if we're living in a simulation and the simulation is running a computer, like what's the architecture of that computer, do you think?"}, {"time": 6471, "text": "So you're saying is it a quantum system?"}, {"time": 6474, "text": "Yeah, like this whole quantum discussion, is it needed?"}, {"time": 6477, "text": "Or can we run it with a RISC 5 architecture, a bunch of CPUs?"}, {"time": 6485, "text": "I think it comes down to the right tool for the job."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "Yeah, and so."}, {"time": 6488, "text": "And what's the compiler?"}, {"time": 6490, "text": "Yeah, exactly, that's my question."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "Did I get that job?"}, {"time": 6493, "text": "Feed the universe compiler."}, {"time": 6496, "text": "And so there, as far as we know, quantum systems are the bottom of the pile of turtles so far."}, {"time": 6505, "text": "And so we don't know efficient ways to implement quantum systems without using quantum computers."}, {"time": 6512, "text": "Yeah, and that's totally outside of everything we've talked about."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "But who runs that quantum computer?"}, {"time": 6517, "text": "Right, so if we really are living in a simulation, then is it bigger quantum computers?"}, {"time": 6524, "text": "Is it different ones?"}, {"time": 6525, "text": "Like how does that work out?"}, {"time": 6526, "text": "How does that scale?"}, {"time": 6527, "text": "Well, it's the same size."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "It's the same size."}, {"time": 6530, "text": "But then the thought of the simulation is that you don't have to run the whole thing, that we humans are cognitively very limited."}, {"time": 6536, "text": "We do checkpoints."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "We do checkpoints, yeah."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "And if we, the point at which we human, so you basically do minimal amount of, what is it, Swift does on right, copy on right."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "So you only adjust the simulation."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "Parallel universe theories, right?"}, {"time": 6557, "text": "And so every time a decision's made, somebody opens the short end of your box, then there's a fork."}, {"time": 6563, "text": "And then this could happen."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "And then, thank you for considering the possibility."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "But yeah, so it may not require the entirety of the universe to simulate it."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "But it's interesting to think about as we create this higher and higher fidelity systems."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "But I do wanna ask on the quantum computer side, because everything we've talked about, whether you work with SciFive, with compilers, none of that includes quantum computers, right?"}, {"time": 6595, "text": "So have you ever thought about this whole serious engineering work of quantum computers looks like of compilers, of architectures, all of that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 6610, "text": "So I've looked at it a little bit."}, {"time": 6611, "text": "I know almost nothing about it, which means that at some point, I will have to find an excuse to get involved, because that's how it works."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "But do you think that's a thing to be, like with your little tingly senses of the timing of when to be involved, is it not yet?"}, {"time": 6626, "text": "Well, so the thing I do really well is I jump into messy systems and figure out how to make them, figure out what the truth in the situation is, try to figure out what the unifying theory is, how to like factor the complexity, how to find a beautiful answer to a problem that has been well studied and lots of people have bashed their heads against it."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "I don't know that quantum computers are mature enough and accessible enough to be figured out yet, right?"}, {"time": 6653, "text": "And I think the open question with quantum computers is, is there a useful problem that gets solved with a quantum computer that makes it worth the economic cost of like having one of these things and having legions of people that set it up?"}, {"time": 6671, "text": "You go back to the fifties, right?"}, {"time": 6672, "text": "And there's the projections of the world will only need seven computers, right?"}, {"time": 6678, "text": "Well, and part of that was that people hadn't figured out what they're useful for."}, {"time": 6681, "text": "What are the algorithms we wanna run?"}, {"time": 6683, "text": "What are the problems that get solved?"}, {"time": 6684, "text": "And this comes back to how do we make the world better, either economically or making somebody's life better or like solving a problem that wasn't solved before, things like this."}, {"time": 6693, "text": "And I think that just we're a little bit too early in that development cycle because it's still like literally a science project, not a negative connotation, right?"}, {"time": 6701, "text": "It's literally a science project and the progress there is amazing."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "And so I don't know if it's 10 years away, if it's two years away, exactly where that breakthrough happens, but you look at machine learning, we went through a few winners before the AlexNet transition and then suddenly it had its breakout moment."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "And that was the catalyst that then drove the talent flocking into it."}, {"time": 6727, "text": "That's what drove the economic applications of it."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "That's what drove the technology to go faster because you now have more minds thrown at the problem."}, {"time": 6735, "text": "This is what caused like a serious knee in deep learning and the algorithms that we're using."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "And so I think that's what quantum needs to go through."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "And so right now it's in that formidable finding itself, getting the like literally the physics figured out."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "And then it has to figure out the application that makes this useful."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "Yeah, but I'm not skeptical that I think that will happen."}, {"time": 6760, "text": "I think it's just 10 years away, something like that."}, {"time": 6763, "text": "I forgot to ask, what programming language do you think the simulation is written in?"}, {"time": 6768, "text": "Ooh, probably Lisp."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "So not Swift."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "Like if you're a Tibet, I'll just leave it at that."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "So, I mean, we've mentioned that you worked with all these companies, we've talked about all these projects."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "It's kind of like if we just step back and zoom out about the way you did that work."}, {"time": 6790, "text": "And we look at COVID times, this pandemic we're living through that may, if I look at the way Silicon Valley folks are talking about it, the way MIT is talking about it, this might last for a long time."}, {"time": 6803, "text": "Not just the virus, but the remote nature."}, {"time": 6808, "text": "The economic impact."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "I mean, all of it, yeah."}, {"time": 6810, "text": "Yeah, it's gonna be a mess."}, {"time": 6812, "text": "Do you think, what's your prediction?"}, {"time": 6814, "text": "I mean, from sci fi to Google, to just all the places you worked in, just Silicon Valley, you're in the middle of it."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "What do you think is, how is this whole place gonna change?"}, {"time": 6826, "text": "Yeah, so, I mean, I really can only speak to the tech perspective."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "I am in that bubble."}, {"time": 6834, "text": "I think it's gonna be really interesting because the Zoom culture of being remote and on video chat all the time has really interesting effects on people."}, {"time": 6841, "text": "So on the one hand, it's a great normalizer."}, {"time": 6845, "text": "It's a normalizer that I think will help communities of people that have traditionally been underrepresented because now you're taking, in some cases, a face off because you don't have to have a camera going, right?"}, {"time": 6858, "text": "And so you can have conversations without physical appearance being part of the dynamic, which is pretty powerful."}, {"time": 6864, "text": "You're taking remote employees that have already been remote, and you're saying you're now on the same level and footing as everybody else."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "Nobody gets whiteboards."}, {"time": 6873, "text": "You're not gonna be the one person that doesn't get to be participating in the whiteboard conversation, and that's pretty powerful."}, {"time": 6879, "text": "You've got, you're forcing people to think asynchronously in some cases because it's harder to just get people physically together, and the bumping into each other forces people to find new ways to solve those problems."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "And I think that that leads to more inclusive behavior, which is good."}, {"time": 6896, "text": "On the other hand, it's also, it just sucks, right?"}, {"time": 6900, "text": "And so the actual communication just sucks being not with people on a daily basis and collaborating with them."}, {"time": 6911, "text": "Yeah, all of that, right?"}, {"time": 6913, "text": "I mean, everything, this whole situation is terrible."}, {"time": 6915, "text": "What I meant primarily was the, I think that most humans like working physically with humans."}, {"time": 6922, "text": "I think this is something that not everybody, but many people are programmed to do."}, {"time": 6927, "text": "And I think that we get something out of that that is very hard to express, at least for me."}, {"time": 6931, "text": "And so maybe this isn't true of everybody."}, {"time": 6933, "text": "But, and so the question to me is, when you get through that time of adaptation, you get out of March and April, and you get into December, you get into next March, if it's not changed, right?"}, {"time": 6946, "text": "It's already terrifying."}, {"time": 6947, "text": "Well, you think about that, and you think about what is the nature of work?"}, {"time": 6951, "text": "And how do we adapt?"}, {"time": 6952, "text": "And humans are very adaptable species, right?"}, {"time": 6955, "text": "We can learn things when we're forced to, and there's a catalyst to make that happen."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "And so what is it that comes out of this, and are we better or worse off?"}, {"time": 6964, "text": "I think that you look at the Bay Area, housing prices are insane."}, {"time": 6969, "text": "Well, there's a high incentive to be physically located, because if you don't have proximity, you end up paying for it and commute, right?"}, {"time": 6978, "text": "And there has been huge social pressure in terms of you will be there for the meeting, right?"}, {"time": 6984, "text": "Or whatever scenario it is."}, {"time": 6986, "text": "And I think that's gonna be way better."}, {"time": 6988, "text": "I think it's gonna be much more the norm to have remote employees, and I think this is gonna be really great."}, {"time": 6993, "text": "Do you have friends, or do you hear of people moving?"}, {"time": 6997, "text": "I know one family friend that moved."}, {"time": 7000, "text": "They moved back to Michigan, and they were a family with three kids living in a small apartment, and we're going insane, right?"}, {"time": 7010, "text": "And they're in tech, husband works for Google."}, {"time": 7014, "text": "So first of all, friends of mine are in the process of, or have already lost the business."}, {"time": 7020, "text": "The thing that represents their passion, their dream, it could be small entrepreneurial projects, but it could be large businesses, like people that run gyms."}, {"time": 7028, "text": "Restaurants, tons of things, yeah."}, {"time": 7030, "text": "But also, people look at themselves in the mirror and ask the question of, what do I wanna do in life?"}, {"time": 7037, "text": "For some reason, they haven't done it until COVID."}, {"time": 7040, "text": "They really ask that question, and that results often in moving or leaving the company with starting your own business or transitioning to a different company."}, {"time": 7050, "text": "Do you think we're gonna see that a lot?"}, {"time": 7053, "text": "Well, I can't speak to that."}, {"time": 7056, "text": "I mean, we're definitely gonna see it at a higher frequency than we did before, just because I think what you're trying to say is there are decisions that you make yourself, big life decisions that you make yourself, and I'm gonna quit my job and start a new thing."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "There's also decisions that get made for you."}, {"time": 7072, "text": "I got fired from my job, what am I gonna do, right?"}, {"time": 7075, "text": "And that's not a decision that you think about, but you're forced to act, okay?"}, {"time": 7080, "text": "And so I think that those, you're forced to act kind of moments where global pandemic comes and wipes out the economy, and now your business doesn't exist."}, {"time": 7089, "text": "I think that does lead to more reflection, right?"}, {"time": 7091, "text": "Because you're less anchored on what you have, and it's not a, what do I have to lose versus what do I have to gain, A, B, comparison."}, {"time":

that make me happy?"}, {"time": 7107, "text": "Is this now time to go back to college and take a class and learn a new skill?"}, {"time": 7113, "text": "Is this a time to spend time with family if you can afford to do that?"}, {"time": 7117, "text": "Is this time to literally move in with parents, right?"}, {"time": 7120, "text": "I mean, all these things that were not normative before suddenly become, I think, very, the value systems change."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "And I think that's actually a good thing in the short term, at least, because it leads to, there's kind of been an overoptimization along one set of priorities for the world, and now maybe we'll get to a more balanced and more interesting world where people are doing different things."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "I think it could be good."}, {"time": 7147, "text": "I think there could be more innovation that comes out of it, for example."}, {"time": 7150, "text": "What do you think about all the social chaos we're in the middle of?"}, {"time": 7154, "text": "You think it's, let me ask you a whole, you think it's all gonna be okay?"}, {"time": 7161, "text": "Well, I think humanity will survive."}, {"time": 7163, "text": "The, from an existential, like we're not all gonna kill, yeah, well."}, {"time": 7167, "text": "Yeah, I don't think the virus is gonna kill all the humans."}, {"time": 7170, "text": "I don't think all the humans are gonna kill all the humans."}, {"time": 7171, "text": "I think that's unlikely."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "But I look at it as progress requires a catalyst, right?"}, {"time": 7182, "text": "So you need a reason for people to be willing to do things that are uncomfortable."}, {"time": 7187, "text": "I think that the US, at least, but I think the world in general is a pretty unoptimal place to live in for a lot of people."}, {"time": 7196, "text": "And I think that what we're seeing right now is we're seeing a lot of unhappiness."}, {"time": 7200, "text": "And because of all the pressure, because of all the badness in the world that's coming together, it's really kind of igniting some of that debate that should have happened a long time ago, right?"},

faster because there's all these problems in the world and we can move it."}, {"time": 7218, "text": "Well, people are intentionally, are inherently conservative."}, {"time": 7222, "text": "And so if you're talking about conservative people, particularly if they have heavy burdens on their shoulders because they represent literally thousands of people, it makes sense to be conservative."},

it's not a directed, it's not a directed plan, but I think that it leads to people asking really interesting questions."}, {"time": 7247, "text": "And some of those questions should have been asked a long time ago."}, {"time": 7250, "text": "Well, let me know if you've observed this as well."}, {"time": 7253, "text": "Something that's bothered me in the machine learning community, I'm guessing it might be prevalent in other places, is something that feels like in 2020 increase the level of toxicity."}, {"time": 7265, "text": "Like people are just quicker to pile on, to just be, they're just harsh on each other, to like mob, pick a person that screwed up and like make it a big thing."}, {"time": 7282, "text": "And is there something that we can like, yeah, have you observed that in other places?"}, {"time": 7288, "text": "Is there some way out of this?"}, {"time": 7290, "text": "I think there's an inherent thing in humanity that's kind of an us versus them thing, which is that you wanna succeed and how do you succeed?"}, {"time": 7297, "text": "Well, it's relative to somebody else."}, {"time": 7299, "text": "And so what's happening in, at least in some part is that with the

right?"}, {"time": 7317, "text": "Turn into much larger and yet shallower problems."}, {"time": 7322, "text": "And people don't have time, the incentives, the clickbait and like all these things kind of really feed into this machine."}, {"time": 7330, "text": "And I don't know where that goes."}, {"time": 7332, "text": "Yeah, I mean, the reason I think about that, I mentioned to you this offline a little bit, but I have a few difficult conversations scheduled, some of them political related, some of them within the community, difficult personalities that went through some stuff."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "I mean, one of them I've talked before, I will talk again is Yann LeCun."}, {"time": 7354, "text": "He got a little bit of crap on Twitter for talking about a particular paper and the bias within a data set."}, {"time": 7362, "text": "And then there's been a huge, in my view, and I'm willing, comfortable saying it, irrational, over exaggerated pile on his comments because he made pretty basic comments about the fact that if there's bias in the data, there's going to be bias in the results."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "So we should not have bias in the data, but people piled on to him because he said he trivialized the problem of bias."}, {"time": 7390, "text": "Like it's a lot more than just bias in the data, but like, yes, that's a very good point, but that's not what he was saying."}, {"time": 7398, "text": "That's not what he was saying."}, {"time": 7399, "text": "And the response, like the implied response that he's basically sexist and racist is something that

you're speaking to there."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "But I mean, I think that there's been a pretty well understood maximum in deep learning that if you make the model bigger and you shove more data into it, assuming you train it right and you have a good model architecture, that you'll get a better model out."}, {"time": 7855, "text": "And so on one hand, GPT3 was not that surprising."},

can have very profound impact on that."}, {"time": 7890, "text": "I think that GPT3 is a huge technical achievement."}, {"time": 7894, "text": "And what will GPT4 be?"}, {"time": 7895, "text": "Well, it'll probably be bigger, more expensive to train."}, {"time": 7898, "text": "Really cool architectural tricks."}, {"time": 7902, "text": "What do you think, is there, I don't know how much thought you've done on distributed computing."}, {"time": 7908, "text": "Is there some technical challenges that are interesting that you're hopeful about exploring in terms of a system that, like a piece of code that with GPT4 that might have, I don't know, hundreds of trillions of parameters which have to run on thousands of computers."}, {"time": 7931, "text": "Is there some hope that we can make that happen?"}, {"time": 7935, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, today you can write a check and get access to a thousand TPU cores and do really interesting large scale training and inference and things like that in Google Cloud, for example, right?"}, {"time": 7947, "text": "And so I don't think it's a question about scale, it's a question about utility."}, {"time": 7953, "text": "And when I look at the transformer series of architectures that the GPT series is based on, it's really interesting to look at that because they're actually very simple designs."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "They're not recurrent."}, {"time": 7964, "text": "The training regimens are pretty simple."}, {"time": 7967, "text": "And so they don't really reflect like human brains, right?"}, {"time": 7971, "text": "But they're really good at learning language models and they're unrolled enough that you can simulate some recurrence, right?"}, {"time": 7979, "text": "And so the question I think about is, where does this take us?"}, {"time": 7983, "text": "Like, so we can just keep scaling it, have more parameters, more data, more things, we'll get a better result for sure."}, {"time": 7989, "text": "But are there architectural techniques that can lead to progress at a faster pace, right?"}, {"time": 7995, "text": "This is when, you know, how do you get, instead of just like making it a constant time

networks, one of the things that Jeff Dean likes to talk about and he's given a few talks on is this idea of having a sparsely gated mixture of experts kind of a model where you have, you know, different nets that are trained and are really good at certain kinds of tasks."}, {"time": 8042, "text": "And so you have this distributor across a cluster and so you have a lot of different computers that end up being kind of locally specialized in different demands."}, {"time": 8049, "text": "And then when a query comes in, you gate it and you use learn techniques to route to different parts of the network."}, {"time": 8055, "text": "And then you utilize the compute resources of the entire cluster by having specialization within it."}, {"time": 8060, "text": "And I don't know where that goes or when it starts to work, but I think things like that could be really interesting as well."}, {"time": 8068, "text": "And on the data side too, if you can think of data selection as a kind of programming."}, {"time": 8076, "text": "I mean, essentially, if you look at it, like Karpathy talked about software 2.0, I mean, in a sense, data is the program."}, {"time": 8084, "text": "So let me try to summarize Andre's position really quick before I disagree with it."}, {"time": 8091, "text": "So Andre Karpathy is amazing."}, {"time": 8093, "text": "So this is nothing personal with him."}, {"time": 8095, "text": "He's an amazing engineer."}, {"time": 8097, "text": "And also a good blog post writer."}, {"time": 8099, "text": "Yeah, well, he's a great communicator."}, {"time": 8101, "text": "You know, he's just an amazing person."}, {"time": 8102, "text": "He's also really sweet."}, {"time": 8103, "text": "So his basic premise is that software is suboptimal."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "I think we can all agree to that."}, {"time": 8111, "text": "He also points out that deep learning and other learning based techniques are really great because you can solve problems in more structured ways with less like ad hoc code that people write out and don't write test cases for in some cases."}, {"time": 8125, "text": "And so they don't even know if it works in the first place."}, {"time": 8127, "text": "And so if you start replacing systems of imperative code with deep learning models, then you get a better result."}, {"time": 8138, "text": "And I think that he argues that software 2.0 is a pervasively learned set of models and you get away from writing code."}, {"time": 8145, "text": "And he's given talks where he talks about, you know, swapping over more and more and more parts of the code to being learned and driven that way."}, {"time": 8154, "text": "I think that works."}, {"time": 8156, "text": "And if you're predisposed to liking machine learning, then I think that that's definitely a good thing."}, {"time": 8161, "text": "I think this is also good for accessibility in many ways because certain people are not gonna write C code or something."}, {"time": 8167, "text": "And so having a data driven approach to do this kind of stuff, I think can be very valuable."}, {"time": 8172, "text": "On the other hand, there are huge trade offs."}, {"time": 8174, "text": "It's not clear to me that software 2.0 is the answer."}, {"time": 8179, "text": "And probably Andre wouldn't argue that it's the answer for every problem either."}, {"time": 8182, "text": "But I look at machine learning as not a replacement for software 1.0."}, {"time": 8187, "text": "I look at it as a new programming paradigm."}, {"time": 8190, "text": "And so programming paradigms, when you look across demands, is structured programming where you go from go tos to if, then, else, or functional programming from Lisp."}, {"time": 8202, "text": "And you start talking about higher order functions and values and things like this."}, {"time": 8205, "text": "Or you talk about object oriented programming."}, {"time": 8208, "text": "You're talking about encapsulation, subclassing, inheritance."}, {"time": 8210, "text": "You start talking about generic programming where you start talking about code reuse through specialization and different type instantiations."}, {"time": 8219, "text": "When you start talking about differentiable programming, something that I am very excited about in the context of machine learning, talking about taking functions and generating variants, like the derivative of another function."}, {"time": 8231, "text": "Like that's a programming paradigm that's very useful for solving certain classes of problems."},

by writing C code."}, {"time": 8245, "text": "That's not a very productive way to do things anymore."}, {"time": 8248, "text": "And so machine learning is absolutely the right way to do that."}, {"time": 8251, "text": "In fact, I would say that learned models are really one of the best ways to work with the human world in general."}, {"time": 8258, "text": "And so anytime you're talking about sensory input of different modalities, anytime that you're talking about generating things in a way that makes sense to a human, I think that learned models are really, really useful."}, {"time": 8268, "text": "And that's because humans are very difficult to characterize, okay?"}, {"time": 8272, "text": "And so this is a very powerful paradigm for solving classes of problems."}, {"time": 8277,

learning models are very hardware intensive."}, {"time": 8287, "text": "They're very energy intensive because you have a lot of parameters and you can provably implement any function with a learned model, like this has been shown, but that doesn't make it efficient."}, {"time": 8300, "text": "And so if you're talking about caring about a few orders of magnitudes worth of energy usage, then it's useful to have other tools in the toolbox."}, {"time": 8306, "text": "There's also robustness too."}, {"time": 8308, "text": "I mean, as a...

Oh, well, I mean, it's provably true that you could replace all of it."}, {"time": 8377, "text": "Right, so then it's a question of the trade offs."}, {"time": 8379, "text": "Anything that's a function, you can."}, {"time": 8380, "text": "So it's not a question about if."}, {"time": 8382, "text": "I think it's a economic question."}, {"time": 8384, "text": "It's a, what kind of talent can you get?"}, {"time": 8387, "text": "What kind of trade offs in terms of maintenance, right?"}, {"time": 8390, "text": "Those kinds of questions, I think."}, {"time": 8391, "text": "What kind of data can you collect?"}, {"time": 8393, "text": "I think one of the reasons that I'm most interested in machine learning as a programming paradigm is that one of the things that we've seen across computing in general is that being laser focused on one paradigm often puts you in a box that's not super great."}, {"time": 8407, "text": "And so you look at object oriented programming, like it was all the rage in the early 80s and like everything has to be objects."}, {"time": 8413, "text": "And people forgot about functional programming even though it came first."}, {"time": 8417, "text": "And then people rediscovered that, hey, if you mix functional and object oriented in structure, like you mix these things together, you can provide very interesting tools that are good at solving different problems."}, {"time": 8428, "text": "And so the question there is how do you get the best way to solve the problems?"}, {"time": 8432, "text": "It's not about whose tribe should win, right?"}, {"time": 8436, "text": "It's not about, you know, that shouldn't be the question."}, {"time": 8438, "text": "The question is how do you make it so that people can solve those problems the fastest and they have the right tools in their box to build good libraries and they can solve these problems."}, {"time": 8447, "text": "And when you look at that, that's like, you know, you look at reinforcement learning as one really interesting subdomain of this."}, {"time": 8452, "text": "Reinforcement learning, often you have to have the integration of a learned model combined with your Atari or whatever the other scenario it is that you're working in."}, {"time": 8462, "text": "You have to combine that thing with the robot control for the arm, right?"}, {"time": 8467, "text": "And so now it's not just about that one paradigm, it's about integrating that with all the other systems that you have, including often legacy systems and things like this, right?"}, {"time": 8478, "text": "And so to me, I think that the interesting thing to say is like, how do you get the best out of this domain and how do you enable people to achieve things that they otherwise couldn't do without excluding all the good things we already know how to do?"}, {"time": 8491, "text": "Right, but okay, this is a crazy question, but we talked a little bit about GPT3, but do you think it's possible that these language models that in essence, in the language domain, Software 2.0 could replace some aspect of compilation, for example, or do program synthesis, replace some aspect of programming?"}, {"time": 8517, "text": "So I think that learned models in general are extremely powerful, and I think that people underestimate them."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "Maybe you can suggest what I should do."}, {"time": 8527, "text": "So if I have access to the GPT3 API, would I be able to generate Swift code, for example?"}, {"time": 8534, "text": "Do you think that could do something interesting and would work?"}, {"time": 8537, "text": "So GPT3 is probably not trained on the right corpus, so it probably has the ability to generate some Swift."}, {"time": 8543, "text": "I bet it does."}, {"time": 8545, "text": "It's probably not gonna generate a large enough body of Swift to be useful, but take it a next step further."}, {"time": 8550, "text": "Like if you had the goal of training something like GPT3 and you wanted to train it to generate source code, right?"}, {"time": 8558, "text": "It could definitely do that."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "Now the question is, how do you express the intent of what you want filled in?"}, {"time": 8564, "text": "You can definitely write scaffolding of code and say, fill in the hole, and sort of put in some for loops, or put in some classes or whatever."}, {"time": 8571, "text": "And the power of these models is impressive, but there's an unsolved question, at least unsolved to me, which is, how do I express the intent of what to fill in?"}, {"time": 8581, "text": "And kind of what you'd really want to have, and I don't know that these models are up to the task, is you wanna be able to say, here's the scaffolding, and here are the assertions at the end."}, {"time": 8592, "text": "And the assertions always pass."}, {"time": 8594, "text": "And so you want a generative model on the one hand, yes."}, {"time": 8596, "text": "Oh, that's fascinating, yeah."}, {"time": 8597, "text": "Right, but you also want some loop back, some reinforcement learning system or something, where you're actually saying like, I need to hill climb towards something that is more correct."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "And I don't know that we have that."}, {"time": 8609, "text": "So it would generate not only a bunch of the code, but like the checks that do the testing."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "It would generate the tests."}, {"time": 8617, "text": "I think the humans would generate the tests, right?"}, {"time": 8619, "text": "But it would be fascinating

smoking DMT or smoking 5 methoxy DMT, which are some interesting examples we could talk more about."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "But with MDMA, for example, it's very rare to have what's called an ego loss experience or a sense of transcendental unity, where one really seemingly loses the psychological construct of the self."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "But MDMA, it's very common for people to have this, they still are perceiving themselves as a self, but it's common for them to have this warmth, this empathy for humanity and for their friends and loved ones."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "So it's more, and you see those effects under the classic psychedelics, but that's a subset of what the classic psychedelics do."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "So I see MDMA in terms of its subjective effects is if you think about Venn diagrams, it's sort of MDMA is all within the classic psychedelics."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "So everything that you see on a particular MDMA session, sometimes a psilocybin

have an experience like that."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So there's an emphasis on the subjective experience that is there words that people put to it that capture that experience or is it something that just has to be experienced?"}, {"time": 1140, "text": "Yeah, people like...

challenge."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "So is that possible to one, convert it into words and the second, convert the words into numbers somehow?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "So we do a lot of that with questionnaires, some of which are very psychometrically validated."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "So lots of numbers have been crunched on them."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "And there's always a limitation with questionnaires."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "I mean, subjective effects are subjective effects."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Ultimately, it's what the person is reporting and that doesn't necessarily point towards a ground truth."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "So for example, if someone says that they felt like they touched another dimension or they felt like they sensed the reality of God or if they, I mean, just you name it, people's ontological views can sometimes shift."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "I think that's more about where they're coming from and I don't think it's the quintessential way

the alteration that psychedelics brings to your perception system."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "So I wonder like the language you bring to the table, how that affects the journey you go on with the psychedelics."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "I think very much so."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "And I think there's, I'm a little concerned some of the science is going a little too far in the direction of around the edges, speaking about it changing beliefs in this sense or that sense about particular, in particular domains."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "And I think what really what a lot of what's going on is what you just discussed."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "It's the priors coming into it."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "So if you've been reading a lot of physics, then you might bring up like space time and interpret the experience in that sense."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "I mean, it's not uncommon for people come out talking about visions of the, it's not the most typical thing, but it's come up in sessions I've guided, the Big Bang and this sort of nature of reality."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "I think probably that the best way to think about these experiences is that, and the best evidence, even though we're in our infancy and understanding it, they really tap into more general psychological mechanisms."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "I think one of the best arguments is they reduce the influence of our priors, of what we bring into all of the assumptions that we all that we're essentially, especially as adults, we're riding on top of heuristic after heuristic to get through life."},

influenced by their prior assumptions, but still nonetheless the nature of the experience can be influenced by what they've been exposed to in the world."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "And sometimes they can get it in a deeper way."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "Like maybe they've read, I mean, I had a philosophy professor one time as a participant in a high dose psilocybin study."}, {"time": 1474,

years and years."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Like, I get it now."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "And so like that, you know, and even at the psychological, emotional level, like the cancer patients we

kinds of mechanisms in our human nature that resist paradigm shift quite sort of obviously."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "So, and psychedelics, there could be a lot of other tools but it seems like

of, you're at the forefront of research here."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "There's just kind of anecdotal stories."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "There's early studies."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "There's a

the studies done."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "But the first thing I would do is like a really high dose session where you're not necessarily in front of your computer, which you can't really do on a really high dose."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "And then the work has been talked about, like you take a really high dose, you take a journey, and then the breakthroughs come from when you return from the journey and like integrate, quote unquote, that experience."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "I think that's where all the, again, we're babies at this point, but my gut tells me that it's the so called

think you need even more credible, active controls or active placebo conditions to kind of tease this out."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And then also in conjunction with that, and you can do this in the

little more rigorously about those because ultimately, if everyone's bringing their own problem, that's more in the face valid side, but you can't dig in as much and get as much experimental power and

about three big hits, inhalations, in order to have what people call a breakthrough dose."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "And there's no great definition of that, but basically meaning moving away from,

the first exhalation, so we're talking about a few seconds in, or maybe just sometime between the first and the second hit, like it'll start to come on."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "And they're already

us."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "And this unlocks them in a certain kind of way."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "And we think about stories."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "Like our sense of self is basically, narrative self is a story."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "And we think about the world of stories."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "This is why metaphors are always more powerful than sort of laying out all the details all the time, speaking in parables."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "It's like, if you really get some, this is why, as much as I hate it, if you're presenting to Congress or something and you have all the best data in the world, it's not as powerful as that one anecdote as the mom dying of cancer that had the psilocybin session and it transformed her life."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "That's a story, that's meaningful."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "And so when this kind of unimaginable kind of change and experience happens with a DMT ingestion, these stories of entities, they might be that, stories that are constructed that is the closest, which is not to say the stories aren't real."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "I mean, I think we're getting to layers where it doesn't really, right."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "Yeah, but it's the closest we can come to making sense out of it."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "Because what we do know about these psychedelics, one of the levels beyond the receptor is that the brain is communicating it with itself in a massively different way."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "There's massive communication with areas that don't normally communicate."},

2802, "text": "I do think it comes with false positives, that could be some of the delusion."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "And so when you're so far out there, like with the DMT experience, like maybe alien is the best way that the mind can wrap some arms around that."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "So I don't know how much you're familiar with Joe Rogan, but he does bring up DMT quite a bit."},

special club these days."}, {"time": 2904, "text": "So he definitely got onto my radar screen quickly."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "You were into both before it was cool."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "Right, I mean, this is all relative because there's people that were before the late 90s and early 2000s who were into it to say you're a Johnny come lately."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "But yeah, compared to where we're at now."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "But yet one of the things I always found fascinating by Joe's telling of his experiences I think is that they resemble very much Terrence McKenna's experiences with DMT and Joe has talked very much about Terrence McKenna and his experiences."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "If I had to guess, I would guess that probably just having heard Terrence McKenna talk about his experiences that that influenced the coloring of Joe's experience."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "It's funny how that works because I mean, that's why McKenna hasn't, I mean, poets and great orators give us the words to then like start to describe our experiences because our words are limited, our language is limited."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "And it's always nice to get some kind of nice poetry into the mix to allow us to put words to it."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "Right, but I also see some elements that seem to relate to Joe's psychology just from what I've seen from hours of watching him on his podcast is that he's a self critical guy."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "And I think with always his positive been, I'm always struck being a behavioral pharmacologist and no one else really says it about cannabis."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "I'll get back to the DMT thing about he likes the kind of the paranoid side of things."}, {"time": 3003,

and something's making you uncomfortable, like dig into that."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "And like, that's his, it's sort of along the lines of Goggins with exercise."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "And it's like, yeah, like things, learning experiences aren't supposed to be easy."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "Like take advantage of these uncomfortable experience."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "It's why we call in our research in a safe context with psychedelics, they're not bad trips, they're challenging experiences."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "Yes, yeah, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "Just that's the tiny tangent."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "It's always cool for me to hear him talk about marijuana, like weed as the paranoia, the anxiety or whatever that you experience as actually the fuel for the experience."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Like I think he talks about smoking weed when he's writing."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "That's inspiring to me because then you can't possibly have a bad experience."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "I'm a huge fan of that."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "Like every experience is good."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "Right, which is very Goggins."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "Yeah, yeah, is it bad?"}, {"time": 3066, "text": "Okay, all right, great, you know."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "Well, see Goggins is one side of that."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "He wants it bad."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "Like he wants the experience to be challenging always."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "But I mean like both are good."}, {"time": 3077, "text": "Like the few times of taking mushrooms, the experience was like everything was beautiful."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "There's zero challenging aspect to it."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "It was just like the world is beautiful and it gave me this deep appreciation of the world."}, {"time": 3095, "text": "I would say, so like that's amazing, but also ones that challenge you are also amazing."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "Like all the times I drink vodka, but that's another, let's not."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "So back to DMT."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "Yeah, Joe's treating cannabis as a psychedelic, which is something that I'd say like a lot of people treat it more like Xanax or like beer or vodka."}, {"time": 3119, "text": "But he's really trying to delve into those minor, it's been called a minor psychedelic."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "So with DMT, as you brought up, it's like the entity's mocking him."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And it's like, you're not, I mean, this reminds me of him, him describing his, like writing his, or just his entire method of comedy."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "It's like, watch the tape of yourself."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "Don't just ignore it."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "Like that's where I screwed up."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "That's where I need to do better."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "This like sort of radical self examination, which I think our society is kind of getting away from because like, all the children win trophies type of thing."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "And it's like, no, no, don't go overboard, but like recognize when you've messed up."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "And so that's a big part of the psychedelic experience."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "Like people come out sometimes saying, my God, I need to say sorry to my mom."}, {"time": 3172, "text": "It's so obvious, or whatever interpersonal issue or like, my God, I'm not pulling enough weight around the house and helping my wife."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "And these things that are just obvious to them, the self criticism that can be a very positive thing if you act on it."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "You've mentioned addiction."}, {"time": 3193, "text": "Maybe we could take a little bit detour into a darker aspect of things, or not even darker, it's just an important aspect of things."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "What's the nature of addiction?"}, {"time": 3204, "text": "You've mentioned some things within the big umbrella of psychedelics may be usually not addictive, but maybe MDMA, I think you said might have some addictive properties, but the point is stuff outside of the psychedelics umbrella can often be highly addictive."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "So you've studied addiction from several angles, one of which is behavioral economics."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "What have you understood about addiction?"}, {"time": 3233, "text": "What is addiction from the biological physiological level to the psychological to whatever is the interesting way to talk about addiction?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Yeah, and the lenses that I view addiction through very much are behavioral economic, but I also think they converge on, I think it's beautiful at the other end of the spectrum, sort of just a completely humanistic psychology perspective."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "It converges on what people come out of, 12 step meetings talking about."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "Can you say what is behavioral economics and what is humanistic psychology?"}, {"time": 3270, "text": "Like, what do you mean by that?"}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And more importantly, behavioral economics lens, what is that?"}, {"time": 3274, "text": "Yeah, so behavioral economics, my definition of it is the application of economic principles, mostly microeconomic principles."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "So understanding the behavior of individual agents surrounding commodities in the marketplace, applying microeconomic types of analyses to non economic behavior."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "So basically at one point, like psychologists figured out that there's this whole other discipline that's been studying behavior, it just happened to be all focused on monetary behavior, spending and saving money, et cetera."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "But it comes with all of these like principles that can be wildly and fruitfully applied to understanding behavior."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "So for example, I've studied things like demand curve analysis of drug consumption."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "So I look at, for example, tobacco, cigarettes and nicotine products through the lens of demand curves."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "And in other words, at different prices, if there's different work requirements for being able to smoke cigarettes, sort of modeling price."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Within that price data, there is some indication of addiction, how much the habits that you form around these particular drugs."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "It's one important dimension."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "So I think a particularly important one there is elasticity or inelasticity, two ends of the spectrum."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "So that's the price sensitivity."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "So for example, you could have something that's pretty price inelastic, like gasoline."}, {"time": 3374, "text": "So the price of gas at times can keep going up and Americans are just gonna pretty much buy the same amount of gas."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "Or maybe the price of gas doubles, but their consumption only decreases by 10%."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "So it's a sub proportional reduction."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "So that's an inelastic."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "And that changes, like you push the price up high enough."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "I mean, if it was $100 a gallon, it would eventually turn, the curve would turn and go downward more drastically and it would be elastic."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "But you can apply that to someone who, a regular cigarette smoker who was working for cigarette puffs, who's gone six hours without smoking."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "And you're asking questions like, how many times are they willing to pull this knob in the lab during this three hour session?"}, {"time": 3419, "text": "I do a lot of work like this in order to earn a cigarette."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "How does the content of nicotine in that affect?"}, {"time": 3425, "text": "It has the availability of nicotine replacement products like nicotine gum or eCigarettes affect those decisions."}, {"time": 3432, "text": "So it's a certain lens of, it's sort of a way to take the kind of the classic behavioral psychology definition of reinforcement, which is just basically reward."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "How much is this a good thing?"}, {"time": 3445, "text": "And it kind of breaks that apart into a multi dimensional space."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "So it's not just the ideas reward or reinforcement is not unit dimensional."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "So for example, you can unpack that with demand curves."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "At a cheap price, you might prefer one good to another."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "So the classic example is luxury versus necessity."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "So diamonds versus toilet paper."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "So at those cheap prices, you can look at something called intensity of demand."}, {"time": 3474, "text": "If it was basically as cheap as possible, or essentially zero, how much would you buy of this good?"}, {"time": 3479, "text": "But then you keep jacking up the price and you'll see, so diamonds will look like the better reward at that low price sort of intensity of demand side of things."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "But as you keep jacking up the price, you gotta have some toilet paper."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "And again, we can get into the whole bidet thing, but forget that, I know Joe's been pushing that too."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "You're gonna hang on and keep buying the toilet paper to a greater degree than you will the diamonds."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "So you'll see a crossing of demand curves."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "So what's the better reinforcer?"}, {"time": 3510, "text": "What's the better reward?"}, {"time": 3511, "text": "Depends on your price."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "And so that's an example of one way to look at addiction."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "So specifically drug consumption, which isn't all of addiction, but it's like in order for something to be addictive, it has to be a reward."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "And it has to compete with other rewards in your life."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "And one of the two main aspects of addiction in my view, and this doesn't map onto how the DSM, the psychiatry Bible defines addiction, which I think is largely bunk, but there's some value to have some common description, but it's how rewarding is it from this multi dimensional lens?"}, {"time": 3555, "text": "And specifically, how does that rewarding value compete with other rewards, other consequences in your life?"}, {"time": 3565, "text": "So it's not a problem if the use of that substance is rewarding."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "Okay, yeah, you like to have a couple of beers every once in a while, and it's like not a problem."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "But then you have the alcoholic who is drinking so much that it tanks their career, it ruins their marriage."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "It's in competition with these pro social aspects to their life."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "It's all about comparing to the other choices you're making, the other activities in your life."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "And if you evaluate it as a much higher reward than anything else, that becomes an addiction."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "And so it's not just the rewarding value, but it's the relative rewarding value."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "And the other major aspect, again, from behavioral economics, that the thing that makes addiction is something called delayed discounting."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "So in economics, sometimes it's called time preference."}, {"time": 3623, "text": "It's what compound interest rates are based upon."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "It's the idea that delaying a good access to a good or a reward comes with a certain decrement to its value."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "So we'd all rather have things now than later."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "And we can study this at the individual level of, would you rather have $9 today or $10 tomorrow?"}, {"time": 3648, "text": "And when you do that, you get huge differences between addicted populations and non addicted, not just heroin and cocaine, but like just cigarette smokers, like normal everyday cigarette smokers."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "And even when you look at something like monetary rewards."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "And so you can go into the rabbit hole with this delayed discounting model."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "So it's not only those huge differences that seem to have a face valid aspect to it."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "Like the cigarette smoker is choosing this thing that's rewarding today, but I know it comes with increased risk of having these horrible consequences down the line."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "So it's this competition between what's good for me now and what's good for me later."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "And the other aspect about delayed discounting is that if you quantitatively map out that discounting curve over time, so you don't just do that $10 tomorrow, how much is it worth to you today?"}, {"time": 3705, "text": "So you can say, what about nine?"}, {"time": 3706, "text": "What about eight?"}, {"time": 3707, "text": "What about $7?"}, {"time": 3708, "text": "And you can titrate it to find that indifference point."}, {"time": 3711, "text": "And so we can say, aha, $10 tomorrow is worth $6 today."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "So it's by the one day it's decreased by 40%."}, {"time": 3720, "text": "We can do that also at one week and one month and one year and 10 years and map out that curve, get a shape of that curve."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "And one of the fascinating things about this is that whether you're talking about pigeons, making these types of choices between a little bit of food now or a little bit of food a minute from now or rats, or like dozens of species of animals tested, including humans, the tendency is pretty consistently that we discount hyperbolically rather than exponentially."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "And what exponentially means is that every unit of time is associated with the same proportional reduction."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "Every unit of delay is associated with the same, causes the same proportional reduction in value."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "And that's the way the compound interest rate works."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "Every day you get this sort of out of whatever values in there at the beginning of that day, you get this, we'll give you this amount of extra money to compensate you for that delay."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "But then the way that all animals tend to function is of this very different way where the reductions, the initial, that initial delay, so like one day's worth of delay, you see a much stronger discounting rate or reduction in value than you do over those."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "So you see the super proportional, then it changes to these lesser rates."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "And so the implication of that, I know I've gone like really into the weeds quantitatively, but what that means is that there's these preference reversals."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "When you have curves of that nature, the decay that's hyperbolic, it maps onto this phenomenon we see both in terms of how people deal with future rewards, but also how perception works."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "When two things are far away, whether it's physical distance or whether in terms of perception or whether it's in terms of time, when you're really far away, the value, the subjective value for that further, that delayed reward is larger."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "So for example, like, let's say we're talking about 360, 364 days from now, you can get $9 or 365 days a year."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Now you get $10 and you're like, dude, it's like, it's a year, like no difference."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "Like I'll take, why not get one more dollar?"}, {"time": 3869, "text": "You bring that same exact set of choices closer."}, {"time": 3871, "text": "Nothing's changed other than the time to both rewards."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "And it's like, would you rather have $9 today or $10 tomorrow and plenty of people would say, eh, just about the same, let's go ahead and take it today."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "So you see this preference reversal."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "And so that's a model of addiction in the sense that consistently with true addiction, I would argue, you see this competition between molar and molecular utility."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "It's like interpersonal, like within the person competing agents."}, {"time": 3907, "text": "Someone sometimes has control of the bus that wants to do what's good for you in the short term."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "And someone at other times is in control of driving the bus and they want to do what's good for you in the long term."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "So you tell the, you're trying to quit and you see a doctor, you see your 12 step therapist and say, God, I know this stuff is killing me."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "Like, I'm really, I'm on the path, like I'm done."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "And that's when you're kind of in their office or wherever you're not, it's not around you."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "And then later on that day, your buddy says that, hey man, I just scored."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "I got it right here."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "Do you want it?"}, {"time": 3944, "text": "And that reward is right in front of you."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "That's like bringing those two choices right in front of you."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "And it's like, hell yeah, I want to use."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "And then you can go through that cycle for like years of the person telling themselves, I want to quit."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "But then other times that same person is saying, I don't want to, you know, functionally, they're saying, I don't want to, because they're saying, yeah, like, yeah, give me some."}, {"time": 3964, "text": "So in the moment, it's very difficult to quit."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "And this isn't just something, this is something that has huge clinical ramifications with addiction, but it's like all humans do it."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "Anyone who's hit the snooze alarm in the morning, like the night before they realize, oh, I got to get up extra early tomorrow."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "That's what's ultimately better for me."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "So I'm going to set the alarm for, you know, 5 a.m. And it goes off at 5 a.m., you know, and then, so now those two consequences have come sooner and it's like, what the hell?"}, {"time": 3995, "text": "And they hit the snooze alarm."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "And sometimes not just once, but then five minutes later and five minutes later, you know, and so, and it's why it's easier to exercise self control at the grocery store compared to in your fridge."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "Like if that snack is like 30 seconds away in your fridge, you're going to more likely yield to temptation than if it is further away."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "So then just take a step back to something you brought up earlier, the inelasticity of pricing."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "Is it from a perspective of the dealers, whether we're talking about cigarettes or maybe venturing slightly into the illegal realm, you know, of people who sell drugs illegally, they also have an economics to them that they set prices and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "Does addiction allow you to mess with the nature of pricing?"}, {"time": 4055, "text": "Like, so I kind of assume that you meant that there's a correlation between things you're addicted to and the inelasticity of the price."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "So you can jack up the price."}, {"time": 4066, "text": "Is there something interesting to be said both for legal drugs and illegal drugs about the kind of price games you can play because the consumers of the product are addicted?"}, {"time": 4083, "text": "Right, I mean, I think you just described it."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "Yeah, you can jack up the price and you know, some people are going to drop off, but the people, you know, and it's not dichotomous because you could just consume less, but some people are going to consume less and the people that are most addicted are going to keep, you know, I mean, you see this, they're going to keep purchasing."}, {"time": 4103,

where most drug, I was, I mean, I don't know, maybe you can correct me, but it seems like most drugs are currently illegal."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "And so, but there's still an economics to them,

you're actually making things worse."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "I mean, I'm all about reducing the problems associated with drugs and drug addictions."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "And part of that is the, are more direct consequences of those drugs themselves, but a whole lot is what you get from indirectly and, you know, sort of the, both for the individual and for society."}, {"time": 4322,

growing up in deeper poverty because you've essentially levied a tax onto this person who's heavily addicted."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "But then at the societal level, you know, so everything we know about the drug war in terms of the heavy criminalization and filling up prisons and reducing employment and educational opportunities, which in the big picture, we know are the things that in a free

that involves cocaine and the other, how do you do a study involving sexual decision making?"}, {"time": 5533, "text": "And then how do you do a study that combines both?"}, {"time": 5536, "text": "Yeah, sex and drugs too."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "I'm just missing the rock and roll."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "It's like the two controversial, rock and roll isn't very controversial anymore."}, {"time": 5543, "text": "Yeah, so the cocaine, lots of hoops to jump through."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "You gotta have a lot of medical support."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "You gotta be at a basically an institution, a research unit like I'm at that has a long history and the ability to do that and get ethics approval, get FDA approval, but it's possible."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "And whenever you're dealing with something like cocaine, you would never wanna give that to someone who hasn't already used cocaine."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "And you wanna make sure you're not giving it to someone who is an active user who wants to quit."}, {"time": 5573, "text": "So the idea is like, okay, if you're using this type of drug anyway, and we're really sure you're not looking to quit, hey, use a couple of times in the lab with us so we can at least learn something."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "And part of what we learn is maybe to help people not use and it'll reduce the harms of cocaine."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "So there's hoops to jump through."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "With the sexual decision making, I looked at the main thing I looked at was this model of I applied delayed discounting to what we talked about earlier, the now versus later, that kind of decision making that goes along with addiction."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "I applied that to condom use decisions."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "And I've done probably published about 20 or so papers with this and different drugs."}, {"time": 5616, "text": "So the primary metric is whether you do or don't use a condom?"}, {"time": 5620, "text": "Right, and so this is using hypothetical decision making, but I've published some studies looking at, showing a tight correspondence to self report it in correlational studies to self reported behavior."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "So this is like, so like how do you, did you do a questionnaire kind of thing?"}, {"time": 5639, "text": "Right, so it's not quite a questionnaire, but it's a behavioral task requiring them to respond to."}, {"time": 5648, "text": "So you show pictures of a bunch of individuals and it's kind of like one of these fun behavioral, like a lot of them you get like numbers are boring, but it's like, okay, hot or not, like which of these 60 people would you have a one night stand with?"}, {"time": 5660, "text": "Men, women, so pick whatever you like, a little bit of this, a little bit of that, whatever you're into, it's all variety there."}, {"time": 5666, "text": "Out of that group, you pick some subsets of people."}, {"time": 5669, "text": "Who do you think is the one you most want to have sex with the least, he thinks most likely to have an STI or least likely a sexually transmitted disease by STI."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "And then you could do certain decision making questions."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "So what I've done is asked, say this person you read a vignette, this person wants to have sex with you now you've met them, you get along casual sex scenario, like a one night stand with a condoms available, just rate your likelihood from one to 100 on this kind of scale, would you use it?"}, {"time": 5697, "text": "But then you can change your scenario to say, okay, now imagine you have to wait five minutes to use a condom."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "So the choice is now instead of using condom versus not in terms of your likelihood scale, it now what ranges from have sex now without a condom versus on the other end of the scale is wait five minutes to have sex with a condom."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "So you rate your likelihood of where your behavior would be along that continuum."}, {"time": 5720, "text": "And then you could say, okay, well, what about an hour?"}, {"time": 5722, "text": "What about three hours?"}, {"time": 5723, "text": "What about 24 hours?"}, {"time": 5725, "text": "Misunderstanding, now without a condom or five minutes later with a condom?"}, {"time": 5733, "text": "So what's supposed to be the preference for the person?"}, {"time": 5741, "text": "There's a lot of factors coming into play, right?"}, {"time": 5744, "text": "There's like pleasure, a personal preference and then there's also the safety."}, {"time": 5751, "text": "Those are two like, are those competing objectives?"}, {"time": 5755, "text": "Right, and so we do get at that through some individual measures and this task is more of a face valid task where there's a lot underneath the hood."}, {"time": 5762, "text": "So for most people, sex with the condom is the better reward but underneath the hood of that is just at the purely physical level, they'd rather have sex without the condom."}, {"time": 5773, "text": "It's gonna feel better."}, {"time": 5774, "text": "What do you mean by reward?"}, {"time": 5775, "text": "Like when they calculate their trajectory through life and try to optimize it, then sex with the condom is a good idea?"}, {"time": 5784, "text": "Well, it's really based on, I mean, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 5787, "text": "Presumably that's the case that there's, but it's measured by like what would you, really that first question where there is no delay."}, {"time": 5795, "text": "Most people say they would be at the higher end scale a lot of times 100% they would say they would definitely use a condom."}, {"time": 5801, "text": "Not everybody and that we know that's the case."}, {"time": 5803, "text": "See, it's like that some people don't like condoms, some people say, yeah, I wanna use a condom but quarter of the time ended up not because I just getting lost in the passion of the moment."}, {"time": 5813, "text": "So for the people, I mean, the only reason that people, so behaviorally speaking, at least for a large number of people in many circumstances condom use as a reinforcer just because people do it."}, {"time": 5823, "text": "Like, why are they doing it?"}, {"time": 5827, "text": "They're not because it makes the sex feel better but because it makes that it allows for at least the same general reward."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "Even if actually, even if it feels a little bit not as good with the condom, nonetheless, they get most of the benefit without the concurrent, oh my gosh, there's this risk of either unwanted pregnancy or getting HIV or way more likely than HIV, herpes in general awards, et cetera, all the lovely ones."}, {"time": 5857, "text": "And we've actually done research saying like where we gauge the probability of these individual different SDIs."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "And it's like, what's the heavy hitter in terms of what people are using to judge and to evaluate whether they're gonna use a condom."}, {"time": 5869, "text": "So that's why the condom use is the delayed thing, five minutes or more."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "And then, yeah, because that's the prefer."}, {"time": 5876, "text": "Which would normally be the larger later reward like the $10 versus the nine, it's like the $10, which is counterintuitive if you just think about the physical pleasure."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "So that's a good thing to measure."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "So condom use is a really good concrete, quantifiable thing that you can use in a study."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "And then you can add a lot of different elements like the presence of cocaine and so on."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "Yeah, you can get people loaded on like any number of drugs like cocaine, alcohol and methamphetamine are the three that I've done and published on."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "And it's interesting that."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "These are fun studies, man."}, {"time": 5908, "text": "Right, I love to get people loaded in a safe context and like, but to really, it started, like there was some early research with alcohol."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "I mean, the psychedelics are the most interesting, but it's like all of these drugs are fascinating."}, {"time": 5920, "text": "The fact that all of these are keys that unlock a certain like psychological experience in the head."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "And so there was this work with alcohol that showed that it didn't affect those monetary delay discounting decisions, $9 now versus $10 later."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "And I'm like getting people drunk."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "And I thought to myself, are you telling me that getting someone, that people being drunk does not cause people at least sometimes to make, to choose what's good for them in the short term at the expense of what's good for them in the long term."}, {"time": 5953, "text": "It's like, bullshit, like we see like, but in what context does that happen?"}, {"time": 5959, "text": "So that's something that inspired me to go in this direction of like, aha, risky sexual decisions is something they do when they're drunk."}, {"time": 5967, "text": "They don't necessarily go home."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "And even though some people have gambling problems and alcohol interacts with that, the most typical thing is not for people to go home, log on and change their allocation in their retirement account or something like that."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "But they're more likely, risky sexual decisions, they're more likely to not wait the five minutes for the condom and instead go no condom now."}, {"time": 5988, "text": "Right, that's a big effect."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "And we see that."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "And interestingly, we do not see, with those different drugs, we don't see an effect if we just look at that zero delay condition."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "In other words, the condoms right there waiting to be used, how likely are to use it?"}, {"time": 6000, "text": "You don't see it."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "I mean, people are by and large gonna use the condom."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "So, and that's the way most of this research outside of behavioral economics that just looked at condom use decisions, very little of which has ever actually administered the drugs, which is another unique aspect."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "But they usually just look at like assuming the condom is there."}, {"time": 6020, "text": "But this is more using behavioral economics to delve in and model something that, and I've done survey research on this, modeling what actually happens."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "Like you meet someone at a laundromat, like you weren't planning on like, and it's like one thing leads to another, they live around the corner, these things."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "And like we did one survey with men who have sex with men and found that 25% of them, 24%, about a quarter, reported in the last six months that they had unprotected anal intercourse, which is the most risky in terms of sexually transmitted infection."}, {"time": 6058, "text": "In the last six months, in a situation where they would have used a condom, but they simply didn't use one just because they didn't have one on them."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "So this to me, it's like, if unless we delve into this and understand this, these suboptimal conditions, we're not gonna fully address the problem."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "There's plenty of people that say, yep, condom use is good."}, {"time": 6077, "text": "I use it a lot of the time."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "It's like, where is that failing?"}, {"time": 6081, "text": "And it's under these suboptimal conditions, which in Frank, if you think about it, it's like most of the case."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "Action is unfolding, things are getting hot and heavy."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "Someone's like, do you got a condom?"}, {"time": 6091, "text": "Eh, no."}, {"time": 6092, "text": "It's like, do they break the action and take 10 minutes to go to the convenience store or whatever?"}, {"time": 6098, "text": "Maybe everything's closed."}, {"time": 6099, "text": "Maybe they gotta wait till tomorrow."}, {"time": 6102, "text": "And there's something to be studied there on the, that just seems like an unfortunate set of circumstances."}, {"time": 6109, "text": "Like, what's the solution to that is, I mean, what's the psychology that needs to be taken apart there?"}, {"time": 6120, "text": "Because it just seems like that's the way of life."}, {"time": 6122, "text": "We don't expect the things to happen."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "Are we supposed to expect them better to be self aware enough about our calculations?"}, {"time": 6131, "text": "Or you see the 10 minute detour to a convenience store as a kind of thing that we need to understand how we humans evaluate the cost of that."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "I think in terms of like how we use this to help people, it's mostly on the environment side, rather than on the individual side."}, {"time": 6154, "text": "Yeah, although those interact."}, {"time": 6156, "text": "So it's like, in one sense, if you're, especially if you're gonna be drinking or using another substance that is associated with a stimulant, alcohol and stimulants go along with risky sex."}, {"time": 6167, "text": "Good to be aware that you might make decisions just to tell yourself you might make a decision that you wouldn't have made in your sober state."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "And so, hey, throwing a condom in the purse, in the pocket, might be a good idea."}, {"time": 6180, "text": "I think at the environmental level, just more condom, I mean, it highlights what we know about just making condoms widely available."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "Something that I'd like to do is like reinforcing condom use."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "So just getting people used to carrying a condom everywhere they go."}, {"time": 6198, "text": "Because once it's in someone's habit, if they are, say, like a young, single person, and they occasionally have unprotected sex, like training those people, like what if you got a text message once every few days saying, ah, if you send back a photo of a condom, within a minute you get a reward of $5."}, {"time": 6217, "text": "You could shape that up like that."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "It's a process called contingency management."}, {"time": 6220, "text": "It's basically just straight up operant reinforcement."}, {"time": 6223, "text": "You could shape that up with no problem."}, {"time": 6225, "text": "And I mean, those procedures of contingency management, giving people systematic rewards is like, for example, the most powerful way to reduce cocaine use in addicted people."}, {"time": 6237, "text": "And by saying, if you show me a negative urine for cocaine, I'm gonna give you a monetary reward."}, {"time": 6245, "text": "And like that has huge effects in terms of decreasing cocaine use."}, {"time": 6249, "text": "If that can be that powerful for something like stopping cocaine use, how powerful could that be for shaping up just carrying a condom?"}, {"time": 6256, "text": "Because the primary, unlike cocaine use, here, we're not saying you can't have the main reward, like you could still have sex, and you can even have sex in the way that you tell yourself you'd rather do it if the condom is available."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "Relatively speaking, it's way easier than like not using cocaine if you like using cocaine."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "It's just basically getting in the habit of carrying a condom."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "So that's just one idea of like why."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "There could be also the capitalistic solutions of like, there could be a business opportunity for like a door dash for condoms."}, {"time": 6292, "text": "Like delivery."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "I thought about this."}, {"time": 6295, "text": "Within five minute delivery of a condom at any location, like Uber for condoms."}, {"time": 6299, "text": "I've thought about it, not with condoms, but a very similar line of thinking, a line that you're going into in terms of Uber and people getting drunk when they enter the bar playing to have one or two, they ended up having five or six, and it's like, okay, yeah, you can take the cab home, the Uber home, but you've left your car there."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "It might get towed."}, {"time": 6318, "text": "You might like, there's also the hassle of just, you wanna wake up tomorrow with your hangover and forget about it and move on."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "And I think a lot of people in their situation, they're like, screw it."}, {"time": 6327, "text": "I'm gonna take the risk, just get it."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "What if you had an Uber service where two, you have a car come out with two drivers and one of them, two sober drivers, obviously, and the person, the one driver drops off the other that then drives you home in their car, in your car, so that you can, I mean, I think a lot of people would pay 50 bucks."}, {"time": 6359, "text": "It's gonna be more than a regular Uber, but it's like, it's gonna be done."}, {"time": 6362, "text": "I got the money."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "I already spent 60 bucks at the bar tonight."}, {"time": 6366, "text": "Like, just get the damn thing done tomorrow."}, {"time": 6369, "text": "I'm done with it."}, {"time": 6370, "text": "I wake up, my car's in front of my house."}, {"time": 6372, "text": "I think that would be, I think someone could, I'm not gonna open that business, so if anyone hears this and wants to take off with that, I think it could help a lot of people."}, {"time": 6381, "text": "And Uber itself, I would say, helped a huge amount of people, just making it easy to make the decision of going home, not driving yourself."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "I read about in Austin where they, I don't know where it's at now, where they outlawed Uber for a while."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "You know, because of the whole taxicab union type thing and how just, yeah, there were like hordes of drunk people that were used to Uber that now didn't have a cheap alternative."}, {"time": 6407, "text": "So just, we didn't exactly mention, you've done a lot of studies in sexual decision making with different drugs."}, {"time": 6415, "text": "Is there some interesting insights or findings on the difference between the different drugs?"}, {"time": 6423, "text": "So I think you said meth as well."}, {"time": 6426, "text": "So cocaine, is there some interesting characteristics about decision making that these drugs alter versus like alcohol, all those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 6434, "text": "I think, and there's much more to study with this, but I think the biggie there is that the stimulants, they create risky sex by really increasing the rewarding value of sex."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "Like if you talk to people that are really, especially that are hooked on stimulants, one of the biggies is like sex on coke or meth is like so much better than sex without."}, {"time": 6455, "text": "And that's a big part of why they have trouble quitting because it's so tied to their sex life."}, {"time": 6461, "text": "So it's not that your decision making is broken, it's just that you, well, you allocate."}, {"time": 6466, "text": "It's a different aspect of their decision."}, {"time": 6468, "text": "Yeah, on the reward side."}, {"time": 6469, "text": "I think on the alcohol, it works more through disinhibition."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "It's like, alcohol is really good at reducing the ability of a delayed punisher to have an effect on current behavior."}, {"time": 6480, "text": "In other words, there's this bad thing that's gonna happen tomorrow or a week from now or 20 years from now."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "Being drunk is a really good way, and you see this in like rats making decisions."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "A high dose of alcohol makes someone less sensitive to those consequences."}, {"time": 6496, "text": "So I think that's the lever that's being hit with alcohol and it's the more, just the increasing the rewarding value of sex by the psycho stimulants on that side."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "We actually found that it, and it was amazing because like hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent by NIH to study the connection between cocaine and HIV."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "Like we ran the first study on my grant that like actually just gave people cocaine under double blind conditions and showed that like, yeah, when people are on coke, like their ratings of sexual desire, even though they're not in a sexual situation, yeah, you've shown them some pictures, but they're just saying they're horny."}, {"time": 6533, "text": "Like you get subjective ratings of like how much sexual desire are you feeling right now."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "People get horny when they're on stimulants."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "And a lot of people say, duh, if they really know these drugs."}, {"time": 6544, "text": "But that's a rigorous study that's in the lab that shows like there's a plot."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "Right, the dose effects of that, the time course of that."},

"text": "Yeah, we didn't say horniness."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "We said sexual arousal, yeah, basically, yeah."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "There's a plot, I'm gonna find this plot."}, {"time": 6566, "text": "Right, I'll send it to you."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "There was one headline from some publicity on the work that said, horny cocaine users don't use condoms or something like that."},

{"time": 6583, "text": "So you've published a bunch of studies on psychedelics."}, {"time": 6587, "text": "Is there some especially favorite insightful findings from some of these that you could talk about?"}, {"time": 6595, "text": "So maybe favorite studies or just something that pops to mind in terms of both the goals and like the major insights gained and maybe the side little curiosities that you discovered along the way."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "Yeah, I think of the work with like using psilocybin to help people quit smoking."}, {"time": 6614, "text": "And we've talked about smoking being such a serious addiction and so that what inspired me to get into that was just kind of having like behavioral psychology as my primary lens, sort of this sort of like, you know, kind of radical empirical basis of, I'm really interested in the mystical experience and all of these reports, very interested."}, {"time": 6644, "text": "And, but at the same time, I'm like, okay, let's get down to some behavior change and something that we can record, like quantitatively verify biologically."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "So find all kinds of negative behaviors that people practice and see if we can turn those into positive or change their behavior."}, {"time": 6662, "text": "Right, like really change it, not just people saying, which again is interesting, I'm not dismissing it, but folks that say my life has turned around, I feel this has completely changed me."}, {"time": 6671, "text": "It's like, yep, that's good."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "All right, let's see if we can harness that and test that."}, {"time": 6676, "text": "And just something that's real behavior change."}, {"time": 6681, "text": "It's quantifiable."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "It's like, okay, you've been smoking for 30 years, you know, like that's a real thing."}, {"time": 6686, "text": "And you've tried a dozen times, like seriously to quit and you haven't been able to long term, like, okay."},

a cup and we'll test that."}, {"time": 6700, "text": "And we'll have you blow into this little machine that measures carbon monoxide and we'll test that."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "So multiple levels of biological verification."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "Like now we're getting like, to me that's where the rubber meets the road in terms of like therapeutics."}, {"time": 6713, "text": "It's like, can we really shift behavior?"}, {"time": 6715, "text": "And since, and so much as we've talked about my other scientific work outside of psychedelics is about understanding addiction and drug use."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "So it's like, you know, looking at addiction, it's a no brainer and smoking is just a great example."}, {"time": 6727, "text": "And so back to your question, like we've had really high success rates."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "I mean, it really, it rivals anything that's been published in the scientific literature."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "The caveat is that, you know, that's based on our initial trial of only 15 people, but extremely high longterm success rates, 80% at six months per smoke free."}, {"time": 6747, "text": "So can we discuss the details of this?"},

they described this, a perceptual level."}, {"time": 7844, "text": "So most people have that when, whether they're looking at the room without the eyeshades on or inside their mind's eye with the eyeshades on, colors, sounds like this, it's a much richer sensorium, which can be very interesting."}, {"time": 7862, "text": "And then at another level, a master's in Houston called it the psychodynamic level."}, {"time": 7868, "text": "And I think you could think about it more broadly than, that's kind of Jungian, but just the personal psychological levels, how I think of it, like this

they love people."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "Like in a way, for people that they'd love their family, but it just hits them so hard that how important this is and the magnitude of that love and what that means in their life."}, {"time": 7914, "text": "So those are some of the most moving experiences to be present for is where people like it hits home, like what really matters in their life."}, {"time": 7922, "text": "And then you have this sort of what masters in Houston called the archetypal realm, which again is sort of Jungian with the focus on archetypes, which is interesting, but I think of that more generally as like symbolic level."}, {"time": 7935, "text": "So just really deep experiences where you have, you do have experiences that seem symbolic of, very much in like what we know about dreaming and what most people think about dreaming, like there's this randomness of things, but sometimes it's pretty clear in retrospect, oh, like this came up because this thing has been on my mind recently."}, {"time": 7956, "text": "So it seems to be, there seems to be this symbolic level."}, {"time": 7960, "text": "And then they have this, the last level that they describe is the mystical integral level, which this is where there's lots of terms for it, but transcendental experiences, experiences of unity, mystical type effects we often measure."}, {"time": 7976, "text": "Europeans use a scale that will refer to oceanic boundlessness."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "This is all pretty much the same thing."}, {"time": 7982, "text": "This is like at some sense, the deepest level of the very sense of self seems to be dissolved, minimize, or expanded, such that the boundaries of the self go into in here."}, {"time": 7996, "text": "I think some of this is just semantics,

shift or sense of loss of sense of self or self boundaries."}, {"time": 8013, "text": "And that's like the most, typically when people have that experience, they'll often report that as being the most remarkable thing."}, {"time": 8020, "text": "And this is what you don't typically get with MDMA, these deepest levels of the nature of reality itself, the subjectivity and objectivity, just like the seer and the seen become one, and it's a process, and yeah."}, {"time": 8038, "text": "And they're able to bring that experience back and be able to describe it?"}, {"time": 8046, "text": "Yeah, but one of the, to a degree, but one of the hallmarks going back to William James of describing a mystical experience is the ineffability."}, {"time": 8055, "text": "And so even though it's ineffable, people try as far as they can to describe it, but when you get the real deal, they'll say, and even though they say a lot of helpful things to help you describe the landscape, they'll say, no matter what I say, I'm still not even coming anywhere close to what this was."}, {"time": 8071, "text": "Like the language is completely failing."}, {"time": 8074, "text": "And I like to joke that even though it's ineffable, and we're researchers, so we try to eff it up by asking them to describe the experience."}, {"time": 8081, "text": "I love it, it's a good one."}, {"time": 8084, "text": "But to bring it back a little bit, so for that particular study on tobacco, what was the results, what was the conclusions in terms of the impact of psilocybin on their addiction?"}, {"time": 8099, "text":

followup?"}, {"time": 8108, "text": "And the answer to that was absolutely, because the success rates were so high, 80% biologically confirmed successful at six months, that held up to 60% biologically confirmed abstinent at an average of two and a half years, a very long fall."}, {"time": 8122, "text": "Yeah, and so, I mean, the best that's been reported in the literature for smoking cessation is in the upper 50%, and that's with not one, but two medications for a couple of months, followed by regular cognitive behavioral therapy, where you're coming in once a week or once every few weeks for an entire year."}, {"time": 8141, "text": "And so it was very heavy."}, {"time": 8144, "text": "This is just like a few uses of psilocybin?"}, {"time": 8148, "text": "So this was three doses of psilocybin over a total course, including preparation, everything, a 15 week period, where there's mainly like, for most part, one meeting a week, and then the three sessions are within that."}, {"time": 8160, "text": "And so it's, and we scaled that back in the more, the study we're doing right now, which I can tell you about, which is a randomized controlled trial."}, {"time":

hustled up some money to actually be able to afford a larger trial."}, {"time": 8188, "text": "So it's randomizing 80 people to get either one psilocybin session, we've scaled that down from three to one, mainly because we're doing fMRI neuroimaging before and after, and it made it more experimentally complex to have multiple sessions."}, {"time": 8205, "text": "But one psilocybin session versus the nicotine patch using the FDA approved label, like standard use of the nicotine patch."}, {"time": 8213, "text": "So it's randomized, 40 people get randomized to psilocybin, one session, 40 people get nicotine patch."}, {"time": 8220, "text": "And they all get the same cognitive behavioral therapy sort of the standard talk therapy."}, {"time": 8223, "text": "And we've scaled it down somewhat, so there's less weekly meetings, but it's within the same ballpark."}, {"time": 8229, "text": "And right now we're still, the study's still ongoing."}, {"time": 8236, "text": "And in fact, we just recently started recruiting again, we paused for COVID."}, {"time": 8239, "text": "Now we're starting back up with some protections like masks and whatnot."}, {"time": 8243, "text": "But right now for the 44 people who have gotten through the one year followup, and so that includes 22 from each of the two groups, the success rates are extremely high."}, {"time": 8256, "text": "For the psilocybin group, it's 59% have been biologically confirmed as smoke free at one year after their quit date."}, {"time": 8263, "text": "And that compares to 27% for the nicotine patch, which by the way is extremely good for the nicotine patch compared to previous research."}, {"time": 8273, "text": "So the results could change because it's ongoing, but we're mostly done and it's still looking extremely positive."}, {"time": 8281, "text": "So if anyone's interested, they have to be sort of be in commuting distance to the Baltimore area, but you know."}, {"time": 8286, "text": "To participate."},

interesting."}, {"time": 8297, "text": "And I think a lot of people listening to this, so now it's anywhere from 300 to 600,000 people for just a regular podcast."}, {"time": 8307, "text": "I know a lot of them will be very interested in what you're saying and they're going to look you up."}, {"time": 8312, "text": "They're going to find your email and they're going to write you a long email about some of the interesting things they've found in any of your papers."}, {"time": 8323, "text": "How should people contact you?"}, {"time": 8325, "text": "What is the best way for that?"},

people communicate with you?"}, {"time": 8336, "text": "Thanks for bringing this up."}, {"time": 8337, "text": "This is a, I'm glad to get the opportunity to address this."}, {"time": 8341, "text": "If someone's interested in participating in a study, the best thing to do is go to the website."}, {"time": 8348, "text": "Of the study or of like, yeah, which website?"}, {"time": 8353, "text": "So we have all of our psilocybin studies."}, {"time": 8355, "text": "So everything we have is up on one website and then we link to the different study websites, but hopkinspsychedelic.org."}, {"time": 8364, "text": "So everything we do, or if you don't remember that, just go to your favorite search engine and look up Johns Hopkins Psychedelic and you're going to find one of the first hits is going to be our, is this website."}, {"time": 8375, "text": "And there's going to be links to the smoking study and all of our other studies."}, {"time": 8379, "text": "If there's no link to it there, we don't have a study on it now."}, {"time": 8382, "text": "And if you're interested in psychedelic research more broadly, you can look up, like at another university that might be closer to you."}, {"time": 8389, "text": "And there's a handful of them now across the country."}, {"time": 8392, "text": "And there's some in Europe that have studies going on, but you can, at least in the US, you can look at clinicaltrials.gov and look up the term psilocybin."}, {"time": 8402, "text": "And in fact, optionally people even in Europe can register their trial on there."}, {"time": 8406, "text": "So that's a good way to find studies."}, {"time": 8407, "text": "But for our research, rather than emailing me, like a more efficient way is to go straight and you can do that first, the first phase of screening."}, {"time": 8417, "text": "There's some questions online and then someone will get back in touch with you."}, {"time": 8421, "text": "But I do already, you know, and I expect it's like going to increase, but I'm already at the level where my simple limited mind and limited capacity is already, I sometimes fail to get back to emails."}, {"time": 8437, "text": "I mean, I'm trying to respond to my colleagues, my mentees, all these things, my responsibilities."}, {"time": 8443, "text": "And as many of the people just inquiring about I wanna go to graduate school, I'm interested in this, I had this, I have a daughter that took a psychedelic and she's having trouble."}, {"time": 8451, "text": "And it's like, I try to respond to those, but sometimes I just simply can't get to all of it already."}, {"time": 8458, "text": "To be honest, like from my perspective, it's been quite heartbreaking because I basically don't respond to any emails anymore."}, {"time": 8467, "text": "And especially as you mentioned mentees and so on, like outside of that circle, it's heartbreaking to me how many brilliant people there are, thoughtful people, like loving people."}, {"time": 8479, "text": "And they write long emails that are really, by the way, I do read them very often."}, {"time": 8486, "text": "It's just that I don't, the response is then you're starting a conversation."}, {"time": 8491, "text": "And the heartbreaking aspect is you only have so many hours in the day to have deep, meaningful conversations with human beings on this earth."}, {"time": 8500, "text": "And so you have to select who they are."}, {"time": 8502, "text": "And usually it's your family, it's people like you're directly working with."}, {"time": 8506, "text": "And even I guarantee you with this conversation, people will write you long, really thoughtful emails."}, {"time": 8514, "text": "Like there'll be brilliant people, faculty from all over, PhD students from all over."}, {"time": 8519, "text": "And it's heartbreaking because you can't really get back to them."}, {"time": 8521, "text": "But you're saying like many of them, if you do respond, it's more like here, go to this website when you're interested into the study, just it makes sense to directly go to the site if there's applications open, just apply for the study."}, {"time": 8536, "text": "Right, right, right, as either a volunteer or if we're looking for somebody, we're gonna be posting, including on the Hopkins University website, we're gonna be posting if we're looking for a position."}, {"time": 8550, "text": "I am right now actually looking through and it's mainly been through email and contacts, but should I say it?"}, {"time": 8557, "text": "I think I'd rather cast my nets wide, but I'm looking for a postdoc right now."}, {"time": 8561, "text": "So I've mentored postdocs for, I don't know, like a dozen years or so."}, {"time": 8566, "text": "And more and more of their time is being spent on psychedelics."}, {"time": 8570, "text": "So someone's free to contact me."}, {"time": 8572, "text": "That's more of a, that's sort of so close to home."}, {"time": 8574, "text": "That's a personal, you know, that like emailing me about that."}, {"time": 8578, "text": "But I come to appreciate more the advice that folks like Tim Ferriss have of like, I think it's him, like five cents emails, you know, like a subject that gets to the point that tells you what it's about so that like you break through the signal to the noise."}, {"time": 8594, "text": "But I really appreciate what you're saying because part of the equation for me is like, I have a three year old, and like my time on the ground, on the floor, playing blocks or cars with him is part of that equation."}, {"time": 8605, "text": "And even if the day is ending and I know some of those emails are slipping by and I'll never get back to them."}, {"time": 8610, "text": "And I have, I'm struggling with it already."}, {"time": 8612, "text": "And I get what you're saying is like, I haven't seen anything yet if with the type of exposure that like your podcast gets."}, {"time": 8619, "text": "This will bring in exposure."}, {"time": 8620, "text": "And then I think in terms of postdocs, this is a really good podcast in the sense that there's a lot of brilliant PhD students out there that are looking for a poster from all over, from MIT, probably from Hopkins, it's just all over the place."}, {"time": 8633, "text": "So this is, and I, we have different preferences, but my preference would also be to have like a form that they could fill out for posts."}, {"time": 8641, "text": "Because, you know, it's very difficult through email to tell who's really going to be a strong collaborator for you, like a strong postdoc, strong student, because you want a bunch of details, but at the same time, you don't want a million pages worth of email."}, {"time": 8659, "text": "So you want a little bit of application process."}, {"time": 8661, "text": "So usually you set up a form that helps me indicate how passionate the person is, how willing they are to do hard work."}, {"time": 8673, "text": "Like I often ask a question, people of what do you think is more important to work hard or to work smart?"}, {"time": 8681, "text": "And I use that, those types of questions to indicate who I would like to work with."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "Because it's counterintuitive."}, {"time": 8691, "text": "But anyway, I'll leave that question unanswered for people to figure out themselves."}, {"time": 8697, "text": "But maybe if you know my love for David Goggins, you will understand."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "Those are good thoughts about the forms and everything."}, {"time": 8705, "text": "And that's something that evolves."}, {"time": 8707, "text": "Email is such a messy thing."}, {"time": 8709, "text": "There's, speaking of Baltimore, Cal Newport, if you know who that is, he wrote a book called Deep Work."}, {"time": 8719, "text": "He's a computer science professor and he's currently working on a book about email, about all the ways that email is broken."}, {"time": 8725, "text": "So this is gonna be a fascinating read."}, {"time": 8728, "text": "This is a little bit of a general question, but almost a bigger picture question that we touched on a little bit, but let's just touch it in a full way, which is what have all the psychedelic studies you've conducted taught you about the human mind, about the human brain and the human mind?"}, {"time": 8752, "text": "Is there something, if you look at the human scientists you were before this work and the scientists you are now, how has your understanding of the human mind changed?"}, {"time": 8763, "text": "I'm thinking of that in two categories."}, {"time": 8768, "text": "One kind of more scientific, and they're both scientific, but one more about the brain and behavior and the mind, so to speak."}, {"time": 8782, "text": "And as a behaviorist, all we see sort of the mind as a metaphor for behaviors, but anyway, that gets philosophical."}, {"time": 8790, "text": "But it's really increasing the, so the one category is increasing the appreciation for the magnitude of depth."}, {"time": 8803, "text": "I mean, so these are all metaphors of human experience."}, {"time": 8807, "text": "That might be a good way to, because you use certain words like consciousness and it's like we're using constructs that aren't well defined unless we kind of dig in, but human experience like that, the experiences on these compounds can be so far out there or so deep."}, {"time": 8828, "text": "And they're doing that by tinkering with the same machinery that's going on up there."}, {"time": 8833, "text": "I mean, my assumption, and I think it's a good assumption is that all experiences, there's a biological side to all phenomenal experience."}, {"time": 8845, "text": "So there is not, the divide between biology and experience or psychology is, it's not one or the other."}, {"time": 8858, "text": "These are just two sides of the same coin."}, {"time": 8863, "text": "I mean, you're avoiding the use of the word consciousness, for example, but the experience is referring to the subjective experience."}, {"time": 8870, "text": "So it's the actual technical use of the word consciousness of subjective experience."}, {"time": 8905, "text": "And that's why it's hard because like it's hard to imagine anything."}, {"time": 8909, "text": "But I think what I was getting is that psychedelics have done this by, the reason I was getting into the biology versus mind, psychology divide is that just to kind of set up the fact that I think all of our experience is related to these biological events."}, {"time": 8953, "text": "Okay, so that's always another side of the coin."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "So another way to put that is all of our subjective experience outside of drugs, it's all a controlled hallucination in a sense."}, {"time": 8967, "text": "Like this is completely constructed."}, {"time": 8968, "text": "Our experience of reality is completely a simulation."}, {"time": 8973, "text": "So I think we're on solid ground to say that that's our best guess and that's a pretty reasonable thing to say scientifically."}, {"time": 8981, "text": "Like all the rich complexity of the world emerges from just some biology and some chemicals."}, {"time": 8986, "text": "So in that definition implied a causation, it comes from."}, {"time": 8989, "text": "And so we know at least there's a solid correlation there."}, {"time": 8993, "text": "And so then we delve deep into the philosophy of like idealism or materialism and things like this, which I'm not an expert in, but I know we're getting into that territory."}, {"time": 9003, "text": "You don't even necessarily have to go there."}, {"time": 9006, "text": "Like you at least go to the level of like, okay, we know there seems to be this one on one correspondence and that seems pretty solid."}, {"time": 9014, "text": "Like you can't prove a negative and you can't prove, you know, it's in that category of like, you could come up with an experience that maybe doesn't have a biological correlate, but then you're talking about, there's also the limits of the science."}, {"time": 9025, "text": "Is it a false negative?"}, {"time": 9026, "text": "But I think our best guess and a very decent assumption is that every psychological event has a biological correlate."}, {"time": 9033, "text": "So with that said, you know, the idea that you can throw, alter that biology in a pretty trivial manner."}, {"time": 9077, "text": "Like that's the thing about psychedelics that just floors me and it never fails."}, {"time": 9114, "text": "Whether it's like therapeutically or just to understand the mind and you're like, and you're still floored, like how is that possible?"}, {"time": 9125, "text": "How did we slightly alter serotonergic neurotransmission and say, and this person is now saying that they're making fundamental differences in the priorities of their life after 60 years."}, {"time": 9139, "text": "It also just fills you with awe of the possibility of experiences we're yet to have uncovered."}, {"time": 9148, "text": "If just a few chemicals can change so much, it's like, man, what if this could be up?"}, {"time": 9156, "text": "I mean, like how, cause we're just like took a little, it's like lighting a match or something in the darkness and you could see there's a lot more there, but you don't know how much more."}, {"time": 9167, "text": "And that's."}, {"time": 9169, "text": "And then like, where's that gonna go with like, I mean, I'm always like aware of the fact that like we always as humans and as scientists think that we figured out 99% and we're working on that first 1%."}, {"time": 9179, "text": "And we gotta keep reminding ourselves, it's hard to do."}, {"time": 9181, "text": "Like we figured out like not even 1%, like we know nothing."}, {"time": 9233, "text": "And it becomes easy to combine within virtual reality where the virtual reality is gonna move from being something out here to being more in there."}, {"time": 9241, "text": "And then we're getting, like we talked about before, we're already in a virtual reality in terms of human perception and cognition models of the universe being all representations and sort of color not existing and just our representations of EM wavelengths, et cetera, sound, being vibrations and all of this."}, {"time": 9263, "text": "And so as the external VR and the internal VR come closer to each other, like this is what I think about in terms of the future of drugs."}, {"time": 9273, "text": "Like all of this stuff sort of combines and like where that goes is just, it's unthinkable."}, {"time": 9282, "text": "Like we were probably gonna, you know, again, I might sound like a fool and this may not happen, but I think it's possible, you know, to go completely offline, like where most of people's experiences maybe going into these internal worlds."}, {"time": 9298, "text": "And I mean, maybe you through some, through a combination of these techniques, you create experiences where someone could live a thousand years in terms of maybe they're living a regular lifespan, but in over the next two seconds, you're living a thousand years worth of experience."}, {"time": 9313, "text": "Inside your mind."}, {"time": 9315, "text": "Yeah, through this manipulation of them."}, {"time": 9316, "text": "Like, is that possible?"}, {"time": 9319, "text": "Like just based on like first principles and like."}, {"time": 9323, "text": "Yeah, first principles, yes."}, {"time": 9326, "text": "Like give us another 50, 100, 500, like who knows, but like how could it not go there?"}, {"time": 9333, "text": "In a small tangent, what are your thoughts in this broader definition of drugs, of psychedelics, of mind altering things?"}, {"time": 9342, "text": "What are your thoughts about Neuralink and brain computer interfaces, sort of being able to electrically stimulate and read neuronal activity in the brain and then connect that to the computer, which is another way from a computational perspective for me is kind of appealing, but it's another way of altering subtly the behavior of the brain."}, {"time": 9373, "text": "That's kind of, if you zoom out, reminiscent of the way psychedelics do as well."}, {"time": 9380, "text": "So what do you have?"}, {"time": 9382, "text": "Like what are your thoughts about Neuralink?"}, {"time": 9385, "text": "What are your hopes as a researcher of mind altering devices, systems, chemicals?"}, {"time": 9393, "text": "I guess broadly speaking, I'm all for it."}, {"time": 9396, "text": "I mean, for the same reason I am with psychedelics, but it comes with all the caveats."}, {"time": 9400, "text": "You know, you're going into a brave new world where it's like all of a sudden there's going to be a dark side."}, {"time": 9406, "text": "There's going to be serious ethical considerations, but that should not stop us from moving there."}, {"time": 9414, "text": "I mean, particularly the stuff from, and I'm no expert, but on the short list in the short term, it's like, yeah, can we help these serious neurological disorders?"}, {"time": 9422, "text": "Like, hell yeah."}, {"time": 9455, "text": "I forget what the example was, but something like, something that came off to some of my neuroscientific colleagues as an oversimplification, or at least the way they said it."}, {"time": 9464, "text": "Oh, from a Neuralink perspective."}, {"time": 9510, "text": "So I'm extremely sympathetic, and I'm a big fan of like what that, you know, what Elon Musk does, like tunnels through the ground, and SpaceX, and all this, just like, hell yeah, like this guy has some, he has some great ideas."}, {"time": 9523, "text": "And there's something to be said, it's not just the communication to the public."}, {"time": 9527, "text": "I think his first principles thinking, it's like, because I get this in the artificial intelligence world, it's probably similar to neuroscience world, where Elon will say something like, or I worked at MIT, I worked on autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 9540, "text": "And he's sort of, I could sense how much he pisses off like every roboticist at MIT, and everybody who works on like the human factor side of safety of autonomous vehicles, and saying like, nah, we don't need to consider human beings in the car, like the car will drive itself, it's obvious that neural networks is all you need."}, {"time": 9562, "text": "Like it's obvious that like we should be able to systems that should be able to learn constantly."},

why would we need anything else?"}, {"time": 9581, "text": "You just have to make a system that learns faster, and faster, and faster, and neural networks can do that."}, {"time": 9586, "text": "And so that's pissing off every single community."}, {"time": 9588, "text": "It's pissing off human factors community, saying you don't need to consider the human driver in the picture, you can just focus on the robotics problem."}, {"time": 9596, "text": "It's pissing off every robotics person for saying LIDAR can be just ignored, it can be camera."}, {"time": 9602, "text": "Every robotics person knows that camera is really noisy, that it's really difficult to deal with."}, {"time": 9608, "text": "But he's, and then every AI person who says, who hears neural networks, and says like, neural networks can learn everything, like almost presuming that it's kind of going to achieve general intelligence."}, {"time": 9622, "text": "The problem with all those haters in the three communities is that they're looking one year ahead, five years ahead."}, {"time": 9631, "text": "The hilarious thing about the, quote unquote, ridiculous things that Elon Musk is saying, is they have a pretty good shot at being true in 20 years."}, {"time": 9640, "text": "And so like, when you just look at the, you know, when you look at the progression of these kinds of predictions, and sometimes first principles thinking can allow you to do that, is you see that it's kind of obvious that things are going to progress this way."}, {"time": 9658, "text": "And if you just remove the prejudice you hold about the particular battles of the current academic environment, and just look at the big picture, the progression of the technology, you can usually see the world in the same kind of way."}, {"time": 9675, "text": "And so in that same way, looking at psychedelics, you can see like, there is so many exciting possibilities here if we fully engage in the research."}, {"time": 9684, "text": "Same thing with Neuralink."}, {"time": 9686, "text": "If we fully engage, so we go from a thousand channels of communication to the brain, to billions of channels of communication to the brain, and we figure out many of the details of how to do that safely with neurosurgery and so on, that the world would just change completely in the same kind of way that Elon is."}, {"time": 9707, "text": "It's so ridiculous to hear him talk about a symbiotic relationship between AI and the human brain."}, {"time": 9715, "text": "But it's like, is it though?"}, {"time": 9721, "text": "Because I can see in 50 years, that's going to be an obvious, like everyone will have, like obviously you have, like why are we typing stuff in the computer?"}, {"time": 9731, "text": "It doesn't make any sense."}, {"time": 9733, "text": "People used to type on a keyboard with a mouse?"}, {"time": 9737, "text": "And it seems pretty clear, like we're going to be there."}, {"time": 9739, "text": "Like, and the only question is like, what's the timeframe?"}, {"time": 9741, "text": "Is that going to be 20 or is it 50 or a hundred?"}, {"time": 9743, "text": "Like, how could we not?"}, {"time": 9745, "text": "And the thing that I guess upsets with Elon and others is the timeline he tends to do."}, {"time": 9751, "text": "I think a lot of people tend to do that kind of thing."}, {"time": 9753, "text": "I definitely do it, which is like, it'll be done this year versus like, it'll be done in 10 years."}, {"time": 9759, "text": "The timeline is a little bit too rushed, but from our leadership perspective, it inspires the engineers to do the best work of their life to really kind of believe, because to do the impossible, you have to first believe it, which is a really important aspect of innovation."}, {"time": 9775, "text": "And there's the delay discounting aspect I talked about before."}, {"time": 9778, "text": "It's like saying, oh, this is going to be a thing 20, 50 years from now."}, {"time": 9781, "text": "It's like, what motivates anybody?"}, {"time": 9784, "text": "And even if you're fudging it or like wishful thinking a little bit, or let's just say airing on one side of the probability distribution, like there's value in saying like, yeah, like there's a chance we could get this done in a year."}, {"time": 9798, "text": "And if you set a goal for a year and you're not successful, hey, you might get it done in three years."}, {"time": 9803, "text": "Whereas if you had aimed at 20 years, well, you either would have never done it at all, or you would have aimed at 20 years and then it would have taken you 10."}, {"time": 9809, "text": "So the other thing I think about this, like in terms of his work and I guess we've seen with psychedelics, it's like there's a lack of appreciation for like sort of the variability you need a natural selection, sort of extrapolating from biological, from evolution like, hey, maybe he's wrong about focusing only on the cameras and not these other things."}, {"time": 9832, "text": "Be empirically driven."}, {"time": 9833, "text": "It's like, yeah, you need to like when he's, when you need to get the regulation, is it safe

Psychedelic Medicine."}, {"time": 9919, "text": "So that's one side of it."}, {"time": 9920, "text": "You've kind of already mentioned that these terms can be a little bit misused or used in a variety of ways that they can be confusing."}, {"time": 9932, "text": "But in a specific way, as much as we can be specific about these things, about the actual heart problem of consciousness or understanding what is consciousness, this weird thing that it feels like, it feels like something to experience things."}, {"time": 9950, "text": "Have psychedelics given you some kind of insight on what is consciousness?"}, {"time": 9958, "text": "You've mentioned that it feels like psychedelics allows you to kind of dismantle your sense of self, like step outside of yourself."}, {"time": 9970, "text": "So that feels like somehow playing with this mechanism of consciousness."}, {"time": 9975, "text": "And if it is in fact playing with the mechanism of consciousness using just a few chemicals, it feels like we're very much in the neighborhood of being able to maybe understand the actual biological mechanisms of how consciousness can emerge from the brain."}, {"time": 9992, "text": "So yeah, there's a bunch there."}, {"time": 9994, "text": "I think my preface is that I certainly have opinions that I can say, here are my best speculations as just a person and an armchair philosopher."},

I'm hoping that that problem can be cracked."}, {"time": 10034, "text": "And as an armchair philosopher, I do think that is a problem."}, {"time": 10038, "text": "I don't think it can be dismissed as some people argue it's not even really a problem."}, {"time": 10042, "text": "It strikes me that explaining just the existence of phenomenal consciousness is a problem."}, {"time": 10047, "text": "So anyway, I very much keep that divide in mind when I talk about these things, what we can really say about what we've learned through science, including by psychedelics versus like what I can speculate on in terms of the nature of reality and consciousness."}, {"time": 10062, "text": "But in terms of, by and large, skeptically, I have to say psychedelics have not really taught us anything about the nature of consciousness."}, {"time": 10075, "text": "I'm hopeful that they will."}, {"time": 10077, "text": "They have been used around certain, I don't even know if features is the right term, but things that are called consciousness."}, {"time": 10084, "text": "So consciousness can refer to not only just phenomenal consciousness, which is like the source of the hard problem and what it is to be like Nagel's description, but the sense of self, which can be sort of like the experiential self moment to moment, or it can be like the narrative self, the stringing together of stories."},

so an interesting story emerged when it was found that when psilocybin is on board in the person's system, that there's less communication amongst these areas."}, {"time": 10169, "text": "So with resting state fMRI imaging, that there's less synchronization or presumably communication between these areas."}, {"time": 10178, "text": "And so I think it has been overstated in terms of, ah, we see this is like, this is the dissolving of the ego."}, {"time": 10186, "text": "The story made a whole lot of sense, but there's several, I think that story is really being challenged."}, {"time": 10193, "text": "Like one, we see increasing number of drugs that decouple that network, including ones like that aren't psychedelic."}, {"time": 10202, "text": "So this may just be a property, frankly, of being like, you know, screwed up, you know, like, you know, being out of your head, being like, like, you know."}, {"time": 10210, "text": "Anytime you mess with the perception system, maybe it screws up some, just our ability to just function in the holistically like we do in order, yeah, for the brain to perceive stuff, to be able to map it to memory, to connect things together, the whole recur mechanism that that could just be messed with."}, {"time": 10231, "text": "And it could, and I'm speculating, it could be tied to more if you had to download into the language, everyday language, like not feeling like yourself."}, {"time": 10237, "text": "Like, so whether that be like really drunk or really hopped up on amphetamine or, you know, like we found it like decoupling of the default mode network on salvinorin A, which is a smokable psychedelic, which is a non classic psychedelic, but another one where like DMT, where people are often talking to entities and that type of thing."}, {"time": 10255, "text": "That was a really fun study to run."}, {"time": 10257, "text": "But nonetheless, most people say it's not a classic psychedelic and doesn't have some of those phenomenal features that people report from classic psychedelics and not sort of the clear sort of ego loss type, at least not in the way that people report it with classic psychedelics."}, {"time": 10273, "text": "So you get it with all these different drugs."}, {"time": 10275, "text": "And so, and then you also see just broad, broad changes in network activity with other networks."}, {"time": 10281, "text": "And so I think that story took off a little too soon, although, so I think, and the story that the DMN, the default mode network relating to the self, and I know some neuroscientists, it drives them crazy if you say that it's the ego and that just like, but self referential processing, if you go that far, like that was already known before psychedelics."}, {"time": 10305, "text": "Psychedelics didn't really contribute to that."}, {"time": 10308, "text": "The idea that this type of brain network activity was related to a sense of self."}, {"time": 10316, "text": "But it is absolutely striking that psychedelics that people report with pretty high reliability, these unity experiences that where people subjectively, like they report losing or again, like the boundaries,

that's the same as the hard problem or the existence of phenomenal consciousness, because you can build an AI system, and you correct me if I'm wrong, that will pass a Turing test in terms of demonstrating the qualities of like a sense of self."}, {"time": 10357, "text": "It will talk as if there's a self and there's probably a certain like algorithm or whatever, like computational, like

10377, "text": "And we might find this with AI that like it works, having a sense of self, and that's stated incorrectly, like acting as if there is an agent at play and behaviorally acting like there is a self, that might kind of work."}, {"time": 10398, "text": "And so you can program a computer or a robot to basically demonstrate, have an algorithm like that and demonstrate that type of behavior."}, {"time": 10408, "text": "And I think that's completely silent on whether there's an actual experience inside there."}, {"time": 10413, "text": "I've been struggling to find the right words in how I feel about that whole thing, but because I've said it poorly before, I've before said that there's no difference between the appearance and the actual existence of consciousness or intelligence or any of that."}, {"time": 10431, "text": "What I really mean is the more the appearance starts to look like the thing, the more there's this area where it's like, I don't think, our whole idea of what is real and what is just an illusion is not the right way to think about it."}, {"time": 10456, "text": "So the whole idea is like, if you create a system that looks like it's having fun, the more it's realistically able to portray itself as having fun, like there's a certain gray area which the system is having fun."}, {"time": 10474, "text": "And same with intelligence, same with consciousness."}, {"time": 10476, "text": "And we humans wanna simplify, like it feels like the way we simplify the existence and the illusion of something is missing the whole truth of the nature of reality, which we're not yet able to understand."}, {"time": 10492, "text": "Like it's the 1%, we only understand 1% currently."}, {"time": 10495, "text": "So we don't have the right physics to talk about things, we don't have the right science to talk about things."}, {"time": 10500, "text": "But to me, like the faking it and actually it being true is the difference is much smaller than what humans would like to imagine."}, {"time": 10515, "text": "That's my intuition, but the philosophers hate that because, and guess what?"}, {"time": 10521, "text": "It's philosophers, what have you actually built?"}, {"time": 10523, "text": "So like to me is that's the difference in philosophy and engineering."}, {"time": 10528, "text": "It feels like if we push the creation, the engineering, like fake it until you make it all the way, which is like fake consciousness until you realize, holy crap, this thing is conscious."}, {"time": 10541, "text": "Fake intelligence until you realize, holy crap, this is intelligence."}, {"time": 10544, "text": "And from my curiosity with psychedelics and just neurobiology and neuroscience is like it feels, I love the armchair."}, {"time": 10555,

that's what the armchair does."}, {"time": 10566, "text": "Sometimes science prevents you from really thinking, wait, like it's really simple."}, {"time": 10574, "text": "There's something really simple."}, {"time": 10575, "text": "Like there's some, there could be some dance of chemicals that we're totally unaware of, not from aspects of like which chemicals to combine with which biological

actually exists."}, {"time": 10606, "text": "Like those weird sort of hypothetically, like maybe we're just thinking about the human mind totally wrong."}, {"time": 10613, "text": "Maybe there's no such thing as individual intelligence."}, {"time": 10616, "text": "Maybe it is all collective intelligence between humans."}, {"time": 10620, "text": "Like maybe the intelligence is possessed in the

about subtle manipulation of the chemicals of the brain, which feels like the best or one of the great chances of the scientific process leading us to an actual understanding of the hard problem."},

fascinated by the so called Psi phenomenon, you know, like stuff that people just kind of reject out of hand."}, {"time": 10690, "text": "You know, I kind of orient towards that stuff with an idea of, you know, hey, look, you know, what we consider, like anything exists as natural."}, {"time": 10699, "text": "And so, but the boundary of what we observe in nature, like what we recognize as in nature

the moving together of the model and the real thing of conscious, like, I'm very sympathetic to that."}, {"time": 10740, "text": "So that's that part of like, on the armchair side, where I want to be clear, I can't say this as a scientist, but just in terms of speculating, I find myself attracted to these, more of the sort of the panpsychism ideas."}, {"time": 10755, "text": "And that kind of makes sense to me."}, {"time": 10757, "text": "I don't know if that's what you meant there, but it seemed like related, the sense that ultimately if you were completely modeling, like it's like, if you completely modeling, unless you dismiss like the idea that there is a phenomenal consciousness, which I think is hard, given that we all, I seem like I have one, that's really all I know."},

us."}, {"time": 10803, "text": "And sometimes we find out that that's pointing towards something else, or sometimes it's still, seems like it's a fundamental, and sometimes it's a placeholder for

there's something better that comes to replace it."}, {"time": 10820, "text": "So, I kind of think about like consciousness and I didn't, I kind of had this inclination before I knew there was a term

of consciousness permeates all matter and, or it's a fundamental part of physics of the universe kind of thing."}, {"time": 10845, "text": "So, and there's a lot of different flavors of it as you're alluding to."}, {"time": 10851, "text": "And something that struck me as like consistent with some just, you know, inclinations of mine, just total speculation is this idea of everything we know in science and with most of the stuff we think of physics, you know, really describes, it's all interactions."}, {"time": 10871, "text": "It's not the thing itself."}, {"time": 10920, "text": "This is

mean, again, totally in the speculation area."}, {"time": 10931, "text": "And something else based on, so it's funny because we don't have this, neither the science nor the proper language to talk about it."}, {"time": 10938, "text": "All we have is kind of a little intuitions about there might be something in that direction of the darkness to pursue."}, {"time": 10946, "text": "And in that sense, I find panpsychism interesting in that like, it does feel like there's something fundamental here, that consciousness is, it's not just like, okay, so the flip side, consciousness could be just a very basic and trivial symptom, like a little hack of nature that's useful for like survival of an organism."}, {"time": 10973, "text": "It's not something fundamental."}, {"time": 10975, "text":

that are fairly standardizable."}, {"time": 718, "text": "Now we actually started with translation, um, and then we added audio transcription a bit later and we'll just make it a website."}, {"time": 725, "text": "You go give us your files."}, {"time": 726, "text": "We'll give you back, uh, the results, you know, as soon as possible."}, {"time": 731, "text": "You know, originally maybe it was 48 hours."}, {"time": 733, "text": "Then we made it shorter and shorter and shorter."}, {"time": 735, "text": "Um, yeah, there's a rush processing too."}, {"time": 737, "text": "There's a rush processing now, uh, and, uh, we'll hide all the details from you."}, {"time": 744, "text": "And like, that's kind of exactly what you're experiencing, right?"}, {"time": 747, "text": "You don't, you don't need to worry about the details of how the sausage is made."}, {"time": 750, "text": "The, so you picked like a vertical by vertically, you mean basically a service, a service category."}, {"time": 756, "text": "Why translation is Rev thinking of potentially going into other verticals in the future, or is this like the focus now is a translation transcription, like language, the focus now is, is language or, uh, speech services, generally speech to text language services, you can kind of group them however you want."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Um, so, but we, uh, originally the categorization was work from home."}, {"time": 781, "text": "So when, uh, work that was done by people on a computer, you know, we weren't trying to get into, you know, uh, task rabbit type of things and something that could be relatively standard, not a lot of options."}, {"time": 794, "text": "So we could kind of present the simplified interface, right?"}, {"time": 796, "text": "So programming wasn't like a good fit because each programming project is kind of unique, right?"}, {"time": 801, "text": "We're looking for something that, uh, Transcription is, you know, you have five hours of idea, it's five hours of audio, right?"}, {"time": 807, "text": "Translation is somewhat similar."}, {"time": 809, "text": "In that, you know, you can have a five page document, you know, and then you just can price it by that and then you pick the language you want and that that's mostly all that is to it."}, {"time": 819, "text": "So those were a few criteria."}, {"time": 820, "text": "We started with translation because we saw the need, um, and, uh, we picked up kind of a specialty of translation, um, where we would translate things like board certificates, uh, uh, immigration documents, things like that."}, {"time": 838, "text": "And so they were fairly, um, even more well defined and easy to kind of tell if we did a good job."}, {"time": 845, "text": "So you can literally charge per type of document."}, {"time": 847, "text": "Was that, was, was that the, so what, what is it now?"}, {"time": 850, "text": "Is it per word or something like that?"}, {"time": 852, "text": "Like, how do you, like, how do you measure the effort involved in a particular thing?"}, {"time": 858, "text": "So now it looks like for audio translation, it's like, so now it looks a for audio transcription, right?"}, {"time": 863, "text": "It's a per audio minute."}, {"time": 864, "text": "Well, that, that yes, for, for, for our translation, we don't really, uh, actually focus it on anymore."}, {"time": 870, "text": "Uh, but you know, back when it was still a main business of Revit was per page, right."}, {"time": 875, "text": "Or per word, depending on the kind of, uh, cause you can also do translation now on the audio, right?"}, {"time": 880, "text": "So like subtitles."}, {"time": 881, "text": "So it would be both, uh, transcription and translation."}, {"time": 885, "text": "I wanted to test the system to see how good it is to see like how, how, uh, well, is Russian supported?"}, {"time": 894, "text": "And it'd be interesting to try it out."}, {"time": 895, "text": "I mean, one of the, now it's only in like the one direction, right?"}, {"time": 898, "text": "So you start with English and then you can have subtitles in Russian."}, {"time": 900, "text": "Not really, not really the other way."}, {"time": 903, "text": "Because it's, um, I'm deeply curious about this."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Um, when COVID opens up a little bit, when the economy, when the world opens up a little bit, you want to build your brand in Russia?"}, {"time": 913, "text": "First of all, I'm allergic to the word brand."}, {"time": 915, "text": "All right, I'm definitely not building, uh, any brands in Russia, but I'm going to Paris to talk to the translators of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, there's this famous couple that does translation."}, {"time": 929, "text": "And, you know, I'm more and more thinking of how is it possible to have a conversation with a Russian speaker?"}, {"time": 937, "text": "Cause I have just some number of famous Russian speakers that I'm interested in talking to, and my Russian is not strong enough to be witty and funny."}, {"time": 949, "text": "I'm already an idiot in English."}, {"time": 951, "text": "I'm an extra level of like awkward idiot in Russian, but I can understand it."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And I also like wonder how can I create a compelling English Russian experience for an English speaker?"}, {"time": 966, "text": "Like if I, there's a guy named Grigori Perlman, who's a mathematician who, uh, obviously doesn't speak any English."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So I would probably incorporate like a Russian translator into the picture."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And then it would be like a, not to use a weird term, but like a three, like a three, three person thing where it's like a dance of, like, I understand it one way."}, {"time": 992, "text": "They don't understand the other way, but I'll be asking questions in English."}, {"time": 998, "text": "I don't know the right way."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "It's complicated, but I feel like it's worth the effort for certain kinds of people, one of whom I'm confident of Vladimir Putin, I'm for sure talking to."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "I really want to make it happen."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "Cause I think I could do a good job with, but the, the right, you know, understanding the fundamentals of translation is something I'm really interested in."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "So that's why I'm starting with, um, the actual translators of like Russian literature, because they understand the nuance and the beauty of the language and how it goes back and forth."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "But I also want to see, like in speech, how can we do it in real time?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "So that's, that's like a little bit of a baby project that I hope to push forward."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "But anyway, it's a challenging thing."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "So just to share, uh, my dad, um, actually does translation, um, not, not professional, he's a, uh, he writes poetry."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "That was kind of always his, uh, not a hobby, but he's, uh, he, you know, he had a job, like a day job, but his passion was always writing poetry."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Uh, and then when I got to America, like he started also translating, um, first he was translating English poetry to Russia."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "Now he also like goes the other, uh, the other way, you kind of gain some small fame in that world anyways, because, uh, recently this poet like Lewis clock, I don't know if you know of, uh, some American poet, um, she was awarded the Nobel prize for literature."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "Uh, and so my dad had translated, uh, one of her books of poetry in to Russian, and he was like one of the few."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "So he kind of like, they asked him and gave an interview to Radiosvoboda, if you know what that is."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "And he kind of talked about some of the intricacies of translating poetry."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "So that's like an extra level of difficulty, right?"}, {"time": 1098, "text": "Because translating poetry is even more challenging than translating just, you know, interviews."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Do you remember any, any experiences and challenges to having to do the translation that, that's the God to you, like something he's talked about?"}, {"time": 1112, "text": "I mean, a lot of it, I think is word choice, right?"}, {"time": 1115, "text": "It's the way Russian is structured is first of all, quite different than, um, the way English is structured, right?"}, {"time": 1120, "text": "Just there is inflections in Russian and genders, and they don't exist in English."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "That's just one of the reasons actually why, um, machine translation is quite difficult for English to Russian and Russian to English, because there's such different languages, but then English has like a huge number of words."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "Um, many more than Russian, actually, I think."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "So it's often difficult to find the right word to convey the same emotional meaning, yeah, Russian language."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "They play with words much more."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "So you, you're mentioning that, uh, Rev was kind of born out of, um, trying to take a vertical on the upwork and then standardize it."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "So we're just trying to make the, the freelancer marketplace idea better, right?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Um, better for both customers and better for the freelancers themselves."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Is there something else to the story of Rev finding the right word?"}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Rev, finding Rev, like what, what did it take to bring it to actually to life?"}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Was there any pain points?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "Um, plenty of, plenty of pain points."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "I mean, uh, as, as often the case it's with scaling it up, right?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Um, and in this case, you know, the scaling is kind of scaling the, the marketplace, so to speak, right?"}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Rev is essentially a two sided marketplace, right?"}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Because, you know, there's the customers and then there's the reverse."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "Um, if there's not enough Revers, Revers are world color freelancers."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "So if there's not enough Revers, then customers have a bad experience, right?"}, {"time": 1203, "text": "You know, it takes longer to get your work done."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "Um, things like that, you know, if there's too many done, the Revers have a bad experience because they might log on to see like what work is available and there's not very much work, right?"}, {"time": 1215, "text": "Uh, so kind of keeping that balance, um, is, is, is a quite challenging problem."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "And, you know, that's, that's like a problem we've been working on for many years and we're still like refining our methods, right?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "If you can kind of talk to this gig economy idea, I did a bunch of different psychology experiments on mechanical Turk, for example, I've asked to do different kinds of very tricky computer vision annotation on mechanical Turk."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And it's connecting, connecting people in a more systematized way."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "I would say, you know, between task and, and, uh, what would you call that worker is what mechanical Turk calls it."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "What do you think about this world of gig economies, of there being a service that connects customers to workers in a way that's like massively distributed, like potentially scaling to, it could be, it could be scaled to like tens of thousands of people, right?"}, {"time": 1271, "text": "Is there something interesting about that world that you can speak to?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "Well, we don't think of it as kind of gig economy, like to some degree, I don't like the word gig that much, right?"}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Because to some degree it diminishes the words being done, right?"}, {"time": 1285, "text": "It sounds kind of like almost amateurish."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Well, maybe in like music industry, like gig is a standard term, but in work, it kind of sounds like, oh, it's, it's, it's frivolous, um, to us it's, um, improving the nature of working from home on your own time and on your own terms, right?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "And kind of taking away geographical limitations and time limitations, right?"}, {"time": 1311, "text": "Uh, so, you know, many of our freelancers are maybe work from home moms, right?"}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And, you know, they don't want the traditional nine to five job, but they want to make some income and rough kind of like allows them to do that and decide like exactly how much to work and when to work or by the same token, maybe someone is, you know, someone wants to live the mountain top, you know, life, right?"}, {"time": 1337, "text": "You know, cabin in the woods, but they still want to make some money."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "Um, and like generally that wouldn't be compatible before, before this new world, you kind of had to choose, uh, but like with Rev, like, if you like, you don't have to choose, can you speak to like, what's the demographics like distribution?"}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Like where do rivers live?"}, {"time": 1385, "text": "Like you, you may be Oh, like you know, one day you might go to the For some years now, we've been doing these little meetings where the management team will go to some place and we'll try to meet Revers."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "And pretty much wherever we go, it's pretty easy to find a large number of Revers."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "The most recent one we did is in Utah."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "But anyway, really."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "Are they from all walks of life?"}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Are these young folks, older folks?"}, {"time": 1408, "text": "Yeah, all walks of life, really."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "Like I said, one category is the work from home."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Students who want to make some extra income."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "There are some people who maybe have some social anxiety, so they don't want to be in the office."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "And this is one way for them to make a living."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "So it's really pretty wide variety."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "But on the flip side, for example, one Rever we were talking to was a person who had a fairly high powered career before and was kind of like taking a break."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "And she was almost doing this just to explore and learn about the gig economy, quote unquote."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "So it really is a pretty wide variety of folks."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "Yeah, it's kind of interesting through the captioning process for me to learn about the Revers because like some are clearly like weirdly knowledgeable about technical concepts."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Like you can tell by how good they are at like capitalizing stuff, like technical terms, like a machine learning or deep learning."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "Like I've used Rev to annotate, to caption the deep learning lectures or machine learning lectures I did at MIT."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And it's funny, like a large number of them were like, I don't know if they looked it up or were already knowledgeable, but they do a really good job at like, I don't know."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "They invest time into these things."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "They will like do research, they will Google things, you know, to kind of make sure that they got it right."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "But to some of them, it's like, it's actually part of the enjoyment of the work."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "Like they'll tell us, you know, I love doing this because I get paid to watch a documentary on something, right?"}, {"time": 1507, "text": "And I learn something while I'm transcribing, right?"}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Pretty cool."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Yeah, so what's that captioning transcription process look like for the Revers?"}, {"time": 1516, "text": "Can you maybe speak to that to give people a sense, like how much is automated, how much is manual?"}, {"time": 1523, "text": "What's the actual interface look like?"}, {"time": 1525, "text": "All that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "Yeah, so, you know, we've invested a pretty good amount of time to give like our Revers the best tools possible."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "So typical day of forever, they might log into their workspace, they'll see a list of audios that need to be transcribed."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "And we try to give them tools to pick specifically the ones they want to do, you know?"}, {"time": 1544, "text": "So maybe some people like to do longer audios or shorter audios, people have their preferences."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "Some people like to do audios in a particular subject or from a particular country."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "So we try to give people the tools to control, things like that."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And then when they pick what they want to do, we'll launch a specialized editor that we've built to make transcription as efficient as possible."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "They'll start with a speech drag draft."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "So, you know, we have our machine learning model for automated speech recognition, they'll start with that."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And then our tools are optimized to help them correct that."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So it's basically a process of correction."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "Yeah, it depends on, you know, I would say the audio."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "If the audio itself is pretty good, like probably like our podcast right now would be quite good."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "So the ASR would do a fairly good job."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "But if you imagine someone recorded a lecture, you know, in the back of a auditorium, right?"}, {"time": 1605, "text": "Where like the speaker is really far away and there's maybe a lot of cross talk and things like that, then maybe the ASR wouldn't do a good job."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "So the person might say like, you know what, I'm just gonna do it from scratch."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "Do it from scratch, yeah."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "So it kind of really depends."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "What would you say is the speed that you can possibly get?"}, {"time": 1620, "text": "Like, what's the fastest?"}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Can you get, is it possible to get real time or no?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "As you're like listening, can you write as fast as?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "Real time would be pretty difficult."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "It's actually a pretty, it's not an easy job, you know."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "We actually encourage everyone at the company to try to be a transcriber for a day, transcriptionist for a day."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "And it's way harder than you might think it is, right?"}, {"time": 1644, "text": "Because people talk fast and people have accents and all this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "So real time is pretty difficult."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "Like there's somebody, we're probably gonna use Rev to caption this, they're listening to this right now."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "What do you think is the fastest you could possibly get on this right now?"}, {"time": 1664, "text": "I think on a good audio, maybe two to three X, I would say, real time."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "Meaning it takes two to three times longer than the actual audio of the podcast."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "This is so meta, I could just imagine the Revvers working on this right now."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "You're like, you're way wrong."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "You're way wrong, this takes way longer."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "But yeah, it definitely works."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "Or you doubted me, I could do real time."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "Okay, so you mentioned ASR."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "Can you speak to what is ASR, automatic speech recognition?"}, {"time": 1695, "text": "How much, like what is the gap between perfect human performance and perfect or pretty damn good ASR?"}, {"time": 1706, "text": "Yeah, so ASR, automatic speech recognition, it's a class of machine learning problem, right?"}, {"time": 1711, "text": "So take speech like we're talking and transform it into a sequence of words, essentially."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "Audio of people talking."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "Audio, audio to words."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "And there's a variety of different approaches and techniques, which we could talk about later if you want."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "So, we think we have pretty much the world's best ASR for this kind of speech, right?"}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So there's different kinds of domains, right, for ASR."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "Like one domain might be voice assistance, right?"}, {"time": 1738, "text": "So Siri, very different than what we're doing, right?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "Because Siri, there's fairly limited vocabulary."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "You might ask Siri to play a song or order a pizza or whatever."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And it's very good at doing that."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "Very different from when we start talking in a very unstructured way."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "And Siri will also generally adapt to your voice and stuff like this."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "So for this kind of audio, we think we have the best."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "And our accuracy, right now I think it's maybe 14% word error rate on our test suite that we generally use to measure."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "So word error rate is like one way to measure accuracy for ASR, right?"}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So what's 14% word error rate?"}, {"time": 1779, "text": "So 14% means across this test suite, of a variety of different audios, it would be, it would get in some way 14% of the words wrong."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "14% of the words wrong."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "So the way you kind of calculate it is, you might add up insertions, deletions, and substitutions, right?"}, {"time": 1803, "text": "So insertions is like extra words."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "Deletions are words that we said, but weren't in the transcript, right?"}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Substitutions is, you said Apple, but I said, but the ASR thought it was able, something like this."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "Human accuracy, most people think realistically, it's like 3%, 2%, word error rate would be like the max achievable."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "So there's still quite a gap, right?"}, {"time": 1829, "text": "Would you say that, so YouTube, when I upload videos, often generates automatic captions."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "Are you sort of from a company perspective, from a company perspective, from a tech perspective, are you trying to beat YouTube, Google?"}, {"time": 1844, "text": "It's a hell of a, Google, I mean, I don't know how seriously they take this task, but I imagine it's quite serious."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "And they, you know, Google is probably up there in terms of their teams on, on ASR or just NLP, natural language processing, different technologies."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "So do you think you can beat Google?"}, {"time": 1866, "text": "On this kind of stuff, yeah, we think so."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "Google just woke up on my phone."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "This is hilarious, okay."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "Now Google is listening, sending it back to headquarters."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "Who are these rough people?"}, {"time": 1879, "text": "But that's the goal?"}, {"time": 1880, "text": "Yeah, I mean, we measure ourselves against like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, you know, some of the, some smaller competitors."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "And we use like our internal tests with it, we try to compose it of a pretty representative set of ideas, maybe it's some podcasts, some videos, some interviews, some lectures, things like that, right?"}, {"time": 1899, "text": "And we beat them in our own testing."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "And actually Rev offers automated, like you can actually just do the automated captioning."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "So like, I guess it's like way cheaper, whatever it is, whatever the rates are."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "So it's a, by the way, it used to be a dollar per minute for captioning and transcription, I think it's like $1.15 or something like that."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "$1.25."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "$1.25, yeah."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "It's pretty cool."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "That was the other thing that was surprising to me, it was actually like the cheapest thing you could, one of the, I mean, I don't remember it being cheaper."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "You could on Upwork get cheaper, but it was clear to me that this, that's gonna be really shitty."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "So like, you're also competing on price."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "I think there were services that you can get, like similar to Rev kind of feel to it, but it wasn't as automated."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "Like the drag and drop, the entirety of the interface, it's like the thing we're talking about."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "I'm such a huge fan of like frictionless, like Amazon's single buy button, whatever."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "That one click."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "The one click, that's genius right there."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "Like that is so important for services."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "And simplicity and I mean, Rev is almost there."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "I mean, there's like some, I'm trying to think."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "So I think I've, I stopped using this pipeline, but Rev offers it and I like it, but it was causing me some issues on my side, which is you can connect it to like Dropbox and it generates the files in Dropbox."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "So like it closes the loop to where I don't have to go to Rev at all and I can download it."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "Sorry, I don't have to go to Rev at all and to download the files."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "It could just like automatically copy them."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "Right, you're putting your Dropbox in a day later or maybe a few hours later."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Yeah, it just shows up."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "Just shows up, yeah."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "Yeah, I was trying to do it programmatically too."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "Is there an API interface you can, I was trying to through like through Python to download stuff automatically, but then I realized this is the programmer in me."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "Like, dude, you don't need to automate everything like in life, like flawlessly, because I wasn't doing enough captions to justify to myself the time investment into automating everything perfectly."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Yeah, I would say if you're doing so many interviews that your biggest roadblock is clicking on the Rev download, but now you're talking about Elon Musk levels of business."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "But for sure, we have like a variety of ways to make it easy."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "You know, there's the integration."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "You mentioned, I think it's through a company called Zapier, which kind of can connect Dropbox to Rev and vice versa."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "We have an API if you want to really like customize it, you know, if you want to create the Lex Friedman, you know, CMS or whatever."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "For this whole thing."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "So can you speak to the ASR a little bit more?"}, {"time": 2086, "text": "Like, what does it take?"}, {"time": 2091, "text": "Like approach wise, machine learning wise, how hard is this problem?"}, {"time": 2095, "text": "How do you get to the 3% error rate?"}, {"time": 2097, "text": "Like, what's your vision of all of this?"}, {"time": 2099, "text": "Yeah, well, the 3% error rate is definitely, that's the grand vision."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "We'll see what it takes to get there."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "But we believe, you know, in ASR, the biggest thing is the data, right?"}, {"time": 2115, "text": "Like, that's true of like a lot of machine learning problems today, right?"}, {"time": 2118, "text": "The more data you have and high quality of the data, the better label the data."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "Yeah, that's how you get good results."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "And we at Rev have kind of like the best data."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "Like we have."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "Like you're literally, your business model is annotating the data."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "Our business model is being paid to annotate the data."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "Being paid to annotate the data."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "So it's kind of like a pretty magical flywheel."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "And so we've kind of like written this flywheel to this point."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And we think we're still kind of in the early stages of figuring out all the parts of the flywheel to use, you know, because we have the final transcripts and we have the audios and we train on that."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "But we in principle also have all the edits that the Revvers make, right?"}, {"time": 2167, "text": "Oh, that's interesting."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "How can you use that as data?"}, {"time": 2170, "text": "Yeah, that's something for us to figure out in the future."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "But, you know, we feel like we're only in the early stages, right?"}, {"time": 2176, "text": "So the data is there."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "That'd be interesting."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "Like almost like a recurrent neural net for fixing transcripts."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "I always remember we did a segmentation annotation for driving data."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "So segmenting the scene, like visual data."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "And you can get all, so it was drawing, people were drawing polygons around different objects and so on."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "And it feels like it always felt like there was a lot of information in the clicking, the sequence of clicking that people do, the kind of fixing of the polygons that they do."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "Now there's a few papers written about how to draw polygons like with a recurrent neural nets to try to learn from the human clicking."}, {"time": 2220, "text": "But it was just like experimental, you know, it was one of those like CVPR type papers that people do like a really tiny data set."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "It didn't feel like people really tried to do it seriously."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "Yeah, I wonder if there's information in the fixing that provides deeper set of signal than just like the raw data."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "The intuition is for sure there must be, right?"}, {"time": 2246, "text": "And in all kinds of signals and how long you took to make that edit and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "It's gonna be like up to us."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "That's why like the next couple of years is like super exciting for us, right?"}, {"time": 2258, "text": "So that's what like the focus is now."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "You mentioned rev.ai, that's where you want to."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "Yeah, so rev.ai is kind of our way of bringing this ASR to the rest of the world, right?"}, {"time": 2271, "text": "So when we started, we were human only."}, {"time": 2275, "text": "Then we kind of created this Temi service."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "I think you might've used it, which was kind of ASR for the consumer, right?"}, {"time": 2282, "text": "So if you don't wanna pay $1.25, but you wanna pay, now it's 25 cents a minute, I think."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "And you get the transcript, the machine generated transcript and you get an editor and you can kind of fix it up yourself, right?"}, {"time": 2297, "text": "Then we started using ASR for our own human transcriptionists."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "And then the kind of rev.ai is the final step of the journey, which is, you know, we have this amazing engine."}, {"time": 2307, "text": "What can people build with it, right?"}, {"time": 2308, "text": "What kind of new applications could be enabled if you have SpeedTrack that's that accurate?"}, {"time": 2316, "text": "Do you have ideas for this or is it just providing it as a service and seeing what people come up with?"}, {"time": 2320, "text": "It's providing it as a service and seeing what people come up with and kind of learning from what people do with it."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "And we have ideas of our own as well, of course, but it's a little bit like, you know, when AWS provided the building blocks, right?"}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And they saw what people built with it and they try to make it easier to build those things, right?"}, {"time": 2336, "text": "And we kind of hope to do the same thing."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "Although AWS kind of does a shitty job of like, I'm continually surprised, like Mechanical Turk, for example, how shitty the interface is."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "We're talking about like Rev making me feel good."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "Like when I first discovered Mechanical Turk, the initial idea of it was like, it made me feel like Rev does, but then the interface is like, come on."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "Yeah, it's horrible."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "Why is it so painful?"}, {"time": 2367, "text": "Does nobody at Amazon want to like seriously invest in it?"}, {"time": 2372, "text": "It felt like you can make so much money if you took this effort seriously."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "And it feels like they have a committee of like two people just sitting back, like a meeting, they meet once a month, like what are we going to do with Mechanical Turk?"}, {"time": 2386, "text": "It's like two websites making me feel like this, that and craiglist.org, whatever the hell it is."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "It feels like it's designed in the 90s."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "Well, Craigslist basically hasn't been updated pretty much since the guy originally built."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "Do you seriously think there's a team, like how big is the team working on Mechanical Turk?"}, {"time": 2405, "text": "There's some team, right?"}, {"time": 2406, "text": "I feel like there isn't."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "I'm skeptical."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "Well, if nothing else, they benefit from the other teams like moving things forward in a small way."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "But I know what you mean."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "We use Mechanical Turk for a couple of things as well."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "And yeah, it's painful UI."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "It's painful, but yeah, it works."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "I think most people, the thing is most people don't really use the UI, right?"}, {"time": 2429, "text": "Like we, for example, we use it through the API, right?"}, {"time": 2433, "text": "But even the API documentation and so on, like it's super outdated."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "Like I don't even know what to..."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "I mean, the same criticism, as long as we're ranting, my same criticism goes to the APIs of most of these companies."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "Like Google, for example, the API for the different services is just the documentation is so shitty."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "Like it's not so shitty."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "I should actually be..."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "I should exhibit some gratitude."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "Okay, let's practice some gratitude."}, {"time": 2470, "text": "The documentation is pretty good."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "Like most of the things that the API makes available is pretty good."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "It's just that in the sense that it's accurate, sometimes outdated, but like the degree of explanations with examples is only covering, I would say, like 50% of what's possible."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "And it just feels a little bit, like there's a lot of natural questions that people would wanna ask that doesn't get covered."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "And it feels like it's almost there."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "Like it's such a magical thing."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "Like the Maps API, YouTube API, there's a bunch of stuff."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "I gotta imagine it's like, there's probably some team at Google responsible for writing this documentation that's probably not the engineers, right?"}, {"time": 2520, "text": "And probably this team is not where you wanna be."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Well, it's a weird thing."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "I sometimes think about this for somebody who wants to also build a company."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "I think about this a lot."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "YouTube, the service is one of the most magical, like I'm so grateful that YouTube exists."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "And yet they seem to be quite clueless on so many things like that everybody's screaming them at."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "Like it feels like whatever the mechanism that you use to listen to your quote unquote customers, which is like the creators, is not very good."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "Like there's literally people that are like screaming why, like their new YouTube studio, for example."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "There's like features that were like begged for for a really long time."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Like being able to upload multiple videos at the same time."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "That wasn't missing for a really, really long time."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "Now, like there's probably things that I don't know, which is maybe for that kind of huge infrastructure, it's actually very difficult to build some of these features."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "But the fact that that wasn't communicated and it felt like you're not being heard."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "Like I remember this experience for me and it's not a pleasant experience."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "And it feels like the company doesn't give a damn about you."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "And that's something to think about."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "I'm not sure what that is."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "That might have to do with just like small groups working on these small features and these specific features."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "And there's no overarching like dictator type of human that says like, why the hell are we neglecting like Steve Jobs type of characters?"}, {"time": 2623, "text": "Like there's people that we need to speak to the people that like wanna love our product and they don't."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "Let's fix this shit."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "Maybe at some point you just get so fixated on the numbers, right?"}, {"time": 2635, "text": "And it's like, well, the numbers are pretty great, right?"}, {"time": 2637, "text": "Like people are watching, doesn't seem to be a problem, right?"}, {"time": 2641, "text": "And you're not like the person that like build this thing, right?"}, {"time": 2644, "text": "So you really care about it."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "You're just there, you came in as a product manager, right?"}, {"time": 2649, "text": "You got hired sometime later, your mandate is like increase this number, like 10%, right?"}, {"time": 2655, "text": "And you just."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "That's brilliantly put."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "Like if you, this is, okay, if there's a lesson in this is don't reduce your company into a metric of like how much, like you said, how much people watching the videos and so on and like convince yourself that everything is working just because the numbers are going up."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "There's something, you have to have a vision."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "You have to want people to love your stuff because love is ultimately the beginning of like a successful longterm company is that they always should love your product."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "You have to be like a creator and have that like creator's love for your own thing, right?"}, {"time": 2695, "text": "Like, and you're pained by these comments, right?"}, {"time": 2699, "text": "And probably like Apple, I think did this generally like really well."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "They're well known for kind of keeping teams small even when they were big, right?"}, {"time": 2708, "text": "And, you know, he was an engineer, like there's a book, a creative selection."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "I don't know if you read it by a Apple engineer named Ken Koscienda."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "It's kind of a great book actually because unlike most of these business books where it's, you know, here's how Steve Jobs ran the company."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "It's more like here's how life was like for me, you know, an engineer here, the projects I worked on and here what it was like to pitch Steve Jobs, you know, on like, you know, I think it was in charge of like the keyboard and the auto correction, right?"}, {"time": 2736, "text": "And at Apple, like Steve Jobs reviewed everything."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "And so he was like, this is what it was like to show my demos to Steve Jobs and, you know, to change them because like Steve Jobs didn't like how, you know, the shape of the little key was off because the rounding of the corner was like not quite right or something like this, right?"}, {"time": 2751, "text": "He was famously a stickler for this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "But because the teams were small, he really owned this stuff, right?"}, {"time": 2756, "text": "So he really cared."}, {"time": 2758, "text": "Yeah, Elon Musk does that similar kind of thing with Tesla, which is really interesting."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "There's another lesson in leadership in that is to be obsessed with the details."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And like, he talks to like the lowest level engineers."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "Okay, so we're talking about ASR and so this is basically where I was saying we're gonna take this like ultra seriously."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "And then what's the mission?"}, {"time": 2782, "text": "To try to keep pushing towards the 3%."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Yeah, and kind of try to build this platform where all of your, you know, all of your meetings, you know, they're as easily accessible as your notes, right?"}, {"time": 2798, "text": "Like, so, like, imagine all the meetings a company might have, right?"}, {"time": 2803, "text": "You know, now that I'm like no longer a programmer, right?"}, {"time": 2806, "text": "Then I'm a quote unquote manager."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "That's less like my day as in meetings, right?"}, {"time": 2811, "text": "And, you know, pretty often I wanna like see what was said, right?"}, {"time": 2815, "text": "Who said it, you know?"}, {"time": 2816, "text": "What's the context?"}, {"time": 2817, "text": "But it's generally not really something that you can easily retrieve, right?"}, {"time": 2820, "text": "Like imagine if all of those meetings were indexed, archived, you know, you could go back, you could share a clip like really easily, right?"}, {"time": 2828, "text": "So that might change completely."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "It's like everything that's said, converted to text might change completely the dynamics of what we do in this world, especially now with remote work, right?"}, {"time": 2839, "text": "With Zoom and so on."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "That's fascinating to think about."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "I mean, for me, I care about podcasts, right?"}, {"time": 2845, "text": "And one of the things that was, you know, I'm torn."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "I know a lot of the engineers at Spotify."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "So I love them very much because they dream big in terms of like, they wanna empower creators."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "So one of my hopes was with Spotify that they would use a technology like Rev or something like that to start converting everything into text and make it indexable."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "Like one of the things that sucks with podcasts is like, it's hard to find stuff."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "Like the model is basically subscription."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "Like you find, it's similar to what YouTube used to be like, which is you basically find a creator that you enjoy and you subscribe to them."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "And like, you just kind of follow what they're doing, but the search and discovery wasn't a big part of YouTube like in the early days, but that's what currently with podcasts, like is the search and discovery is like non existent."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "You're basically searching for like the dumbest possible thing, which is like keywords in the titles of episodes."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "Even aside from a search and discovery, like all the time."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "So I listened to like a number of podcasts and there's something said, and I wanna like go back to that later because I was trying to, I'm trying to remember, what do you say?"}, {"time": 2930, "text": "Like maybe like recommended some cool product that I wanna try out."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "And like, it's basically impossible."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "Maybe like some people have pretty good show notes."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "So maybe you'll get lucky and you can find it, right?"}, {"time": 2939, "text": "But I mean, if everyone had transcripts and it was all searchable, it would be so much better."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "I mean, that's one of the things that I wanted to, I mean, one of the reasons we're talking today is I wanted to take this quite seriously."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "The rough thing, I just been lazy."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "So, because I'm very fortunate that a lot of people support this podcast, that there's enough money now to do a transcription and so on."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "And it seemed clear to me, especially like CEOs and sort of like PhDs, like people write to me who are like graduate students in computer science or graduate students in whatever the heck field, it's clear that their mind, like they enjoy podcasts when they're doing laundry or whatever, but they wanna revisit the conversation in a much more rigorous way."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "And they really wanna transcript."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "Like it's clear that they want to analyze conversations."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "Like so many people wrote to me about a transcript for Yosha Bach conversation."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "I had just a bunch of conversations."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "And then on the Elon Musk side, like reporters, they wanna write a blog post about your conversation."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "So they wanna be able to pull stuff."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "And it's like, they're essentially doing on your conversation transcription privately."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "They're doing it for themselves and then starting to pick, but it's so much easier when you can actually do it as a reporter, just look at the transcript."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Yeah, and you can like embed a little thing, like into your article, right?"}, {"time": 3029, "text": "Here's what they said, you can go listen to like this clip from the section."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "I'm actually trying to figure out, I'll probably on the website create like a place where the transcript goes, like as a webpage so that people can reference it, like reporters can reference it and so on."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "I mean, most of the reporters probably want to write clickbait articles that are complete falsifying, which I'm fine with."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "It's the way of journalism, I don't care."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "Like I've had this conversation with a friend of mine, a mixed martial artist, the Ryan Hall."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "And he brought up like Hitler as somebody that would potentially be the hardest thing to possibly forgive, but it might be a worthwhile pursuit psychologically, so on, blah, blah, blah, it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "It was very eloquent, very powerful words."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "I think people should go back and listen to it."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "It's powerful."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "And then all these journalists, all these articles written about like MMA fight, UFC fight."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "MMA fighter loves Hitler."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "No, like, well, no, they didn't."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "They were somewhat accurate."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "They didn't say like loves Hitler."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "They said, thinks that if Hitler came back to life, we should forgive him."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "Like they kind of, it's kind of accurate ish, but the headline made it sound a lot worse than it was, but I'm fine with it."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "That's the way the world, I wanna almost make it easier for those journalists and make it easier for people who actually care about the conversation to go and look and see."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Right, they can see it for themselves."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "For themselves."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "There's the headline, but now you can go."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "There's something about podcasts, like the audio that makes it difficult to jump to a spot and to look for that particular information."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "I think some of it, I'm interested in creating, like myself experimenting with stuff."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "So like taking rev and creating a transcript and then people can go to it."}, {"time": 3185, "text": "I do dream that like, I'm not in the loop anymore, that like, Spotify does it, right?"}, {"time": 3193, "text": "Like automatically for everybody, because ultimately that one click purchase needs to be there, like, you know."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "Like you kind of want support from the entire

extension to their RSS format to reference transcripts in a standard way."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "And they're talking about like, there's one client dimension that will support it, but imagine like more clients support it, right?"}, {"time": 3244, "text": "So any podcast, you could go and see the transcripts right in your like normal podcast app."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "I mean, somebody, so I have somebody who works with me, works with helps with advertising, Matt, this awesome guy."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "He mentioned Buzzsprout to me, but he says, it's really annoying because they want exclusive, they want to host the podcast."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "This is the problem with Spotify too."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "This is where I'd like to say, like F Spotify, there's a magic to RSS with podcasts."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "It can be made available to everyone."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "And then there's all, there's this ecosystem of different podcast players that

Spotify only."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "I, you know, and Spotify gave him a hundred million dollars for that."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "So it's an interesting deal, but I, you know, I did some soul

right."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "That said, you know, because so many people care about Joe Rogan's program, they're gonna hold Spotify's feet to the fire."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "Like one of the cool things with what Joe told me is the reason he likes working with Spotify is that they, they're like ride or die together, right?"}, {"time": 3376, "text": "So they, they want him to succeed."},

anything."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "They want him to succeed."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "And that's the cool thing about exclusivity with a platform is like, you're kind of wanting each other to

the right word."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "I mean, censorship is usually government censorship, but still, yeah, putting yourself in the position of arbiter for these kinds of things."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "It's very difficult and people think it's so easy, right?"}, {"time": 3505, "text": "Like, cause like, well, you know, like no Nazis, right?"}, {"time": 3507, "text": "What a simple principle."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "But you know, yes, I mean, no one likes Nazis, but there's like many shades of gray, like very soon after that."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "Yeah, and then, you know, of course everybody, you know, there's some people that call our current president a Nazi and then there's like, so you start getting a Sam Harris."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "I don't know if you

conversation where some number, some significant number of people think that the current president of the United States should not be on your platform."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And it's like, okay."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "So if that's even on the table as a conversation, then everything's on the table for conversation."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "And yeah, it's tough."}, {"time": 3574,

think, you know, if you're the kind of person that's gonna be convinced, you know, by some YouTube video, you know, that, I don't know, our government's been taken over by aliens, it's unlikely that like, you know, you'll be returned to sanity simply because, you know, that video is not available on YouTube, right?"}, {"time": 3602, "text": "I tend to believe in the intelligence of people and we should trust them."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "But I also do think it's the responsibility of platforms to encourage more love in the world, more kindness to each other."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "And

think about that a lot."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "Where's the balance between free speech and like encouraging people, even though they have the freedom of speech to not be an asshole."}, {"time":

really put that in the constitution that the Supreme Court can't be like, eh, just don't be a dick."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "But I feel like platforms have a role to be like, just be nicer."},

increase the health of conversations?"}, {"time": 3686, "text": "I don't know how seriously they're actually trying to do that though."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "Which is one of the reasons that I'm in part considering entering that space a little bit."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "It's difficult for them, right?"}, {"time": 3698, "text": "Because, you know, it's kind of like well known that people

engineer, but now you made the unfortunate choice or maybe that's the way life goes of basically moving away from the low level work and becoming a manager, becoming an executive, having meetings,

look at the Googleplex or what Amazon has or others, and they have so much value, so many users, so many things going on, and no person can keep that in their head."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "And so you're talking about systems may have 10 million lines of code, 15 million lines of code, millions of nodes connecting, faulty processes happening all the time, hackers breaking in on a regular basis."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So when you're trying to model all of that, trying to ask yourself, what formal guarantees and properties can I get to simplify this system as much as possible?"}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So instead of the applications of formal methods slowing you down, in many cases, it actually massively reduces your debugging time and your ability to find where errors occur."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "In some cases, you can't find where errors occur inside these massive concurrent systems."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "And you say, well, where are cryptocurrencies going?"}, {"time": 1219, "text": "We're talking about just the same thing."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "But we're talking about a much more hostile operating environment, where instead of it running in a pristine data center in California somewhere, it's running on your cell phone, it's running on your mom's phone, it's running your dad's phone, it's running on some computer in Mongolia that may have good internet on Tuesday, but not any other day."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "So when you live in that kind of environment, you really do need to think carefully about a whole new class of protocols."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And then you need to think carefully about a whole new class of tools and techniques to test the reliability of those systems."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And you need to separate the world and say, what is high assurance and cannot fail?"}, {"time": 1255, "text": "Because if it fails, people lose money."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "And what is low assurance?"}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And it's okay if that falls apart."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "The other thing I'll mention is there are perverse financial incentives in our industry."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "Because the reality is when something blows up, the people who built those things that blow up usually get paid upfront."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "So what they're focusing on is time to market, speed to market, and getting tokens out and getting them liquid."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "And then people come in, they buy it, but if there's a nascent bug in some DeFi protocol, it'll probably be discovered six months later or something like that."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "It blows up, who suffers?"}, {"time": 1287, "text": "The users."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "The people that created that already got paid."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "Exactly, that's why you pay the guy who makes the breaks software for your train last."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And you make sure he rides the train every day."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "So you're basically describing the complexity of a distributed system that's fundamentally game theoretic."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "And like, if we think about turtles all the way down, it's humans all the way down."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "I mean, at the very bottom is still human nature."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "Is there something you can say formally about human nature to try, you said you can't, there's certain parts of the system that can't fail."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "Some people talk about nuclear war in that same kind of way, that there's this game theoretic construction of mutually assured destruction."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Oh, that rhymes, see, I'm a poet."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "That system can't fail because you're gonna blow everyone up but you can't formally say for sure it's not going to fail."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So like, you're basically trying to chase, like statistically reduce the probability that these particular critical aspects will fail."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "And then you test, I guess, by deploying in the real world at small scale to see where things go wrong."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "Yeah, it's a great question."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "And the problem with game theory and mechanism design is that you can develop this concept of a rational actor."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "And

create this incentive model and rational actors will behave with that incentive model."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "And they say, well, the individual won't do that but the firm, the government, the entity will."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "The problem with that is we have a lot of counter examples where the system was actually behaving in weird ways."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Like we almost completely eradicated the human population twice in the 20th century, once during the Cuban missile crisis."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "And again, in the 1980s, there was a Russian Colonel and they installed a new satellite system and it said, hey, the Americans are launching missiles at us."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "You need to turn the key in, launch all the missiles in the silo."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "And he said, oh, that's not right."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "That doesn't seem right."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And he was reprimanded for not launching the missiles."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So in both cases, a single person stood against the systems of superpowers between us and nuclear annihilation."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So in general, we're really bad at building these types of things."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "So what you look for instead is say, can the system be self correcting?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "It's not about avoiding a problem."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "It's more about can the problem be resolved?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And that's how nature engineers things."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "It gives you an immune system."}, {"time":

push it back into a healthy, productive, useful state, which is going back kind of to that complexity theory stuff that we began with and a little bit about, how do you handle modern economics?"},

years, you'd have some conference, usually in a cool island like Jamaica and be like, okay, let's go talk about monetary policy and like amend the Bretton Woods Agreement."}, {"time": 1533, "text":

really get as much traction."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "Like Al Grant is a great example of that."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "I mean, Silvio, he's an incredibly bright guy."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Every time I go to MIT, we have dinner and his work is legendary and it's just beautiful and elegant and he literally has all the people."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "He went and hired Tal Robin and

in the VCs."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So you'd say, okay, that's a contender."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "But if you look at market adoption, Ethereum Classic sometimes is above it and other things are above it."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "And then there's this weird Darwinian evolution produced Dogecoin organism that's just stomping all around."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "Evolution doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "Exactly, but maybe it's worth the problem, not evolution, because the market's the market and you can scream and cry and pout and stamp your foot and say this makes no sense, but that's the way the world works."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "There's plenty of mountain climbers that didn't want gravity to apply to them and it's the same situation here."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "There's plenty of people in these marketplaces that had the best of intentions, the best team, the best technology, and for whatever reason, they didn't get that adoption."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "So the question isn't the local, it should be the longterm and will the system over time converge to a state that actually is useful and meaningful to society and actually solve problems for it and that's what we try to figure out is how do we perturb these things in a way to kind of push them in that direction."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "So before we go into this fascinating Darwinian evolution of cryptocurrencies, let me ask you sort of a basic programming question."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "Yeah, so there's the pedagogy of learning how to program and to express the theory of computer science."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "I still love Lisp."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "Oh man, it's great, these are your father's parentheses, they're elegant weapons from a time long ago."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "But that's a great starting point and it's not about falling in love with a language, it's just falling in love with computing, it's about falling in love with having a dialogue with a computer and thinking about, well, how would I solve that?"}, {"time": 1736, "text": "How would I interact with that?"}, {"time": 1737, "text": "What does this need to look like?"}, {"time": 1768, "text": "You might think that what you've built is the paper but the computer's not going to tell you that because the paper's written in prose and maybe typed up in LaTeX or something but there's no proof chain, evidence chain that you can show that there's no ambiguity."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "When you look at a functional language, you're a little closer to math and so as a consequence, the translation of the papers that we spent so damn long writing and writing proofs about and so forth to code is much smaller."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "Now the downside is these functional languages tend to be a bit more academic and they tend to have not necessarily the best Windows support and the libraries aren't so good and also they tend to be a little slower when compared as a whole on average to languages like C for example."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "So it's really a question of okay, what are you designing for for version one?"}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Are you designing for performance and are you designing for developer accessibility or are you designing for correctness and are you designing for a high fidelity representation of the protocol?"}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Okay, so Haskell was chosen as kind of the version one because we knew that the kinds of people who think about that are also the kinds of people that would have an easy time reading a paper like Ouroboros and working their way through all of this and they would do a pretty good job running a formal specification and then translating that into running code."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "Then once you have that, you have a blueprint that you can actually reason about, maintain and if you really wanted to, you could then turn that into a Rust code base or into a Java code base."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "Going the other way around would be kind of pointless and counterproductive."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "The other side of it is that Haskell code or functional code tends to be significantly more concise and I actually have a real life example of that."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "So if you take a look at Mantis, we implemented a full Ethereum node in Scala."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "It's only about 14 or 15,000 lines of code and you compare that with like C++ Bitcoin, I think that's 120, 150,000 lines of code."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "So it's almost 10 times smaller and so less code, less to read and you tend to read code significantly more than you would read write code."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "So it's always an advantage for a maintenance, understandability, documentation and other sort of things when you have more concise code bases and also it's a lot easier for you to apply stronger tools to a functional code base like static analysis or property based testing or these types of things than an imperative code base."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "But the thing is, it's almost like a religion or language, it's like saying, French versus Russian versus English, everybody has their adherence."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "They say, oh, they have the best poetry here."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Russian, yeah, wins."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "There you go, always a Russian."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "Everybody has their favorite tools and their favorite languages, but it just comes down to what problems are you trying to solve and what problem domain do you live in?"}, {"time": 1938, "text": "If you're inventing new protocols based on science, you're gonna take the time to write a paper, go through the peer review process as you've done personally, you know how hard it can be to get into a conference and go through that and get your ass kicked."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "Then you also have to apply the exact same level of care to the engineering side in terms of implementation of that or else you will make a mistake and that mistake will probably be an exploit in the system that destroys the security properties of the system."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "So we really had no choice but to go to some notion of functional."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "The question was, what's the Goldilocks language?"}, {"time": 1970, "text": "Do you use a hybrid language like Scala and F Sharp or Clojure where you still have some connection to understandable things like.NET or the JVM?"}, {"time": 1980, "text": "Or do you go to an overly academic language like Idris or Agda or, you know, Isabel?"}, {"time": 1986, "text": "And there you can really dial up the correctness and write all kinds of crazy proofs."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "But by the way, it's like the seven people who write your code, they go on vacation a lot, you'll never get anything done."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "So Haskell kind of felt like a nice mill ground between those two where if we needed to pull into the left, we could, if you wanted to pull into the right, you could as well."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "That said, it's really amazing to see what the hybrid languages have done."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "If I was a new student in computer science and I said, you know, learn any language to grow your career from, Scala 3 is probably the language to go with."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "Yeah, it's great, because it's like you want it to be like Java, it's Java."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "And it looks kind of like a Java program."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "You want it to be like Python and scripted and you reuse a REPL, you can do that."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "You want to go hardcore dot, you know, dependent object types and do like weird proofs and stuff and the functional, you do all that."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "You have access to all of these things and Martin Niederski is a brilliant guy."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "He's done some phenomenal work basically, because he was one guy who created the JVM and he's worked on compilers for over 20 years."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "He did a lot of really hardcore work in trying to build a concise, nice, modern language that does a little bit of everything."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And it's got great applications in data science and AI."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "It's also heavily used in modern companies, like Netflix uses Scala for all of their microservice architecture."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "Yeah, so that's a great language and it's easy to pick up and it's easy to hire people into it."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "You just find these Eastern European guys who were Java programmers for 10 years, 15 years, they got tired of making $20 an hour, so they picked up Scala so they can make $35 an hour and they're really good at it."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "And that's a great gateway drug because you have like QuickCheck and Haskell, you have ScalaCheck and Scala."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "You can also do model checking."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "You can also go and use a TLA spec and make it work with Scala and so forth."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "So it gets you a little bit of everything and you can then move around that entire design space in a beautiful way."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So the recommendation is maybe if you wanna go vanilla, you go Python and JavaScript."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "When you're getting started."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "It's the getting started."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "That'll get you everything."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "You can do web scrapers and anything."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "It's just fun."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "All this experiment with drugs in undergrad, this was where Scala 3 comes in, it's a gateway drug to then potentially more hardcore functional languages like Haskell."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "Do you think C and C++, C++ still has a role?"}, {"time": 2124, "text": "No, I think Rust is completely replaced, a need for them."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "Go and Rust, those are the two twins of doom."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "I mean, Google created Go just to get rid of C. They hated C that much."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "And then Rust is just a phenomenal language as well."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "Hate can be a great motivator."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "Let me ask a question from Reddit on this topic."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "We're going depth first today."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "As a developer, why should I be incentivized to create Cardano based applications?"}, {"time": 2150, "text": "What is on the Cardano developer roadmap?"}, {"time": 2152, "text": "Any other language, I guess this is the key question I wanna ask."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "Any other language support other than Haskell?"}, {"time": 2158, "text": "The example this person gives is TypeScript, Go, Java, Python, et cetera."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "Also, have you considered a yearly conference focused around developers?"}, {"time": 2167, "text": "Ha ha, yeah, we saw the Plutus Fest."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "And we did the first one in 2018, 2019, I can't remember."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And we were gonna do one last year, but then COVID hit."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "So we'll bring it back and we'll probably do it annually at the University of Wyoming for their hackathon there."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "In fact, it just so happens that coincides with the Goguen Summit."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "So we're doing that, I think the third week of September."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "But yeah, it's great to do an annual conference."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "You can bring a lot of cool people together and you can do hackathons and awards and so forth."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "But to the question in particular, Plutus is like any other language."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "Plutus core, you can compile things into it."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "So it's entirely possible to write a Scala to Plutus core compiler or TypeScript compiler or something like that."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "But I'm a big believer of separation of concerns and we don't live in a single chain model anymore."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "So you have a situation where you probably wanna have different execution environments and different chains."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "So you have different virtual machines there."}, {"time": 2223, "text": "And that's why we work so closely with the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Kagori Roshu's team at runtime verification."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "What they did is they said, let's start with something very familiar, LLVM, which has been around for a really long time and they happened to have created it there with Apple."}, {"time": 2237, "text": "And let's take that and translate that into the blockchain space."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "Okay, then once you have it, then it's very easy to modify compilers of standard languages like the C's and C++'s and other things that do compile to LLVM already and have them run there."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "So that's a different execution model than what we tried to build for Plutus, which focuses on correctness, okay?"}, {"time": 2258, "text": "So then all you have to really do is say, can both of these models coexist within the same ecosystem?"}, {"time": 2264, "text": "Because then you kind of, and I did a video, it was called like the island, the ocean, the pond."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "And the basic idea was say, you have an island where everything's perfect."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "Calypso lives there, life is great."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "People feed you grapes every day, but maybe you can't do everything on the island."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "And the ocean's big, it has everything, but the ocean's got sea monsters and sharks and Boaty McBoatface and all kinds of crazy stuff, right?"}, {"time": 2288, "text": "So that's what Yella is about."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "It's basically this bring LLVM into our world."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And at some point in the next three to five year time horizon, we can bring modern programming languages in, but they're gonna come in with all their flaws and their warts and their problems."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "And then the pond was the idea of the Ethereum virtual machine."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "There's some network effect around it and there's some great tooling that's materialized and evolved."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "And it's not clear if that's the standard yet, or if like MySpace or Blackberry or all of these other things, it'll fade away."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "Well, if it becomes the standard, okay, don't fight nature, just support it."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "And the same thing that gives you the ability to bolt on the LLVM will also give you the ability to bolt on the EVM and they can run with their own models and they're encapsulated, bulkheaded, separated systems, but you can move ADA applications, information between those two systems."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "And so your main chain will always stay somewhat conservative and have the minimum viable amount of expressiveness required on it to do all kinds of interesting things."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "And also for interoperability, be able to talk to all kinds of interesting things, but it's not trying to be everything to everyone."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "There's never gonna be an ice cream store in the island."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "You'll have the grapes and the beautiful women, but no ice cream."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "Now you're just like distracting me with the ice cream."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "So just for, because we'll throw around a bunch of terms, for the record, what is Plutus?"}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So Plutus is a programming language."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "It's kind of a DSL that we built on top of Haskell."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "And basically we wrote it after spending about three years thinking about all smart contracts."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "We were trying to figure out like, what is the ideal language to express a smart contract?"}, {"time": 2384, "text": "And then we started thinking, well, what is a smart contract?"}, {"time": 2386, "text": "Is it the whole application, or is it just like a sub module within an application?"}, {"time": 2390, "text": "And usually it's the latter more than the former."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "You can build a self contained program like a script, but usually what's happening is you'll have it like a video game, let's say World of Warcraft or something like that."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "You say, hey, maybe I wanna actually create gold in World of Warcraft that's actually a currency."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "Okay, so I'm gonna issue a token."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "Well, and then maybe I wanna create some mechanics behind how people are gonna trade that amongst each other."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "So that would be like a smart contract layer and issue an asset."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "So you have this centralized server running and proprietary software controlled by a single company, but then you've opened your application up to a broader world."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "And what we've done now is added a blockchain layer and the blockchain handles the accounting of that asset and the spending policy of that stuff."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "So that is a much smaller program than what Blizzard is doing with World of Warcraft."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "So the point of Plutus was let's create a language where you can write these small to midsize programs and have a high degree of confidence that they behave with correctness and also they give you deterministic results on the consumption of resources."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "You can run things locally and you actually understand what it costs to run and that doesn't change when you deploy it on the system."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "If you dial up the expressiveness of the system and like Ethereum does and these big mutable account systems, the problem is you have to have global state."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "So whatever you test locally doesn't actually necessarily translate to what you've deployed, okay?"}, {"time": 2475, "text": "So we spent a long time asking like where's the Goldilocks zone?"}, {"time": 2479, "text": "Bitcoin script was too restrictive and every single time Satoshi tried to dial it up, it led to mega problems."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "Like there was a beautiful thing called the value overflow incident in 2010, which led to the creation of billions of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "They had to quickly clean that up and sweep it under the rug and pretend like it didn't exist."}, {"time": 2496, "text": "But that was mostly because of an issue with how the scripting language was implemented."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "And when you look at Ethereum, it's like this pure game of stomping down these skirmishers where every update there's something they have to change or tune and then it's not clear how you shard such a model."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "So we said, let's build something that's in the middle of this and that's what Plutus basically is."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "And it's really designed to play very nicely with off chain infrastructure as much as on chain infrastructure."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "So you can look at all those different examples, whether it's Wolfram wants to auction off their universes or Blizzard wants to issue an in game currency or your Uber and you wanna start putting peer to peer dynamics inside your system, you're gonna gracefully connect to that on chain code."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "And it's very clear how those two things connect together."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "Just so happens Haskell's really good for this."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "They have template Haskell and it makes it very easy to embed domain specific languages."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "And it makes it very easy to wire your Haskell code onto off chain infrastructure."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "So in the future, you'll be able to have your off chain run a node or the Java virtual machine or a.NET application and there'll just be this beautiful interface and then it can talk to all your on chain code and that's written in that DSL and you have a high degree of assurance that it's right."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "Is there like a Hello World program in Plutus that reveals the beauty of this balance that you're referring to?"}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Sort of simple but not too simple, the Einstein idea?"}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Yeah, so we did do our first Hello World program actually today."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "Yeah, I heard about this."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "Yeah, but you know, there you'd want to have the whole round trip."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "So you'd like to have an interaction and I think a video game would probably show it the best."}, {"time": 2592, "text": "Like if we could re implement CryptoKitties or something like that on it and you have this off chain infrastructure and you have your GUI in your front end, it's running on your phone or a browser and most of that lives off chain."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "And then, but your CryptoKitties, they'd live on the blockchain."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "The whole round trip end to end with relatively low fees and low latency and high availability of service, it never goes down."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "That would probably be the best thing to do and we'll have something like that by August."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "It's pretty easy to build this stuff."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "So what kind of off chain interactions are supported with Plutus?"}, {"time": 2621, "text": "What are the limits you want to put on the thing so it doesn't get chaotic?"}, {"time": 2625, "text": "That's the beautiful thing."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "When you have a less expressive model on chain, it means you can do anything you want off chain."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "So you started talking about smart contracts, but let's zoom back out and ask the big question here is what is a blockchain and what is a cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 2642, "text": "So a blockchain is just a ledger and really it has three nice properties."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "You're timestamped, you're immutable and auditable, either in a global or a local sense."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "And so there's all kinds of things mankind has invented where it's really important that when you put some information down, it doesn't change and other people can see it and that you know when it was put down."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "For example, a property ledger."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "So when you buy land or you have rights associated with land like mineral rights or water rights or these things, you'd like to transitively see how does it go from Alice to Bob to Charlie to Jim and so forth and what was the state of these things as they were transitioning?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "So how much did they pay, when did it occur, et cetera, et cetera, the metadata that follows that."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "Okay, well normally these types of ledgers are so important that they're managed either by governments or regulated entities."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "And the issues are that while they can be efficient, they're generally brittle to political manipulation and they're brittle to geopolitical events."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "For example, when Syria fell apart, the very first thing ISIS did, they started saying, hey, the ownership of the land, it's gonna fundamentally change."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "We've decided that this guy over here now owns all these things and then when peace comes, how do you unwind all of that, put it all back together?"}, {"time": 2718, "text": "So the power of a blockchain is that it gives you a transnational way of sorting all these details out, putting all together in a place that you know that even if it's inconvenient to a very powerful actor, that it will still stay preserved."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "This is an asymmetry we haven't had as a society."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "Usually kings and empires, they have the ability to decide what's true."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "And then suddenly you have this asymmetrical thing that is above them, kind of like a synthetic laws of physics and once something goes in there, you know that that's there."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "Okay, so that's the first part of it."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "The second part of it is that it's auditable, meaning that instead of saying only the high cleric or the president or some very special club of people get to see what's going on, suddenly now all the people can actually see who owns what where."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "Like imagine a tax system where the public club just leaked the taxes of all these different billionaires and said, well, how much do they make and how much do they pay?"}, {"time": 2781, "text": "Well, imagine a tax system where that's just done by default or other social systems where this type of information is put in by default."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "So it's tremendously useful, this type of structure and all kinds of things, medical records, supply chains, just a good thought experiment is I travel a lot, I've been to 52 countries in the last five years."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "Imagine if I got sick in Zimbabwe, I get hit by a car or something and I'm unconscious and a Zimbabwean doctor calls my doctor in Colorado and says, hey, I need all Charles's medical records."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "He's unconscious right now, but I need it to treat him because he's quite ill."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "They'd say, who is this person in Zimbabwe?"}, {"time": 2818, "text": "I don't know you, I can't give you his records, I need his consent."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "Oh no, he's unconscious in the hospital, I can't do it."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "Well, a broker system that would allow the movement of medical records would be an example of what a blockchain could potentially do in the foreseeable future."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "Cryptocurrency is just an application that runs on top of blockchain because it turns out that when you issue property, you also can issue tokens of value and then you could have a monetary policy, it could be inflationary or deflationary, you know, demurrage where it decays over time or whatever have you."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "And the very same mechanics that would ensure your property records are secure, your medical record access is secure, could also be applied for the ownership of the cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "And again, you can either be completely transparent and everybody can see what everybody owns and that's what Bitcoin does, or you can be as opaque as you seek to be, that's what Zcash basically attempts to do."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "It says, hey, let's keep these things as private as possible."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "But they have relatively the same mechanics in terms of those properties of auditability and timestamping and immutability."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "You know things won't be reversed, you know, that people aren't gonna manipulate the timestamps and you can audit at least enough to know that the ownership is right."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "But the way, if you think about physics and the universe, the universe has figured out a way to update the ledger of physics in a way where like a lot of people can be updating it and it stays consistent."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "Is there something you can say about the task of updating the ledger when a bunch of people are trying to do it or a bunch of entities are trying to do it?"}, {"time": 2904, "text": "Oh yeah, that's the whole point of a consensus algorithm."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So whatever ledger you're running, there has to be some mechanism to decide who's in charge."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "And that's what proof of work does and proof of stake does and all these other systems."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "And you break them down to basically three steps."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "And so we'll use Eve for kind of step number one."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "Hi, Eve, how are you doing?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And we're gonna use Wally for step number two."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "And I need the monkey, give me the monkey."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "What's the monkey's name?"}, {"time": 2929, "text":

pondering its own mortality."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "And so anyway, the first step is all about basically deciding who's in charge for that moment."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "So blockchain is just a sequence of events."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "The heart has to beat, the metronome has to click."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "So somebody has to be in charge."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "And so generally you have this notion of a resource."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "So there's some pool of resource out there and it can be a token."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "And in that case, it's a plutocratic system and that's what proof of stake does or it can be computation, but there can be other resources."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "But computation is what proof of work does."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "And so you make so many hashes and then eventually somebody wins."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "And that person who wins is now the person who basically gets to decide the order of transactions and put them all together from their perspective in the system."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "Then once that person wins, they'll make the block."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "That's step two."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "And after it's made, transmit it and it gets validated and accepted."}, {"time": 2983, "text": "So actually it's quite fortuitous you have the magnifying glass because at this stage people are trying to decide is what I'm looking at correct or not."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Now, there are other ways to potentially conceive of this, but this particular model gives you a kind of a way of thinking of all consensus algorithms in one setting."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "You can be Algorand, you can be a classic BFT protocol, you can be Paxos, you can be Raft, you can be proof of work, you can be proof of stake."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "It's always the same idea."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "You have to find someone or some group to be in charge."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "They'll reach a consensus on order."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "They have to then do some work, change the state of the system, update it, and then the network has to accept that that's valid."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "So even if this process works well, this side will say, oh, you created a Bitcoin at a thin air, you're not allowed to do that."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "So that's rejected."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "So there's checks and balances and guards all the way through."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "There's a meta question of fairness in all of this."}, {"time": 3039, "text": "So the proof of work people, they're kind of a cult and they say that this is the only truth and everything out here, any other resource is not legitimate or valid."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "And there's not a lot of evidence to that, but that's what they believe."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "The proof of stake people, the downside and weakness they have is it's a plutocratic model."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "The more ownership of the system you have, the more control you have over that system."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "And it suffers from the same thing that shareholder models suffer from, whereas you may maximize short term gain over the long term viability of the system."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "So a really cool question is, can you build systems that are multi resource?"}, {"time": 3074, "text": "So instead of just pulling from one resource to select who wins, this 25% of the time and maybe this 25%, you can do that."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "In fact, the cryptocurrency space did that a long time ago."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "There was a cryptocurrency called Peercoin in 2011, and it was a hybrid proof of work proof of stake."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "So some of the blocks were made with the token ownership distribution and some of the blocks were made with proof of work, but you could keep adding."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "You could put in like, hey, I want hard disk in my thing."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "You can put Permacoin in or something like that."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "So it created incentive for hard drives."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "And then you could say, oh no, I want to do like a human system, like a proof of merit."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "Oh my God, now we're up to four."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "And you just keep adding."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "And each of these pools will have different adherence and actors, and then you can actually balance out the whole thing."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "So as opposed to having one cult, you have many cults."}, {"time": 3119, "text": "And they argue."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "And the cults argue with each other and we call that a government."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "By the way, not all cults are bad."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "Physics is a cult too."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "And it's sometimes bad."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "It's honest at least."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "Nature is a cult."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "Nature is metal, I saw it on Instagram."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "So that's really the crux of it."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "You have a ledger and the ledger is just all about saying, hey, we need to put some stuff in here."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "And once it's put in here, you can't turn it back."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "And you know when it was put in and everybody can see it or some group can see it."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "And then you need to pick somebody to modify that."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "So all this chaos will happen."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "All these transactions are all around the world and our perception of them are different."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "There's a beautiful paper from Lamport that kind of talks about this from the 70s."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "It's like one of the most classic papers ever in computer science."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "I think it's been cited like 50,000 times or something like that."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "It's a crazy paper."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "But basically you have to figure out, okay, well, somebody has to be in charge."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "Some group has to be in charge."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And you can do it with a meritocratic, hashocratic computation thing."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "You can say, well, if you have coins 25% of supply, 25% of the time on average, you'll be selected to have the right to do this or give it to somebody else."}, {"time": 3186, "text": "Or you could search for other resources."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "And they can even be human resources, like some notion of merit or social benefit."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "Maybe you get a token for that and you can weight it with these other systems."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "And that's where kind of where everything's going."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "We're getting to a point where we've really optimized all the properties here."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "We've proven all these nice things about it."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "And there's a lot of competition to basically build like the perfect proof of stake system, whether you're Polkadot or Algorand or any of these other guys."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "But now the next step is say, well, why don't we just have one?"}, {"time": 3216, "text": "We should have multiple resources."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "And the point is each of these has different trade off profiles."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "And so they balance each other and you end up building a much more resilient system."}, {"time": 3225, "text": "So it's not winner take all with one particular demand."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "Okay, so there's a million questions that spring up right there."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "But first linger on this topic and say, what is proof of work?"}, {"time": 3235, "text": "What is proof of stake?"}, {"time": 3236, "text": "Just zooming in on each of those."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "And what are the differences?"}, {"time": 3241, "text": "Okay, so they all have the same three properties of pick someone in charge, do something and validate it."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "The difference is that the picking mechanism for proof of work is you have to solve a puzzle."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "So it's basically like buying lottery tickets and you can buy a certain amount every second with your computing devices."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "And some of them are ASIC resistant."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "So you run them on like a laptop or a GPU."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "And some of them are you specialized hardware that you have to either manufacturer or buy from someone who sells it to you."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "And that's just how many tickets per second you can get."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And eventually you hit those magic numbers."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "When you do, it means you have the right to make the block and generally you bundle the block making with the proof of work system."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "Now you can do this looking for a single or you can do this to actually shard it and look for multiple block makers at the same time."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "So there are sharded proof of work protocols like Prism is an example of that."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "And actually Ethereum got started this way with Spectre and Ghost and Phantom, the Aviz Ahar's work and Yonatan Sonlopinsky."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "But the basic idea is you pick some collection of people, they make some collection of things and there's some way to sort it all out, serialize it and prevent double spends, great."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "Proof of stake is the same, but it's a synthetic resource."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "So instead of doing things, they say, well, if you had 25% of the hash power on average over a long period of time, you'd probably win 25% of the time."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "Well, why don't we just introduce some randomness in from some source and then 25% of the time on average over a long period of time, you'll win."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "So it's a synthetic resource, but you still have to do the other two things."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "You still have to make the block and you still have to validate the block."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "The big difference is this step in the proof of work world is horrendously expensive."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "You use more energy than the nation of Switzerland."}, {"time": 3341, "text": "And the problem with that is that you have less resources for the other two."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "And the other problem with that is that if this is horrendously expensive, you have an economy of scale kick in."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "So what ends up happening is the system becomes less decentralized over time because you have these vertically integrated operations."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "I mean, not everybody can go build a mining facility on a volcano in El Salvador."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "Not everybody can go to Mongolia and set up a five gigawatt power plant and a huge data thing."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "Not everybody has access to the patented basics that people produce."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "Because what if I don't sell it to you and I have the patent on it?"}, {"time": 3372, "text": "Or what if I control the supply chain for these things?"}, {"time": 3375, "text": "So you'll end up having centralization around maybe 10 or five major operations as we've seen historically with proof of work."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "And that means you end up having like a ruling class of a mining oligarchy in the system."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "Proof of stake, if you design the parameters correctly, you actually get more decentralized over time because as the currency goes up in value, the distribution of the currency tends to get more egalitarian."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "For example, Bill Gates, when he started Microsoft, he had 64% of the shares."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "Now he has less than 5% of the shares."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "So this founder drift over time, as the value goes up, divestment occurs, you have more and more and more people coming in."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "That means there's more people who can participate in the consensus."}, {"time": 3419, "text": "You can even tune economic parameters."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "And this is what we did with Cardano and Ouroboros."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "We created this concept of K in the system and it's just a parameter."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "And it's like a forcing factor that tends to accumulate a certain amount of stake pools."}, {"time": 3432, "text": "So you can set it to 200 and then 500 and 1000 and so forth."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "But the basic idea is as the price of ADA goes up, you make K larger and then you end up in practical terms having a larger and larger set of actors making blocks that are unique and distinct."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "And the other good thing is this is a virtual resource instead of a physical resource, which means it's portable by the click of a button."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "So let's say China says, mining is bad, we're gonna shut it all down."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "And it looks like they're moving in that direction."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "You have all these people in WeChat, just like trying to sell miners or trying to figure out how the hell do I move miners, because they have these huge data centers they've constructed."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "You can't exactly go and grab a server and like take it with you, it's huge."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "It's a lot of work."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "And if the government sees it, well, it's their property now."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "A virtual resource, you can click a button and redeploy it to a different jurisdiction."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "So to me, for a virtual asset, it makes a lot more sense to try to tie your security to something endogenous, something within the system, because it's just like the asset, it can move anywhere at a click of a button and human beings have a much harder time attacking something like that."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "Well, so people, maybe you could sort of play devil's advocate and say, what is the strength of proof of work system?"}, {"time": 3501, "text": "Because some people would argue that proof of work has, because it's outside the system, it's tied to physical resources, it's more secure."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "It's less prone to attack by large groups of people."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And the first question we had was, could proof of stake actually work or not?"}, {"time": 3521, "text": "So the problem was that the engineers kind of led when the science should have led."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "And so there were all these POS protocols that came out in the early 2010s, like Peercoin was the first and then NXT and others came out."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "And there they had suffered from things like the random number generation wasn't good."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "They had grinding attacks and nothing at stake and all these other things."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "And there's a lot of beautiful properties for proof of work from a theoretical sense."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "We even wrote a paper called GKL, named after the authors, Juan Gray, Niko Leonardis and Agelos Gassis, our chief scientist."}, {"time": 3553, "text": "It's got 1100 citations now and it was published in 2015."}, {"time": 3557, "text": "But basically all it did is just model the blockchain and created some security properties for it."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "And then it started talking about, well, what does proof of work actually do for you?"}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And it turns out it does a lot."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "It's an asynchronous system."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "You can bootstrap from Genesis."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "So if Eve joins the network and Wally joins the network and Daisy joined the network, then you give them some different chains, like five or 10 different chains."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "They can run a calculation and they will always pick the

actually needed to solve that in proof of stake with a trusted checkpoint."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "So some actor had to be observing, watching the whole thing and creating checkpoints."}, {"time": 3600, "text": "And then when new people joined in, they would only be able to distinguish between a chain based upon a checkpoint telling them that."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "So you have to do a lot of really wonky, crazy math to show and create this notion of like density to be able to show that that's possible."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "But there's a lot of properties of proof of work that were super hard to replicate and emulate in the proof of stake world."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "Macaulay kind of revolutionized the whole VRF thing."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "There was a group out of Cornell that talked about better network conditions."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "They wrote a paper called Sleepy."}, {"time": 3630, "text": "We did Genesis."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "We also did the very first proofably secure protocol, but that was six years of work and like 12 papers."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "And it's still not done."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "There's still a few polishing things that have to be cleaned up because this is a physical resource and there's something there."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "But there's a flaw to proof of work that is a little problematic."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "It's a winner take all type of a system."}, {"time": 3651, "text": "So maximalism is kind of philosophically and computationally built into it."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "Let's say you have two proof of work systems and they have roughly the same market cap and hash rate."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "And they use the same algorithm."}, {"time": 3665, "text": "Then the problem is if the miner comes in and let's say the miner has enough resources to have 51% for any of these chains, they actually have a perverse incentive to come and destroy one chain and short sell the asset, it's called a gold finger attack, and then go mine the other asset because they're not bound to that asset."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "They're not loyal to it."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "And they can make just as much profit mining this as they can make mining the other system and the markets allow them to profit from the destruction of a system."}, {"time": 3695, "text": "So that's something that proof of stake doesn't suffer from because the only way you can participate in a proof of stake system is you have to actually own equity and you have to have ownership in that system."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "So if you go and destroy Daisy's chain, it would just be a net loss for the most part, unless you have really messed up markets or something like that."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "So there's always trade offs and all these things."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "And this is why I like this concept of going one to end and having multiple resources, because why not have proof of work and proof of stake together?"}, {"time": 3722, "text": "If the proof of work is useful, not wasted computation, and why not add other things like create incentives for network relay?"}, {"time": 3728, "text": "Right now there's no incentives in the system for you to run peer to peer nodes and the shared data."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "Right now it's not a problem, but if you're running like Amazon web services level of bandwidth, it could cost you like $5,000 a month in bandwidth just to run a full node or something like that."}, {"time": 3741, "text":

bright."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "And these really bright people, what they do is they try to do everything all at once because they're really, really smart and they keep going until they run up against the wall and they realize the problem is a lot harder."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "If you're more experienced, and that's why we brought in proper academics like Aggelos and others, because they've been beaten up through life, Aggelos worked with David Chom and these other, it's really hard work with those guys."}, {"time": 3799, "text": "And they'd already been humiliated and yelled at and had chalk thrown at them and all that stuff."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "And so they were humble enough to say, I'm not smart enough to solve the big problem."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "So don't even try."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "What you do is you decompose it and you say, okay, what's the first problem to solve in a chain of problems that you can compose your way up to a working

Ouroboros protocol in 2017."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "And that protocol was like a synchronous system and it assumed the nodes were always on and it worked, but it was useless because that's not real life."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "Then Prowse came out and then suddenly we relaxed things."}, {"time": 3850, "text": "So these are all, by the way, names for consensus algorithms."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "Yeah, papers that we published and they were all peer reviewed."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "Like GKL was EuroCrypt."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "That's a very hard conference to get into."},

that there was some merit to the work that was done."}, {"time": 3871, "text": "Second, it solved a particular class of problems, either showing the feasibility of the entire problem."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "Because when I said, let's do the model first because let's see if we can do an FLP thing."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "Let's see if we can get them a possibility theorem."}, {"time": 3882, "text": "That's great because you're done."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "It's like those short math papers were like, I found a counterexample."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "It's like, oh, okay, this whole thing has fallen apart because you have a two line proof, thank you."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "So that's what we were looking for in the beginning of the agenda was, let's either prove it's

know ahead of time, you can attack them."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "You can DDoS them, you cause all kinds of problems."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "So adaptive security, also we moved from an MPC,

little dirtier."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "Because Algorand actually did some great work there."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "There was some good knowledge there."}, {"time": 3953, "text": "What are the really hard problems that you, maybe if you just linger on a little bit, what are some of the really hard problems you have to solve along this chain of papers, ideas, the evolution of the consensus algorithm?"}, {"time": 3963, "text": "Yeah, not only are they really hard problems, they actually require different cryptographers because you're moving from mathematician style cryptographers like the Neil Koblitz's and the Addie Shamir's and the people that like start as proper mathematicians."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "They really love theory and that's their thing."}, {"time": 3977, "text":

that."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "I know how to think about that."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "So that transition from GKL to Ouroboros Classic to Prowse, I'd say the biggest leap was Classic to Prowse

"text": "And so this is a beautiful kind of interdisciplinary notion that layers computer science and biology together."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "And minute that complexity starts going up, you start seeing cell specialization."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "So you go from single cell organisms to organisms where you have eyeballs and brains and hearts and each of these tissues do different things."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "Well, analogously, complex distributed systems start getting specialization."}, {"time": 4071, "text": "So you introduce this concept of the stake pool and suddenly now you

deeply and carefully about, okay, well, can this now introduce a new attack vector that we didn't have before?"}, {"time": 4102, "text": "So that leap from classic to Prowse and adding in stake pools and figuring out how to handle the game theory there was exceedingly hard."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "It took two years to do that."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "So stake pools allow for multiple parties to delegate their staking capabilities to others."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "Can you describe a little bit how this works?"}, {"time": 4119, "text": "It's a super simple concept."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "So you register a pool and then the pool is there and basically they advertise and they're actually registered on chain with a certificate."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "And then in the wallet software itself, you can see all of the pools that have registered."}, {"time": 4133, "text": "There's over 3000 of them now inside the system."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "And then you can click a little tile and it shows you all the metadata that's in the certificate and says, hey, I have my own pool."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "It's called rats, king of the rats."}, {"time": 4145, "text": "So you can see all this stuff that's described there and pools have an operating fee cause they're like a business."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "And they say, well, if you delegate to me, I'll charge this much."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "So if you get like a hundred bucks in rewards, I'll give you 90 and I'll take 10 or something like that."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "And then you make your decision and whichever one you select, you click delegate, push the button and then you have now given your staking rights to them until revoked."}, {"time": 4169, "text": "Okay, so it lives there."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And then the stake pools weight in the system is proportional to the amount of stake that they have delegated to them."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "And then we have this other limiting factor K, which says that you get diminishing returns with the more stake you have."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "So it's kind of like an S function."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "So you kind of go up and up and then eventually caps and then at some point you get no rewards beyond a certain threshold."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "So there's an incentive to split pools to different owners after some point."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "Yeah, and so that's a complex thing and you have to actually model the game theory out to understand where those parameters should be set."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "And we didn't know how to do that."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "So what we did is we bought talent."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "We went to Oxford and we hired this guy named Elias Kasupis, he's an algorithmic game theorist."}, {"time": 4208, "text": "We said, hey, would you like to do some game theory work in crypto?"}, {"time": 4212, "text": "And he's like, that sounds fun."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "So he spent a year and a half, we built all these beautiful models and we kind of figured out what those curves needed to look like."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "So figure out like the S curve that would result in a nice distribution of responsibility."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "So not everybody delegates to the king of the rats."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "How does it feel to be royalty, by the way?"}, {"time": 4228, "text": "It's not a very impressive kingdom, but you're nevertheless a king."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "I'll take it, because I think it's the kindest thing people call me in this space."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "Yeah, people love you."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "So, okay, so that, I mean, so is that, would you say a solved problem?"}, {"time": 4243, "text": "The game theory of stake pools?"}, {"time": 4245, "text": "No, it's the starting, and I was getting back to my original point that you build things in iterations."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "Every step, if you've done it right, is an invitation for 10 more sexy, fascinating, fun problems."}, {"time": 4256, "text": "And this is why we have such a great time building labs."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "We started in Edinburgh, now we're at Tokyo Tech and University of Wyoming and Athens, and we're setting up more labs this year."}, {"time": 4265, "text": "And all these academics wanna work with us, hey, because we write a lot of really fascinating papers, but B, because we're focused on all these really cool, sexy, interdisciplinary problems."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "We're actually running into problems where we don't even know where to publish the paper."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "Because you'll have this paper where there's like these PL guys working with crypto guys, working with systems guys, working with economists."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "And you put it all together and you have this Frankenstein paper monster, and we're like, where do we submit this?"}, {"time": 4287, "text": "Where does this go?"}, {"time": 4289, "text": "Yeah, there we go."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "Nature or quanta or something, I don't know."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "It'll write a nice little."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "So the sexy problems multiply exponentially."}, {"time": 4296, "text": "Exactly, and we've now gotten to a point where we're starting to work on refinements to the system rather than fundamental things that are like, if you don't solve it, the system just simply doesn't work."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "For example, you can run all of this with NTP as your clock server, but you actually can create a notion of time with N. We wrote a paper called the Workforce Chronos for that."}, {"time": 4315, "text": "But that's not necessary for the system."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "It's just a nice to have thing."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "It's a nice property."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "Optimization of the random number generation is another example of that."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "You can run it with a heavier thing."},

run the system every five days with Cardano, but there's been derivative work."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "We didn't even do this."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "This work occurred at University of Illinois."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "And that derivative work said, well, you don't actually need to do that."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "You can do it on a block by block basis."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "It's like, ooh, that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "So that's the other point about doing things in a very rigorous way is that that way creates a lingua franca for what you're trying to solve with the totality of the academic community."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "So suddenly people that you've never met, you know nothing about have read your papers, cited your papers and start writing their own papers, either to try to attack and destroy things you've done or to build on top of the things that you've done."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "So people are trying to figure out ways to attack this."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "As rigorous as you are trying to build up."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "And I don't have to pay them."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "It's fun to try to destroy and that's how we grow stronger."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "And it's how you build your career too."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "There's plenty of people that they've gotten tenure just kicking the hell out of Intel SGX."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "You go to CCS every year, there's some guy there and he's having a hell of a time making Intel cry."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "Can we pull back historically speaking and in terms of the big picture of cryptocurrency real quick and ask the question, what is Cardano?"}, {"time": 4399, "text": "We started talking about already the consensus algorithm Cardano takes."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "But maybe when you look at the history books, you know, sort of a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Cardano will have one sentence."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "What's that one sentence going to be?"}, {"time": 4413, "text": "And in general, what's like the vision in the context of the history of cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 4417, "text": "You have like this whiteboard overview video that you talk about the three generations of cryptocurrency where Cardano is the third."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "So that's like five different questions way of asking the exact same thing you can answer however the hell you want."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "You know, I always termed Cardano as like a FOSS, a financial operating system and nobody likes it and everybody picks on me for using that term."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "But basically the idea is that, you know, the world runs on systems, especially the financial world."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "You have, you know, the BIS and Swift and all this other stuff."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "And these protocols allow you to move value around and represent things like identity."}, {"time": 4453,

don't work so well for people who aren't in rich countries."}, {"time": 4465, "text": "And so the point of what we do, or at least what I do and what my company does is we think a lot about how do we build a universal protocol that does all the stuff the legacy system has but just does it better, faster and cheaper for everybody in the world."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "And everybody has equal access to it, you know?"}, {"time": 4482, "text": "So it's the people's protocol."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "You know, you have a situation where the guy in Senegal has the same access that I do or Bill Gates does or someone else who's kind of higher on the spectrum of wealth and power."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And so that is what we seek to achieve."}, {"time": 4496, "text": "But then the question is well, is Cardano the solution?"}, {"time": 4499, "text": "You know, is that that thing?"}, {"time": 4501, "text": "And the answer is no, because you need a lot more evolution."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "You need decades of evolution to kind of work your way there."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "And in many ways the work is never quite done but it's better than what came before."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "Because you have a realization that first the control of the system needs to be more balanced and nuanced and it needs to be more democratic."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "So there's this sustainability component of who's in charge and how do you pay for things?"}, {"time": 4528, "text": "Well, the system can print its own money so it always has the ability to have a budget."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "Okay, so there's a treasury idea."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "And then there's a voting thing."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "Well, the same things that allow you to move money around allow you to represent votes."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "So you can do eVoting with the type of system, okay."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "And you know, if you played Gnomic in the 1980s or Peter

because nothing understands each other right now."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "There are all these chains are blind, deaf and dumb to each other."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "And then there's this thing that it has to work at a huge scale, like billions of people."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "And we've done that, but we've done that with large multinational trillion dollar companies with centralized

done in a lot of media interviews, because I think it really helps people understand where we're at in the clock is face things in terms of generations."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "And so I said, well, the first generation is Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "And really the problem Bitcoin was trying to solve is saying every time we wanna represent or move value, we need some sort of trusted third

minute you have that, and suddenly you have ICOs and DeFi and STOs and NFTs and all these word salads of things and then people start using it, they get frustrated."}, {"time": 5114, "text": "Because

no group of people you can bring in and thus the internet evolves very slowly, you see?"}, {"time": 5178, "text": "And so that's the problem is that you have this situation where you wanna do lots of utility, you wanna do a lot of things, you wanna be a financial operating system and be everything to everyone but then your rate of evolution slows down as your rate of adoption speeds up."},

use and utility?"}, {"time": 5336, "text": "You know, all these layer two protocols and these DeFi applications in five years, they're completely protocol and blockchain agnostic because at the end of the day, they care about liquidity, operating cost and user experience."}, {"time": 5347, "text": "It's so a preposterous and absurd for somebody to say, oh, well, I'm gonna go build my application,

that."}, {"time": 5390, "text": "TCPIP didn't have a token connected to it."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "There was no financial incentive where if TCPIP got adopted over something else, they'd make some big company crazy amounts of money."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "It was a useful piece of infrastructure."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "So I think that the third generation is gonna be as defined by the social components and the usability components as it is by the technological capabilities of the system."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "Really what these technological capabilities gave you was the ability to demonstrate a proof of concept and say these things are possible."}, {"time": 5419, "text": "Kind of like Xerox PARC, when Steve and Bill came in, they said, wow, you have networked

productize something like that."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "And in that case, it actually took several decades to roll out that vision that those guys had."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "And I think that's what Bitcoin and Ethereum did."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "But what's unique about this is normally you throw away the prior experiments."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "With these things, these are self evolving systems."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "So it's entirely possible to, Joe Rogan quote, to evolve Bitcoin to a point where it could become a third generation system if desired, as some amalgamation of layer one and layer two protocols."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "And it's the same for Ethereum."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "In fact, Vitalik is throwing away Ethereum and replacing with Ethereum too, because he recognizes he needs to upgrade and evolve the system."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "And that's what makes it fun because the techniques and methodologies that they've chosen to evolve and upgrade this system are distinctly different from the ones that we've chosen."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "And we have no idea which one's actually going to win, but we learn from each other and we co evolve from each other."}, {"time": 5490, "text": "So you're running like all these experiments in real time in a giant marketplace, and maybe they'll consolidate, maybe they'll stay divergent."}, {"time": 5496, "text": "I mean, look at big tech, you have Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, they all coexist and they're trillion dollar companies."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "Some cases with TCP, it consolidates to one standard."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "And that's what we ended up using."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "So what's your intuition with Cardano having the proof of stake, and then eventually smart contracts versus the Bitcoin with layer two technologies, this kind of evolving creature."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "Again, you said you can't really predict the future, but what's your intuition why one might be more successful than the other?"}, {"time": 5530, "text": "So the problem with Bitcoin is it is so slow."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "It's like the mainframe programming of the past."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "And the only reason it's still around is because there was so much invested in keeping it around that we just kind of have to leave it

the network effect, it has the brand name, it has the regulatory approval, but there's no way to change the system, even correcting obvious downsides in that system."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "Now,

say, okay, the script is correct, but you don't have to run the whole program."}, {"time": 6547, "text": "So there's a lot, I'm not doing the topic justice, there's a lot more to it, but that's the basic concept."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "And in a Redeemer validator model, you need stuff like that, because as your model gets more complex and a lot more things happen, you don't want to have a

to check the proof of work."}, {"time": 6637, "text": "Cryptography also works this way."}, {"time": 6638, "text": "You have some trap door where you can verify something's correct, but to get that thing done, if you're doing it brute force, it takes an enormous amount of computation."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "Well, not all problems are like this, like protein folding, to verify the protein is folded correctly, you have to fold the protein."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "So you have to redo the work."}, {"time": 6653, "text": "But what if for arbitrary computation, you could take a problem, and

{"time": 6666, "text": "Well, Microsoft actually wrote a paper on how to do that."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "It's called Pinocchio."}, {"time": 6670, "text": "So that's another example of these types of things, these rollups of things where instead of doing the computation on chain or trying to create some sort of replicated machine that does all this stuff, you instead just say, okay, only thing I'm gonna use the blockchain for is to check your proof."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "But I'm gonna turn it into a distributed computing problem, and any person in the world can do the problem on any server, untrusted server even, because you don't have to trust the output, you trust the proof, and the proof is deterministic."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "It tells you these things."}, {"time": 6697,

from I'm doing the work to I'm checking that the work was done correctly."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "And all of a sudden, we're back to the P equals NP thing where for many very interesting problems, the checking is efficient, is much more efficient than the solving."}, {"time": 6721, "text": "Right, and also do you want complete determinism or is it probabilistic?"}, {"time": 6725, "text":

explicitly to facilitate more expressive smart contracts."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "On the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTXO also for good reasons, including that its semantic model stays simple in a complex concurrent and distributed computing environment."}, {"time": 6777, "text": "This raises the question of whether it is possible to have expressive smart contracts while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "So what's the fuck that mean?"}, {"time": 6789, "text": "What is UTXO, what is the account model, and what is the idea of the Extended UTXO model?"}, {"time": 6797, "text": "So I guess the easiest way of visualizing it is that UTXO is kind of like cash register accounting."}, {"time": 6802, "text": "So let's assume you don't have credit cards, you just have cash."}, {"time": 6805, "text": "And so when you go and buy some milk and potatoes or whatever and you go to the cashier, you pull out your $20 bill, you give it to them, unless

remaining change that goes back to you, okay?"}, {"time": 6843, "text": "The problem with this particular model is that the way it was implemented with Bitcoin, there was no notion of how do we run complex predicates, complex contracts on this thing, where instead of just saying, okay, I'm just gonna push value to you, I wanna put lots of terms and conditions into the movement of that value."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "Like you only get this if I mow your lawn on Tuesday or you only get this if some event happens like the Broncos win the Super Bowl or something like that."}, {"time": 6872, "text": "Okay, so you need some notion of programmability with it."}, {"time": 6875, "text": "So a lot of people are trying to figure out in the early days of Bitcoin, how could we improve the expressiveness of the system?"}, {"time": 6881, "text": "And one of ways of doing it is you can go to a different accounting model, bank style accounting."}, {"time": 6888, "text": "So in a bank ledger, every time you do a withdrawal, a deposit, it's a mutable system."}, {"time": 6894, "text": "With the cash register accounting, you don't tear up the bills, but the bank you can deduct or add ledger all the time."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "So Ethereum kind of works in that bank accounting system where you just, you send messages, you send transactions and you're going up or down."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "And so you can trigger programs the same way."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "So what we did is we said, okay, if you take the UTXO model and you have some data to it, and instead of saying it's just a digital signature, but it's in a script, you can basically create something that's still the same as cash register, but now you have programmability and the big difference is local versus global."}, {"time": 6928, "text": "So in the case of UTXO, your scripts are your concerns."}, {"time": 6932, "text": "So whatever's going on in that cash register has no bearing or impact on the other cash registers."}, {"time": 6937, "text": "But when you look at bank accounting, you have to know the state of the entire banking world to be able to make that work."}, {"time": 6944, "text": "Because if that transaction is inbound, that wire transfer is inbound, you have to know those funds are actually there, that thing is actually happening."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "So when you have a global state for a program, it's like you could do a lot more with it, but it's a lot more dangerous."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "And so you have to build all these mechanisms to try to protect yourself from it."}, {"time": 6958, "text": "So what we did is we said, okay, add data, add a programmability, and you're kind of in this nice Goldilocks zone between what Ethereum did with an account style model and a global state system."}, {"time": 6968, "text": "And you're not as restrictive as Bitcoin, but you're still in a Turing complete world, you can still run all kinds of things."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "And then any standard mathematician, they'll say, okay, well, is it isomorphic?"}, {"time": 6979, "text": "Is there a mapping between this?"}, {"time": 6981, "text": "What type of function can I actually take something expressed in one structure and transmit it to the other structure and properties are preserved?"}, {"time": 6988, "text": "So we wrote a paper, it's called Climatic Ledgers, where we actually showed that UTXO, Extended UTXO and accounts are somewhat similar in that you could map things that happen in one system to the other system, the properties are preserved between the two."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "So in practice, what's nice about Extended UTXO is that you can put infrastructure on top of it to make the development experience relatively similar to the development experience of what you would do with Ethereum, but you don't have to worry about this global state."}, {"time": 7018, "text": "So when you talk about sharding, it's a lot easier to do that."}, {"time": 7021, "text": "It's a lot more conceivable to that."}, {"time": 7022, "text": "And also you get determinism in the system."}, {"time": 7025, "text": "So when I have a Plutus smart contract, whatever I run locally is exactly what I expect to run in the system."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "When you have a concept of this mutable global state in the system, whatever you run locally is not necessarily what you're gonna get when you actually push it into the system."}, {"time": 7038, "text": "So you may misprice things and the contract will fail."}, {"time": 7041, "text": "It doesn't ever happen in the Plutus world."}, {"time": 7043, "text": "So you got a lot of advantages with this particular model."}, {"time": 7046, "text": "The downside is that it's a little bit less expressive on the boundaries and a little bit harder to write certain types of software with it."}, {"time": 7054, "text": "But again, how you resolve that is you kind of build higher level languages and other such things that compensate for these types of things and design patterns that compensate for these types of things."}, {"time": 7065, "text": "The other advantage that we have that's really fun and exciting is that Bitcoin lives in this model and there are other UTXO based systems."}, {"time": 7072, "text": "And so they're all talking about smart contracts as well."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "And they would like to continue working in the UTXO model."}, {"time": 7078, "text": "So if you're a Bitcoin contract developer or other things, there's actually already a group of people that understand this very well."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "And that's still a fairly large part of the mindshare of the entire space."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "So there are no silver bullets."}, {"time": 7089, "text": "And anytime you pick a particular model, there's an upside and a downside."}, {"time": 7093, "text": "And there's different ways of doing things from cash register accounting or bank accounting."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "You can even do different accounting models."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "But we felt this was kind of the best first step to go into because we started with something very familiar that had a long history behind it."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "And it maps very beautifully to functional programming principles."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "This concept of immutability and these things and much more strict management of state and no notion of having this global concept that you have to kind of manage as you break up the system."}, {"time": 7123, "text": "Now in practice, what does this mean to the developer when they actually start real writing an application?"}, {"time": 7130, "text": "Not too much."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "There's gonna be a little bit of retooling and some new patterns you have to learn."}, {"time": 7134, "text": "But in practice, you can still do the same things."}, {"time": 7136, "text": "You can implement a Uniswap style thing."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "In fact, we even wrote that code with the Plutus Pioneers program."}, {"time": 7141, "text": "So you can go to YouTube and watch a lecture and see how that's done."}, {"time": 7145, "text": "You can do a stable coin."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "You can do an Oracle."}, {"time": 7147, "text": "You can do interactive contracts."}, {"time": 7150, "text": "It's just, it has to be done a little differently than the way that you would do it in an account style model."}, {"time": 7154, "text": "Just like you could run an application in Java, you can run an application in Haskell."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "They both can do the same thing, but the code is gonna look different."}, {"time": 7161, "text": "And the canonical way of looking at things is different."}, {"time": 7165, "text": "So in terms of Oracle, Oracle networks, what are your thoughts about chain link and external off chain data sources?"}, {"time": 7172, "text": "And everything we've been talking about now with the external, with the extended UTXO model."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "Yeah, I mean, trying to do smart contracts without Oracle is like trying to have sex with your pants on."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "I mean, it's not really fun."}, {"time": 7185, "text": "It's not exactly the best of things."}, {"time": 7187, "text":

{"time": 7195, "text": "This makes so much sense now."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "Okay, so anyway, you need the outside world to be injected into your system, right?"}, {"time": 7203, "text": "I'm trying to keep a straight face."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "You need the outside world to make your system useful."}, {"time": 7209, "text": "It's like all the kinds of things that you care to do with a smart contract usually involve human beings and information streams aggregating and doing something."}, {"time": 7217, "text": "So the Oracle is a super important component in practice for any smart contract involving any notion of value."}, {"time": 7224, "text": "You need to know when things have happened, how they happen, who won, who lost, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 7228, "text": "So first, where do you get the data from?"}, {"time": 7231, "text": "So what's the aggregator?"}, {"time": 7232, "text": "This is why we love our relationship with Wolfram because one of the things you'll know about Wolfram as you get to know the guy is he's a data pack rat."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "Every email, every communication, every interaction, he's archived somewhere."}, {"time": 7243, "text": "Like last time I talked to him, oh, yeah, I have emails from you from 2012."}, {"time": 7246, "text": "It's like, you still have those?"}, {"time": 7248, "text": "Yeah, every keystroke is written down and stored somewhere."}, {"time": 7251, "text": "So if you use Wolfram Alpha, it's a simulacrum of the way his mind thinks."}, {"time": 7255, "text": "And so you can query the system and be like, oh, how many shipwrecks have happened in Florida between 1950 and 2000 that have resulted more than a billion dollars of cargo loss and at least one fatality?"}, {"time": 7266, "text": "And it'll return an answer."}, {"time": 7268, "text": "I mean, it's an incredible source of data that's computable."}, {"time": 7271, "text": "For people who don't know, Wolfram Alpha is more than just the thing that assists you with your math homework in high school."}, {"time": 7278, "text": "It's actually this giant network of data of like weather data, of location data, just statistic, all kinds of, it's doing the aggregation in a way that you can query across data sets."}, {"time": 7290, "text": "And it's exactly this kind of idea."}, {"time": 7294, "text": "It basically represents the very kind of thing you would hope to be able to query off chain as part of the smart contracts."}, {"time": 7301, "text": "Right, but the only downside is it's centralized."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "And that's always the Achilles heel of Wolfram is he tends to like proprietary things and he tends to like centralizing things and mostly because he likes running the things."}, {"time": 7313, "text": "And everybody can have an opinion on that."}, {"time": 7316, "text": "The thing though is that after you've done aggregation, there's a question of injection."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "How do you get that data into the system?"}, {"time": 7324, "text": "And you can do that in a very naive way where you can say, oh, I'm just gonna attach a public key to it and it'll sign for that data feed, that injection."}, {"time": 7330, "text": "And then somehow I'll just trust it as it is."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "Or you could try to make it more complicated."}, {"time": 7336, "text": "You could wait data feeds from different sources and have some notion of truthiness or a veracity metric or something like that."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "So Chainlink is just one of many different philosophies that was born out of the academy."}, {"time": 7349, "text": "I believe Ari Jewell was connected to it and there's some good people on that side."}, {"time": 7353, "text": "And it has a philosophy about how do you aggregate, a philosophy about how do you inject and how do you create incentives so that that process over time gets more federated or more decentralized instead of centralizing around one particular setup."}, {"time": 7367, "text": "Now, closely related corollary to this is computation off chain."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "So as I mentioned, smart contracts are intimately connected to our Oracle."}, {"time": 7376, "text": "The question is how much pre processing and state management are you gonna do outside of the system versus what do you do inside of the system?"}, {"time": 7383, "text": "So it's a very interesting balance between these two."}, {"time": 7387, "text": "And they were thinking about this stuff for a long time."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "There's a great paper called Town Crier, came out way back in the day at Cornell."}, {"time": 7393, "text": "And that was all about using like SGX to scrape things and you can rely on trusted hardware to give you good data."}, {"time": 7400, "text": "But you could also use those SGX cores to do contract processing, because if it runs in trusted hardware, then it's very unlikely to be tampered with or manipulated."}, {"time": 7408, "text": "And because of that, you don't have to federate it or decentralize it, you can run it on a single device as if it was running on a cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "So there seems to be a desire in that community to capture more and more of the smart contract stack and pull more and more of that stack into that layer two infrastructure from running on layer one."}, {"time": 7427, "text": "Because you have cost reduction and potentially because your trust model collapses to whatever Chainlink is offering, you're not gaining anything by doing the computation on Ethereum or another platform."}, {"time": 7440, "text": "Because you ever watched The Simpsons?"}, {"time": 7442, "text": "There was this beautiful episode where Mr. Burns wants to turn the power off in Springfield."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "It is the perfect analogy for information security."}, {"time": 7449, "text": "So he and Smithers, they go through this elaborate series of doors and secret passages and guard dogs and robots and shit to get to the center of the power plant to turn off the power."}, {"time": 7460, "text": "And when they arrive at the center of the plant, there's like this stray dog that's inside the room."}, {"time": 7465, "text": "And there's this wicker screen door that leads to the outside."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "And you're like, well, why the hell did you go through this elaborate series of doors and things if there's like a backdoor into your system?"}, {"time": 7474, "text": "Well, that's basically a real life analogy of the relationship between the Oracle and the smart contract."}, {"time": 7480, "text": "You're only as good in your infrastructure model as your weakest link."}, {"time": 7483, "text": "And it doesn't matter if all of your computation is decentralized, if you're at the mercy of your data feed."}, {"time": 7488, "text": "Because I can just manipulate that and break the entire security model of the system, okay?"}, {"time": 7492, "text": "You'll perfectly execute the wrong answer."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "So they say, well, if you're trusting us anyway, why don't you pull more of what you're doing on chain into our stack, which creates more transaction fees for them and more value for them."}, {"time": 7504, "text": "But there are many different ways you can do oracles."}, {"time": 7506, "text": "And earlier I was talking about the biology of these things, the cell differentiation."}, {"time": 7511, "text": "The minute that you admit heterogeneity in your system and you start having cells like stake pools or things that are on 24 seven, then you can start asking the what if question."}, {"time": 7522, "text": "Why don't you guys just also provide data feeds?"}, {"time": 7526, "text": "Why don't you guys also provide state channels or payment channels or generate random numbers from here or whatever?"}, {"time": 7531, "text": "And you're now a service provider."}, {"time": 7532, "text": "You're making the blockchain full time, but part time you're doing this."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "And if you're making bagels, you could probably make donuts, that type of a concept."}, {"time": 7539, "text": "So I think that type of competition is going to be very difficult for a lot of these layer two protocols that aren't tightly coupled with the protocol because the ones that are tightly coupled with the protocol, they have a built in trust advantage."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "They've already built a commercial reputation."}, {"time": 7556, "text": "There's already an increasingly more decentralized set."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "The other thing is you don't need a token."}, {"time": 7561, "text": "You can just use ADA."}, {"time": 7562, "text": "You don't need an oracle coin for these types of things to work."}, {"time": 7565, "text": "And by the way, that's just for the injection component and the veracity attestation."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "So is it true or not?"}, {"time": 7572, "text": "That's not about the aggregation."}, {"time": 7573, "text": "That's still a tremendously time intensive, expensive proposition."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "There's only a few people in the world that have what Steve has with Wolfram."}, {"time": 7581, "text": "And those guys by just cutting off those supply to replicate what they have is something that would cost hundreds of millions or billions of dollars."}, {"time": 7589, "text": "And so it's an interesting question of how do you incentivize decentralized aggregation of information?"}, {"time": 7593, "text": "And that's kind of what town crier and other protocols we're trying to achieve."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "So maybe you can say how town crier works because it's like, what's your vision?"}, {"time": 7601, "text": "You're now partnering with Wolfram and Wolfram Alpha in sort of exploring this partnership of data and the blockchain."}, {"time": 7611, "text": "What's your vision for a possible distributed version of Wolfram Alpha?"}, {"time": 7616, "text": "Well, the first step is just say, can we use this as a feed?"}, {"time": 7619, "text": "And they can be what Bloomberg is to the financial markets."}, {"time": 7622, "text": "So you have a terminal and you have something and there's always a value of at least offering choice."}, {"time": 7626, "text": "And so it's not like we're anti chain link or picking winners and losers."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "It's an open protocol, it's an open system."}, {"time": 7631, "text": "So if we're successful, chain link will migrate or it will at least support us because they like money."}, {"time": 7637, "text": "They like users, they like liquidity."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "It's a disservice to their community not to support a potential customer set, but you're gonna have a spectrum from the desire to do a completely decentralized aggregation, curation, injection and veracity attestation to a completely centralized vertically integrated set."}, {"time": 7656, "text": "You need to be able to have that whole spectrum and offer that to the smart contract developer to decide what makes sense."}, {"time": 7662, "text": "By the way, a lot of cases, they're gonna be their own Oracle."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "So for example, the World of Warcraft example that I gave, well, it's a completely centralized thing."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "It's a video game run by a single company."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "There's no sense in saying that we're somehow going to decentralize that."}, {"time": 7677, "text": "What they're just trying to do is extend their currency or NFTs or whatever into new marketplaces."}, {"time": 7682, "text": "So the minting of that is controlled by a single entity and the world state of that, you just have to trust Blizzard to inject that into the system."}, {"time": 7692, "text": "You could try to imagine some sort of like, Sentinel group of people within the game who keep Blizzard honest, but it's completely unnecessary because they can change the rules of the system arbitrarily."}, {"time": 7702, "text": "So in that case, you're optimizing around efficiency and cost reduction."}, {"time": 7707, "text": "So you'd want a single feed that gets injected into the system from them."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "If you look at a stable coin that's algorithmic and it's basing its value on the aggregation of many different exchanges, that's the polar opposite example."}, {"time": 7721, "text":

7729, "text": "You'd have to look at Binance and Bittrex and all these other things, or maybe there's conventional Forex exchanges or something like that."}, {"time": 7734, "text": "Okay, well, how do you weight that?"}, {"time": 7737, "text": "And how do you clip outliers and these types of things?"}, {"time": 7739, "text": "That's a completely different conversation."}, {"time": 7741, "text": "There's a lot more mechanics you have to put in for that bundling and attestation of the veracity of the data feed."}, {"time": 7748, "text": "And what happens if you get it wrong?"}, {"time": 7749, "text": "Your stable coin gets mispriced and everything goes to hell."}, {"time": 7753, "text": "And the markets will eventually correct it for arbitrage seeking behavior, but anything that was built on that will fail in the short term."}, {"time": 7761, "text": "So Oracle is really just a game of, you have to build a standardized interfaces and make it as easy as possible for people to do that."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "And then let people choose how they wanna inject data and what level of assurance do they need behind that?"}, {"time": 7774, "text": "And the question is, how much do you leave to the user versus how much does the protocol take care of for you?"}, {"time": 7778, "text": "And it's a difficult design question."}, {"time": 7780, "text": "For our part, we love working with Steve and Wolfram and they're a great company and they really have some bright people there."}, {"time": 7787, "text": "And we know on the data set, they're second to none because not only do they have it, it's computable."}, {"time": 7791, "text": "You can do all kinds of things and manipulate with a very rich query language."}, {"time": 7796, "text": "And we wanna make sure that that's accessible to developers and Cardano."}, {"time": 7800, "text": "Remember, they're like Bloomberg."}, {"time": 7801, "text": "It's a centralized speed in that respect."}, {"time": 7804, "text": "So if you wanna build a Chainlink S competitor, there's other protocols you could do for that."}, {"time": 7809, "text": "Now you asked about Tom Cryer and that was an attempt to kind of sweep the oceans with the net, get the data through a decentralized way."}, {"time": 7819, "text": "And that was just saying, hey, let's use trusted hardware to go read all kinds of websites and other things."}, {"time": 7824, "text": "And because it's trusted hardware, the scraping is nonbiased."}, {"time": 7828, "text": "If you find something inconvenient to whatever the person who's scraping is, trusted hardware will still do it and it can't be changed."}, {"time": 7835, "text": "You'd have to manipulate SGX to do that."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "So that's great, but you still run into the problem of how do you wire that together?"}, {"time": 7842, "text": "The underlying websites still don't have any notion of veracity or reputation behind them."}, {"time": 7847, "text": "And then you also have the issue of storage."}, {"time": 7849, "text": "Where the hell do you put all of it?"}, {"time": 7851, "text": "If you have exabytes of data, what's the incentive for that?"}, {"time": 7854, "text": "That's the dream of the Semantic Web."}, {"time": 7856, "text": "I still think is a fascinating idea how to basically convert the internet into a core, like a knowledge base that you can query, you can integrate in the same way you did with Wolfram Alpha, but much bigger."}, {"time": 7871, "text": "But that means basically revolutionizing the way we put the internet together, which I think these ideas of off chain data will motivate people, because there's a lot of money to be made."}, {"time": 7887, "text": "Finally, there's money to be made with the Semantic Web."}, {"time": 7890, "text": "So that'll be an interesting kind of future."}, {"time": 7892, "text": "I do want to ask you about video games really quick as a small tangent, because you said this really interesting idea of Blizzard being centralized control."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "Is it possible to have items in the game that are not controlled by Blizzard?"}, {"time": 7909, "text": "Being controlled in a decentralized fashion that you can, like what is it, the grandfather sword in Diablo?"}, {"time": 7916, "text": "Hmm, what was it really?"}, {"time": 7918, "text": "Somebody was criticizing me."},

those items are owned by Blizzard."}, {"time": 7940, "text": "Is it possible to create video games where items are owned by the people outside of Blizzard, and do you think in like a half century from now we will all live in those games, and we'll forget the physical space even exists?"}, {"time": 7955, "text": "Well, yeah, that's definitely possible."}, {"time": 7957, "text": "I look at CryptoKitties, that's a great example of that."}, {"time": 7959, "text": "Can you explain what CryptoKitties is?"}, {"time": 7961, "text": "Well, it's basically just a video game that kind of lives on a blockchain, and the creatures within the game can breed with each other and create new CryptoKitties, and you can own them."}, {"time": 7970, "text": "So it's like some sort of dystopian Tamagotchi with lots of money behind it."}, {"time": 7974, "text": "But anyway, the thing is those assets actually have a blockchain based representation."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "And so whether the

intellectual property."}, {"time": 7996, "text": "So yeah, it's completely possible to break your architecture up where you have a notion of the player part, and then you have a notion of the experience part, and you can interchange experiences, almost like you do cascading style sheets or something for different presentations, and the ownership of the underlying layers, the players."}, {"time": 8016, "text": "So yeah, that's definitely doable."}, {"time": 8018, "text": "And frankly, that's what's gonna happen in the gaming world, because there's so much value in that."}, {"time": 8022, "text": "I mean, everybody wants play, and right now the model is you make a game, you sell licenses, and you have a huge surge of people at the beginning of the game buying the video game, and

won't be playing the game within 12 months."}, {"time": 8042, "text": "But if you can create an interactive game where there's an actual economy inside the game, then you have EVE Online, or Second Life, or any of these things, where you have people playing for 10 years, and there's like people buying virtual real estate and all these other things."}, {"time": 8053, "text": "You as the game developer actually don't have to create a lot of content."}, {"time": 8057, "text": "So your long tail gets a lot fatter, and it generates a lot more revenue, and your cost of operating the system is

step, you do some more things."}, {"time": 8471, "text": "You bring more users in, and then eventually, you get to a threshold where you say, okay, everything works the way intended, and you push a button, and we initiate what's called a hard fork combinator event, and boom, the system has smart contracts."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "You just wake up, and it's there."}, {"time": 8484, "text": "It's like it's in your house."}, {"time": 8485, "text": "So it's gonna be a hard fork."}, {"time": 8486, "text": "It's like when I got my blue check mark on Twitter, I woke up, and I had it."},

fork of Charles."}, {"time": 8496, "text": "You got blue mark."}, {"time": 8497, "text": "Well, actually, I think you can take it away, but."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "Can they take my check mark away, Flex?"}, {"time": 8502, "text": "Oh, but that'd be like a hard fork backwards, I guess."}, {"time": 8507, "text": "Okay, so great."}, {"time": 8508, "text": "So that's, but currently, there's a testing procedure going on to see what does that look like, and what will give you confidence that things are working well."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "Yeah, so first, you start with the marry era, which is where we're right now multi assets."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "So you can do metadata and issue tokens on Cardano, but you'd have limited programmability on chain."}, {"time": 8531, "text": "Alonzo adds the programmability in, but we already have most of the foundations of the extended UTXO model, and the smart contract model is just, those things aren't ready."}, {"time": 8539, "text": "So the first step is, say, fork it, so all those rules are now there, okay?"}, {"time": 8543, "text": "That's what we did with Alonzo Blue."}, {"time": 8545, "text": "We forked a testnet base layer, and it successfully survived going from marry to Alonzo, which means that you can move transactions from one side to the other."}, {"time": 8554, "text": "Both systems work."}, {"time": 8555, "text": "And then the next step is, say, okay, well, are the stake pool operators, people who run the infrastructure, able to run this testnet just like they run Cardano?"}, {"time": 8562, "text": "And that's what we're doing right now with Blue."}, {"time": 8564, "text": "We're bringing all these SPOs in, and then are we able to submit and run smart contracts on the system?"}, {"time": 8569, "text": "And they actually return a round trip."}, {"time": 8571, "text": "You send something, you get something back."}, {"time": 8573, "text": "Yay, okay."}, {"time": 8575, "text": "And then what you do is each step, so the next is white, you go from like 50 people to several hundred, and then purple's an open testnet where we want every single person in the entire ecosystem to use it, and it's also a DevNet."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "So that means that people who are writing with Pluse Playground and local interpreters, their smart contracts can actually start testing them now on the public infrastructure."}, {"time": 8597, "text": "So it's kind of like releasing dev kits to the Xbox or something like that."}, {"time": 8601, "text": "You send them out to game developers before you release the Xbox, so they can test their video games in anticipation of the release of the system."}, {"time": 8607, "text": "So you run that for at least a month, and as long as it doesn't blow up in your face, and oh God, what have we done, Hindenburg, oh the humanity, you release it and you ship it."}, {"time": 8617, "text": "The problem is it's no longer in our control."}, {"time": 8619, "text": "There's over 100 exchanges that have listed Cardano."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "There's lots of wallet infrastructure."}, {"time": 8623, "text": "There are thousands of different constituencies."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "So it's less of a technological problem now, and it's more of a coordination problem."}, {"time": 8631, "text": "So you have to evolve in a very methodical way, and each step of the way you bring new actors in, they get ready for it."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "They upgrade their infrastructure to it, and then like shells, eventually, you get to the outer shell, which is the hard fork for the general public."}, {"time": 8645, "text": "And if we've done it right, like that blue check mark, they wake up and it's exactly the same."}, {"time": 8651, "text": "They just get a little update thing, update your client."}, {"time": 8654, "text": "And they start demanding Wagyu beef."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "Is there stuff you're worried about in terms of like when something's this tricky, you know, goes up several orders of magnitudes in terms of scale?"}, {"time": 8665, "text": "Are there problems that you foresee?"}, {"time": 8667, "text": "Is there, like we said, there's game theoretic aspects, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 8672, "text": "Like what worries you the most?"}, {"time": 8673, "text": "I mean, I sleep like a baby."}, {"time": 8675, "text": "I wake up every two hours crying."}, {"time": 8686, "text": "And what makes no sense, I slept like a baby."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "But go ahead."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "Yeah, yeah, exactly, right."}, {"time": 8691, "text": "Messing your whole world up right now, Alex."}, {"time": 8695, "text": "No, I mean, there's so much that keeps me up at night."}, {"time": 8696, "text": "You know, it's like you're in a cold sweat everyday when you have an ecosystem like this, cause you, you, the other thing is you're judged as much by the applications people build on the platform as you are by the platform you've constructed."}, {"time": 8708, "text": "So, you know, one of the most unfair things that happened in our industry was blaming Vitalik for the DAO hack."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "He didn't write the code, he wasn't responsible for it."}, {"time": 8716, "text": "It was a completely independent, different team."}, {"time": 8718, "text": "And because it blew up, a lot of people just developed this idea, Ethereum is not secure, the EBM is fundamentally broken."}, {"time": 8724, "text": "And it's true, there are some issues there, but come on, that's like saying, oh, well, Photoshop didn't work, fuck Bill Gates."}, {"time": 8732, "text": "And that's the issue is you get, as a platform developer, coupled with the wins and losses of your application developer."}, {"time": 8741, "text": "So if they go do amazing things, it's like, oh yeah, Windows is great, we love it."}, {"time": 8745, "text": "And if they go do terrible things, they're like, oh man, I guess he's trying to kill all of us."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "So what we're kept up a night about is not just what we've constructed, but also how do we curate an ecosystem and foster the development of an ecosystem where you have assurance baked into the application, and that's somehow expressible to the user."}, {"time": 8764, "text": "So when you download your smart contract or you click your one click install, you use your unit swap clone or whatever the hell it is that's deployed on Cardano, you have a little green check mark or something that indicates to you that somebody audited the code or followed a specification."}, {"time": 8778, "text": "The lack of that is problematic because then first there's impersonations, the whole MyEtherWallet thing, like your videos or my videos are the same."}, {"time": 8786, "text": "Every comment, there's a bot that says, hey, give me some money or something like that."}, {"time": 8790, "text": "That kind of stuff happens."}, {"time": 8791, "text": "But then just protocol level flaws, like what happened with the DAO hack, that's what really keeps me up at night."}, {"time": 8797, "text": "How do you resolve that problem?"}, {"time": 8798, "text": "Because I don't hire these people."}, {"time": 8800, "text": "I don't tell them what to do."}, {"time": 8801, "text": "I didn't tell them how to build things on the platform."}, {"time": 8804, "text": "They may have tons of experience and knowledge."}, {"time": 8806, "text": "They could be Simon Payton Jones or they could have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever and they read one tutorial and they've written three lines of code their entire life and they've deployed something horribly broken, copy paste, and suddenly it all goes to hell."},

ecosystem, trying to figure out standards."}, {"time": 8826, "text": "Like at University of Wyoming, we're setting up the Smart Contract Engineering Institute."}, {"time": 8830, "text": "We're negotiating with them right now."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "And the goal there is just to create some standards for how to certify smart contracts so that you can get that green check mark and know that it actually has some assurance level behind it."}, {"time": 8842, "text": "But God, that's a huge coordination problem and it's a huge information presentation problem and incentives problem and so forth."}, {"time": 8849, "text": "And unfortunately, people who value being first to market will kind of piss in the pool for everybody else."}, {"time": 8855, "text": "In terms of, maybe you can comment on the topic of decentralized exchanges."}, {"time": 8860, "text": "What kind of decentralized exchanges, DEXs, what are they, first of all, and what kind would you like to see built around Cardano?"}, {"time": 8868, "text": "Yeah, so people want to create exchanges that don't have custodial risk."}, {"time": 8872, "text": "The point of exchange is to build you a marketplace where bids and asks can find each other, people can meet and trade."}, {"time": 8880, "text": "You can find a price and you can get liquidity."}, {"time": 8882, "text": "So you got gold, you wanna turn your gold into dollars."}, {"time": 8885, "text": "Okay, well, somebody has to create a marketplace for that."}, {"time": 8888, "text": "So like Coinbase is an example of a marketplace."}, {"time": 8889, "text": "But it's centralized."}, {"time": 8891, "text": "But the problem is you have custodial risk."}, {"time": 8893, "text": "So when you put your gold and your dollars or your digital representations of these things into the exchange, what if Wally, Eve broke up with him and now he's really sad and he's gone to the dark side and he's become Wally the hacker."}, {"time": 8907, "text": "Okay, so he can go and sneak his way in and hack into Coinbase and steal all your gold and your tokens."}, {"time": 8912, "text": "So instead of you actually being able to swap these things, you've lost all your money."}, {"time": 8916, "text": "And there's other problems too."}, {"time": 8917, "text": "Like let's say Daisy has now come in and become a regulator and said, oh, I don't like these exchanges anymore."}, {"time": 8924, "text": "I'm just gonna shut them all down."}, {"time": 8926, "text": "Yeah, and then you have no access to it."}, {"time": 8927, "text": "So you have sovereign risk, you have the risk of threat, you have regulatory risk, you have the issue of banks maybe cutting you out."}, {"time": 8934, "text": "So it's been in our industry for more than 10 years."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "Mt."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "Gox was the most famous example of that."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "They collapsed, I believe in 2013 and hundreds of millions of dollars was lost over the course of a while."}, {"time": 8946, "text": "So the point of a DEX is saying, can we do what a marketplace does, but not have Coinbase, not have a central actor run this thing?"}, {"time": 8955, "text": "And there's a lot of problems with that because exchanges are generally creatures of latency."}, {"time": 8961, "text": "You know, high frequency trading, for example, the things that nanosecond, they co locate their infrastructure with the exchange software just so they can front run orders over other people."}, {"time": 8971, "text": "I mean, it's crazy the amount of technology that they put in."}, {"time": 8974, "text": "So the traditional Wall Street version of an exchange is very centralized, very fast, very optimized and kind of behaves by a very closed set of rules."}, {"time": 8984, "text": "When you look at a DEX, you have to accept that you're gonna have to have slightly different rules because you're operating in a global systems latency and you're operating in a system that has different behaviors."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "However, that said, there's a lot of great protocols that have been built for it."}, {"time": 8998, "text": "You know, Uniswap has kind of evolved a lot over the years and we've seen a huge competition and a lot of evolution to basically build out protocols that kind of excuse some of these security problems, enjoy high liquidity and then also have this beautiful concept of openness."}, {"time": 9015, "text": "One of the gatekeepers to crypto when you're a cryptocurrency developer are the exchanges."}, {"time": 9019, "text": "I remember when we first created Cardano, you know, the Bitfinex guys reached out to the Cardano Foundation."}, {"time": 9024, "text": "They said, oh, we'd be happy to list ADA."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "And they said, yeah, we want $5 million to do it."}, {"time": 9030, "text": "You know, so there was kind of some Italian for go fuck yourself in those email conversations."}, {"time": 9036, "text": "Fuck, hula is what I said."}, {"time": 9039, "text": "But anyway, that kind of back and forth happens all the time."}, {"time": 9042, "text": "And because these guys are gatekeepers, they have this nepotistic control information asymmetries and so forth."}, {"time": 9048, "text": "So having a DEX, you don't have that problem."}, {"time": 9050, "text": "You have open listing and you basically just put the asset into it."}, {"time": 9054, "text": "And if anybody wants to trade it, they will."}, {"time": 9056, "text": "And if it seems like it's a good idea, a natural market will form, market making will occur and you get liquidity with it."}, {"time": 9061, "text": "So there's no barrier to entry for that type of system."}, {"time": 9065, "text": "The biggest existential problem for DEXs right now is the concept of regulation."}, {"time": 9070, "text": "So basically right now, when you use Binance or Coinbase or these other guys, you have to go through KYC and AML, know your customer and anti money laundering."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "So basically who are you and you know, is your money real or not, or are you a drug dealer or something?"}, {"time": 9084, "text": "So normally you do that by saying, okay, I'm gonna give them my copy of my passport and maybe they're gonna request some tax records or whatever the best practices are for the particular jurisdiction."}, {"time": 9094, "text": "And then that exchange is liable if that's fucked up."}, {"time": 9097, "text": "So if the government comes in and says, hey guys, you know, pull your compliance records and they find discrepancies, they'll actually put the exchange out of business or fine them very heavily."}, {"time": 9108, "text": "JP Morgan Chase got $19 billion in fines over the last 20 years for various compliance issues amongst other things."}, {"time": 9116, "text": "So it's expensive, very difficult thing."}, {"time": 9119, "text": "And at DEX, it's open system."}, {"time": 9121, "text": "You just have value coming in, not identity."}, {"time": 9123, "text": "And so all these things are trading amongst anonymous accounts."}, {"time": 9126, "text": "And so there's no notion of compliance right now for that."}, {"time": 9129, "text": "So a lot of regulators are coming in and saying, oh, well, this is just a cesspool for terrorism and drug dealing and bad stuff."}, {"time": 9135, "text": "And they're word salad of bullshit."}, {"time": 9138, "text": "But you know, it is what it is."}, {"time": 9139, "text": "You have to deal with these guys."}, {"time": 9140, "text": "And so there's been a lot of discussions of, can we take DEXs and keep the openness and keep the liquidity and no counterpart or custodial risk?"}, {"time": 9149, "text": "And can we add some notion of compliance to that in a decentralized way that doesn't require a single actor to be a gatekeeper?"}, {"time": 9157, "text": "So I think actually by combining DIDs, decentralized identifiers, that's the way to do it."}, {"time": 9161, "text": "But it's actually the next generation of the technology is the regulated DEX and who regulates that, how

some way, and then do it in a different system where it's fast and cheap."}, {"time": 10507, "text": "And what I'm doing with that is I'm losing some of the security guarantees of the base layer and admitting a slight higher degree of centralization, but then I get super fast settlement, I get super low cost transactions, and potentially I may even be able to get distributed computing."}, {"time": 10526, "text": "Meaning that instead of having the smart contracts run in a replicated system, they could run on a single node, like a stake pool, and their stuff is different from the other guy's stuff."}, {"time": 10535, "text": "So you go from a system of capacity of whatever it is to a system of N for the totality of all the stake pools."}, {"time": 10544, "text": "So basically Hydra is just the next generation of that."}, {"time": 10548, "text": "When you have the ability to tinker with the accounting model and the layer two solution is co designed with the layer one solution."}, {"time": 10555, "text": "So it's like what Lightning would have been had Lightning been co developed when Bitcoin came out."}, {"time": 10560, "text": "There would have been special provisions made in Bitcoin, specifically to accommodate Lightning, and it would have made it very easy for you then to move inside the system, outside of the system, and have security properties preserved, like availability, for example, or fraud resistance, say, oh, you can't steal the money or these types of things."}, {"time": 10578, "text": "Where things get really complex, and this is why Hydra's novel over Lightning, is when you wanna move beyond payments to state management."}, {"time": 10585, "text": "Okay, so payments are just, I wanna move between Alice to Bob as quickly as possible, as low cost as possible."}, {"time": 10591, "text": "So for example, I have a micro tipping application, like change tip on Twitter, or like a video, I'm watching YouTube video, like maybe this video in the future, and people really like it, and they click tip, and you get five cents or something like that."}, {"time": 10603, "text": "Okay, so that's an example of a perfect payment application, and that's great, but what happens when you actually have a rich smart contract, like a DEX, or you wanna do a video game, or something like that, you wanna run that off chain, but then there's some reconciliation on chain that happens."}, {"time": 10619, "text": "So a state channel basically lets you do that, but it's a lot more complicated, and there's a lot more to think about."}, {"time": 10625, "text": "So Hydra basically just has in its design, a collection of ideas of how to do that."}, {"time": 10631, "text": "And the current paper is for a single head."}, {"time": 10635, "text": "The next thing you do is composition."}, {"time": 10637, "text": "So you go multiple heads, and there's a routing protocol between them."}, {"time": 10640, "text": "And then eventually create these tail protocols for when things get asynchronous."}, {"time": 10644, "text": "So instead of always being aligned, and always being available, what happens if they die for a bit, and then they come back?"}, {"time": 10650, "text": "And you can create all kinds of guarantees that your funds won't be lost, or locked forever, or things like that."}, {"time": 10655, "text": "There's a failure recovery mode for this type of stuff."}, {"time": 10657, "text": "And basically the idea is leverage what Lightning has already achieved with Bitcoin, but then take advantage of the fact that you have a more expressive accounting model, and a more expressive programming model, so you can just physically do more, and you can put more crypto into that thing."}, {"time": 10672, "text": "Now contrast it with rollups, really that is just saying, you're gonna take some thing, batch a bunch of transactions together, and you're gonna generate a proof."}, {"time": 10680, "text": "And then what you can do is whenever you see some part of that history, you can check it against that proof that's rolled up."}, {"time": 10685, "text": "And they're closely related concept of recursive snarks that you'll see a lot."}, {"time": 10689, "text": "Things like the MENA protocol, or other things."}, {"time": 10691, "text": "And basically the idea is that whenever you see something, you can always generate two proofs."}, {"time": 10696, "text": "An existential proofs that the coins exist, and a non existence of a double spend."}, {"time": 10701, "text": "So you can always check those two properties."}, {"time": 10703, "text": "And the proof is verifiable in logarithmic time, ideally."}, {"time": 10707, "text": "So you can have giant amounts of data, but it's very small."}, {"time": 10710, "text": "The actual proof is concise, okay?"}, {"time": 10713, "text": "So they're just different boats for different floats."}, {"time": 10715, "text": "The advantage of a layer two network where there's actual channels, and there's interaction, and there's service providers, is the channels can eventually scale in the collection of things that they can do."}, {"time": 10726, "text": "And eventually they can become interoperability networks between cryptocurrencies."}, {"time": 10731, "text": "So at some point, we could modify the bolt spec, and make it somewhat interoperable with Hydra."}, {"time": 10736, "text": "And then what you could happen is you could use it as a bridge to actually do cross chain traffic, and send transactions between the systems."}, {"time": 10742, "text": "You don't really think about that too much when you're talking about roll ups."}, {"time": 10744, "text": "That's more of optimizing what you have within the system."}, {"time": 10747, "text": "Within the chain, so can you elaborate how it's possible to do cross chain traffic?"}, {"time": 10752, "text": "Well, you already have the intermediary, you have the channel operator, and you already have lightning protocol, right?"}, {"time": 10758, "text": "And you just build a dex that runs within that system, and they can swap assets, or you can do wrapped assets."}, {"time": 10764, "text": "So you lock it."}, {"time": 10764, "text": "So it would be like low cost?"}, {"time": 10766, "text": "I guess you could just switch low."}, {"time": 10768, "text": "Yeah, the same thing lets you batch things on one, will let you batch the other."}, {"time": 10771, "text": "So if lightning works on Bitcoin, and Hydra works on Cardano, you can eventually bridge these two together, and create a way of moving back and forth."}, {"time": 10777, "text": "And the same things that make transactions in and out of that network cheap, will make creating wrapped assets cheap."}, {"time": 10783, "text": "At least on the Bitcoin to Cardano side, you can't create assets on Bitcoin."}, {"time": 10787, "text": "Another flaw of Bitcoin that they've never fixed."}, {"time": 10789, "text": "What's your thought about layer two technologies in general?"}, {"time": 10792, "text": "Is there stuff you're excited about?"}, {"time": 10793, "text": "We talked quite a bit about Lightning Network, Hydra, and these ideas."}, {"time": 10797, "text": "Do you think there'll be somebody that wins out, or is this gonna be this kind of dynamic thing that we just keep building different ideas, and they all interact with each other?"}, {"time": 10805, "text": "It goes back to biology, that cell differentiation concept, is you have to build specialized tissue to do these things."}, {"time": 10811, "text": "The point of layer two is to extend the network."}, {"time": 10813, "text": "It's adding a foot, it's adding an arm, it's adding a brain, it's adding a heart, it's adding eyes, giving you additional senses, you have ears now."}, {"time": 10820, "text": "So when you add these layer two protocols, like Atala Prism is a perfect example of that."}, {"time": 10824, "text": "We don't have identity at the base layer of Cardano."}, {"time": 10827, "text": "It's a real bad deal to do that, because then China will come in, or US will come in and tell you how to do that."}, {"time": 10832, "text": "What you do is you build a layer two protocol that's blockchain agnostic, and then the user can decide when and where they need an identity, and then bring that identity into the system."}, {"time": 10841, "text": "And if you designed it right, when they bring it in, it's very easy, very fluid, and suddenly the experience enhances."}, {"time": 10847, "text": "Everything just gets better."}, {"time": 10849, "text": "Oh, wow, okay, now I can use all these regulated things."}, {"time": 10851, "text": "They go from gray to green in the App Store."}, {"time": 10855, "text": "Or, oh, wow, now I can send to human readable addresses, because if I have an identity and you have an identity, we can alias them with some namespace, and now I sent a Lex instead of some horrible back 32 address structure."}, {"time": 10868, "text": "Okay, so that's really what you need to do with layer two is say, okay, each layer two protocol is meant to do something."}, {"time": 10874, "text": "Either it gives me payments, or lower cost smart contracts, or interoperability, or identity, and then it's a marketplace."}, {"time": 10881, "text": "So you should have blockchain agnosticism with your layer two solutions."}, {"time": 10885, "text": "And so you can mix and match and choose whichever collection of services you need."}, {"time": 10889, "text": "And that's actually how IT works these days with microservices and these other things, and cloud software, you know."}, {"time": 10895, "text": "Every firm is an aggregation of dozens of providers, and basically that composition of them is your software stack."}, {"time": 10903, "text": "Jumping around back to proof of work."}, {"time": 10905, "text": "What are non interactive proofs of proof of work?"}, {"time": 10913, "text": "NIPOPOWS, it's fun to say, right?"}, {"time": 10915, "text": "It's just one of those things that you notice that certain proofs of work, when you solve them, come up less frequently than other ones."}, {"time": 10922, "text": "And just by that nature, you can sample them and then construct proofs from them."}, {"time": 10927, "text": "So you can, with that just set, have a more concise representation of an amount of work for a range of the chain."}, {"time": 10934, "text": "So that works."}, {"time": 10935, "text": "Yeah, I was gonna say that word salad, basically the idea is, okay, so let's say that this block, and I'm just simplifying the concept a lot."}, {"time": 10942, "text": "This block, you get a regular green type of proof of work, and then this block, you get a green, and you keep going, and then suddenly you get a red one."}, {"time": 10951, "text": "So it's still a valid proof of work, but it's more rare than the other ones."}, {"time": 10955, "text": "So if you notice that particular pattern, what you can do is you can just start not caring so much about the green ones, and you can just bookend your chain with red."}, {"time": 10964, "text": "And then you can just repeat that, and repeat that, repeat that, and you can collect, and you can create this really compressed representation of these things."}, {"time": 10971, "text": "So what does it mean?"}, {"time": 10972, "text": "It means that suddenly when you have that, now you have a way of representing a long range of history with a very small proof."}, {"time": 10980, "text": "So you can use it for light wallets, and you also can use it for side chains, if both side chains use proof of work."}, {"time": 10987, "text": "So when you see a transaction come in, you don't have a copy of the side chain, but you have a copy of the proof of work, and it has the same algorithmic weight as the normal longest chain, because you don't have all the greens, but the reds only occur with a certain sampling frequency."}, {"time": 11001, "text": "So this is the brainchild of Dionysus Zintros and Agelos, and it's just an amazing paper, and what's so cool about it is it doesn't require any structural changes to proof of work."}, {"time": 11011, "text": "It's just something you notice as an off gas of proof of work."}, {"time": 11014, "text": "It's like you're watching an engine operate, and you notice like every 500 times a piston will do a certain weird thing, and so you take advantage of that."}, {"time": 11022, "text": "You say, well, if I count 10 of them, now I have 5,000 pistons, strikes, as I observed that pattern."}, {"time": 11028, "text": "And so it's the same concept there, and it's just a property of the engine."}, {"time": 11032, "text": "So you don't really need to hard fork it in."}, {"time": 11034, "text": "It's just there, and because you can build proofs that way, now you can use those proofs to do like clients, and you can use those proofs to do other things, because you can just use that as something that comes with the history."}, {"time": 11043, "text": "You don't have to have the whole blockchain."}, {"time": 11044, "text": "Now, is this a weird property of multiple proof of work chains?"}, {"time": 11048, "text": "It has to be key to the particular consensus algorithm, but usually there's some portability in this type of thing."}, {"time": 11055, "text": "Like we're right now exploring, can you do NIPA piles with Prism or any of these sharded proof of work protocols, but it looks like you can."}, {"time": 11061, "text": "The closely related is log space mining."}, {"time": 11063, "text": "So you can use this concept, and instead of having the entire blockchain to be able to mine, you can use a compressed representation of it."}, {"time": 11069, "text": "We wrote a paper called Log Space Mining that basically explains how to do that."}, {"time": 11073, "text": "So your miner only has this very small micro ledger as opposed to the entire ledger."}, {"time": 11080, "text": "How does it connect back to the entire ledger?"}, {"time": 11083, "text": "How does the compressed?"}, {"time": 11083, "text": "Because you have those red blocks."}, {"time": 11085, "text": "You have those special things, and so you know that the state you're working on is actually legitimate, right?"}, {"time": 11091, "text": "So the map goes both ways?"}, {"time": 11092, "text": "Yep, it's pretty cool."}, {"time": 11095, "text": "Wow, that's really interesting."}, {"time": 11096, "text": "Yeah, and Denis is a genius."}, {"time": 11098, "text": "He's a really, really smart kid, and he got his PhD under us."}, {"time": 11101, "text": "He went to University of Athens, and he was Agelos's graduate student, and now he's doing a postdoc at Stanford under David Shi, and this is literally the only thing he does."}, {"time": 11110, "text": "He does interoperability, sidechain stuff, NIPA piles and so forth, and he's written a lot of great papers on it."}, {"time": 11116, "text": "And that was a testimony to hard work for getting the paper published, because the paper came out in 2016, but I think it took three or four years for it to go through peer review."}, {"time": 11125, "text": "He kept trying to push it one conference after another rejection, after another rejection, but he got it through."}, {"time": 11130,

allowed to change the tax rate, but they can't change freedom of speech, that kind of a thing."}, {"time": 13483, "text": "So the first thing you have to do when you build these types of systems and they get to a certain scale is you have to build some mechanism for people who are interested in governance to self select and participate."}, {"time": 13494, "text": "Just create a collection bucket."}, {"time": 13496, "text": "In Bitcoin, we had Bitcoin talk and Bitcoin Reddit and these things."}, {"time": 13499, "text": "And eventually the GitHub repos and these things, there was a place to go if you were interested."}, {"time": 13504, "text": "And you need some sort of change management system where people who want to evolve the system can write it down in a very careful way."},

us, it's the SIP, the Cardano Improvement Proposal."}, {"time": 13518, "text": "But just a structured way of discussing how you wish to change."}, {"time": 13521, "text": "Then there's a question of,

doing foundational research in eVoting."}, {"time": 13547, "text": "We're building new voting systems, we're exploring preference voting and quadratic voting."}, {"time": 13551, "text": "And the long and the short is that we want more and more people to participate in voting for things."}, {"time": 13557, "text": "And you just have to start somewhere."}, {"time": 13559, "text": "So our hypothesis is we can bootstrap the system with the treasury system."}, {"time": 13565, "text": "So in Cardano, some of the inflation goes to the block producers, just like any other cryptocurrency, but some goes into a decentralized treasury, which now has over a billion dollars of ADA in it."}, {"time": 13577, "text": "So it's a lot of money."}, {"time": 13578, "text": "And that treasury is not under my control or the foundation's control, it's actually controlled by the community as a whole through a program called Catalyst."}, {"time": 13586, "text": "And so all these people can come together and

people participating."}, {"time": 13604, "text": "And the other is meaningful participation."}, {"time": 13606, "text": "So the depth of participation."}, {"time": 13608, "text": "Did you just show up and vote?"}, {"time": 13609, "text": "Or did you spend hours debating things on idea scale, the innovation management platform, interacting with the funding proposal, going back and forth."}, {"time": 13617, "text": "And there's dozens of little things like that."}, {"time": 13620, "text": "Now, my hypothesis is if you run this with enough iterations, eventually you get to a certain critical mass,

improvement proposals and so forth."}, {"time": 13638, "text": "And then what you can do is you can roll out new voting systems and new social structures, and you can let them start voting on training wheels like system parameters."}, {"time": 13646, "text": "Like for example, the minimum transaction fee or that K parameter for the amount of stake pools or these types of things."}, {"time": 13652, "text": "Then they build enough competency there and they move up a next level."}, {"time": 13655, "text": "And they actually start talking about hard forks using the update system, the hard fork combinator system."}, {"time": 13660, "text": "See, so that's how you."}, {"time": 13661, "text": "Voting on a hard fork."}, {"time": 13664, "text": "You can't do it unless your social dynamics are right and your voting system is right."}, {"time": 13667, "text": "And by the way, you also need to write a constitution around the same time because not all hard forks are created equally."},

system."}, {"time": 13682, "text": "So the constitution would be written, and maybe you can comment on what is the innovation management proposal system?"}, {"time": 13689, "text": "So we partnered with a company called Ideascale and they run a kind of a side platform."}, {"time": 13693, "text": "So people who are interested, that's kind of our version of a forum."}, {"time": 13696, "text": "They sign up and there's special tools in that platform for discussions that are productive."}, {"time": 13701, "text": "So they don't descend into kind of like trolly Reddit style conversations, but they're much more focused around how is your product building out."}, {"time": 13708, "text": "And by the way, we're gonna add more infrastructure over time."}, {"time": 13710, "text": "Our chief of staff, Tamara Hasson, she's working on setting up an incubator and accelerator."}, {"time": 13715, "text": "And we have lots of cool partners we've talked with in that space."}, {"time": 13718, "text": "And it's the same concept."}, {"time": 13719, "text": "Your idea comes in, what enters the system should not be what gets approved on the other side."}, {"time": 13724, "text": "It should go through some sort of gauntlet, some sort of crucible where you iterate your way through and there's all kinds of optimizations and upgrades and evolutions and combinations and destructions that occur."}, {"time": 13735, "text": "And then by the time you get to the other side, either the idea just dies on the vine because it was a bad idea, or it's a significantly stronger, far more fundable thing and potentially even gets attached with accountability."}, {"time": 13745, "text": "So you don't just fund the idea, you'd actually fund the auditor at the same time who actually holds the person accountable because the blockchain is not a real company."}, {"time": 13752, "text": "It's an ethereal thing."}, {"time": 13754, "text": "You need a counterparty to hold someone accountable who's real for that type of stuff and that type of funding."}, {"time": 13759, "text": "So that's what we're doing this year."}, {"time": 13761, "text": "So we have a whole team of people, partners like Governance Live and IdeaScale and papers we've written and about 30, 40,000 people regularly participating in this."}, {"time": 13770, "text": "So it's a huge social experiment and we're learning an enormous amount."}, {"time": 13774, "text": "And then our goal is by the end of the year to have a meaningful percentage of the entire Cardinal population inside of it, like 40, 50%."}, {"time": 13781, "text": "Then once you're at that threshold, now you have democratic majority of the entire system and you can have a real conversation about, okay, how do we write a constitution for this type of a system?"}, {"time": 13791, "text": "And sorry to interrupt, but so the constitution, people still argue about it because natural language, much like poetry, lends itself to multiple interpretations."}, {"time": 13800, "text": "Is it possible to formalize some of these ideas that reduce the ambiguity?"}, {"time": 13807, "text": "Everything's old is new again."}, {"time": 13809,

is why I'm so interested in things like Idris and Koch and Acta and theorem proving, because that's exactly what you're attempting to do is to express some concept or desire or construction in a language that's machine understandable and manipulatable."}, {"time": 13830, "text": "In particular, how does the system know its own design?"}, {"time": 13833, "text": "So what is the reference of a cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 13835, "text": "Usually it's a canonical code base, like here's Bitcoin core and the C++ code is that is the canonical code base."}, {"time": 13842, "text": "But actually that's not right."}, {"time": 13843, "text": "You should have specifications, blueprints that are implementation agnostic as your canonical code base."}, {"time": 13849, "text": "And can your system know those specifications, understand those specifications, and can your change management system be for that?"}, {"time": 13855, "text": "And then can you provide a proof that your client is by similar to that specification?"}, {"time": 13860, "text": "So yeah, that's 10 years in the future, but that's where you would go with that kind of a concept."}, {"time": 13865, "text": "But you're tending towards a formalism."}, {"time": 13868, "text": "Eventually, but that's not necessary for the system in the short term."}, {"time": 13872, "text": "It's good enough just to have, I know in a winter and say the Haskell client is that, and then what you basically do is you vote on a SIP and then once it's approved, then you go and implement that."}, {"time": 13884, "text": "And there's some mechanism to trigger the update system, to update the reference client."}, {"time": 13887, "text": "Do you have an example of a SIP, a Cardano Improvement Proposal?"}, {"time": 13891, "text": "Yeah, like the Curb Benefit Pledge, SIP 007."}, {"time": 13894, "text": "So the... 007."}, {"time": 13898, "text": "Yeah, everybody loves that."}, {"time": 13900, "text": "Yeah, key."}, {"time": 13901, "text": "I'm gonna change my luggage code now, Lex."}, {"time": 13905, "text": "So basically it just has to do with the pledge."}, {"time": 13910, "text": "So a pledge is a certain amount of ADA that a stake pool operator will set aside and connect to his pool in order to be listed in the registry."}, {"time": 13919, "text": "And actually it's connected to how much income you make as a pool operator."}, {"time": 13923, "text": "So if you set it too high, you have a consolidation, you have lots of pools."}, {"time": 13928, "text": "If you set it too low, what will happen is larger pools will tend to fragment and actually run multiple instances of themselves."}, {"time": 13935, "text": "And so this is delicate parameter that you have to tweak."}, {"time": 13938, "text": "And so we have a formula for it, our formal specification that's quite involved."}, {"time": 13942, "text": "And so one of the community members came and said, well, I think we can massively simplify this design and actually get a better result for smaller stake pool operators."}, {"time": 13950, "text": "And so it's SIP 007."}, {"time": 13953, "text": "And there's actually a lot of conversation and people are thinking about it."}, {"time": 13955, "text": "And it was just stunning for me because to understand how to write a SIP like this, you actually have to read like a hundred pages of mathematical prose in the formal specification."}, {"time": 13964, "text": "So the guys who wrote it, I was like, fuck yeah."}, {"time": 13968, "text": "I'll just say an example of a SIP, but that's one thing, but it could be as big as, hey, I wanna add like quantum resistance to the system."}, {"time": 13975, "text": "And here's how you do that, like quantum VRF and I wanna put XMSS and all this other stuff."}, {"time": 13980, "text": "So there's a lot you can do and you can do it indirectly or implicitly where there's some social process outside of the system where you eventually approve a SIP, or you can do it explicitly where you directly vote or some representative democracy, some group of representatives directly votes."}, {"time": 13999, "text": "And then once you've decided it's there."}, {"time": 14001, "text": "The constitution is necessary because you need to know the decision threshold."}, {"time": 14004, "text": "Is it super majority or majority?"}, {"time": 14006, "text": "And also the voting process."}, {"time": 14009, "text": "Like a lot of policy experts believe that if Brexit was a multi stage vote, it would have never passed because people would have done the initial stage and all the horrors of Brexit would have been broadcast to society."}, {"time": 14019, "text": "And then there would have been some reluctance and buyer's remorse on it."}, {"time": 14022, "text": "And then the second round would have failed or something like that."}, {"time": 14025, "text": "But because it was just a singular event, it's like they passed it now, British are all passive aggressive about it with no sign."}, {"time": 14032, "text": "Very well, we shall remove from Europe."}, {"time": 14035, "text": "And so your voting system has a lot to do with the outcome you get."}, {"time": 14039, "text": "The other thing is, what type of voting?"}, {"time": 14041, "text": "Is it just an absolute or is it a preference voting?"}, {"time": 14044, "text": "So you pick your favorite SIP, follow your second favorite SIP or something like that."}, {"time": 14048, "text": "So Condorcet or Borda are two examples of systems like that."}, {"time": 14051, "text": "Are you a fan of those, like the ranked choice vote?"}, {"time": 14053, "text": "I love them so much, especially for political diversity because this whole concept of throwing your vote away, if it's Alice or Bob,

preference voting, you never have that situation because you always pick your favorite and you get a lot more diversity on the ballot."}, {"time": 14078, "text": "But then you have arrows paradox and all these other things that come up."}, {"time": 14081, "text": "So there's no perfect system."}, {"time": 14084, "text": "And really you have to be comfortable with governance in a game of inches."},

interactions."}, {"time": 14097, "text": "And you have to be able to quantify those things."}, {"time": 14098, "text": "As long as you have an engine that allows you to grow in those directions, then you have a lot more people on for the ride when you actually start talking about these bigger and bigger things."}, {"time": 14107, "text": "The other challenge was that we had to decentralize development of the protocol and the brain of the protocol."}, {"time": 14112, "text": "We have fully decentralized the brain of the protocol."}, {"time": 14115, "text": "The peer review academic process means that there's now an academic incentive for graduate students, postdocs, and professors to spend enormous amounts of time writing papers in our ecosystem because they want tenure."},

automatically through some process will generate music."}, {"time": 16689, "text": "And there's actually people who study this."}, {"time": 16691, "text": "And so that's one dimension."}, {"time": 16692, "text": "The other thing is you have things like GPT3 and so forth."}, {"time": 16695, "text": "There was a great game, Event Zero, and it came out like 2016 where you could actually have a dialogue with an AI and you're like a marooned astronaut on a space station that's abandoned."}, {"time": 16708, "text": "And you have to somehow work with this AI through communicating with it to convince you to take you home."}, {"time": 16714, "text": "But the AI is a bit duplicitous."}, {"time": 16717, "text": "And I don't wanna spoil the plot of the game because it's such a cool game, but

the AI will reply to you back and forth."}, {"time": 16730, "text": "And this was 2016 and it's like things have gotten an order of magnitude better."}, {"time": 16734, "text": "So the evolution of that tech, I think within the next five years, brought into video games could give you incredibly cool dialogue inside the game."}, {"time": 16742, "text": "So algorithmically generated music, better dialogue, better gameplay mechanics."}, {"time": 16746, "text": "Also, I'd love to explore alternative physics systems, alternative geometries like hyperbolic geometry or these types of things."}, {"time": 16755, "text": "And there's actually Hyperbolica is a game that does that."}, {"time": 16759, "text": "And you can do down the Euclidean geometry as well and bring those elements into a game design."}, {"time": 16763, "text": "And that's what we'll do with Legends of Valor."}, {"time": 16765, "text": "So it'll be kind of like Skyrim, but with a lot of really cool new shit."}, {"time":

in."}, {"time": 16781, "text": "So that'll be a lot of fun."}, {"time": 16783, "text": "And what's nice about it is that there is a lot of new play in the market because of the Microsoft acquisition

I'll probably do it in 2022, 2023 and we'll build a nice crew and we'll do it in Wyoming, probably in Wheatland or some really small town and we'll import everybody and then we'll have to build the

dum."}, {"time": 16868, "text": "Jeremy Soule, I think was the composer."}, {"time": 16872, "text": "And actually getting like Raman Juwadi or Bear McCready in to do that, that would be so cool."},

like where do you fit?"}, {"time": 16926, "text": "And it has this incredible plot where you're kind of just a stowaway on a zeppelin that gets shot down and you get dragged into this conspiracy and you have to kind of figure out the conspiracy as you go through the whole game world."}, {"time": 16938, "text": "And you meet all these different races like the elves and the dwarves and so forth."}, {"time": 16941, "text": "And they've all been impacted by the proliferation of technology in different ways."}, {"time": 16945, "text": "Like the humans use steam engines to clear cut all the forest

side, kind of be neutral."}, {"time": 16963, "text": "And there's like 40 different endings for the game."}, {"time": 16967, "text": "And this is all like 2000."}, {"time": 16968, "text": "And then you talk about a procedurally generated world."}, {"time": 16971, "text": "You have a quick travel, but if you want, you can just walk and the world randomly generates."}, {"time": 16975, "text": "But it's not like Daggerfall where there was interesting things along the way."}, {"time": 16978, "text": "So it was really ahead of its time and it was kind of the last of a generation of games."}, {"time": 16983, "text": "It was based on the same framework that Interplay used for Fallout, the original Fallout and Fallout 2."}, {"time": 16989, "text": "So that was really a cool setup."},

look."}, {"time": 16997, "text": "And so it doesn't hold up super well today, but that was never the point."}, {"time": 17002, "text": "It was more of a story driven game."}, {"time": 17004, "text":

one, I think is probably the greatest."}, {"time": 17036, "text": "Was it called Planescape?"}, {"time": 17037, "text": "Yeah, it's another one on the Infinity Engine, which was what was used for Baldur's Gate."}, {"time": 17041, "text": "So it looks like Baldur's Gate."}, {"time": 17042, "text": "And God, that was such an incredibly well written game."}, {"time": 17046, "text": "You play this character called the Nameless One, this little blue guy, and you wake up in a morgue."}, {"time": 17050, "text": "And it turns out that you're a mortal."}, {"time": 17051, "text": "And every time you

forever, but you keep forgetting every time you get killed."}, {"time": 17071, "text": "And it turns out you weren't such a nice person throughout this entire game world."}, {"time": 17075, "text": "But then again, there's this question of, well, if you can start over and you lose all your memories, do you have a chance for redemption or not?"}, {"time": 17082, "text": "So it's an incredible game, Planescape Torment."}, {"time": 17085, "text": "And it's actually another one of those games where you can never actually have a fight."}, {"time": 17089, "text": "You can just kind of talk your way out of everything."}, {"time": 17090, "text": "And there's probably like a thousand pages of dialogue inside the game."}, {"time": 17094, "text": "You guys had a lot of fun and a lot of drugs making that game."}, {"time": 17097, "text": "Do you think these three games are the kinds that would still be okay to play today or are they forever lost in time because we sort of got desensitized

that thing."}, {"time": 17135, "text": "And so I think the fact that you have VR and AR and enhanced graphics and all these new gameplay mechanics, it's a value add instead of a value negative because ultimately what are you doing?"}, {"time": 17146, "text": "You're telling stories and you're trying to connect people to something."}, {"time": 17149, "text": "Maybe it's the nature of life and death

the question is, well, how good of a story can you tell?"}, {"time": 17162, "text": "Well, you're constrained by your storytelling tools and technology."}, {"time": 17165, "text": "The fact that games are so much more advanced now means that you now have many more dimensions of storytelling available to you."}, {"time": 17172, "text": "And actually with AI now coming in and really good AI coming in the next five or 10 years, your storytelling is not static anymore."}, {"time": 17180, "text": "The person can actually majorly participate and change the outcome in ways that were previously

research."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "Okay, but then you started speaking out about this as well, but also started to say, no, no, no, we should hurry up and figure out the origins now because it will

a little bit."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "Which are you most focused on now?"}, {"time": 2823, "text": "Which are you most freaking out about now in terms of the importance of figuring out the origins of this virus?"}, {"time": 2830, "text": "I am most freaking out about both of them because they're both really important and we can put bounds on this."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "Let me say first that this is a perfect test case for the theory of close calls because as much as COVID is a disaster, it is also a close call from which we can learn much."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "You are absolutely right."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "If we keep playing this game in the lab, if we are not, if we are, especially if we do it under pressure and when we are told that a virus is going to leap

on, is I think the algorithm can fix a lot of this and YouTube should build better algorithms and trust that to a couple of complete freedom of speech to expand what people are able to think about,

thing for everyone and then it got personalized and for a while it was possible to turn off the personalization, which was still not great because if everybody else is looking at a personalized search

is unthinkable."}, {"time": 5744, "text": "It is unthinkable that in the face of a campaign to vaccinate people in order to reach herd immunity that YouTube would give you videos on hazards of

perspective."}, {"time": 5769, "text": "If intelligent people in large amounts are open minded and are thinking through the hazards and the benefits of a vaccine, a company should find the best videos to present what people are thinking about."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "Well, let's come up with a hypothetical."}, {"time": 5790, "text": "Okay, let's come up with a very deadly disease for which there's a vaccine that is very safe, though not perfectly safe."}, {"time": 5800, "text": "And we are then faced with YouTube trying to figure out what to do for somebody searching on vaccine safety."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "Suppose it is necessary in order to drive the pathogen to extinction, something like smallpox, that people get on board with the vaccine."}, {"time": 5817, "text": "But there's a tiny fringe of people who thinks that the vaccine is a mind control agent."}, {"time": 5825, "text": "So should YouTube direct people to the only claims against this vaccine, which is that it's a mind control agent when in fact the vaccine is very safe, whatever that means."}, {"time": 5842, "text": "If that were the actual configuration of the puzzle, then YouTube would be doing active harm, pointing you to this other video potentially."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "Now, yes, I would love to live in a world where people are up to the challenge of sorting that out."}, {"time": 5859, "text": "But my basic point would be, if it's an evidentiary question, and there is essentially no evidence that the vaccine is a mind control agent, and there's plenty of evidence that the vaccine is safe, then while you look for this video, we're gonna give you this one, puts it on a par, right?"}, {"time": 5875, "text": "So for the mind that's tracking how much thought is there behind it's safe versus how much thought is there behind it's a mind control agent will result in artificially elevating this."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "Now in the current case, what we've seen is not this at all."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "We have seen evidence obscured in order to create a false story about safety."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "And we saw the inverse with ivermectin."}, {"time": 5902,

thing, but I guess my point is the algorithmic solution that you point to creates a problem of its own, which is that it means that the way to get exposure is to generate something fringy."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "If you're the only thing on some fringe, then suddenly YouTube would be recommending those things, and that's obviously a gameable system at best."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "Yeah, but the solution to that, I know you're creating a thought experiment, maybe playing a little bit of a devil's advocate."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "I think the solution to that is not to limit the algorithm in the case of the super deadly virus."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "It's for the scientists to step up and become better communicators, more charismatic, fight the battle of ideas, sort of create better videos."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "Like if the virus is truly deadly, you have a lot more ammunition, a lot more data, a lot more material to work with in terms of communicating with the public."}, {"time": 5966, "text": "So be better at communicating and stop being, you have to start trusting the intelligence of people and also being transparent and playing the game of the internet, which is like, what is the internet hungry for, I believe?"}, {"time": 5980, "text": "Authenticity, stop looking like you're full of shit."}, {"time": 5986, "text": "The scientific community, if there's any flaw that I currently see, especially the people that are in public office, that like Anthony Fauci, they look like they're full of shit and I know they're brilliant."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "Why don't they look more authentic?"}, {"time": 5999, "text": "So they're losing that game and I think a lot of people observing this entire system now, younger scientists are seeing this and saying, okay, if I want to continue being a scientist in the public eye and I want to be effective at my job, I'm gonna have to be a lot more authentic."}, {"time": 6018, "text": "So they're learning the lesson, this evolutionary system is working."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "So there's just a younger generation of minds coming up that I think will do a much better job in this battle of ideas that when the much more dangerous virus comes along, they'll be able to be better communicators."}, {"time": 6034, "text": "At least that's the hope."}, {"time": 6036, "text": "Using the algorithm to control that is, I feel like is a big problem."}, {"time": 6041, "text": "So you're going to have the same problem with a deadly virus as with the current virus if you let YouTube draw hard lines by the PR and the marketing people versus the broad community of scientists."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "Well, in some sense you're suggesting something that's close kin to what I was saying about freedom of expression ultimately provides an advantage to better ideas."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "So I'm in agreement broadly speaking, but I would also say there's probably some sort of, let's imagine the world that you propose where YouTube shows you the alternative point of view."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "That has the problem that I suggest, but one thing you could do is you could give us the tools to understand what we're looking at, right?"}, {"time": 6087, "text": "You could give us, so first of all, there's something I think myopic, solipsistic, narcissistic about an algorithm that serves shareholders by showing you what you want to see rather than what you need to know, right?"}, {"time": 6102, "text": "That's the distinction is flattering you, playing to your blind spot is something that algorithm will figure out, but it's not healthy for us all to have Google playing to our blind spot."}, {"time": 6113, "text": "It's very, very dangerous."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "So what I really want is analytics that allow me or maybe options and analytics."}, {"time": 6122, "text": "The options should allow me to see what alternative perspectives are being explored, right?"}, {"time": 6129, "text": "So here's the thing I'm searching and it leads me down this road, right?"}, {"time": 6132, "text": "Let's say it's ivermectin, okay?"}, {"time": 6134, "text": "I find all of this evidence that ivermectin works."}, {"time": 6136, "text": "I find all of these discussions and people talk about various protocols and this and that."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "And then I could say, all right, what is the other side?"}, {"time": 6144, "text": "And I could see who is searching, not as individuals, but what demographics are searching alternatives."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "And maybe you could even combine it with something Reddit like where effectively, let's say that there was a position that, I don't know, that a vaccine is a mind control device and you could have a steel man this argument competition effectively and the better answers that steel man and as well as possible would rise to the top."}, {"time": 6173, "text": "And so you could read the top three or four explanations about why this really credibly is a mind control product."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "And you can say, well, that doesn't really add up."}, {"time": 6183, "text": "I can check these three things myself and they can't possibly be right, right?"}, {"time": 6187, "text": "And you could dismiss it."}, {"time": 6188, "text": "And then as an argument that was credible, let's say plate tectonics before that was an accepted concept, you'd say, wait a minute, there is evidence for plate tectonics."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "As crazy as it sounds that the continents are floating around on liquid, actually that's not so implausible."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "We've got these subduction zones, we've got a geology that is compatible, we've got puzzle piece continents that seem to fit together."}, {"time": 6213, "text": "Wow, that's a surprising amount of evidence for that position."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "So I'm gonna file some Bayesian probability with it that's updated for the fact that actually the steel man arguments better than I was expecting, right?"}, {"time": 6223, "text": "So I could imagine something like that where A, I would love the search to be indifferent to who's searching, right?"}, {"time": 6229, "text": "The solipsistic thing is too dangerous."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "So the search could be general, so we would all get a sense for what everybody else was seeing too."}, {"time": 6236, "text": "And then some layer that didn't have anything to do with what YouTube points you to or not, but allowed you to see, you know, the general pattern of adherence to searching for information."}, {"time": 6251, "text": "And again, a layer in which those things could be defended."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "So you could hear what a good argument sounded like rather than just hear a caricatured argument."}, {"time": 6259, "text": "Yeah, and also reward people, creators that have demonstrated like a track record of open mindedness and correctness as much as it could be measured over a long term and sort of, I mean, a lot of this maps to incentivizing good longterm behavior, not immediate kind of dopamine rush kind of signals."}, {"time": 6290,

inoculating children, and there has been some revision in the last day or two about the recommendation on this because of the adverse events that have shown up in children, but to the extent that we

should not be exposing them to."}, {"time": 7511, "text": "By the way, as a tiny tangent, another huge part of this soup that should have been part of it that's an incredible solution is large scale testing."}, {"time": 7522, "text": "But that might be another couple hour conversation, but there's these solutions that are obvious that were available from the very beginning."}, {"time": 7530,

shocked that we did not get on high quality testing early and that we are still suffering from this even now, because just the simple ability to track where the virus moves between people would tell us a lot about its mode of transmission, which would allow us to protect ourselves better."}, {"time": 7588, "text": "Instead, that information was hard won and for no good reason."}, {"time": 7593,

explain the conclusion of the paper."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "There's a question about why a creature that can replace its cells with new cells grows feeble and inefficient with age."}, {"time": 7634, "text": "We call that process, which is otherwise called aging, we call it senescence."}, {"time": 7640, "text": "And senescence, in this paper, it is hypothesized, is the unavoidable downside of a cancer prevention feature of our bodies."}, {"time": 7656, "text": "That each cell has a limit on the number of times it can divide."}, {"time": 7660, "text": "There are a few cells in the body that are exceptional, but most of our cells can only divide a limited number of times."}, {"time": 7666, "text": "That's called the Hayflick limit."}, {"time": 7667, "text": "And the Hayflick limit reduces the ability of the organism to replace tissues."}, {"time": 7675, "text": "It therefore results in a failure over time of maintenance and repair."}, {"time": 7681, "text": "And that explains why we become decrepit as we grow old."}, {"time": 7686, "text": "The question was why would that be, especially in light of the fact that the mechanism that seems to limit the ability of cells to reproduce is something called a telomere."}, {"time": 7698, "text": "Telomere is a, it's not a gene, but it's a DNA sequence at the ends of our chromosomes that is just simply repetitive."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "And the number of repeats functions like a counter."}, {"time": 7710, "text": "So there's a number of repeats that you have after development is finished."}, {"time": 7714, "text": "And then each time the cell divides a little bit of telomere is lost."}, {"time": 7717, "text": "And at the point that the telomere becomes critically short, the cell stops dividing even though it still has the capacity to do so."}, {"time": 7724, "text": "Stops dividing and it starts transcribing different genes than it did when it had more telomere."}, {"time": 7730, "text": "So what my work did was it looked at the fact that the telomeric shortening was being studied by two different groups."}, {"time": 7737, "text": "It was being studied by people who were interested in counteracting the aging process."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "And it was being studied in exactly the opposite fashion by people who were interested in tumorigenesis and cancer."}, {"time": 7750, "text": "The thought being because it was true that when one looked into tumors, they always had telomerase active."}, {"time": 7756, "text": "That's the enzyme that lengthens our telomeres."}, {"time": 7759, "text": "So those folks were interested in bringing about a halt to the lengthening of telomeres in order to counteract cancer."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "And the folks who were studying the senescence process were interested in lengthening telomeres in order to generate greater repair capacity."}, {"time": 7775, "text": "And my point was evolutionarily speaking, this looks like a pleiotropic effect that the genes which create the tendency of the cells to be limited in their capacity to replace themselves are providing a benefit in youth, which is that we are largely free of tumors and cancer at the inevitable late life cost that we grow feeble and inefficient and eventually die."}, {"time": 7804, "text": "And that matches a very old hypothesis in evolutionary theory by somebody I was fortunate enough to know, George Williams, one of the great 20th century evolutionists who argued that senescence would have to be caused by pleiotropic genes that cause early life benefits at unavoidable late life costs."}, {"time": 7826, "text": "And although this isn't the exact nature of the system, he predicted it matches what he was expecting in many regards to a shocking degree."}, {"time": 7835, "text": "That said, the focus of the paper is about the, well, let me just read the abstract."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols designed, this is the end of the abstract."}, {"time": 7849, "text": "We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols designed to increase reproductive output, simultaneously exert strong selection against reproductive senescence and virtually eliminate selection that would otherwise favor tumor suppression."}, {"time": 7863, "text": "This appears to have greatly elongated the telomeres of laboratory mice."}, {"time": 7867, "text": "With their telomeric failsafe effectively disabled, these animals are unreliable models of normal senescence and tumor formation."}, {"time": 7875, "text": "So basically using these mice is not going to lead to the right kinds of conclusions."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "Safety tests employing these animals likely overestimate cancer risks and underestimate tissue damage and consequent accelerated senescence."}, {"time": 7892, "text": "So I think, especially with your discussion with Eric, the conclusion of this paper has to do with the fact that, like we shouldn't be using these mice to test the safety or to make conclusions about cancer or senescence."}, {"time": 7913, "text": "Is that the basic takeaway?"}, {"time": 7915, "text": "Like basically saying that the length of these telomeres is an important variable to consider."}, {"time": 7921, "text": "I think there was a reason that the world of scientists who was working on telomeres did not spot the pleiotropic relationship that was the key argument in my paper."}, {"time": 7936, "text": "The reason they didn't spot it was that there was a result that everybody knew, which seemed inconsistent."},

very long lives is, but in the end, I was confronted with a hypothesis that would explain a great many features of the way mammals and indeed vertebrates age, but it was inconsistent with one result."}, {"time": 7966, "text": "And at first I thought, maybe there's something wrong with the result."}, {"time": 7970, "text": "Maybe this is one of these cases where the result was achieved once through some bad protocol and everybody else was repeating it, didn't turn out to be the case."}, {"time": 7978, "text": "Many laboratories had established that mice had ultra long telomeres."}, {"time": 7982, "text": "And so I began to wonder whether or not there was something about the breeding protocols that generated these mice."}, {"time": 7991, "text": "And what that would predict is that the mice that have long telomeres would be laboratory mice and that wild mice would not."}, {"time": 7998, "text": "And Carol Greider, who agreed to collaborate with me, tested that hypothesis and showed that it was indeed true, that wild derived mice, or at least mice that had been in captivity for a much shorter period of time did not have ultra long telomeres."}, {"time": 8015, "text": "Now, what this implied though, as you read, is that our breeding protocols generate lengthening of telomeres."}, {"time": 8023, "text": "And the implication of that is that the animals that have these very long telomeres will be hyper prone to create tumors."}, {"time": 8030, "text": "They will be extremely resistant to toxins because they have effectively an infinite capacity to replace any damaged tissue."}, {"time": 8038, "text": "And so ironically, if you give one of these ultra long telomere lab mice a toxin, if the toxin doesn't outright kill it, it may actually increase its lifespan because it functions as a kind of chemotherapy."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "So the reason that chemotherapy works is that dividing cells are more vulnerable than cells that are not dividing."}, {"time": 8061, "text": "And so if this mouse has effectively had its cancer protection turned off, and it has cells dividing too rapidly, and you give it a toxin, you will slow down its tumors faster than you harm its other tissues."}, {"time": 8073, "text": "And so you'll get a paradoxical result that actually some drug that's toxic seems to benefit the mouse."}, {"time": 8080, "text": "Now, I don't think that that was understood before I published my paper."}, {"time": 8084, "text": "Now I'm pretty sure it has to be."}, {"time": 8086, "text": "And the problem is that this actually is a system that serves pharmaceutical companies that have the difficult job of bringing compounds to market, many of which will be toxic."}, {"time": 8099, "text": "Maybe all of them will be toxic."}, {"time": 8101, "text": "And these mice predispose our system to declare these toxic compounds safe."}, {"time": 8107, "text": "And in fact, I believe we've seen the errors that result from using these mice a number of times, most famously with Vioxx, which turned out to do conspicuous heart damage."}, {"time": 8118, "text": "Why do you think this paper and this idea has not gotten significant traction?"}, {"time": 8123, "text": "Well, my collaborator, Carol Greider, said something to me that rings in my ears to this day."}, {"time": 8132, "text": "She initially, after she showed that laboratory mice have anomalously long telomeres and that wild mice don't have long telomeres, I asked her where she was going to publish that result so that I could cite it in my paper."},

young seals that had made mistakes during training operations."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And the description was that I, same thing, like this harsh blunt force trauma and just totally direct sledgehammer of truth that I would hit guys with."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "But it's interesting because I always talk about, you know, building relationships and making sure you're not offending someone."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "So how do these things match up?"}, {"time": 3152, "text": "Well, I can tell you how they match up when I was being harsh, the guys that I was being harsh with knew without one shred of doubt that I cared about them more than anything else."}, {"time": 3166, "text": "And that the reason I was giving them this feedback is because I wanted them to be able to lead their troops."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "I wanted them to be able to go accomplish their mission."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And I wanted them to be able to bring their guys home from war."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "So I wasn't being harsh because it elevated my ego."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "I wasn't being harsh because I wanted to denigrate them."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "I was being, actually being harsh because I wanted them to accomplish the mission."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "Because I wanted them to accomplish the mission."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "So if that's where Elon comes from, hey, listen, we got to make this happen."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "This is for the good of the world to do this."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "And people know that then it works."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "I'll bring this point back up with another guy, Steve Jobs, but let me stay on Elon for a second."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "The other thing he does, which is interesting, I see the value of this."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "It'd be great to hear you speak about it."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "He's unlike many of the other CEOs, very rich billionaires, involved in leading a lot of people."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "He puts a lot of time into making sure he's on the factory floor."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "He famously sleeps on the, sort of like in the middle of things."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "And he puts a lot of effort."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "He's also very good at it is being a low level engineer."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "So like, whatever the task is, he wants to understand the details and he'll talk to the lowest level person in terms of like, somebody who's like working literally on putting parts together."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "He wants to understand what the problem is, what the challenge is."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "If there's an emergency, he wants to understand the actual details of the problem, not like delegating it to a manager, but like, because a lot of CEOs, a lot of managers will talk about sort of the power and the importance of delegation."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "Here, he wants to know if there's a big problem, he wants to know the exact detail."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "He wants to know the exact problem."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "He wants to, at the fundamental level, understand how to solve that problem."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "Whether it has to do with materials, whether it has to do with the actual manufacturing, the mechanical engineering aspect, like we're talking about engineering."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "This is a guy who wears a suit as a CEO, tweets about Dogecoin, but like an actual job, he's low level engineering."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "And that to me was always inspiring to see somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "That's what it, like he gains the respect of engineers at the lowest level."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "I don't know if that's scalable, but that's always been inspiring to me."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "And I wonder how many people it's inspiring to."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "Maybe you could speak to the value of doing that, of no matter how high your level of leader is, to be able to do the low level shit."}, {"time": 3328, "text": "And that's a common trait that good leaders have."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "And maybe he doesn't necessarily know how to do everything, a good leader, but they go down there and talk to the frontline troops and say, Hey, what is the issue that you're dealing with?"}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Or, you know, how can I support you?"}, {"time": 3345, "text": "How can I give you help?"}, {"time": 3345, "text": "And one key point that you said is, he said, when there's a problem, he gets in there."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "So there's things happening at his companies that they're working."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "And so he doesn't have to die."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "I'm not saying he never does, but he doesn't have to spend as much time working on or looking at some subsystem that's functioning well."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "He's got a good leader in there that's handling it."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "And he checks in with that leader."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "And the leader says, yeah, it's working perfectly."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "He says, great."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "When there's a problem, that's when he might have to get down there and dig into some details so that he fully understands it."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "So that he, when he digs down in the details, and this is important, he's coming from an altitude where he has a better, bigger perspective, not necessarily better, but a bigger perspective."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "So if you sit there and work on a problem, whatever, for eight hours and you're staring at, you know, if you were planning a mission and you were planning it for eight hours, you're staring at the maps and the charts and you're figuring out where all the troops are going to be located."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "And I come in after eight hours and I look at your plan from a distant perspective, there's a good chance I'll be able to see holes in your plan that you couldn't see because your perspective was too close."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "So that's good for me to be able to come in from a higher perspective and have a look at it."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "But also there's times where I need to get down there and actually look, you know, if you're looking at a problem and you say, look, I can't figure out boss, I can't figure out how to get to this target."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "And I'm looking at it from a distance and I don't see, I might need to start digging in and looking and saying, Oh, here's a route that we can take that actually makes sense."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "So I think it's a good example of someone going up and down in altitude to look at problems, understanding what's happening with the frontline troops."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "And at the same time, being able to go back to the strategic level."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "And I can, it's probably this way."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "The reason that he's successful is because he doesn't get stuck down there."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "Because if he felt the need to micromanage each and every part on a Tesla, it wouldn't be, it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do that."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "It wouldn't be, it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do all that."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "Now he can hand over some broad chip design and say, Hey, this is what the function needs to be."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "And he gives it to Lex and Lex goes there with your team and you figured out and you make it happen."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "If he had to actually do that all himself, most likely not possible."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "So that's what leaders should be doing."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "They should go elevate and, and, and then get down in the weeds when they have to, and then go back up."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "The sad thing, this is the part that makes me not want to do a startup is basically his whole life is dealing with emergencies."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "Just like you said, he's not dealing, this is not shooting the shit about details of engineering."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "It's dealing with like, in this, in the case of the company, life and death, like something that can just completely damage the production line, right?"}, {"time": 3528, "text": "So he's constantly dealing with emergencies, putting out fires."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "And I don't know if there's something to be said about that psychology of that, of how, like he, he's spoken himself that he's worried whether his mind can hold up much longer."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "So hopefully in the near future, he will start to form more decentralized command where he has some subordinate leadership that he fully trusts."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "And most important that he has properly trained so that they can handle these day to day fires at least 80% of them."}, {"time": 3556, "text": "So only 20% of the time, does he actually need to go in and solve a problem."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "If he's not doing that right now, then that's going to end up being a problem anytime."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "So I work with companies all the time."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "And that's, what's interesting about this is I go and work with a CEO or with a, with a C suite of a company."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "It takes a little while to figure out what's going on."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "I'm kind of going off of the things that you're telling me almost anecdotally, right?"}, {"time": 3610, "text": "Number one, so you can let your brain, you know, you can, you can survive a little longer as he put it, but also all the time that you spend as a leader, looking down and into your organization is time that you're not looking up and out."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "So when you're not looking up and out, you're not seeing what the competitors doing."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "You're not seeing where the market's going."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "There's problems that, that, that can come from that."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "So if right now he's spending too much time looking down and in, and you mentioned, you know, you said, I don't know if I want to do a startup."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "When you do a startup, you're going to be looking down and in for a while."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "It's going to take a while."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "You're going to have to do all this work yourself."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "You're not going to have the finances to put people manpower behind these things."}, {"time": 3647, "text": "So that's probably he, maybe he's in that mindset a little bit because he's done so many startups over the years."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "And so he's in the he's habitually in the weeds."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "So my advice would be, all right, let's start looking at formulating some subordinate leadership that has the, like I said, the expertise, the trust that you can, you can start to turn over some of these more minute details to them so that you can start looking up and out."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "I think he's done that more successful in some places than others."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "The SpaceX, a lot of people give the credit to Gwen Shotwell for the CEO, the COO of SpaceX as, as a very successful person that runs shit, but in Tesla, not as much."}, {"time": 3691, "text": "So I wonder if you can comment on something a lot of people worry about, and this applies to a lot of tech companies, which is a lot of people worry about that if Elon disappears, the, the, the innovative spirit, the company is as we know them today will collapse, will stagnate and will basically fail to do what they've been doing for so many years successfully."}, {"time": 3720, "text": "Is there some aspect to what makes a good leader that if you disappear, it's still the thing still lives on and not just lives on, but thrives."}, {"time": 3734, "text": "So what we have to do in those situations is we have to establish a strong culture inside that organization."}, {"time": 3739, "text": "And if you're there's, there's, there's reasons why this happens, right?"}, {"time": 3739, "text": "If I have a big ego and I form a company and I love the fact that everyone looks at me and says, Oh, Jocko made this company and he's the creative force behind this company."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "And that fuels my ego and it makes me feel good."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And you know, I'm working with you, Lex."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And every time you come up with an idea, I say, Lex, you need to stay in your box."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "So I'm not creating a culture that rewards that sort of creativity."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "And eventually when I die, I won't have have educated my team on how to maintain that creative aspect."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "So again, hopefully inside that organization, he's, he's encouraging and growing that culture where creativity is rewarded, where, where it flourishes, even when he's gone, that's what we have to hope for."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "He is, but I also seem to notice that there's not many people like him."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "Um, people become complacent too easily."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "I've been disappointed by people a little bit."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "It's like, success makes people soft."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "With Elon, it seems like success doesn't have any effect."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "It's like the reverse effect."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "It doesn't, it's like, what's the, it's always like, what's the next biggest thing, right?"}, {"time": 3825, "text": "He's living that exponential growth, which I think that's the problem that you have to have somebody who's constantly trying to find the 10 X solution, like trying to constantly improve things."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "And, uh, restlessly that, I mean, that probably has to do with finding the right people, not just creating the culture, but creating a culture with the right set of people."}, {"time": 3851, "text": "Speaking of which Steve Jobs, there's, uh, two things I want to mention there."}, {"time": 3859, "text": "One, once again, the harshness, but a very different kind."}, {"time": 3862, "text": "And the second is team building."}, {"time": 3862, "text": "So on the harshness, he is much harsher than Elon in a way, in the following way."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "And I'm having a sense that you will not like this, but I'd like to defend it is he loses his shit quite a bit."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "He was famously, at least, especially early on being very emotional."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "He was letting passion dominate the discussion."}, {"time":

is, how can you do it quickly enough?"}, {"time": 465, "text": "So how can you do it at all is something that philosophers have grappled with."}, {"time": 471, "text": "And fortunately, philosophers 100 years ago and even earlier developed a kind of formal language like English."}, {"time": 478, "text": "It's called predicate logic or first order logic or something like predicate calculus and so on."}, {"time": 490, "text": "So there's a way of representing things in this formal language which enables a mechanical procedure to sort of grind through and algorithmically produce all of the same logical entailments, all the same logical conclusions that you or I would from that same set of pieces of information that are represented that way."}, {"time": 521, "text": "So that sort of raises a couple questions."}, {"time": 521, "text": "One is, how do you get all this information from say observations and English and so on into this logical form?"}, {"time": 528, "text": "And secondly, how can you then efficiently run these algorithms to actually get the information you need?"}, {"time": 541, "text": "In the case I mentioned in a 10th of a second rather than say in 10 hours or 10,000 years of computation."}, {"time": 548, "text": "And those are both really important questions."}, {"time": 548, "text": "And like a corollary addition to the first one is, how many such things do you need to gather for it to be useful in certain contexts?"}, {"time": 562, "text": "So like what, in order, you mentioned philosophers, in order to capture this world and represent it in a logical way and with a form of logic, like how many statements are required?"}, {"time": 576, "text": "Is it five?"}, {"time": 576, "text": "Is it 10?"}, {"time": 576, "text": "Is it 10 trillion?"}, {"time": 576, "text": "Is it like that?"}, {"time": 576, "text": "That's as far as I understand is probably still an open question."}, {"time": 583, "text": "It may forever be an open question just to say like definitively about, to describe the universe perfectly."}, {"time": 590, "text": "How many facts do you need?"}, {"time": 594, "text": "I guess I'm going to disappoint you by giving you an actual answer to your question."}, {"time": 600, "text": "Well, no, this sounds exciting."}, {"time": 603, "text": "So now we have like three things to talk about."}, {"time": 609, "text": "We'll keep adding more."}, {"time": 610, "text": "Although it's okay."}, {"time": 610, "text": "The first and the third are related."}, {"time": 610, "text": "So let's leave the efficiency question aside for now."}, {"time": 616, "text": "So how does all this information get represented in logical form?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "So that these algorithms, resolution theorem proving and other algorithms can actually grind through all the logical consequences of what you said."}, {"time": 630, "text": "And that ties into your question about how many of these things do you need?"}, {"time": 637, "text": "Because if the answer is small enough, then by hand, you could write them out one at a time."}, {"time": 643, "text": "So in the early 1984, I held a meeting at Stanford where I was a faculty member there, where we assembled about half a dozen of the smartest people I know."}, {"time": 665, "text": "People like Alan Newell and Marvin Minsky and Alan Kay and a few others."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Was Feynman there by chance?"}, {"time": 675, "text": "Because he commented about your system, Eurisco, at the time."}, {"time": 680, "text": "No, he wasn't part of this meeting."}, {"time": 683, "text": "That's a heck of a meeting anyway."}, {"time": 685, "text": "I think Ed Feigenbaum was there."}, {"time": 685, "text": "I think Josh Lederberg was there."}, {"time": 685, "text": "So we have all these different smart people."}, {"time": 727, "text": "And I expected there would be an enormous divergence of opinion and computation."}, {"time": 727, "text": "But amazingly, everyone got an answer which was around a million."}, {"time": 734, "text": "And one person got the answer by saying, well, look, you can only burn into human long term memory a certain number of things per unit time, like maybe one every 30 seconds or something."}, {"time": 750, "text": "And other than that, it's just short term memory and it flows away like water and so on."}, {"time": 756, "text": "So by the time you're, say, 10 years old or so, how many things could you possibly have burned into your long term memory?"}, {"time": 762, "text": "And it's like about a million."}, {"time": 767, "text": "Another person went in a completely different direction and said, well, if you look at the number of words in a dictionary, not a whole dictionary, but for someone to essentially be considered to be fluent in a language, how many words would they need to know?"}, {"time": 780, "text": "And then about how many things about each word would you have to tell it?"}, {"time": 785, "text": "And so they got to a million that way."}, {"time": 790, "text": "Another person said, well, let's actually look at one single short, one volume desk encyclopedia article."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And so we'll look at what was like a four paragraph article or something."}, {"time": 807, "text": "I think about grebes."}, {"time": 807, "text": "Grebes are a type of waterfowl."}, {"time": 807, "text": "And if we were going to sit there and represent every single thing that was there, how many assertions or rules or statements would we have to write in this logical language and so on and then multiply that by all of the number of articles that there were and so on."}, {"time": 826, "text": "So all of these estimates came out with a million."}, {"time": 826, "text": "And so if you do the math, it turns out that like, oh, well, then maybe in something like 100 person years in one or two person centuries, we could actually get this written down by hand."}, {"time": 849, "text": "And a marvelous coincidence, an opportunity existed right at that point in time, the early 1980s."}, {"time": 859, "text": "There was something called the Japanese fifth generation computing effort."}, {"time": 859, "text": "Japan had threatened to do in computing and AI and hardware what they had just finished doing in consumer electronics and the automotive industry, namely resting control away from the United States and more generally away from the West."}, {"time": 876, "text": "And so America was scared and Congress did something."}, {"time": 876, "text": "That's how you know it was a long time ago because Congress did something."}, {"time": 884, "text": "Congress passed something called the National Cooperative Research Act, NCRA."}, {"time": 888, "text": "And what it said was, hey, all you big American companies, that's also how you know it was a long time ago because they were American companies rather than multinational companies."}, {"time": 899, "text": "Hey, all you big American companies, normally it would be an antitrust violation if you colluded on R&D, but we promise for the next 10 years, we won't prosecute any of you if you do that to help combat this threat."}, {"time": 913, "text": "And so overnight, the first two consortia, research consortia in America sprang up, both of them coincidentally in Austin, Texas."}, {"time": 920, "text": "One called Semitech focusing on hardware chips and so on, and then one called MCC, the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, focusing more on software, on databases and AI and natural language understanding and things like that."}, {"time": 941, "text": "And I got the opportunity, thanks to my friend Woody Bledsoe, who was one of the people who founded that, to come and be its principal scientist."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And he sent Admiral Bob Inman, who was the person running MCC, came and talked to me and said, look, professor, you're talking about doing this project, it's going to involve centuries of effort."}, {"time": 968, "text": "You've only got a handful of graduate students, you do the math, it's going to take you longer than the rest of your life to finish this project."}, {"time": 973, "text": "But if you move to the wilds of Austin, Texas, we'll put 10 times as many people on it and you'll be done in a few years."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And so that was pretty exciting."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And so I did that."}, {"time": 987, "text": "I took my leave from Stanford, I came to Austin, I worked for MCC."}, {"time": 994, "text": "And the good news and bad news, the bad news is that all of us were off by an order of magnitude."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "That it turns out what you need are tens of millions of these pieces of knowledge about every day, sort of like if you have a coffee cup with stuff in it and you turn it upside down, the stuff in it's going to fall out."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "So you need tens of millions of pieces of knowledge like that, even if you take trouble to make each one as general as it possibly could be."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "And so by now we've done that."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "And the good news is since you've waited 38 years just about to talk to me, we're about at the end of that process."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So most of what we're doing now is not putting in even what you would consider common sense, but more putting in domain specific application specific knowledge about health care in a certain hospital or about oil pipes getting clogged up or whatever the applications happen to be."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "Because that's one of the general pieces of knowledge you have in dealing with electronic equipment or software systems or things like that."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "Is there a basic principle like that?"}, {"time": 1146, "text": "Is it possible to encode something that generally captures this idea of turn it off and turn it back on and see if it fixes?"}, {"time": 1153, "text": "That's one of the things that Psych knows."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "That's actually one of the fundamental laws of nature, I believe."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "I wouldn't call it a law."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "It's more like a..."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "It seems to work every time."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "So it sure looks like a law."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "So that basically covered the resources needed."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And then we had to devise a method to actually figure out, well, what are the tens of millions of things that we need to tell the system?"}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And for that, we found a few techniques which worked really well."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "One is to take any piece of text almost, it could be an advertisement, it could be a transcript, it could be a novel, it could be an article."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And don't pay attention to the actual type that's there, the black space on the white page."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "Pay attention to the complement of that, the white space, if you will."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So what did the writer of this sentence assume that the reader already knew about the world?"}, {"time": 1212, "text": "For instance, if they used a pronoun, why did they think that you would be able to understand what the intended referent of that pronoun was?"}, {"time": 1226, "text": "If they used an ambiguous word, how did they think that you would be able to figure out what they meant by that word?"}, {"time": 1231, "text": "The other thing we look at is the gap between one sentence and the next one."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "What are all the things that the writer expected you to fill in and infer occurred between the end of one sentence and the beginning of the other?"}, {"time": 1247, "text": "So if the sentence says, Fred Smith robbed the Third National Bank, period, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison, period."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Well, between the first sentence and the second, you're expected to infer things like Fred got caught, Fred got arrested, Fred went to jail, Fred had a trial, Fred was found guilty, and so on."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "If my next sentence starts out with something like, the judge, dot, dot, dot, then you assume it's the judge at his trial."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "If my next sentence starts out something like, the arresting officer, dot, dot, dot, you assume that it was the police officer who arrested him after he committed the crime and so on."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So those are two techniques for getting that knowledge."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "The other thing we sometimes look at is fake news or humorous onion headlines or headlines in the Weekly World News, if you know what that is, or the National Enquirer, where it's like, oh, we don't believe this, then we introspect on why don't we believe it."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "So there are things like, B17 lands on the moon."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "It's like, what do we know about the world that causes us to believe that that's just silly or something like that?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Or another thing we look for are contradictions, contradictions, things which can't both be true."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "And we say, what is it that we know that causes us to know that both of these can't be true at the same time?"}, {"time": 1333, "text": "For instance, in one of the Weekly World News editions, in one article, it talked about how Elvis was cited, even though he was getting on in years and so on."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And another article in the same one talked about people seeing Elvis's ghost."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "So it's like, why do we believe that at least one of these articles must be wrong and so on?"}, {"time": 1359, "text": "So we have a series of techniques like that that enable our people."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "And by now, we have about 50 people working full time on this and have for decades."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "So we've put in the thousands of person years of effort."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "We've built up these tens of millions of rules."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "We constantly police the system to make sure that we're saying things as generally as we possibly can."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So you don't want to say things like, no mouse is also a moose."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "Because if you said things like that, then you'd have to add another one or two or three zeros onto the number of assertions you'd actually have to have."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "So at some point, we generalize things more and more and we get to a point where we say, oh, yeah, for any two biological taxons, if we don't know explicitly that one is a generalization of another, then almost certainly they're disjoint."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "A member of one is not going to be a member of the other and so on."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "And the same thing with the Elvis and the ghost."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "It has nothing to do with Elvis."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "It's more about human nature and the mortality and that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "In general, things are not both alive and dead at the same time."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "Unless special cats in theoretical physics examples."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "Well, that raises a couple important points."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "Well, that's the onion headline situation type of thing."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "But no, no."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "So what you bring up is this really important point of like, well, how do you handle exceptions and inconsistencies and so on?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And one of the hardest lessons for us to learn, it took us about five years to really grit our teeth and learn to love it, is we had to give up global consistency."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "So the knowledge base can no longer be consistent."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "So this is a kind of scary thought."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "I grew up watching Star Trek and anytime a computer was inconsistent, it would either freeze up or explode or take over the world or something bad would happen."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "Or if you come from a mathematics background, once you can prove false, you can prove anything."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "So that's not good."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "So that's why the old knowledge based systems were all very, very consistent."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "But the trouble is that by and large, our models of the world, the way we talk about the world and so on, there are all sorts of inconsistencies that creep in here and there that will sort of kill some attempt to build some enormous globally consistent knowledge base."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And so what we had to move to was a system of local consistency."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "So a good analogy is you know that the surface of the earth is more or less spherical globally, but you live your life every day as though the surface of the earth were flat."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "When you're talking to someone in Australia, you don't think of them as being oriented upside down to you."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "When you're planning a trip, even if it's a thousand miles away, you may think a little bit about time zones, but you rarely think about the curvature of the earth and so on."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "And for most purposes, you can live your whole life without really worrying about that because the earth is locally flat."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "In much the same way, the psych knowledge base is divided up into almost like tectonic plates, which are individual contexts."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "And each context is more or less consistent, but there can be small inconsistencies at the boundary between one context and the next one and so on."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "And so by the time you move say 20 contexts over, there could be glaring inconsistencies."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "So eventually you get from the normal modern real world context that we're in right now to something like roadrunner cartoon context where physics is very different."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "And in fact, life and death are very different because no matter how many times he's killed, the coyote comes back in the next scene and so on."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "So that was a hard lesson to learn."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "For instance, at one level of abstraction, you think of this table as a solid object, but down at the atomic level, it's mostly empty space and so on."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So then that's fascinating, but it puts a lot of pressure on context to do a lot of work."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So you say tectonic plates, is it possible to formulate contexts that are general and big that do this kind of capture of knowledge bases?"}, {"time": 1649, "text": "Or do you then get turtles on top of turtles, again, where there's just a huge number of contexts?"}, {"time": 1659, "text": "So it's good you asked that question because you're pointed in the right direction, which is you want context to be first class objects in your system's knowledge base, in particular, in psych's knowledge base."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And by first class object, I mean that we should be able to have psych think about and talk about and reason about one context or another context the same way it reasons about coffee cups and tables and people and fishing and so on."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "And so contexts are just terms in its language, just like the ones I mentioned."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "And so psych can reason about context, context can arrange hierarchically and so on."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And so you can say things about, let's say, things that are true in the modern era, things that are true in a particular year would then be a subcontext of the things that are true in a broader, let's say, a century or a millennium or something like that."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "Things that are true in Austin, Texas are generally going to be a specialization of things that are true in Texas, which is going to be a specialization of things that are true in the United States and so on."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "And so you don't have to say things over and over again at all these levels."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "You just say things at the most general level that it applies to, and you only have to say it once, and then it essentially inherits to all these more specific contexts."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "To ask a slightly technical question, is this inheritance a tree or a graph?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Oh, you definitely have to think of it as a graph."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "So we could talk about, for instance, why the Japanese fifth generation computing effort failed."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "There were about half a dozen different reasons."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "One of the reasons they failed was because they tried to represent knowledge as a tree rather than as a graph."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And so each node in their representation could only have one parent node."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "So if you had a table that was a wooden object, a black object, a flat object, and so on, you have to choose one, and that's the only parent it could have."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "When, of course, depending on what it is you need to reason about it, sometimes it's important to know that it's made out of wood, like if we're talking about a fire."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "Sometimes it's important to know that it's flat if we're talking about resting something on it, and so on."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "So one of the problems was that they wanted a kind of Dewey decimal numbering system for all of their concepts, which meant that each node could only have at most 10 children, and each node could only have one parent."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "And while that does enable the Dewey decimal type numbering of concepts, labeling of concepts, it prevents you from representing all the things you need to about objects in our world."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "And that was one of the things which they never were able to overcome, and I think that was one of the main reasons that that project failed."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "So we'll return to some of the doors you've opened, but if we can go back to that room in 1984 around there with Marvin Minsky and Stanford."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "By the way, I should mention that Marvin wouldn't do his estimate until someone brought him an envelope so that he could literally do a back of the envelope calculation to come up with his number."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "Well, because I feel like the conversation in that room is an important one."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "You know, this is how sometimes science is done in this way."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "A few people get together and plant the seed of ideas, and they reverberate throughout history."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "And some kind of dissipate and disappear, and some, you know, Drake equation, and, you know, they, you know, seems like a meaningless equation, somewhat meaningless, but I think it drives and motivates a lot of scientists."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "And when the aliens finally show up, that equation will get even more valuable because then we'll get, be able to, in the long arc of history, the Drake equation will prove to be quite useful, I think."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "And in that same way, a conversation of just how many facts are required to capture the basic common sense knowledge of the world."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "I want to distinguish between what you think of as facts and the kind of things that we represent."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "So we map to and essentially make sure that psych has the ability to, as it were, read and access the kind of facts you might find, say, in Wikidata or stated in a Wikipedia article or something like that."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So what we're representing, the things that we need a small number of tens of millions of, are more like rules of thumb, rules of good guessing, things which are usually true and which help you to make sense of the facts that are sort of sitting off in some database or some other more static storage."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "So they're almost like platonic forms."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "So like when you read stuff on Wikipedia, that's going to be like projections of those ideas."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "You read an article about the fact that Elvis died, that's a projection of the idea that humans are mortal."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "And very few Wikipedia articles will write, humans are mortal."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "That's what I meant about ferreting out the unstated things in text."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "What are all the things that were assumed?"}, {"time": 1981, "text": "And so those are things like if you have a problem with something, turning it off and on often fixes it for reasons we don't really understand and we're not happy about."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "Or people can't be both alive and dead at the same time."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "Or water flows downhill."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "If you search online for water flowing uphill and water flowing downhill, you'll find more references for water flowing uphill because it's used as a kind of a metaphorical reference for some unlikely thing because of course, everyone already knows that water flows downhill."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So why would anyone bother saying that?"}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Do you have a word you prefer?"}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Because we said facts isn't the right word."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Is there a word like concepts?"}, {"time": 2026, "text": "I would say assertions."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "Assertions or rules?"}, {"time": 2026, "text": "Because I'm not talking about rigid rules, but rules of thumb."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "But assertions is a nice one that covers all of these things."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "As a programmer, to me, assert has a very dogmatic authoritarian feel to them."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "Oh, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "But assertions works."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "So if we go back to that room with Marvin Minsky with you, all these seminal figures, Ed Fagamon, thinking about this very philosophical, but also engineering question."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "We can also go back a couple of decades before then and thinking about artificial intelligence broadly when people were thinking about, you know, how do you create super intelligent systems, general intelligence."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "And I think people's intuition was off at the time."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "And I mean, this continues to be the case that we're not, when we're grappling with these exceptionally difficult ideas, we're not always, it's very difficult to truly understand ourselves when we're

and she's actually doing fine now."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "But when she was a baby, she was diagnosed as having meningitis and doctors wanted to do all these scary things."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "And my wife and I were very worried and we could not get a meaningful answer from her doctors about exactly why they believed this, what the alternatives were, and so on."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "And fortunately, a friend of mine, Ted Shortliffe, was another assistant professor in computer science at Stanford at the time."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "And he'd been building a program called MISON, which was a medical diagnosis program that happened to specialize in blood infections like meningitis."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "And so, he had privileges at Stanford Hospital because he was also an MD."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "And so, we got hold of her chart and we put in her case and it came up with exactly the same diagnoses and exactly the same therapy recommendations."}, {"time": 3929, "text": "But the difference was, because it was a knowledge based system, a rule based system, it was able to tell us step by step by step why this was the diagnosis and step by step why this was the best therapy and the best procedure to do for her and so on."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "And there was a real epiphany because that made all the difference in the world."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "Instead of blindly having to trust an authority, we were able to understand what was actually going on."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "And so, at that time, I realized that that really is what was missing in computer programs was that even if they got things right, because they didn't really understand the way the world works and why things are the way they are, they weren't able to give explanations of their answer."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "And it's one thing to use a machine learning system that says, I think you should get this operation and you say why and it says 0.83 and you say no, in more detail why and it says 0.831."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "That's not really very compelling and that's not really very helpful."}, {"time": 4000, "text": "There's this idea of the Semantic Web that when I first heard about, I just fell in love with the idea."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "It was the obvious next step for the internet."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "And maybe you can speak about what is the Semantic Web?"}, {"time": 4011, "text": "What are your thoughts about it?"}, {"time": 4011, "text": "How your vision and mission and goals with Psych are connected, integrated?"}, {"time": 4018, "text": "Are they dance partners?"}, {"time": 4018, "text": "Are they aligned?"}, {"time": 4025, "text": "What are your thoughts there?"}, {"time": 4025, "text": "So, think of the Semantic Web as a kind of knowledge graph and Google already has something they call knowledge graph, for example, which is sort of like a node and link diagram."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "So, you have these nodes that represent concepts or words or terms and then there are some arcs that connect them that might be labeled."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "And so, you might have a node with like one person that represents one person and let's say a husband link that then points to that person's husband."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "And so, there'd be then another link that went from that person labeled wife that went back to the first node and so on."}, {"time": 4070, "text": "So, having this kind of representation is really good if you want to represent binary relations, essentially relations between two things."}, {"time": 4088, "text": "So, if you have equivalent of like three word sentences, like Fred's wife is Wilma or something like that, you can represent that very nicely using these kinds of graph structures or using something like the Semantic Web and so on."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "But the problem is that very often what you want to be able to express takes a lot more than three words and a lot more than simple graph structures like that to represent."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "So, for instance, if you've read or seen Romeo and Juliet, I could say to you something like, remember when Juliet drank the potion that put her into a kind of suspended animation?"}, {"time": 4141, "text": "When Juliet drank that potion, what did she think that Romeo would think when he heard from someone that she was dead?"}, {"time": 4148, "text": "And you could basically understand what I'm saying."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "You could understand the question."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "You could probably remember the answer was, well, she thought that this friar would have gotten the message to Romeo saying that she was going to do this, but the friar didn't."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "So, you're able to represent and reason with these much, much, much more complicated expressions that go way, way beyond what simple three, as it were, three word or four word English sentences are, which is really what the Semantic Web can represent and really what Knowledge Graphs can represent."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "If you could step back for a second, because it's funny you went into specifics and maybe you can elaborate, but I was also referring to Semantic Web as the vision of converting data on the internet into something that's interpretable, understandable by machines."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "Oh, of course, at that level."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "So, I wish it'd say like, what is the Semantic Web?"}, {"time": 4209, "text": "I mean, you could say a lot of things, but it might not be obvious to a lot of people when they do a Google search that, just like you said, while there might be something that's called a Knowledge Graph, it really boils down to keyword search ranked by the quality estimate of the website, integrating previous human based Google searches and what they thought was useful."}, {"time": 4240, "text": "It's like some weird combination of surface level hacks that work exceptionally well, but they don't understand the full contents of the websites that they're searching."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "So, Google does not understand, to the degree we've been talking about the word understand, the contents of the Wikipedia pages as part of the search process, and the Semantic Web says, let's try to come up with a way for the computer to be able to truly understand the contents of those pages."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "So, let me first give you an anecdote, and then I'll answer your question."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "So, there's a search engine you've probably never heard of called Northern Light, and it went out of business, but the way it worked, it was a kind of vampiric search engine, and what it did was it didn't index the internet at all."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "All it did was it negotiated and got access to data from the big search engine companies about what query was typed in, and where the user ended up being happy, and actually then they type in a completely different query, unrelated query and so on."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "So, it just went from query to the webpage that seemed to satisfy them eventually, and that's all."}, {"time": 4328, "text": "So, it had actual no understanding of what was being typed in, it had no statistical data other than what I just mentioned, and it did a fantastic job."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "It did such a good job that the big search engine company said, oh, we're not going to sell you this data anymore."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "So, then it went out of business because it had no other way of taking users to where they would want to go and so on."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "And of course, the search engines are now using that kind of idea."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "So, let's go back to what you said about the Semantic Web."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "So, the dream Tim Berners Lee and others dream about the Semantic Web at a general level is, of course, exciting and powerful, and in a sense, the right dream to have, which is to replace the kind of statistically mapped linkages on the internet into something that's more meaningful and semantic and actually gets at the understanding of the content and so on."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "And eventually, if you say, well, how can we do that?"}, {"time": 4403, "text": "There's sort of a low road, which is what the knowledge graphs are doing and so on, which is to say, well, if we just use the simple binary relations, we can actually get some fraction of the way toward understanding and do something where in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king kind of thing."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "And so, being able to even just have a toe in the water in the right direction is fantastically powerful."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "And so, that's where a lot of people stop."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "But then you could say, well, what if we really wanted to represent and reason with the full meaning of what's there?"}, {"time": 4444, "text": "For instance, about Romeo and Juliet with the reasoning about what Juliet believes that Romeo will believe that Juliet believed and so on."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "Or if you look at the news, what President Biden believed that the leaders of the Taliban would believe about the leaders of Afghanistan if they blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "So, in order to represent complicated sentences like that, let alone reason with them, you need something which is logically much more expressive than these simple triples, than these simple knowledge graph type structures and so on."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "And that's why kicking and screaming, we were led from something like the semantic web representation, which is where we started in 1984 with frames and slots with those kinds of triples, triple store representation."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "We were led kicking and screaming to this more and more general logical language, this higher order logic."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "So, first, we were led to first order logic, and then second order, and then eventually higher order."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "So, you can represent things like modals like believes, desires, intends, expects, and so on, and nested ones."}, {"time": 4518, "text": "You can represent complicated kinds of negation."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "You can represent the process you're going through in trying to answer the question."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "So, you can say things like, oh, yeah, if you're trying to do this problem by integration by parts, and you recursively get a problem that solved by integration by parts, that's actually okay."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "But if that happens a third time, you're probably off on a wild goose chase or something like that."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "So, being able to talk about the problem solving process as you're going through the problem solving process is called reflection."}, {"time": 4558, "text": "And so, that's another... It's important to be able to represent that."}, {"time": 4567, "text": "You need to be able to represent all of these things because, in fact, people do represent them."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "They do talk about them."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "They do try and teach them to other people."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "You do have rules of thumb that key off of them and so on."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "If you can't represent it, then it's sort of like someone with a limited vocabulary who can't understand as easily what you're trying to tell them."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "And so, that's really why I think that the general dream, the original dream of Semantic Web is exactly right on."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "But the implementations that we've seen are sort of these toe in the water, little tiny baby steps in the right direction."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "You should just dive in."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "And if no one else is diving in, then yes, taking a baby step in the right direction is better than nothing."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "But it's not going to be sufficient to actually get you the realization of the Semantic Web dream, which is what we all want."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "From a flip side of that, I always wondered... I've built a bunch of websites just for fun, whatever."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "Or say I'm a Wikipedia contributor."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "Do you think there's a set of tools that I can help Psych interpret the website I create?"}, {"time": 4639, "text": "Like this, again, pushing onto the Semantic Web dream, is there something from the creator perspective that could be done?"}, {"time": 4648, "text": "And one of the things you said with Psych Orb and Psych that you're doing is the tooling side, making humans more powerful."}, {"time": 4661, "text": "But is there the other humans on the other side that create the knowledge?"}, {"time": 4661, "text": "Like, for example, you and I are having a two, three, whatever hour conversation now."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "Is there a way that I could convert this more, make it more accessible to Psych, to machines?"}, {"time": 4670, "text": "Do you think about that side of it?"}, {"time": 4676, "text": "I'd love to see exactly that kind of semi automated understanding of what people write and what people say."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "I think of it as a kind of footnoting almost."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "Almost like the way that when you run something in say Microsoft Word or some other document preparation system, Google Docs or something, you'll get underlining of questionable things that you might want to rethink."},

powered tools that read through what it is you said or have typed in and try to partially understand what you've said."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "And then you help them out."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "And then they put in little footnotes that will help other readers and they put in certain footnotes of the form, I'm not sure what you meant here."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "You either meant this or this or this, I bet."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "If you take a few seconds to disambiguate this for me, then I'll know and I'll have it correct for the next hundred people or the next hundred thousand people who come here."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "And if it doesn't take too much effort and you want people to understand your website content, not just be able to read it, but actually be able to have systems that reason with it, then yes, it will be worth your small amount of time to go back and make sure that the AI trying to understand it really did correctly understand it."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "And let's say you run a travel website or something like that and people are going to be coming to it because of searches they did looking for vacations or trips that had certain properties and might have been interesting to them for various reasons, things like that."}, {"time": 4812, "text": "And if you've explained what's going to happen on your trip, then a system will be

tiny factors like that may very well cause you to sign up for that trip rather than some competitor trip."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "And so there's a lot of benefit with SEO."}, {"time": 4874, "text":

universality of that kind of experience, if you look at educational software today, almost all of it has the computer playing the role of the teacher and the student plays the role of the student."},

what they're doing and try to give them good advice to get them to understand what they're doing wrong and so on."}, {"time": 5039, "text": "And the trick from the point of view of Psych is it has to make mistakes, it has to play the role of the student who makes mistakes, but it has to pick mistakes which are just at the fringe of what you actually understand and don't understand and so on."},

something because it used to make this mistake and now it doesn't and so on."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "So this tremendous reinforcement and engagement because of that and so on."}, {"time": 5089,

things."}, {"time": 5577, "text": "For example, in coming up with scenarios."}, {"time": 5577, "text": "So one of the applications that Psych does, one kind of application it does is to generate

level where you don't need to tease them apart further."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "So love is too general of a term."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "It's not useful."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "So when you get down to romantic love and sexual attraction, you get down to parental love, you get down to filial love, and you get down to love of doing some kind of activity or creating."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "So eventually, you get down to maybe 50 or 60 concepts, each of which is a kind of love."}, {"time": 5749, "text": "They're interrelated and then each one of them has idiosyncratic things about it."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "And you don't have to deal with love to get to that level of complexity, even something like in, X being in Y, meaning physically in Y."}, {"time": 5764, "text": "We may have one English word in to represent that, but it's useful to tease that apart because the way that the liquid is in the coffee cup is different from the way that the air is in the room, which is different from the way that I'm in my jacket, and so on."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "And so there are questions like, if I look at this coffee cup, well, I see the liquid."}, {"time": 5795, "text": "If I turn it upside down, will the liquid come out?"}, {"time": 5801, "text": "If I have, say, coffee with sugar in it, if I do the same thing, the sugar doesn't come out, right?"}, {"time": 5808, "text": "It stays in the liquid because it's dissolved in the liquid and so on."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "So by now, we have about 75 different kinds of in in the system and it's important to distinguish those."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "So if you're reading along an English text and you see the word in, the writer of that was able to use this one innocuous word because he or she was able to assume that the reader had enough common sense and world knowledge to disambiguate which of these 75 kinds of in they actually meant."}, {"time": 5843, "text": "And the same thing with love."},

{"time": 5855, "text": "So you have to be careful not to take language too seriously because people have done a kind of parsimony, a kind of terceness where you have as few words as you can because otherwise you'd need half a million words in your language, which is a lot of words."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "That's like 10 times more than most languages really make use of and so on."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "Just like we have on the order of about a million concepts in psych because we've had to tease apart all these things."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "And so when you look at the name of a psych term, most of the psych terms actually have three or four English words in a phrase which captures the meaning of this term because you have to distinguish all these types of love."}, {"time": 5909, "text": "You have to distinguish all these types of in and there's not a single English word which captures most of these things."}, {"time": 5915, "text": "And it seems like language when used for communication between humans almost as a feature has some ambiguity built in."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "It's not an accident because like the human condition is a giant mess."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "And so it feels like nobody wants two robots like very precise formal logic conversation on a first date."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "There's some dance of uncertainty of wit, of humor, of push and pull and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "If everything is made precise, then life is not worth living I think in terms of the human experience."}, {"time": 5950, "text":

so many fantastic PhDs, so many fantastic people who did great PhD theses."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "How did he think of all these great ideas?"}, {"time": 5980, "text": "What he said is he would generally say something that didn't exactly make sense."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "He didn't really know what it meant."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "But the student would figure like, oh my God, Minsky said this, it must be a great idea."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "And he'd swear he or she would work on work and work until they found some meaning in this sort of Chauncey Gardner like utterance that

distinctly made aware that the words I say have a long lasting impact."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "I will now start doing the Minsky method of saying something cryptically profound and then letting them actually make something useful and great out of that."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "You have to become revered enough that people will take as a default that everything you say is profound."},

like in the past."}, {"time": 6053, "text": "He has so many good one liners or also to work on things that nobody else is working on because he's not very good at doing stuff."}, {"time": 6064,

program."}, {"time": 6085, "text": "Are you familiar with this?"}, {"time": 6085, "text": "So this is back in the day when you had job control cards at the beginning of your IBM card deck that said things like how many CPU seconds to allow this to run before it got kicked off because computer time was enormously expensive."}, {"time": 6098, "text": "And so he wrote a program and all it did was it said, give me 30 seconds of CPU time."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "And all it did was it would wait like 20 seconds and then it would print out on the operator's console teletype, I need another 20 seconds."}, {"time": 6119, "text": "So the operator would give it another 20 seconds, it would wait, it says, I'm almost done, I need a little bit more time."}, {"time": 6124, "text": "So at the end he'd get this printout and he'd be charged for like 10 times as much computer time as his job control card."}, {"time": 6130, "text": "And he'd say, look, I put 10 seconds, 30 seconds here, you're charging me for five minutes, I'm not going to pay for this."}, {"time": 6135, "text": "And the poor operator would say, well, the program kept asking for more time and Marvin would say, oh, it always does that."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "If you could just linger on it for a little bit, is there something you've learned from your interaction with Marvin Minsky about artificial intelligence, about life?"}, {"time": 6158, "text": "But I mean, he's, again, like your work, his work is, you know, he's a seminal figure in this very short history of artificial intelligence research and development."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "What have you learned from him as a human being, as an AI intellect?"}, {"time": 6180, "text": "I would say both he and Ed Feigenbaum impressed on me the

different human opinion including contrasting opinion that's worth representing."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "So I think that's one reason."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "A, I don't think there was ever a time where I thought about quitting."}, {"time": 6444, "text": "There are times where I've become depressed a little bit about how hard it is to get funding for the system."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "Occasionally there are AI winters and things like that."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "Occasionally there are AI what you might call summers where people have said, why in the world didn't you sell your company to company X for some large amount of money when you had the opportunity and so on."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "Company X here are like old companies maybe you've never even heard of like Lycos or something like that."}, {"time": 6512, "text": "So five years ago almost all of our money came from the government."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Now virtually none of it comes from the government."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Almost all of it is from companies that are actually using it for something, hospital chains using it for medical reasoning about patients and energy companies using it and various other manufacturers using it to reason about supply chains and things like that."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "So there's so many questions I want to ask."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "So one of the ways that people can help is by adding to the knowledge base and that's really basically anybody if the tooling is right."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "And the other way, I kind of want to ask you about your thoughts on this."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "So you've had like you said in government and you had big clients, you had a lot of clients but most of it is shrouded in secrecy because of the nature of the relationship of the kind of things you're helping them with."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "So that's one way to operate and another way to operate is more in the open where it's more consumer facing."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "And so you know hence something like open cycle is born at some point or there's... No that's a misconception."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "Oh well this let's go there."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "So what is open cycle and how is it born?"}, {"time": 6589, "text": "Two things I want to say and I want to say each of them before the other so it's going to be difficult."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "But we'll come back to open cycle in a minute."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "But one of the terms of our contracts with all of our customers and partners is knowledge you have that is genuinely proprietary to you."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "We will respect that, we'll make sure that it's marked as proprietary to you in the psych knowledge base."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "No one other than you will be able to see it if you don't want them to and it won't be used in inferences other than for you and so on."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "However, any knowledge which is necessary in building any applications for you and with you which is publicly available general human knowledge is not going to be proprietary."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "It's going to just become part of the normal psych knowledge base and it will be openly available to everyone who has access to psych."}, {"time": 6642, "text": "So that's an important constraint that we never went back on even when we got pushback from companies which we often did who wanted to claim that almost everything they were telling us was proprietary."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "So there's a line between very domain specific company specific stuff and the general knowledge that comes from that."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "Yes or if you imagine say it's an oil company there are things which they would expect any new petroleum engineer they hired to already know and it's not okay for them to consider that that is proprietary and there sometimes a company will say well we're the first ones to pay you to represent that in psych and our attitude is some polite form tough."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "The deal is this take it or leave it and in a few cases they've left it and in most cases they'll see our point of view and take it because that's how we've built the psych system by essentially tacking with the funding wins where people would fund a project and half of it would be general knowledge that would stay permanently as part of psych."}, {"time": 6719, "text": "So always with these partnerships it's not like a distraction from the main psych development."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "It's a small distraction."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "It's a small but it's not a complete one so you're adding to the knowledge base."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "Yes absolutely and we try to stay away from projects that would not have that property."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "So let me go back and talk about open psych for a second."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "So I've had a lot of trouble expressing and convincing other AI researchers how important it is to use an expressive representation language like we do this higher order logic rather than just using some triple store knowledge graph type representation."}, {"time": 6761, "text": "And so as an attempt to show them why they needed something more we said oh well we'll represent this unimportant projection or shadow or subset of psych that just happens to be the simple binary relations, the relation argument one argument two triples and so on."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "And then you'll see how much more useful it is if you had the entire psych system."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "So it's all well and good to have the taxonomic relations between terms like person and night and sleep and bed and house and eyes and so on."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "But think about how much more useful it would be if you also had all the rules of thumb about those things like people sleep at night, they sleep lying down, they sleep with their eyes closed, they usually sleep in beds in our country, they sleep for hours at a time, they can be woken up, they don't like being woken up and so on and so on."}, {"time": 6835, "text": "So it's that massive amount of knowledge which is not part of open psych and we thought that all the researchers would then immediately say oh my god of course we need the other 90% that you're not giving us, let's partner and license psych so that we can use it in our research."}, {"time": 6855, "text": "But instead what people said is oh even the bit you've released is so much better than anything we had, we'll just make do with this."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "But there's two parts to open psych."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "So one is convincing people on the idea and the power of this general kind of representation of knowledge and the value that you hold in having acquired that knowledge and built it and continue to build it."}, {"time": 6902, "text": "And the other is the code base."}, {"time": 6902, "text": "This is the code side of it."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "So my sense of the code base that psych or psych is operating with, I mean it has the technical debt of the three decades plus right."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "This is the exact same problem that Google had to deal with with the early version of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 6923, "text": "It's still dealing with that."}, {"time": 6923, "text": "They had to basically break compatibility with the past several times and that's only over a period of a couple years."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "But they I think successfully opened up, it's very risky, very gutsy move to open up TensorFlow and then PyTorch on the Facebook side."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "And what you see is there's a magic place where you can find a community, where you could develop a community that builds on the system without taking away any of, not any, but most of the value."}, {"time": 6957, "text": "So most of the value that Google has is still a Google."}, {"time": 6965, "text": "Most of the value that Facebook has still Facebook even though some of this major machine learning tooling is released into the open."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "My question is not so much on the knowledge, which is also a big part of open psych, but all the different kinds of tooling."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "So there's the kind of, all the kinds of stuff you can do on the knowledge graph, knowledge base, whatever we call it."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "There's the inference engines."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "So there could be some, there probably are a bunch of proprietary stuff you want to kind of keep secret."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "And there's probably some stuff you can open up completely and then let the community build up enough community where they develop stuff on top of it."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "Yes, there will be those publications and academic work and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "And also the tooling of adding to the knowledge base, right?"}, {"time": 7011, "text": "Like developing, you know, there's incredible amount, like there's so many people that are just really good at this kind of stuff in the open source community."}, {"time": 7020, "text": "So my question for you is like, have you struggled with this kind of idea that you have so much value in your company already?"}, {"time": 7026, "text": "You've developed so many good things."}, {"time": 7026, "text": "You have clients that really value your relationships."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "And then there's this dormant giant open source community that as far as I know, you're not utilizing."}, {"time": 7037, "text": "There's so many things to say there, but there could be magic moments where the community builds up large enough to where the artificial intelligence field that is currently 99.9% machine learning is dominated by machine learning, has a face shift towards like, or at least in part towards more like what you might call symbolic AI."}, {"time": 7065, "text": "This whole place where psych is like at the center of, and then as you know, that requires a little bit leap of faith because you're now surfing and there'll be obviously competitors that will pop up and start making you nervous and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7079, "text": "So do you think about the space of open sourcing some parts and not others, how to leverage the community, all those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 7090, "text": "And I think you phrased it the right way, which is we're constantly struggling with the question of what to open source, what to make public, what to even publicly talk about."}, {"time": 7103, "text": "And there are enormous pluses and minuses to every alternative."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "And it's very much like negotiating a very treacherous path."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "Partly the analogy is like if you slip, you could make a fatal mistake, give away something which essentially kills you or fail to give away something which failing to give it away hurts you and so on."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "So it is a very tough, tough question."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "Usually what we have done with people who've approached us to collaborate on research is to say we will make available to you the entire knowledge base and executable copies of all of the code, but only very, very limited source code access if you have some idea for how you might improve something or work with us on something."}, {"time": 7169, "text": "So let me also get back to one of the very, very first things we talked about here, which was separating the question of how could you get a computer to do this at all versus how could you get a computer to do this efficiently enough in real time."}, {"time": 7190, "text": "And so one of the early lessons we learned was that we had to separate the epistemological problem of what should the system know, separate that from the heuristic problem of how can the system reason efficiently with what it knows."}, {"time": 7205, "text": "And so instead of trying to pick one representation language which was the sweet spot or the best tradeoff point between expressiveness of the language and efficiency of the language, if you had to pick one, knowledge graphs would probably be, associative triples would probably be about the best you could do."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "And that's why we started there."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "But after a few years, we realized that what we could do is we could split this and we could have one nice, clean, epistemological level language, which is this higher order logic, and we could have one or more grubby but efficient heuristic level modules that opportunistically would say, oh, I can make progress on what you're trying to do over here."}, {"time": 7260, "text": "I have a special method that will contribute a little bit toward a solution."}, {"time": 7265, "text": "Of course, some subset of that knowledge."}, {"time": 7269, "text": "So by now, we have over a thousand of these heuristic level modules, and they function as a kind of community of agents."}, {"time": 7274, "text": "And there's one of them, which is a general theorem prover."}, {"time": 7274, "text": "And in theory, that's the only one you need."}, {"time": 7280, "text": "But in practice, it always takes so long that you never want to call on it."}, {"time": 7289, "text": "You always want these other agents to very efficiently reason through it."}, {"time": 7289, "text": "It's sort of like if you're balancing a chemical equation."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "You could go back to first principles, but in fact, there are algorithms which are vastly more efficient."}, {"time": 7299, "text": "Or if you're trying to solve a quadratic equation, you could go back to first principles of mathematics."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "But it's much better to simply recognize that this is a quadratic equation and apply the binomial formula and snap, you get your answer right away and so on."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "So think of these as like a thousand little experts that are all looking at everything the site gets asked and looking at everything that every other little agent has contributed, almost like notes on a blackboard, notes on a whiteboard, and making additional notes when they think they can be helpful."}, {"time": 7339, "text": "And gradually, that community of agents gets an answer to your question, gets a solution to your problem."}, {"time": 7344, "text": "And if we ever come up in a domain application where Psych is getting the right answer but taking too long, then what we'll often do is talk to one of the human experts and say, here's the set of reasoning steps that Psych went through."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "You can see why it took it a long time to get the answer."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "How is it that you were able to answer that question in two seconds?"}, {"time": 7370, "text": "And occasionally, you'll get an expert who just says, well, I just know it."}, {"time": 7377, "text": "I just was able to do it or something."}, {"time": 7377, "text": "And then you don't talk to them anymore."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "But sometimes you'll get an expert who says, well, let me introspect on that."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "Yes, here is a special representation we use just for aqueous chemistry equations, or here's a special representation and a special technique, which we can now apply to things in this special representation and so on."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "And then you add that as the 1001st HL heuristic level module."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "And from then on, in any application, if it ever comes up again, it'll be able to contribute and so on."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "So that's pretty much one of the main ways in which Psych has recouped this loss deficiency."}, {"time": 7415, "text": "A second important way is meta reasoning."}, {"time": 7423, "text": "So you can speed things up by focusing on removing knowledge from the system till all it has left is minimal knowledge needed."}, {"time": 7432, "text": "But that's the wrong thing to do, right?"}, {"time": 7438, "text": "That would be like in a human extirpating part of their brain or something."}, {"time": 7438, "text": "That's really bad."}, {"time": 7442, "text": "So instead, what you want to do is give it meta level advice, tactical and strategic advice, that enables it to reason about what kind of knowledge is going to be relevant to this problem, what kind of tactics are going to be good to take in trying to attack this problem."}, {"time": 7455, "text": "When is it time to start trying to prove the negation of this thing, because I'm knocking myself out trying to prove it's true, and maybe it's false."}, {"time": 7466, "text": "And if I just spend a minute, I can see that it's false or something."}, {"time": 7470, "text": "So it's like dynamically pruning the graph to only like, based on the particular thing you're trying to infer."}, {"time": 7477, "text": "And so by now, we have about 150 of these sort of like breakthrough ideas that have led to dramatic speed ups in the inference process, where one of them was this ELHL split and lots of HL modules."}, {"time": 7493, "text": "Another one was using meta and meta level reasoning to reason about the reasoning that's going on and so on."}, {"time": 7499, "text": "And 150 breakthroughs may sound like a lot, but if you divide by 37 years, it's not as impressive."}, {"time": 7512, "text": "So there's these kind of heuristic modules that really help improve the inference."}, {"time": 7512, "text": "How hard, in general, is this?"}, {"time": 7521, "text": "Because you mentioned higher order logic."}, {"time": 7521, "text": "In the general theorem prover sense, it's intractable, very difficult problem."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "So how hard is this inference problem when we're not talking about if we let go of the perfect and focus on the good?"}, {"time": 7537, "text": "I would say it's half of the problem in the following empirical sense, which is over the years, about half of our effort, maybe 40% of our effort has been our team of inference programmers."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "And the other 50, 60% has been our ontologists or ontological engineers putting in knowledge."}, {"time": 7562, "text": "So our ontological engineers in most cases don't even know how to program."}, {"time": 7568, "text": "They have degrees in things like philosophy and so on."}, {"time": 7572, "text": "So it's almost like the..."}, {"time": 7572, "text": "I love to hang out with those people actually."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "Oh yes, it's wonderful."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "But it's very much like the Eloy and the Morlocks in H.G."}, {"time": 7582, "text": "Wells Time Machine."}, {"time": 7582, "text": "So you have the Eloy who only program in the epistemological higher order logic language."}, {"time": 7589, "text": "And then you have the Morlocks who are under the ground figuring out what the machinery is that will make this efficiently operate and so on."}, {"time": 7596, "text": "And so, you know, occasionally they'll toss messages back to each other and so on."}, {"time": 7603, "text": "But it really is almost this 50 50 split between finding clever ways to recoup efficiency when you have an expressive language and putting in the content of what the system needs to know."}, {"time": 7617, "text": "And yeah, both are fascinating."}, {"time": 7623, "text": "To some degree, the entirety of the system, as far as I understand, is written in various variants of Lisp."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "So my favorite program language is still Lisp."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "I don't program in it much anymore because, you know, the world has in majority of its system has moved on."}, {"time": 7637, "text": "Like everybody respects Lisp, but many of the systems are not written in Lisp anymore."}, {"time": 7644, "text": "But Syke, as far as I understand, maybe you can correct me, there's a bunch of Lisp in it."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "So it's based on Lisp code that we produced."}, {"time": 7657, "text": "Most of the programming is still going on in a dialect of Lisp."}, {"time": 7657, "text": "And then for efficiency reasons, that gets automatically translated into things like Java or C. Nowadays, it's almost all translated into Java because Java has gotten good enough that that's really all we need to do."}, {"time": 7678, "text": "So it's translated into Java, and then Java is compiled down to bytecode."}, {"time": 7683, "text": "Okay, so that's sort of that's a that that that's a, you know, it's a process that probably has to do with the fact that when Syke was originally written, and you build up a powerful system, like there is some technical depth you have to deal with, as is the case with most powerful systems that span years."}, {"time": 7702, "text": "Have you ever considered this, this would help me understand, because my perspective, so much of the value of everything you've done with Syke and Cycorp is the is the is the knowledge."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "Have you ever considered just like throwing away the code base and starting from scratch, not really throwing away, but sort of moving it to like throwing away that technical debt, starting with a more updated programming language?"}, {"time": 7733, "text": "Is that throwing away a lot of value or no?"}, {"time": 7739, "text": "How much of the value is in the silly software engineering aspect, and how much of the value is in the knowledge?"}, {"time": 7747, "text": "So development of programs in Lisp proceeds, I think, somewhere between a thousand and fifty thousand times faster than development in any of what you're calling modern or improved computer languages."}, {"time": 7770, "text": "Well, there's other functional languages like, you know, Clojure and all that."}, {"time": 7770, "text": "But I mean, I'm with you."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "I like Lisp."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "I just wonder how many great programmers there are."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "There's still like..."}, {"time": 7780, "text": "So it is true when a new inference programmer comes on board, they need to learn some of Lisp."}, {"time": 7788, "text": "And in fact, we have a subset of Lisp, which we call cleverly Sub L, which is really all they need to learn."}, {"time": 7795, "text": "And so the programming actually goes on in Sub L, not in full Lisp."}, {"time": 7795, "text": "And so it does not take programmers very long at all to learn Sub L. And that's something which can then be translated efficiently into Java."}, {"time": 7808, "text": "And for some of our programmers who are doing, say, user interface work, then they never have to even learn Sub L. They just have to learn APIs into the basic psych engine."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "So you're not necessarily feeling the burden of like, it's extremely efficient."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "That's not a problem to solve."}, {"time": 7831, "text": "The other thing is, remember that we're talking about hiring programmers to do inference, who are programmers interested in effectively automatic theorem proving."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "And so those are people already predisposed to representing things in logic and so on."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "And Lisp really was the programming language based on logic that John McCarthy and others who developed it basically took the formalisms that Alonzo Church and other philosophers, other logicians, had come up with and basically said, can we basically make a programming language which is effectively logic?"}, {"time": 7872, "text": "And so since we're talking about reasoning about expressions written in this epistemological language and we're doing operations which are effectively like theorem proving type operations and so on, there's a natural impedance match between Lisp and the knowledge, the way it's represented."}, {"time": 7896, "text": "So I guess you could say it's a perfectly logical language to use."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "Okay, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 7902, "text": "I'll even let you get away with that."}, {"time": 7906, "text": "Okay, thank you."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "So I'll probably use that in the future without credit."}, {"time": 7913, "text": "But no, I think the point is that the language you program in isn't really that important."}, {"time": 7921, "text": "It's more that you have to be able to think in terms of, for instance, creating new helpful HL modules and how they'll work with each other and looking at things that are taking a long time and coming up with new specialized data structures that will make this efficient."}, {"time": 7940, "text": "So let me just give you one very simple example, which is when you have a transitive relation like larger than, this is larger than that, which is larger than that, which is larger than that."}, {"time": 7950, "text": "So the first thing must be larger than the last thing."}, {"time": 7953, "text": "Whenever you have a transitive relation, if you're not careful, if I ask whether this thing over here is larger than the thing over here, I'll have to do some kind of graph walk or theorem proving that might involve like five or 10 or 20 or 30 steps."}, {"time": 7968, "text": "But if you store, redundantly store the transitive closure, the cleanly star of that transitive relation, now you have this big table."}, {"time": 7978, "text": "But you can always guarantee that in one single step, you can just look up whether this is larger than that."}, {"time": 7986, "text": "And so there are lots of cases where storage is cheap today."}, {"time": 7992, "text": "And so by having this extra redundant data structure, we can answer this commonly occurring type of question very, very efficiently."}, {"time": 8002, "text": "Let me give you one other analogy, analog of that, which is something we call rule macro predicates, which is we'll see this complicated rule and we'll notice that things very much like it syntactically come up again and again and again."}, {"time": 8021, "text": "So we'll create a whole brand new relation or predicate or function that captures that and takes maybe not two arguments, takes maybe three, four or five arguments and so on."}, {"time": 8034, "text": "And now we have effectively converted some complicated if then rule that might have to have inference done on it into some ground atomic formula, which is just the name of a relation and a few arguments and so on."}, {"time": 8053, "text": "And so converting commonly occurring types or schemas of rules into brand new predicates, brand new functions, turns out to enormously speed up the inference process."}, {"time": 8067, "text": "So now we've covered about four of the 150 good ideas I said."}, {"time": 8072, "text": "So that idea in particular is like a nice compression that turns out to be really useful."}, {"time": 8078, "text": "I mean, this whole thing is just fascinating from a philosophical."}, {"time": 8080, "text": "There's part of me, I mean, it makes me a little bit sad because your work is both from a computer science perspective fascinating and the inference engine from a epistemological philosophical aspect fascinating, but you know, it is also you're running a company and there's some stuff that has to remain private and it's sad."}, {"time": 8103, "text": "Well here's something that may make you feel better, a little bit better."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "We've formed a not for profit company called the Knowledge Axe Immunization Institute, NAX, KNAX."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "And I have this firm belief with a lot of empirical evidence to support it that the education that people get in high schools, in colleges, in graduate schools and so on is almost completely orthogonal to, almost completely irrelevant to how good they're going to be at coming up to speed in doing this kind of ontological engineering and writing these assertions and rules and so on in psych."}, {"time": 8149, "text": "And so very often we'll interview candidates who have their PhD in philosophy, who've taught logic for years and so on, and they're just awful."}, {"time": 8159, "text": "But the converse is true."}, {"time": 8160, "text": "So one of the best ontological engineers we ever had never graduated high school."}, {"time": 8200, "text": "And if we could do that, that would create an enormous number of relatively very high paying jobs for people who currently have no way out of some situation that they're locked into."}, {"time": 8215, "text": "So is there something you can put into words that describes somebody who would be great at ontological engineering?"}, {"time": 8223, "text": "So what characteristics about a person make them great at this task, this task of converting the messiness of human language and knowledge into formal logic?"}, {"time": 8237, "text": "This is very much like what Alan Turing had to do during World War II in trying to find people to bring to Bletchley Park, where he would publish in the London Times cryptic crossword puzzles along with some innocuous looking note, which essentially said, if you were able to solve this puzzle in less than 15 minutes, please call this phone number and so on."}, {"time": 8262, "text": "Or back when I was young, there was the practice of having matchbooks, where on the inside of the matchbook, there would be a, can you draw this?"}, {"time": 8274, "text": "You have a

whether you're going to be good or not?"}, {"time": 8286, "text": "So part of it has to do with being able to make and appreciate and react negatively appropriately to puns and other jokes."},

8305, "text": "Like puns?"}, {"time": 8307, "text": "Like dad jokes?"}, {"time": 8309, "text": "Well, maybe not dad jokes, but funny jokes."}, {"time": 8312, "text": "I think I'm applying to work at SACOR."}, {"time": 8316, "text": "Another is if you're able to introspect."}, {"time": 8318, "text": "So very often, we'll give someone a simple question and we'll say like, why is this?"}, {"time": 8328, "text": "And sometimes they'll just say, because it is, okay, that's a bad sign."}, {"time": 8333, "text": "But very often, they'll be able to introspect and so on."}, {"time": 8336, "text": "So one of the questions I often ask is I'll point to a sentence with a pronoun in it and I'll say, the referent of that pronoun is obviously this noun over here."}, {"time": 8347, "text": "How would you or I or an AI or a five year old, 10 year old child know that that pronoun refers to that noun over here?"}, {"time": 8358, "text": "And often the people who are going to be good at ontological engineering will give me some causal explanation or will refer to some things that are true in the world."}, {"time": 8370, "text": "So if you imagine a sentence like, the horse was led into the barn while its head was still wet."}, {"time": 8376, "text": "And so its head refers to the horse's head."}, {"time": 8378, "text": "But how do you know that?"}, {"time": 8380, "text": "And so some people will say, I just know it."}, {"time": 8382, "text": "Some people will say, well, the horse was the subject of the sentence."}, {"time": 8385, "text": "And I'll say, okay, well, what about the horse was led into the barn while its roof was still wet?"}, {"time": 8391, "text": "Now, its roof obviously refers to the barn."}, {"time": 8394, "text": "And so then they'll say, oh, well, that's because it's the closest noun."}, {"time": 8398, "text": "And so basically, if they try to give me answers which are based on syntax and grammar and so on, that's a really bad sign."}, {"time": 8407, "text": "But if they're able to say things like, well, horses have heads and barns don't and barns have roofs and horses don't, then that's a positive sign that they're going to be good at this because they can introspect on what's true in the world that leads you to know certain things."}, {"time": 8423, "text": "How fascinating is it that getting a Ph.D. makes you less capable to introspect deeply about this?"}, {"time": 8429, "text": "Oh, I wouldn't go that far."}, {"time": 8430, "text": "I'm not saying that it makes you less capable."}, {"time": 8432, "text": "Let's just say it's independent of how good people are."}, {"time": 8437, "text": "You're not saying that."}, {"time": 8438, "text": "I'm saying that."}, {"time": 8439, "text": "It's interesting that for a lot of people, Ph.D.s, sorry, philosophy aside, that sometimes education narrows your thinking versus expands it."}, {"time": 8453, "text": "And for certain when you're trying to do ontological engineering, which is essentially teach our future AI overlords how to reason deeply about this world and how to understand it, that requires that you think deeply about the world."}, {"time": 8468, "text": "So I'll tell you a sad story about mathcraft, which is why is that not widely used in schools today?"}, {"time": 8476, "text": "We're not really trying to make big profit on it or anything like that."}, {"time": 8480, "text": "When we've gone to schools, their attitude has been, well, if a student spends 20 hours going through this mathcraft program from start to end and so on, will it improve their score on this standardized test more than if they spent 20 hours just doing mindless drills of problem after problem after problem?"}, {"time": 8503, "text": "And the answer is, well, no, but it'll increase their understanding more."}, {"time": 8507, "text": "And their attitude is, well, if it doesn't increase their score on this test, then we're not going to adopt it."}, {"time": 8516, "text": "I mean, that's a whole another three, four hour conversation about the education system."}, {"time": 8521, "text": "But let me ask you, let me go super philosophical, as if we weren't already."}, {"time": 8526, "text": "So in 1950, Alan Turing wrote the paper that formulated the Turing test."}, {"time": 8532, "text": "And he opened the paper with the question, can machines think?"}, {"time": 8541, "text": "Machines can think, certainly as well as humans can think, right?"}, {"time": 8547, "text": "We're meat machines just because they're not currently made out of meat is just an engineering solution decision and so on."}, {"time": 8558, "text": "So of course machines can think."}, {"time": 8562, "text": "I think that there was a lot of damage done by people misunderstanding Turing's imitation game and focus on trying to get a chat bot to fool other people into thinking it was human and so on."}, {"time": 8586, "text": "That's not a terrible test in and of itself, but it shouldn't be your one and only test for intelligence."}, {"time": 8593, "text": "In terms of tests of intelligence, you know, with the Lobner Prize, which is a very kind of, you want to say a more strict formulation of the Turing test as originally formulated."}, {"time": 8605, "text": "And then there's something like Alexa Prize, which is more, I would say a more interesting formulation of the test, which is like, ultimately the metric is how long does a human want to talk to the AI system?"}, {"time": 8618, "text": "So it's like if the goal is you want it to be 20 minutes, it's basically not just have a convincing conversation, but more like a compelling one or a fun one or an interesting one."}, {"time": 8633, "text": "And that seems like more to the spirit maybe of what Turing was imagining."}, {"time": 8641, "text": "But what for you do you think in the space of tests is a good test?"}, {"time": 8646, "text": "When you see a system based on psych that passes that test, you'd be like, damn, we've created something special here."}, {"time": 8657, "text": "The test has to be something involving depth of reasoning and recursiveness of reasoning, the ability to answer repeated why questions about the answer you just gave."}, {"time": 8670, "text": "How many why questions in a row can you keep answering?"}, {"time": 8676, "text": "Just have like a young curious child and an AI system and how long will an AI system last before it wants to quit?"}, {"time": 8684, "text": "And again, that's not the only test."}, {"time": 8685, "text": "Another one has to do with argumentation."}, {"time": 8688, "text": "In other words, here's a proposition, come up with pro and con arguments for it and try and give me convincing arguments on both sides."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "And so that's another important kind of ability that the system needs to be able to exhibit in order to really be intelligent, I think."}, {"time": 8712, "text": "So there's certain, I mean, if you look at IBM Watson and like certain impressive accomplishments for very specific tests, almost like a demo, right?"}, {"time": 8724, "text": "There's some, like I talked to the guy who led the Jeopardy effort, and there's some kind of hard coding heuristics tricks that you try to pull it all together to make the thing work in the end for this thing, right?"}, {"time": 8743, "text": "That seems to be one of the lessons with AI is like, that's the fastest way to get a solution that's pretty damn impressive."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "So here's what I would say is that as impressive as that was, it made some mistakes, but more importantly, many of the mistakes it made were mistakes which no human would have made."}, {"time": 8767, "text": "And so part of the new or augmented Turing tests would have to be, and the mistakes you make are ones which humans don't basically look at and say, what?"}, {"time": 8784, "text": "So for example, there was a question about which 16th century Italian politician, blah, blah, blah, and Watson said Ronald Reagan."}, {"time": 8797, "text": "So most Americans would have gotten that question wrong, but they would never have said Ronald Reagan as an answer because among the things they know is that he lived relatively recently and people don't really live 400 years and things like that."}, {"time": 8813, "text": "So that's, I think, a very important thing, which is if it's making mistakes which no normal sane human would have made, then that's a really bad sign."}, {"time": 8825, "text": "And if it's not making those kinds of mistakes, then that's a good sign."}, {"time": 8830, "text": "And I don't think it's any one very, very simple test."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "I think it's all of the things you mentioned, all the things I mentioned is really a battery of tests, which together, if it passes almost all of these tests, it'd be hard to argue that it's not intelligent."}, {"time": 8845, "text": "And if it fails several of these tests, it's really hard to argue that it really understands what it's doing and that it really is generally intelligent."}, {"time": 8853, "text": "So to pass all of those tests, we've talked a lot about psych and knowledge and reasoning."}, {"time": 8860, "text": "Do you think this AI system would need to have some other human like elements, for example, a body or a physical manifestation in this world?"}, {"time": 8872, "text": "And another one which seems to be fundamental to the human experience is consciousness."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "The subjective experience of what it's like to actually be you."}, {"time": 8884, "text": "Do you think it needs those to be able to pass all of those tests and to achieve general intelligence?"}, {"time": 8890, "text": "I think in the case of a body, no, I know there are a lot of people like Penrose who would have disagreed with me and others, but no, I don't think it needs to have a body in order to be intelligent."}, {"time": 8904, "text": "I think that it needs to be able to talk about having a body and having sensations and having emotions and so on."}, {"time": 8913, "text": "It doesn't actually have to have all of that, but it has to understand it in the same way that Helen Keller was perfectly intelligent and able to talk about colors and sounds and shapes and so on, even though she didn't directly experience all the same things that the rest of us do."}, {"time": 8935, "text": "So knowledge of it and being able to correctly make use of that is certainly an important facility, but actually having a body, if you believe that that's just a kind of religious or mystical belief, you can't really argue for or against it, I suppose."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "It's just something that some people believe."}, {"time": 8959, "text": "What about an extension of the body, which is consciousness?"}, {"time": 8964, "text": "It feels like something to be here."}, {"time": 8968, "text": "But what does that really mean?"}, {"time": 8970, "text": "It's like, well, if I talk to you, you say things which make me believe that you're conscious."}, {"time": 8975, "text": "I know that I'm conscious, but you're just taking my word for it now."}, {"time": 9006, "text": "If we want to call that consciousness, then yes, psych is already conscious."}, {"time": 9011, "text": "But I don't think that I would ascribe anything mystical to that."}, {"time": 9015, "text": "Again, some people would, but I would say that other than our own personal experience of consciousness, we're just treating everyone else in the world, so to speak, at their word about being conscious."}, {"time": 9029, "text": "And so if a computer program, if an AI is able to exhibit all the same kinds of response as you would expect of a conscious entity, then doesn't it deserve the label of consciousness just as much?"}, {"time": 9047, "text": "So there's another burden that comes with this whole intelligence thing that humans got is the extinguishing of the light of consciousness, which is kind of realizing that we're going to be dead someday."}, {"time": 9062, "text": "And there's a bunch of philosophers like Ernest Becker, who kind of think that this realization of mortality, and then fear, sometimes they call it terror of mortality, is one of the creative forces behind human condition, like, it's the thing that drives us."}, {"time": 9084, "text": "Do you think it's important for an AI system?"}, {"time": 9087, "text": "You know, when Psych proposed that it's not human, and it's one of the moderators of his contents, you know, there's another question it could ask, which is like, it kind of knows that humans are mortal, am I mortal?"}, {"time": 9107, "text": "And I think one really important thing that's possible when you're conscious is to fear the extinguishing of that consciousness, the fear of mortality."}, {"time": 9119, "text": "Do you think that's useful for intelligence, thinking like, I might die, and I really don't want to die?"}, {"time": 9126, "text": "I think it may help some humans to be better people."}, {"time": 9132, "text": "It may help some humans to be more creative, and so on."}, {"time": 9136, "text": "I don't think it's necessary for AIs to believe that they have limited lifespans, and therefore they should make the most of their behavior."}, {"time": 9146, "text": "Maybe eventually the answer to that and my answer to that will change, but as of now I would say that that's almost like a frill or a side effect that is not, in fact, if you look at most humans, most humans ignore the fact that they're going to die most of the time."}, {"time": 9163, "text": "Well, but that's like, this goes to the white space between the words."}, {"time": 9169, "text": "So

Seio the way I do it because it never works."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "How do you have the fortitude and the guts to just go on with a throw that's not traditional, a variant that's not traditional?"}, {"time": 1021, "text": "If you think about it, you know, from a very basic like root of it, there's a philosophy and a mentality of Judo of how the throws work, right?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "There's a mechanical structure there of like, this makes sense."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "If I follow that principle, I can do anything I want."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "As long as we follow those core principles."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "So in the early days, even then, you were able to think on your own."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "Yeah, and I was able to develop a pattern for my foot placement based on my opponent's height."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Because the number one thing any Judo coach would tell you is you need your center of gravity below yours."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Well, now I know exactly where to put my feet because the shorter you are, the bigger the split because the lower I need to get."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "The taller you are, the less of a split I need."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Is there something you could say about fundamental principles of Judo?"}, {"time": 1077, "text": "Is there, over all that time, not over 20 years that you've been doing Judo, it's not approaching 30, is it?"}, {"time": 1086, "text": "Yeah, it's getting there."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "Okay, it's getting there."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "We're a couple years away, but it's getting there."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "Is there some like principles that have emerged?"}, {"time": 1097, "text": "Like you said, you have to have your center of gravity below theirs."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Is there other kind of, both on the gripping side, the footwork side, leverage, anything you can speak to?"}, {"time": 1108, "text": "There's some that have withstood like time, like you have to be able to get below their center of gravity because you have to be able to rotate them around their center of gravity."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And then the other one is, that was always a principle when I was growing up and I didn't change until later on in my career was, you have to be able to pull."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "You need to be able to pull to get them off balance."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "But when you think about that statement as a whole, it ended with, they have to be off balance."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "I don't need to pull to get you off balance."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "I just need you off balance."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "And when you think about it that way, it allows you to open up the doors to, what do I need to do to get you off balance?"}, {"time": 1151, "text": "I could push, pull, I could flinch, I could fake, and you could put yourself in your own off balance state."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "When you think about people who wrestle, if I fake shoot, it causes you to over lean forward, which means you're off balance."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "There's no pull, there's no push, there's no nothing."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "I just get a reaction that leaves the opportunity in the door open for an attack."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And that off balance could be very subtle?"}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Could be very subtle."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "And the better you get and the more skills you get, the less subtle it is."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "So we should also mention that there is something called forward throws, where you throw the person, they're gonna fly facing forward, they're gonna fly forward."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "And then a backward throw, they're gonna fly back."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "Yep, and then there's lateral, they actually go sideways over, like a cartwheel almost."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "Okay, so the forward throws, there's the one we've been talking about, which is Seinagi, and there's a bunch of different variants, Ippon, Marote, Seinagi."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "There's drop and there's standing versions of them."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And that all, I don't know if there's a way to summarize it, but that's like as clean as getting your center of gravity under theirs as it gets."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "And then the rest is just gripping variations."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "I guess it's all gripping variations on all of these throws, but."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "And then there is, in terms of forward throws, there's the other big one in competition is Uchimata, which is, I don't know, we can try to explain that one."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "But it ends up being where one, you're standing on just one of your feet, and the other one is up in the air."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "And I don't know if you would put in that same category, Harai Goshi, like those kinds of throws where you're kind of a little bit single footed."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "Yeah, so there's two footed techniques and then there's single footed, yeah."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "Oh, Goshi, where it's like you're doing a mix between the Uchimata and the Seinagi."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "It's a hug."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "You hug a person and then you turn your hips around such that you're now hugging facing the same direction."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "When it comes to forward throw, there's, regardless of the name of the throw or the gripping variation that you're using, the whole principle is how do I get this person to do a forward roll in midair and land on their back?"}, {"time": 1300, "text": "The more of a forward roll I can get, the bigger the score."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "If I get like a quarter of a turn where like you land on your side and you don't go over your back, it's a half score."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "But they all require me to get you to do that forward rolling action."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "So just if we think of one person, if they do this nice leap forward and they do a roll and their back nicely rolls over the ground, you're trying to do the exact same thing with you connected to them."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Well, and if it's nice and it's smooth, it's probably not a full score."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "It needs to have like somewhat of a violent impact."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "So if you think of a drop, say Nagi, if I'm moving too slow and you still roll over your shoulders and there's no direct impact, it's only a half score."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "They want the force."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "The force, the violence."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "So then in terms of backward throws, the traditional ones, there's stuff where you trip them from outside their body, like Osoto gari."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "It's a trip where you hook your leg onto their leg and you trip them, but your hook goes outside of their legs."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "And then there's the trips from inside their body."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "There's a one foot is called kuchi gari and then the other is ochi gari, it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "The most important thing is outside and inside."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "Inside and then there's like, I don't even know how you throw them sideways except foot sweeps."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And then there's the foot sweeps where you can sweep one of their legs from out of them or both their legs at the same time."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "And like we're talking about this kind of is when timed perfectly, it's effortless for everybody involved and the ending, like you said, is big, dramatic and violent."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "Is there other kind of, oh yeah."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "There's a sacrifice techniques."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "There's a bunch of them."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "And that ultimately the variations have to do with gripping, but you're basically you, the attacker fall onto your back, sticking your legs somewhere onto their body, which is like this fulcrum over which they fly and do that same kind of roll that you mentioned."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "You basically sacrifice your back to the mat in order to throw them into that circular pattern."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "So they hit their back."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "Sometimes we use a foot, sometimes we don't."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And so we should probably say, it's okay for you to go onto your back as long as you're clearly demonstrating control over the other person's body."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "You can't go to your back in the same direction that your opponent is trying to put you to your back."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "You have to go the other way or you have to initiate you going to your own back."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "Like clearly."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "And then there's all the counters which almost kind of have a whole group of their own, even though they have echoes of the same types of techniques, it seems like they're their own whole thing."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "Yeah, but they follow the same principles."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "It's just most counters."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "Like if you wanted to counter Ennuchi Mata, for example, you're trying to throw me in a somersault over my right shoulder."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "Therefore, I would counter you by throwing you over your left shoulder."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "It goes in the opposite shoulder direction, but in the same somersault idea."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "And there used to be, I already at this point, forget the years, but it might be before the 2012 Olympics where they banned, you used to be allowed to grab legs in the same way you do in wrestling."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So you have basically all the techniques you would have in wrestling available to you if you would like."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "It's just that some of the techniques in wrestling are not that effective for getting your opponent to their back."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "Wrestlers wanna take the other person down in any way possible and have control."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "Judo wants to take you down, like we said, in a big fashion where your back slams on the ground."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Yeah, it has to be to the back."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "A lot of wrestling takedowns happen because they get behind them and then they parterre out."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "Yeah, so, but Judo banned all touching of the legs, which is a very dramatic change at the sport."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "But after 2012."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "After, it was after 2012?"}, {"time": 1560, "text": "In 2012, so 2008, I fought the games and everything was free."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "In 2012, we could only touch the legs as a defensive action or in response to an attack."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "So I could try to throw you with a normal throw and then when you try to counter, I could grab your leg."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "So there had to be a secondary technique."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "And didn't, like, didn't they disqualify on a first offense?"}, {"time": 1589, "text": "First offense was a direct disqualification, which happened at the 2012 games to the 57 Brazilian who won in 16."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "She was DQed and I think the quarters."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And it was like, I wouldn't say it was blatant as much as I don't think the act changed the outcome of the match had they not disqualified her."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "So that's not that dramatic."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "And by the way, you say 57, that refers to weight divisions and that's in kilograms and kilograms is the measure of weight that the rest of the world uses and the United States does not."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "So, and there's, we should say the divisions for guys, I don't know what the 70, I don't know if the lower level, 60."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "60, 66, 73, 81, 90, 100 and heavyweight, which has no ceiling."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "No ceiling, as we'll talk about."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "It's an important distinction."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "Yeah, it is an important distinction."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "And you competed most of your career at 81 kilograms."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "All, you never did 73."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "I never did 73."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "Well, you had to cut big for 81 anyway, especially towards the end of my career, yeah."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "I overly grew into the division."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "What's, I'm trying to remember, is it about 180 pounds?"}, {"time": 1667, "text": "178.6, I think."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "And you have to weigh in with the gear."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "You're not allowed to wear anything except for your underwear, weigh in."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "Confusing digits, that's right, that's right, that's right."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "That's which is very nice."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "Okay, so we, would you say we covered most of the throws or no?"}, {"time": 1687, "text": "So there's the forward and the backward, there's the sacrifice throws and the counters."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And then there's the leg grabs."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "And we should say for the leg grabs that were effective, it's like the big pickups where you just kind of pick them up and try to figure out once they're in the air what the heck to do with their body to get them to the ground."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "You just kind of figure it out as you go."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "I think the really nice one that was to me heartbreaking as a fantasy go is I guess what's called a fireman's carry, which is, it does lead to judo like beautiful throws."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "And the fact that that was gone is, that one I missed a little bit, but then a bunch of people I guess came up with the variance where you don't need to grab the leg."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "It's definitely not as effective as being able to grab it, but I'm also on the side of the fence having competed in all three."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "It was definitely better for the sport to remove it as a whole."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "It's probably good to cover sort of the whole spectrum of rules of judo is there's groundwork."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "So you do all this stuff on the feet where you're trying to murder each other with a giant throw."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "But then if the throw doesn't succeed, you go to the ground and you stay in the ground for some amount of time, like short amount of time."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "You have to move quickly, you have to be attacking."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "And two of the ways you can win is similar to people who do jiu jitsu is you can submit them, chokes, arm breaks, all that kind of stuff, no footlocks."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And you can also pin them, which is get around their legs."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "And this is very, no, this is not like wrestling."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "You have to actually get around their legs and pin them in what in jiu jitsu is called side control mount, all kinds of ways that doesn't involve their legs."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "And then you pin them for like whatever, 20 seconds, 25 seconds."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "Yeah, 20 seconds now."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "I think the distinction is their back has to be facing the mat."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "You have to be past their legs and your chest has to be on the same plane as theirs."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "So it doesn't have to necessarily be on top, but it has to be on the same plane."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "And all of this is, I think different sports have different versions of this, but it's like an approximation of what dominance looks like."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "So pin and wrestling is dominating your opponent."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "Presumably if you were in a street fight, that position allows you to then do a lot of damage."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "Obviously submissions is dominance cause you're breaking their arm or choking them to unconscious."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And then obviously the throw, which is not often talked about, but like if you talk about a street fight situation, a throw is like the best way to murder somebody."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "Like this could end anyone's life."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "It's terrifying actually."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "So, okay, so these are all elements of dominance."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "So going back to set of principles, you were mentioning getting your center of mass under theirs, which I think applies for type of like the forward say Nagi throws, is there other stuff?"}, {"time": 1874, "text": "Oh, so you mentioned off balance."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "Yeah, there's the off balance one where you can either pull to get an off balance or you can give way to the force, which can also lead to an off balance."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "You can amplify somebody's force to, so for example, if you push me, you expect a certain reaction that you're ready for."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "But if you push me and I pull you, now you didn't expect that much force coming out of you."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "Therefore you're off balance."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "The thing that's distinctly recognizable about Judo is like when done at the highest level, like it seems effortless when the big throw happens."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "Like that's just, it doesn't, there is no other sport like it in the combat sports where it's like when the timing is right, everything just is perfect."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "I think you get that out of my mate and boxing sometimes when this is a perfect strike, just like, but it's not just like a hard hit."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "It's like, it's almost like with Conor McGregor and Aldo, for example, when you just catch him just right."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "Just right."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "You didn't look like you hit him that hard, but you hit him just right."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "And then you get to see this all the time in Judo."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "And so the beginning part of that is because there's a jacket, there's also this whole thing that you're a master of, which is like, which is gripping."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "So is there something you could say about, are there some fundamental principles of gripping that you can speak to?"}, {"time": 1970, "text": "Like what the hell is gripping?"}, {"time": 1972, "text": "Gripping is having the ability to hold your opponent in such a way where you have the ability to be offensive and also the ability to be defensive at the same given time."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And it's a distinction because I can hold you in such a way where I might be able to feel offensive, but if you can take a purely defensive grip and then I can't be offensive, we are no longer gripping."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "We are holding each other."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "And so like that would be the act of being able to grip is to be in a situation where you have me and I have you, and I can play both offense and defense at the same time where you can only play defense."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So Donaher talks about like Jiu Jitsu that way, and not that way, but maybe you can see if there's a distinction."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "So you have a set of weapons."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "The other person has a set of weapons."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "You wanna sort of maximize the use of your weapons and shut down the set of weapons that they have."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "Do you see gripping the same way on the feet?"}, {"time": 2037, "text": "I do if we wanna include body positioning with our gripping."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "Because I can give you any grip you want and you still can't throw me."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "Because I can put myself in a position that nullifies your ability to use those grips in a successful way."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And those, would you say the hips are critical to that or is it everything?"}, {"time": 2057, "text": "Hips, shoulders, chin position, head position, the angle of your foot."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "Yeah, where you lean."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "And so, and there's a bunch of places you can grip."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "Obviously, if people like kind of think of a jacket, like there's a bunch of places you can grip that are interesting."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So you can grip on the collar, you can grip on the sleeves, you can grip like the elbow joint."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "And then you could do those bad ass, like Eastern European, Georgian, over the back."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "Over the back, over the opposite sides of the heads."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "The Koreans that grab on one side around the head with their hands together."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "There's something really nice about just those, I mean, especially George just keeps throwing that hand."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "Just over the person and just, you're not actually gripping a belt or anything."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "You're gripping just the entirety of like, as opposed to being all nice and I'm gonna grab this part of the jacket, this part of the jacket."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "You're just like taking the whole fucking jacket and just launching somebody."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "For those people that can't picture judo, think about it in like, if you understood like what a boxing match looks like, and you thought about that as like traditional gripping, when you throw like a Russian grip over the back, that's more like a hockey fight."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "Like I'm just grabbing you and we're just gonna, we're gonna be throwing punches left and right."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "Cause when we have that grip, somebody has to get thrown."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "There's no, we don't walk around with this grip."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "It's go time once somebody throws it."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "To me, as a fan and sort of amateur practitioner, there's two styles of Olympic level judo."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "One is where you're trying not to get thrown."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "And the other is where you're trying to throw."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "More specifically, when you're trying not to get thrown, there's like the strategy that you're using gripping to nullify their offense and all those kinds of stuff here."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "You're being very clever and strategic and all that, maybe using conditioning."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "And then there's people who just like step in the pocket and they almost don't care if they're getting thrown cause they have the confidence that they're gonna throw first."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And those, like there's a clear distinction between the people that do one or the other."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "And I think both can be done extremely successfully at the highest level."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "It's just like, obviously you admire the people that step in the pocket."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "And I think when you look at the people who do judo the best, like if we wanna talk about like the top 10% of the people who would compete at the games, they do both."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "And they do both really well, but they favor one."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "Because if you look at a player like Lutepe Tilliani of Georgia, for example, there's a guy that stands in the pocket."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "But we can find numerous occasions where he's hustled some people for like a short period of time to get out of scenarios, to elongate the match, to make somebody tired."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "So you want both sides of the coin, but you better pick the one that 80% of your strategy is gonna be built around."}, {"time": 2247, "text": "Sorry for the romantic question, but I talked to Dan Gable and he always looked to the Russians as the artists in wrestling."}, {"time": 2257, "text": "And he always wanted to be an artist."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "But I think he's known for being that sort of guts, aggression, mental toughness guy, but he always was drawn to the artistry of wrestling."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "It's hard to know when you just watch you, because it looks like you're aggressive and you got the guts and the mental toughness, but there's also obviously a mastery of technique."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "Which would you lean towards in terms of what accounts for your success and just the way you approach judo?"}, {"time": 2285, "text": "Is it the guts, the aggression, the mental toughness, or is it the mastery of technique, the artistry?"}, {"time": 2295, "text": "Mine would be my aggressiveness if I'm gonna pick those two areas."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "But I think there's a third area in there that I would put myself in where I'm more of a strategist."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "I look at all of my opponents and all I ever see is their

be just flailing."}, {"time": 5967, "text": "Yep, one of my golden rules when I'm training and I get really tired, one of the like mantras I would always tell myself is I'm gonna put my back on your

their chest, like for people who are sort of more, like for example, for people like me, who are just like amateur Judo people, like there's all kinds of ways to prevent this turn from happening, the

it?"}, {"time": 6044, "text": "The trick is to get them to play defense to something that never happened."}, {"time": 6050, "text": "And then you go through like another way."}, {"time": 6052, "text":

work."}, {"time": 6063, "text": "So then this, you're celebrating here, it's a huge sort of, once a big accomplishments, big relief to qualify for the Olympics."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "And then you go into the Olympics and this is where I first saw Judo."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "And I kind of thought of them as the same as Judo and Jiu Jitsu."}, {"time": 6084, "text": "And I was really

right?"}, {"time": 6253, "text": "He must've been 24, 25, 26, world medalist, European champion at the time."}, {"time": 6262, "text": "And when he would grab me, I had that sense of feeling stuck."},

situation."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "So I was getting really aggravated because I couldn't generate any offense with every time I felt like I gained an advantage in the gripping scenario, he would take some obscure grip somewhere that was like, well, now I've got to go address this thing, give up what I gained and I have to go back."}, {"time": 6294, "text": "And if I were to think about

6345, "text": "This is not the guy that I've trained with that I expected."}, {"time": 6351, "text": "Cause it was a definite like level change in like his ability, strength, speed, and stamina."},

was, is there some kind of routine that he followed to like really level up in intensity for this particular event?"}, {"time": 6372, "text": "I've been told that he only gets to like his prime for like really big events."}, {"time": 6380, "text": "Like he doesn't train like year round like I would train, but when it comes to like the games, he doesn't do social media, he doesn't work, he lives,

think I ever fought, who was world number one."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "That avoided fighting me at the team tournament."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "But I mean, every single Olympics you've fought

your eyebrow."}, {"time": 7483, "text": "And so in judo, they don't, they're allergic to blood, probably for a good reason."}, {"time": 7487, "text": "But they, so now you have to try to figure out

play and mercy."}, {"time": 7588, "text": "Oh, this is great."}, {"time": 7590, "text": "Cause he wouldn't give me the sleeve and I needed an attack."}, {"time": 7593, "text": "And then I'm like, okay, I can't hold onto this forever cause that judge is going to see it."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "So let me just do a quick throw here while I'm using the fingers in the mercy grip."}, {"time":

us and he's like, hey, we're good, right?"}, {"time": 7653, "text": "Like, you guys aren't about to do what I think you're about to do."}, {"time": 7658, "text": "And he's like, hey, shake hands again."}, {"time": 7659, "text": "Cause the first time we did it, that wasn't good enough."}, {"time": 7661, "text": "Well, you gotta do it again."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "The heartbreaking part about this and why the IJF switched it to an unlimited golden score."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "Because we fought five minutes through the entire normal part of the match."}, {"time": 7677, "text":

him."}, {"time": 7764, "text": "I knew I was gonna have to."}, {"time": 7766, "text": "If I was gonna throw him or armbar him or pin him, whatever the case may be, it was gonna be his mental like, I'm just tired of this."}, {"time": 7777, "text": "He's too cagey of a player."}, {"time": 7778, "text": "He's too experienced."}, {"time": 7781, "text": "He has to mentally make that choice to give that inch."}, {"time": 7784, "text": "And then you just have to be ready to take it."}, {"time": 7787, "text": "So I was just waiting for it."}, {"time": 7790, "text": "And so now this is four minutes in, one minute left."}, {"time": 7794, "text": "Oh, is that in your game plan two potentials like sumi gaeshi, like the sacrifice throws to him?"}, {"time": 7801, "text": "Cause the whole point of that

he should have gotten Ashido there."}, {"time": 7816, "text": "Hands in the face."}, {"time": 7818, "text": "But again, that's just part of judo."}, {"time": 7821, "text": "He poked me in the

exchange, right?"}, {"time": 7856, "text": "Every time we grip up, every time we attack, sometimes it can take longer to get back to the line than the entire exchange."}, {"time": 7863, "text": "So the more aggression, the more exchanges you have, the longer the time stretches."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "Then here, the six seconds left in golden score, your tape is now yellow and red with sweat and blood, literally, and time is out."}, {"time": 7883, "text": "Now, what are you thinking here?"}, {"time": 7884, "text": "Do you think you won the match?"}, {"time": 7886, "text": "I thought I won the match a minute ago."}, {"time": 7890, "text": "I remember thinking to myself, like if this goes to the flags, I won."}, {"time": 7896, "text": "No doubt in my mind."}, {"time": 7899, "text": "Because I felt like the whole time, like I was going to him, right?"}, {"time": 7905, "text": "He was never coming at me."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "Yeah, that's the way it felt."}, {"time": 7909, "text": "And like, that's the way it felt body language wise, just the intensity, how fast you're moving towards him."}, {"time": 7915, "text": "You're constantly going for throws."}, {"time": 7920, "text": "Now, if you want to rewind that, we can talk about the whole, because it's a part of this clip."}, {"time": 7925, "text": "So wait a minute, they all went blue."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "They all did."}, {"time": 7929, "text": "So in judo, there's three referees, two on the side, one in the center, and they all vote on who won."}, {"time": 7934, "text": "And now let's pause it right there."}, {"time": 7936, "text": "Now, the way this is supposed to work, they raise their flags, they do like a one, two count, and then on three, they all raise it together."}, {"time": 7944, "text": "Now, as a little pretext to this entire match, up until this point, not one match at the Olympic Games has ever been a split decision."}, {"time": 7954, "text": "Meaning out of three people, not one of them voted against the other group members."}, {"time": 7961, "text": "So they were all unified blue or all unified white."}, {"time": 7966, "text": "Which is statistically difficult to imagine."}, {"time": 7970, "text": "It's almost like they had a referee meeting and said, it's better for the Olympics."}, {"time": 7975, "text": "To never have a split."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "So the question becomes, if you would click that frame by frame, right?"}, {"time": 7988, "text": "So right now we have all the refs with their flags out and then click that."}, {"time": 7992, "text": "So the middle guy starts."}, {"time": 7995, "text": "He is all the way up."}, {"time": 7997, "text": "All the way up."}, {"time": 7997, "text": "The other side judges haven't moved."}, {"time": 8000, "text": "We now have one side ref all the way up."}, {"time": 8003, "text": "Then we have a third side ref all the way up."}, {"time": 8009, "text": "So there's a time point when the middle guy has the flag all the way up."}, {"time": 8013, "text": "If not 80, 90% of the way there."}, {"time": 8016, "text": "Then the other one does."}, {"time": 8017, "text": "And then the third one goes."}, {"time": 8020, "text": "So now the question becomes who really, like did the outside refs really have an opinion?"}, {"time": 8027, "text": "Or were they told to wait for the center one to start and then lift whatever flag the center ref picked?"}, {"time": 8041, "text": "It's very, honestly, it's very possible that they had this meeting."}, {"time": 8045, "text": "This is the problem with the Olympics."},

blue."}, {"time": 8071, "text": "Like what do you think?"}, {"time": 8073, "text": "Do you think it's just a shitty call?"}, {"time": 8076, "text": "He has the right to pick."}, {"time": 8078, "text": "But the problem is the other two I don't think did."}, {"time": 8083, "text": "And so when you do this frame by frame again, I can see from my own perspective two of the refs."}, {"time": 8094, "text": "And I see them both blue."}, {"time": 8095, "text": "So when you fast forward that a little bit to get to all the flags, I see the two go blue."}, {"time": 8103, "text": "And I go, I look over and I look at the other guy and I'm like, really?"}, {"time": 8108, "text": "All three?"}, {"time": 8110, "text": "I fought for eight minutes and I can't even get a vote."}, {"time": 8113,

"text": "I mean, both people can't believe what happened."}, {"time": 8146, "text": "That's the, and like, honestly, I wish we had the rules that we do today, as far as the unlimited golden score,

{"time": 8164, "text": "He was kind of apologizing for the way the scores went."}, {"time": 8171, "text": "Cause he knows how badly you want it."}, {"time": 8173, "text": "He saw the match."},

actually like in a situation where nobody was watching me and I was free to just battle at my own will."}, {"time": 9070, "text": "Which is what it was about for me."}, {"time": 9072, "text": "And you just push yourself."}, {"time": 9074, "text": "Because I knew how to do that."}, {"time": 9075, "text": "I know how to push myself."}, {"time": 9077, "text": "Are you, when you're doing these 14

British strangle, when they're in that turtle position and you do that rolling motion."}, {"time": 10361, "text": "And here, when you go into that, you can fall off of him, like you said, if you're going for an arm bar, but here, literally, because you have it under the chin really well, there's just a nice control."}, {"time": 10373, "text": "And I've already planned on it being on his chin."},

that you mentioned."}, {"time": 11339, "text": "But like, I love going against 200, 220 that."}, {"time": 11343, "text": "Because in jiu jitsu, the weight doesn't get amplified in the sport."},

there's much more variety of games."}, {"time": 11380, "text": "The level is much higher."}, {"time": 11381, "text": "So you're taking on a bigger challenge, even if you're like, have a weight advantage."}, {"time": 11387, "text": "So those are all decisions you have to kind of make."}, {"time": 11389, "text": "And certainly in jiu jitsu, people that are weight cutting are silly."},

12272, "text": "But it's still above the elbow because you can see the bend, right?"}, {"time": 12276, "text": "And right here, see how he never put, back it up a little bit."}, {"time": 12281,

put his left foot down, it never touches the mat."}, {"time": 12295, "text": "But by putting his left foot back, it actually pulls Ungarvi's foot forward."}, {"time": 12299, "text": "And so he's able

the foot down to just continue."}, {"time": 12315, "text": "Cause he recognizes that feel in his hands."}, {"time": 12318, "text": "And so it's like, it never, it's a swing."}, {"time": 12320, "text":

through."}, {"time": 12328, "text": "So it's right there, he wants to take a step."}, {"time": 12330, "text": "And then he goes, nope, he's bringing that foot forward."}, {"time": 12332, "text": "I'm just going to go for it."}, {"time": 12334, "text": "Wait, is he full?"}, {"time": 12336, "text": "Full air."}, {"time": 12338, "text": "Boom, boom."}, {"time": 12339, "text": "And look at, if you go a few more steps forward right there, his hip is the same height as Ungarvi shoulder."}, {"time": 12348, "text": "Because he's leaning so far into the throw with his body weight."}, {"time": 12353,

about the sheer physics to like get your body into this position."}, {"time": 12367, "text": "Jimmy and I were so like, when we saw this for the first time, we tried to just stand like that and we couldn't do it."}, {"time": 12373, "text": "His left foot is pointing straight ahead."}, {"time": 12377, "text": "His chest is perpendicular to that foot or parallel with it, right?"}, {"time": 12381,

"text": "I think he's done this particular throw, not this style of it, but Uchi Mata so much that his body has adapted to be able to do this."}, {"time": 12397, "text": "So when people are trying to learn and like break down videos, they don't understand like the power he has and what we call end range motion."}, {"time": 12408, "text": "Yeah, look at that."}, {"time": 12409, "text": "So like look at the full range of motion he takes, right?"}, {"time": 12413, "text": "His left foot swings all the way around and the torso starts like at three oclock and it goes all the way around like almost back to the three oclock."}, {"time": 12425, "text": "Like, like what?"}, {"time": 12428, "text": "And he never lifts his leg above his hip."}, {"time": 12432, "text": "And the crazy part is he never fell over during any of it."}, {"time": 12437, "text": "Stayed on his feet."}, {"time": 12439, "text": "What's he doing?"}, {"time": 12439, "text": "Is that a matter of pride or just?"},

I've ever seen."}, {"time": 12455, "text": "There's so much wrong with it, but it worked."}, {"time": 12459, "text": "It worked."}, {"time": 12460, "text": "Because when you think about, remember what we talked about the very beginning, like he's got to get his center of gravity under his."}, {"time": 12465, "text": "Well, here's one of the top players in the world throwing another top player in the world with his hip at that guy's shoulder height and it's still working, it's."}, {"time": 12475, "text": "Okay, so he, this generation, he could be the great."}, {"time": 12479, "text": "And like he switched a lot of those details of the throw in the middle."}, {"time": 12483, "text": "In the middle."}, {"time": 12484, "text": "And that only is, that means he's probably what, like a hundred thousand times that throw has happened."}, {"time": 12491, "text": "I saw you were into chess recently."}, {"time": 12492, "text": "So you're like me, a bit of a beginner in chess."}, {"time": 12496,

the old guard and recognized that the party had to change and the whole system had to change to continue to compete."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "And so Afghanistan was one element of this."}, {"time":

backing and with Saudi backing, the opposition said, no, we're not going to reconcile, we're gonna push you off the cliff."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "And so that story goes on from at least 1987, the
