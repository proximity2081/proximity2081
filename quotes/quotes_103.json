Can you describe at a high level what are the different schools of economics, perhaps ones that are interesting to you, perhaps ones that the difference between which reveals something useful or insightful for our conversation."}, {"time": 554, "text": "So you know, you could neoclassical, post Keynesian, Austrian, like the biophysical economics and so on, other heterodox economic schools that you find interesting."}, {"time": 566, "text": "OK, I actually find interesting a school which went extinct about 250 years ago."}, {"time": 572, "text": "That's where I'd like to start from."}, {"time": 573, "text": "And they're called the Physiocrats."}, {"time": 575, "text": "And the name itself implies where the knowledge came from, because if you go back far enough in history, we didn't do autopsies."}, {"time": 583, "text": "But when you started doing autopsies, they found wires, they found tubes, etc., etc."}, {"time": 589, "text": "And they started seeing the body as a circulation system, and they applied the same sort of logic to the economy."}, {"time": 595, "text": "And they came out of an agricultural economy, which was France, and they saw that the wealth came effectively from the sun."}, {"time": 603, "text": "So their soil wealth comes from, like I said, the soil, but what they really mean is sun."}, {"time": 606, "text": "The soil absorbs the energy of the sun."},

natural economy."}, {"time": 617, "text": "That's where we should have stayed and developed from that forward."}, {"time": 620, "text": "We then went through the classical school of economics, which comes out of Adam Smith."}, {"time": 624, "text": "And Smith, coming from Scotland, looked at what the Physiocrats said, and what the Physiocrats argued was that agriculture is the source of all wealth, and the manufacturing sector is sterile."}, {"time": 637, "text": "That's literally the term they used to describe the manufacturing sector."}, {"time": 639, "text": "What does sterile mean?"}, {"time": 640, "text": "Sterile means you don't extract value."}, {"time": 643, "text": "You simply change the shape of value."}, {"time": 646, "text": "So the value comes from the soil."}, {"time": 649, "text": "Yeah, it comes from the soil."}, {"time": 651, "text": "That's the free gift of nature."}, {"time": 652, "text": "That's literally the phrase they used."}, {"time": 654, "text": "And we then distribute the free gift of nature around, and we need carriages, which was the manufacturing term they used at the time, as well as wheat."}, {"time": 664, "text": "So to make the carriages, we take what's been taken from the soil, and we convert it to a different form."}, {"time": 670, "text": "But there is no value added in manufacturing."}, {"time": 673, "text": "So Smith looked at that and said, well, I'm from Scotland."}, {"time": 676, "text": "And we've got these industries, and we make stuff, and it's machinery."}, {"time": 681, "text": "And he said, no, it's not land that gives us the source of value, it's labor."}, {"time": 686, "text": "Now, that led to the classical school of thought, and that said that all value comes from labor, that value is objective, so it's the amount of effort you put in, that the price two things will exchange for reflects the relative effort that's involved in the manufacturing."}, {"time": 702, "text": "So this computer takes two hours to make, and this bottle takes two minutes to make, then this is worth 60 times as much as that."}, {"time": 710, "text": "They didn't talk about marginal cost."}, {"time": 713, "text": "It was absolute cost, effectively."}, {"time": 715, "text": "They didn't talk about utility as a subjective thing, they ridiculed subjective utility theory."}, {"time": 721, "text": "That led to Marx, and Marx is probably the most brilliant mind in the history of economics."}, {"time": 727, "text": "The only other competitor I'd see is Schumpeter, possibly Keynes, but in my terms of ranking of intellects, it would be Marx, Schumpeter, Keynes, in terms of the outstanding capacities to think."}, {"time": 738, "text": "But Marx then turned that classical school, which was pro capitalism and anti feudal, into a critique of capitalism, which led to the neoclassical school coming along as a defense of capitalism."}, {"time": 751, "text": "But they defended it using the ideas of the subjective theory of value, so that value does not reflect effort, it's the satisfaction individuals get from different objects that determines their value, marginal utility."}, {"time": 765, "text": "It's the marginal cost that determines how much they sell for."}, {"time": 770, "text": "Capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility, and the concepts of equilibrium and marginal this and marginal that became the neoclassical school, and that's still the dominant school now 150 years later."}, {"time": 784, "text": "That's the one that everybody learns."}, {"time": 785, "text": "When you first learn economics, if you don't have the critical background that I managed to acquire, that's what you think is economics, the marginal utility, equilibrium oriented analysis of mainstream economics, and for example, they ignore money."}, {"time": 800, "text": "People think economists, you must be an expert on money because you're an economist."}, {"time": 803, "text": "Well, in fact, economists learn literally in the first few weeks at university that money is irrelevant."}, {"time": 809, "text": "They say money illusion."}, {"time": 811, "text": "They represent people's tastes using what they call indifference curves, and they're like isoquants on a weather map."}, {"time": 819, "text": "If you look at an isoquant, it shows you all the points of the same pressure."}, {"time": 823, "text": "So you can be here or you can be in Denver and the air pressure can be the same if you're in the same weather unit, so you just draw a cell that links together."}, {"time": 830, "text": "Well, they do the same thing with utility and say lots of bananas and very few coconuts can give you the same utility as lots of coconuts and very few bananas, and you draw basically like a hyperbola running down linking the two, and they'll say, well, that's your utility."}, {"time": 846, "text": "That describes your tastes, and then we have your income, and given your income, you can buy that many bananas completely or that many coconuts or a straight line combination of the two, and then if we double the nominal price of coconuts and double the nominal price of bananas and double your income, what happens, and the correct answer is, oh, nothing, sir."}, {"time": 867, "text": "You stay at the same point of tangency between what your budget is and which particular utility curve gives you the maximum satisfaction."}, {"time": 876, "text": "So that gets ingrained into them, and they think anybody who worries about money suffers from money illusion."}, {"time": 882, "text": "You are therefore ignorant of the deep insights of economics if you think money actually matters."}, {"time": 888, "text": "So you have an entire theory of economics which presumes we exchange through barter."}, {"time": 893, "text": "Like I'll swap you that Microsoft Surface for, actually, I'll take two of those for one of these."}, {"time": 899, "text": "We do this bartering type arrangement."}, {"time": 902, "text": "In fact, that only works if money plays no creative role in the economy, and that's where you find, reading Schumpeter, the insight that's the school of thought that I come from that says money is essential."}, {"time": 915, "text": "Money actually adds to demand, and we'll talk about that later on."}, {"time": 919, "text": "So that's the neoclassical school that ends up being subjective theory of value, nonmonetary, as though everything happens in barter, and focusing on equilibrium, as though everything happens in equilibrium, or if you get disturbed from equilibrium, you return back to it again."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And that mindset describes capitalism."}, {"time": 942, "text": "Its most interesting feature is that it reaches equilibrium."}, {"time": 946, "text": "Now what planet are we on to believe that?"}, {"time": 948, "text": "Because if you look at the real world, the real exciting world of capitalism in which we live, change is by far the most obvious characteristic of it."}, {"time": 959, "text": "There's no equilibrium."}, {"time": 961, "text": "It's unstable."}, {"time": 967, "text": "You work out what the Jacobian is."}, {"time": 970, "text": "You work out your Lyapunov exponents in a complex system."}, {"time": 973, "text": "You're used to the idea that equilibrium is unstable."}, {"time": 977, "text": "But economists get schooled into believing that everything happens in equilibrium, and they don't learn stability analysis."}, {"time": 983, "text": "So all that stuff is missing."}, {"time": 985, "text": "So onto the schools of thought, treating the economy as an equilibrium system, which was what the neoclassical school did, is what Keynes disturbed."}, {"time": 996, "text": "And he really disturbed it by talking about, fundamentally, that uncertainty determines our decisions about the future."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "So when we consume, you know if you like Pfizer or whatever particular drink we want to have, you know the current situation."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "But to invest, you must be making guesses about the future."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "But you don't know the future."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "You extrapolate what you currently know."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "And as you said, this is a terrible basis on which to plan for the future."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "But this is the only thing you can do where there is no possibility of solid calculation."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So investment is therefore subject to uncertainty, and therefore you will get volatility out of investment."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "You will get fads, of course, booms and slumps coming out of that, because people extrapolate for the current conditions."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "And that's the normal state of a capitalist economy."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "And Schumpeter argued that that's what gives it its creativity as well, the fact that you can perceive a potential demand, but first of all, you don't know whether that demand is going to work."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "Secondly, you don't know who your competitor is going to be, whether somebody is going to be ahead of you or behind."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "If there's a fad, you'll overinvest."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "All this stuff is the real nature of capitalism, and that's what we're trying to capture, the dynamic nonequilibrium monetary violence and creativity of capitalism."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "That's what we should be analyzing."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "And the post Keynesian school has gone in that orientation."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "They've been, in my opinion, inhibited by learning their mathematics from neoclassical economists, so they don't have enough of the technology of complex systems."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "There's only a really tiny handful of people working in complex systems analysis in post Keynesian economics, but that is, to me, the most interesting area."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "So their tools may be lacking, but they fundamentally accept the instability of things."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "So let me try to summarize what you said, and then you say how stupid I am."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "So then there was the physiocrats that thought value came from the land."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "Then there's Adam Smith, who said, nah, value comes from human labor."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "That was the classical school."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "And then neoclassical is value comes from bananas and coconuts, human preferences, like human happiness, how happy a banana makes you."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "And then the Keynesian and the post Keynesian were like, yeah, well, you can't, you can never, the moment you try to put value to a banana and a coconut, you're already working in the past."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "It's always going to be chaos and stability."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "And then you just, you're fishing in uncertain waters, and that's why we have to embrace that and come up with tools that model that well."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "And also Joseph Schumpeter, what school would you put him under?"}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Is he a Keynesian or is he Austrian economics?"}, {"time": 1181, "text": "He's an Austrian."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "The Austrians deny."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "That's the intriguing."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "He's from Austria, but he's not an Austrian economist."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "There are elements of the Austrian school of thought, which are worthwhile."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "What is Austrian economics in this beautiful whirlwind picture that you painted?"}, {"time": 1200, "text": "Austrian economics grew out of the rebellion against the classical school."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So you had three intellects who mainly led the growth of the neoclassical school back in the 1870s."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "It was William Jevons from England, Menger, who's from Austria, and Vollras from France."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "And Vollras tried to work out a set of equations to describe a multiproduct economy where there's numerous producers and numerous consumers."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "Everybody's both a producer and a consumer, and you try to work out a vector of prices that will give you equilibrium in all markets instantaneously."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And that's his equilibrium orientation."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "Jevons is also one about equilibrium, but he worked more at the aggregate level."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "So there's a supply curve and a demand curve, and that's what Marshall ultimately codified."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "Menger was pretty much saying that, well, yes, there might be an equilibrium, but you're going to get disturbed from it all the time."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "You'll be above or below the equilibrium."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "And what came out of the Austrian school was an acceptance of that sort of vision that a market should reach equilibrium, but then said, well, you'll get disturbed away from the equilibrium."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "And that's what gives you the vitality of capitalism, because an entrepreneur will see an arbitrage advantage and try to close that gap, and that will give you innovation over time."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "And Schumpeter went beyond that and saw the role of money and said that an entrepreneur is somebody with a great idea and no money."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "So to become a capitalist, you've got to get money."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "And therefore, you've got to approach the finance sector to get the money, and the finance sector creates money and also creates a debt for the entrepreneur."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "And so you get this financial engine turning up as well, and you will get movements away from equilibrium out of that."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "You won't necessarily head back towards the equilibrium."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "So Schumpeter has a rich vision of capitalism in which money plays an essential role, in which you will be disturbed from equilibrium all the time."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "And that is really, I think, a much closer vision of actual capitalism than anything by even the leading Austrians, Hayek, et cetera, et cetera, and certainly Rombardo, I find totally like reading a cardboard cutout version of The Wealth of Nations."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "I find his work trivial."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "But Schumpeter was rich, but with the same foundations as the Austrians."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "But because he talked about the importance of money that took him away from the Austrian vision, which is very much based on a hard money idea of capitalism, Schumpeter said you needed the capacity of the financial sector to create money to empower entrepreneurs."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "And that's a very important vision."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "So Schumpeter's argument is the deviation from equilibrium, that's where all the fun happens."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "That's where all the magic happens."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "That's the magic of capitalism."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "And like the Austrians, because they focus on the deviation from equilibrium, they're better than their classicals, but they still have this belief in the, you'll reach equilibrium ultimately or you'll head back towards it, whereas they don't have an explanation of capitalism that gives you cycles apart from having the wrong rate of interest."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "So there's no role for an accumulation of debt over time."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "So what Schumpeter gave us was a vision of the creativity of capitalism being driven by entrepreneurs who are funded by money creation by the finance sector."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "And that's fundamentally the world in which we live."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "So there's also the kids these days are all into modern monetary theory, what's that about?"}, {"time": 1418, "text": "Modern monetary theory is accounting."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "I want to summarize it bluntly."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "It's simply saying let's do the accounting because what money is, is a creature of double entry bookkeeping."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "What's double entry bookkeeping?"}, {"time": 1430, "text": "This was invented back in the 1500s in Italy."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "I've forgotten the particular merchant who did it based on some Arabic ideas as well."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "But the thing is, if you want to keep track of your financial flows, then you divide all the financial claims on you."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "You divide into claims you have on somebody else, which are your assets, claims somebody else has on you, which are your liabilities, and the gap between the two is your equity."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "So you record every transaction twice on one row."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "So for example, if you and I do a financial transfer, you have a bank account, I have a bank account, your bank account will go down, mine goes up."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "And that's the sum of the operation is zero."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "But on the other hand, if I go to a bank and borrow money, then my account goes up, they put money in my deposit account, the bank's assets go up."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "And there's still the same sum applies, assets minus liabilities minus equity equals zero."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "Now that's simply saying money is an accounting, a creature of accounting."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "It's not a creature of a commodity."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "So if you think about how Austrians think about money, and how gold bugs think about money and Bitcoin enthusiasts, if there are any left, think about money, what they see is money is an object."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And you and I can both have more gold, if we're both willing to go to this mine somewhere and dig a few holes and get a few specks of gold out."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "So there's no competition or no interaction between you and me if money is gold."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "And they think money should be an object, a commodity."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "But money fundamentally is not a commodity."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "It's a claim on somebody else."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "That's money's essence."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "So when you do it, you must use double entry bookkeeping to do it."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "And then when you do, you find all the answers that come out of thinking of money as a commodity are wrong."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "So for example, and I've got Elon on this one."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "So I want to get this with Elon because I saw him making a comment about this a few weeks ago on Twitter."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "He said that it's wrong for the government, effectively it seems wrong for the government to always be in deficit."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "Now, when you look at it and say, well, how is money created?"}, {"time": 1554, "text": "How does money come about when it's not a commodity like gold, which you dig up out of the ground, when it's actually social relations between people that create money?"}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Well, money is the fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "If we make a transfer between us, your deposit account goes down, my deposit account goes up."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "Deposit exchange is on the liability side of the banking sector."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "But if we have a transaction with a bank, then if the bank lends us money, as its loans go up, its deposits go up, again, that same balance."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "So you've got to look and say, money therefore is fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "So how do you create additional liabilities?"}, {"time": 1600, "text": "You must have an operation which occurs both on the liability side and the asset side of the banking sector."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "So if you and I make a new transaction, no money is created."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "Existing money is redistributed."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "But if you go to a bank and take out a bank loan, then money is created by the bank loan."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "So the liabilities of the banking sector rise, the assets rise, they're balanced, but more liabilities of the banking sector means more money."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "So that's how private banks create money."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "And that's what I first started working on when I became an academic about 35 years ago, the actual dynamics of private money creation."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "But the government has the same sort of story."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "If the government runs a deficit, it spends more money on the individuals in the economy than it taxes them, which means their bank accounts increase."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "So a government deficit creates money for the private sector."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "So that's where money creation occurs from the government."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "So it puts more money into people's bank accounts by spending, by welfare payments than it takes out by taxation."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "So that's creating new money."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And then on the other side on the bank, the money turns up in the reserve accounts of the banks, which are basically the private bank's bank accounts at the central bank."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "So rather than the asset of private money creation being loans, the asset of government money creation is reserves."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "So you mentioned a bunch of stuff like private money creation with the liabilities in

Marx."}, {"time": 9384, "text": "And what Marx had argued in chapter 25, I think, of volume one of Capital, section three, he built a verbal model of a cyclical system."}, {"time": 9399, "text": "And it's quite out of character with the rest of the book."}, {"time": 9401, "text": "So when you read volume one of Capital, people think Marx has got a commodity view of money."}, {"time": 9407, "text": "He doesn't at all."}, {"time": 9410, "text": "The idea was he had like an onion, you start off on the middle level and you ignore the outer layer, then you bring the outer layer and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 9416, "text": "Anyway, in this model, in volume one of Capital, he normally just assumed work has got a subsistence wage."}, {"time": 9423, "text": "In this little chapter, he said that if the economy is, effectively he said, the economy is booming, then workers will demand wage rises."}, {"time": 9434, "text": "And the wage rises will cut into the profit so that capitalists will not get the level of profit they're expecting."}, {"time": 9440, "text": "Therefore they will invest less and the economy will slump."}, {"time": 9443, "text": "And the slump will mean workers become unemployed and have to accept wage cuts."}, {"time": 9448, "text": "And it was a model of a cyclical economy."}, {"time": 9451, "text": "And as it happens, Marx spent his later years trying to learn enough calculus to be able to model it himself mathematically."}, {"time": 9457, "text": "And he never managed."}, {"time": 9458, "text": "There's Marx's mathematical notes on calculus, which are quite fun to read if you have a mathematical background."}, {"time": 9463, "text": "Did he get far?"}, {"time": 9467, "text": "He got too caught up in the whole philosophy and never really got to build the model."}, {"time": 9470, "text": "But what Goodman realized was a predator prey model."}, {"time": 9475, "text": "The Locta Volterra model was the basis of the idea."}, {"time": 9477, "text": "So the idea is you have a prey, and the example that Locta actually used initially was grass."}, {"time": 9487, "text": "Grass is the prey."}, {"time": 9488, "text": "And then you have a predator, and the predator were cows."}, {"time": 9492, "text": "So you start off with a very few cows, lots of grass."}, {"time": 9495, "text": "And then because of lots of grass, the numbers of cows grow."}, {"time": 9499, "text": "And then because the cows grow, they start to eat the grass."}, {"time": 9501, "text": "So the grass runs out, so the cows starve, and you get a cycle."}, {"time": 9505, "text": "And what Locta was amazed by was that the cycles were persistent."}, {"time": 9508, "text": "They didn't die out."}, {"time": 9510, "text": "So Goodman got that vision, and he then built a predator prey model."}, {"time": 9513, "text": "And I, first of all, read Goodman and really found it really hard to follow his writing."}, {"time": 9517, "text": "He's not a very good writer,

9529, "text": "And I read that."}, {"time": 9530, "text": "It was superb, and he said a way he could extend this was to include finance."}, {"time": 9535, "text": "So I thought, okay, what I'm going to have is that what Goodman presumed is capitalists invest all their profits."}, {"time": 9542, "text": "So you get a boom when there's a high rate of profit because they invest all that money, and then a slump when there's low profit because depreciation will wipe away capital and you'll go boom and slump."}, {"time": 9554, "text": "So I simply added in, well, capitalists will invest more than their profits during a boom, but less than their profits during a slump."}, {"time": 9563, "text": "And that therefore means they had to borrow money to finance the gap and pay interest on the debt."}, {"time": 9568, "text": "So I ended up with a model with just three systems states, the income share, the wages distribution of income between workers, capitalists, and bankers, the level of employment, and the level of private debt."}, {"time": 9580, "text": "And those three equations are fundamentally like going from the Locke to Volterra model with just two equations, and therefore you get a fixed cycle, to the Lorenz model where you have three."}, {"time": 9591, "text": "And therefore what I got out of it was a chaotic outcome."}, {"time": 9594, "text": "So what you're seeing is a manifestation of chaos, complexity in those plots."}, {"time": 9600, "text": "But one of the many fascinating parts about it was that as the level of private debt rose, in my model I had capitalists being the only ones who borrowed, but the people who paid for the high level of private debt were the workers."}, {"time": 9617, "text": "The rising banker's share corresponded exactly to a falling worker's share."}, {"time": 9622, "text": "So you can infer from that that the workers are the ones paying."}, {"time": 9626, "text": "Effectively, the workers end up paying for it."}, {"time": 9628, "text": "They get a lower level of wages."}, {"time": 9630, "text": "And the basic dynamic is that capitalists, when you have a three social class system, your income goes between workers, capitalists, and bankers."}, {"time": 9638, "text": "Now in the system, the good one did, they're just workers and capitalists."}, {"time": 9641, "text": "So if workers share rose, capitalists share had to fall."}, {"time": 9645, "text": "But when you have three social classes, then capitalists share can remain constant while workers fall and bankers rise."}, {"time": 9653, "text": "So that's what actually happened."}, {"time": 9655, "text": "Because capitalists, the simple way I modeled it was there's a certain rate of profit at which capitalists invest all their profits."}, {"time": 9662, "text": "Above that they borrow more, below that they pay off debt."}, {"time": 9665, "text": "So what would happen is when you got back to that point, then the level of investment would be a precise share of GDP."}, {"time": 9673, "text": "And therefore you'd get a precise rate of economic growth."}, {"time": 9675, "text": "But if there was a higher percentage going to bankers and offset by a lower share going to workers, it didn't affect the capitalists."}, {"time": 9683, "text": "So what you get is the cycles sort of diminish for a while because there's the income distribution effect is important."}, {"time": 9692, "text": "So the workers pay for the increasing level of debt."}, {"time": 9697, "text": "But the other side of it was that the cycles would diminish for a while."}, {"time": 9700, "text": "Now what you get is a period of diminishing cycles, then leading to rising cycles."}, {"time": 9705, "text": "And technically this is known as the Pomeranville route to chaos, and it's one particular element of Lorenzo's equations of fluid dynamics."}, {"time": 9717, "text": "So what they found was in examining laminar flow in a fluid, you have a period where the laminar flow got more laminar, and then suddenly it'd start to get less laminar and go turbulent."}, {"time": 9729, "text": "And this is what actually goes on in the model, so in my model of Minsky."}, {"time": 9734, "text": "So what you have is a period where there's big berms and cycles, and then as the debt level rises, the berms and slumps get smaller."}, {"time": 9743, "text": "And that looks like what neoclassical economists call the Great Moderation."}, {"time": 9748, "text": "So when I first modeled this in 1982, I finished up my paper, which was published in 95, with what I thought was a nice rhetorical flourish, saying the chaotic dynamics of this paper should warn us against regarding a period of relative stability in a capitalist economy as anything more than a lull before the storm."}, {"time": 9765, "text": "Now I thought it was a great speed of rhetoric, I didn't think it was going to fucking happen."}, {"time": 9770, "text": "But it did, because you had this period from 1990 through to 2007 where there were diminishing cycles, and the neoclassicals labeled that the Great Moderation, and they took the credit for it."}, {"time": 9781, "text": "They thought that the economy was being managed by them to a lower rate of inflation, a lower level of unemployment, less instability over time, and they literally took credit for it."}, {"time": 9791, "text":

because I wrote Debunking Economics, and I got involved in a fight over the modeling of competition in neoclassical theory that took me away for about four or five years."}, {"time": 9811, "text": "And then I got asked to do a court case in 2005, end of 2005, and I used Minsky as my framework for arguing that somebody who was involved in predatory lending should be able to get out of the debt they were in."}, {"time": 9827, "text": "And I explained Minsky's theory, and I used this throwaway line of saying debt levels of private debt have been rising exponentially."}, {"time": 9835, "text": "And then I thought, well, I can't, as an expert, just make a claim like that."}, {"time": 9839, "text": "I've got to check the data."}, {"time": 9841, "text": "And the debt ratio was rising exponentially, and I thought, holy shit, we're in for a financial crisis, and somebody has to warn about it, and at least in Australia, I was that somebody."}, {"time": 9850, "text": "So can you, given this chaotic dynamics idea, can you talk about the crises ahead of us in the future?"}, {"time": 9857, "text": "So one of the things, I mean, it's a fundamental question of economics."},

yeah, and then you can, you know, watch years fly by, and some of the predictions in retrospect that you make turn out to be true, but, you know, all kinds of gurus throughout history have done that
