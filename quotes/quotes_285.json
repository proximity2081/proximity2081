when you actually had these two nations connecting."}, {"time": 362, "text": "Uh, in orbit."}, {"time": 363, "text": "And so, yeah, there are great moments where something beautiful and wonderful and amazing happens, you know, but it's just, there are fewer of, that's why, that's why as much as I can't imagine proposing to somebody at a sporting event, when you have like 30,000 people waiting and you know, like she says, yes, it's pretty exciting."}, {"time": 383, "text": "So I think that we shouldn't, we shouldn't discount that."}, {"time": 387, "text": "So how bad do you think it's going to get in terms of, um, of the global suffering that we're going to experience with this, with this crisis?"}, {"time": 398, "text": "I can't figure this one out."}, {"time": 400, "text": "I'm just not smart enough."}, {"time": 401, "text": "Something is going weirdly wrong."}, {"time": 403, "text": "They're almost like two separate storylines."}, {"time": 406, "text": "We in one storyline, we aren't taking things nearly seriously enough."}, {"time": 412, "text": "We see people using food packaging lids as masks who are doctors or nurses."}, {"time": 419, "text": "Um, we hear horrible stories about people dying needlessly due to triage."}, {"time": 425, "text": "And that's a very terrifying story."}, {"time": 429, "text": "On the other hand, there's this other story, which says there are tons of ventilators someplace."}, {"time": 435, "text": "We've got lots of masks, but they haven't been released."}, {"time": 438, "text": "We've got hospital ships where none of the beds are being used."}, {"time": 442, "text": "And it's very confusing to me that somehow these two stories give me the feeling that they both must be true simultaneously, and they can't both be true in any kind of standard way, whether I don't know whether it's just that I'm dumb, but I can't get one or the other story to quiet down."}, {"time": 460, "text": "So I think weirdly, this is much more serious than we had understood it."}, {"time": 464, "text": "And it's not nearly as serious as some people are making it out to be at the same time and that we're not being given the tools to actually understand, Oh, here's how to interpret the data, or here's the issue with the personal protective equipment is actually a jurisdictional battle or a question of who pays for it rather than a question of whether it's present or absent."}, {"time": 486, "text": "I don't understand the details of it, but something is wildly off in our ability to understand where we are."}, {"time": 491, "text": "So that's, that's policy that's institutions."}, {"time": 494, "text": "What about, do you think about the quiet suffering of millions of people that have lost their job?"}, {"time": 501, "text": "Is this a temporary thing?"}, {"time": 503, "text": "I mean, what I'm my ears, not to the suffering of those people who have lost their job or the 50% possibly a small businesses that are going to go bankrupt, do you think about that?"}, {"time": 516, "text": "It's suffering."}, {"time": 517, "text": "Well, and how that might arise itself could be not quiet too."}, {"time": 521, "text": "I mean, right."}, {"time": 522, "text": "That's the, could be a depression."}, {"time": 524, "text": "This could go from recession to depression and depression could go to armed conflict and then to war."}, {"time": 529, "text": "So it's not a very, um, abstract causal chain that gets us to the point where we can begin with quiet suffering and anxiety and all of these sorts of things and people losing their jobs and people dying from stress and all sorts of things."}, {"time": 546, "text": "But, um, look, anything powerful enough to put us all indoors in a, I mean, I think about this as an incredible experiment."}, {"time": 555, "text": "Imagine that you proposed, Hey, I want to do a bunch of research."}, {"time": 562, "text": "Let's figure out what changes in our emissions, emissions profiles for our carbon footprints when we're all indoors or what happens to traffic patterns or what happens to the vulnerability of retail sales, uh, as Amazon gets stronger, you know, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 579, "text": "I believe that in many of those situations, um, we're running an incredible experiment and I, am I worried for us all?"}, {"time": 587, "text": "Yes, there are some bright spots."}, {"time": 589, "text": "One of which is that when you're ordered to stay indoors, people are going to feel entitled and the usual thing that people are going to hit when they hear that they've lost your job, you know, there's this kind of tough, um, tough love attitude that you see, particularly in the United States, like, Oh, you lost your job, poor baby."}, {"time": 612, "text": "Well, go retrain, get another one."}, {"time": 615, "text": "I think there's going to be a lot less appetite for that."}, {"time": 618, "text": "Um, because we've been asked to sacrifice, to risk, to act collectively."}, {"time": 623, "text": "And that's the interesting thing."}, {"time": 625, "text": "What does that reawaken in us?"}, {"time": 627, "text": "Maybe the idea that we actually are nations and that, you know, you're fellow countrymen may, may start to mean something to more people."}, {"time": 635, "text": "It certainly means something to people in the military, but I wonder how many people who aren't in the military start to think about this as like, Oh yeah, we are kind of running separate experiments and we are not China."}, {"time": 648, "text": "So you think this is kind of a period that might be studied for years to come."}, {"time": 652, "text": "From my perspective, we are a part of experiment, but I don't feel like we have access to the full range of knowledge."}, {"time": 659, "text": "But I don't feel like we have access to the full data, the full data of the experiment, we're just like little mice in a large, does this one make sense to you?"}, {"time": 671, "text": "I'm, I'm romanticizing it and I keep connecting it to world war II."}, {"time": 675, "text": "So I keep connecting to historical events and making sense of them through that way or reading the plague by Camus, like almost kind of telling narratives and stories, but it might, I'm not hearing the suffering that people are going through because I think that's quiet there."}, {"time": 696, "text": "Everybody's numb currently."}, {"time": 699, "text": "They're not realizing what it means to have lost your job and to have lost your business."}, {"time": 704, "text": "There's kind of a, I don't, I, um, I'm afraid how that fear will materialize itself once the numbness wears out."}, {"time": 714, "text": "And especially if this lasts for many months, then if it's connected to the incompetence of the CDC and the WHO and our government and perhaps the election process, you know, my biggest fear is that the elections get delayed or something like that."}, {"time": 735, "text": "So the, the, the basic mechanisms of our democracy get slowed or damaged in some way that then mixes with the fear that people have that turns to panic, that turns to anger, that anger."}, {"time": 751, "text": "Can I just play with that for a little bit?"}, {"time": 753, "text": "What if in fact, all of that structure that you grew up thinking about, and again, you grew up in two places, right?"}, {"time": 763, "text": "So, uh, when you were inside the U S we tend to look at all of these things as museum pieces, like how often do we amend the constitution anymore?"}, {"time": 774, "text": "And in some sense, if you think about the Jewish tradition of Simha Torah, you've got this beautiful scroll that has been lovingly hand drawn and calligraphy, um, that's very valuable."}, {"time": 788, "text": "And it's very important that you not treat it as a relic to be revered."}, {"time": 795, "text": "And so we, one day a year, we dance with the Torah and we hold this incredibly vulnerable document up and we treat it as if, uh, you know, it was Ginger Rogers being, uh, led by Fred Astaire."}, {"time": 808, "text": "Well, that is how you become part of your country."}, {"time": 813, "text": "In fact, maybe the, maybe the election will be delayed."}, {"time": 816, "text": "Maybe extraordinary powers will be used."}, {"time": 818, "text": "Maybe any one of a number of things will indicate that you're actually living through history."}, {"time": 823, "text": "This isn't a museum piece that you were handed by your great, great grandparents."}, {"time": 827, "text": "But you're kind of suggesting that there might be a, like a community thing that pops up like, like, um, as opposed to, uh, an angry revolution."}, {"time": 839, "text": "It might have a positive effect of, well, for example, are you telling me that if the right person stood up and called for us to sacrifice PPE, uh, for our nurses and our, our MDs who are on the front lines, that like people wouldn't reach down deep in their own supply that they've been like stocking and carefully storing them just say, like, say here, take it."}, {"time": 866, "text": "Like right now, an actual leader would use this time to bring out the heroic character and I'm going to just go wildly patriotic cause I frigging love this country, we've got this dormant population in the us that loves leadership and country and pride in our freedom and not being told what to do."}, {"time": 891, "text": "And we still have this thing that binds us together and all of them, the merchants of division just be gone."}, {"time": 899, "text": "I totally agree with you."}, {"time": 901, "text": "There's a, I think there is a deep hunger for that leadership."}, {"time": 904, "text": "Why hasn't that, why, why hasn't one of us, we don't have the right search surgeon general, we have a guy saying, you know, come on guys, don't buy masks."}, {"time": 914, "text": "They don't really work for you."}, {"time": 915, "text": "Save them for our healthcare professionals."}, {"time": 918, "text": "No, you can't do that."}, {"time": 920, "text": "You have to say, you know what, these masks actually do work and they more work to protect other people from you, but they would work for you."}, {"time": 928, "text": "They'll keep you somewhat safer if you wear them."}, {"time": 930, "text": "Here's the deal."}, {"time": 931, "text": "You've got somebody who's taking huge amounts of viral load all the time because the patients are shedding."}, {"time": 936, "text": "Do you want to protect that person who's volunteered to be on the front line, who's up sleepless nights?"}, {"time": 941, "text": "You just changed the message."}, {"time": 943, "text": "You stop lying to people."}, {"time": 944, "text": "You just, you level with them."}, {"time": 946, "text": "It's like, it's bad."}, {"time": 948, "text": "But that's a, that's a little bit specific."}, {"time": 951, "text": "So you, you have to be just honest about the facts of the situation."}, {"time": 955, "text": "But I think you were referring to something bigger than just that inspiring, like, you know, rewriting the constitution, sort of rethinking how we work as a nation."}, {"time": 994, "text": "And it's like, you're now too old to ride a tricycle and they're still whooping it up, ringing the bell with the streamers coming off the handlebars."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "And you're just thinking, do you guys never get bored?"}, {"time": 1004, "text": "Do you never pass a torch?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "Do you really want it?"}, {"time": 1007, "text": "We had five septuagenarians all born in the forties running for president of the United States when Clovis sure dropped out."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "The youngest was Warren."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "We had Warren Biden, Sanders, Bloomberg, and Trump from like 1949 to 1941."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "All who had been the oldest president at inauguration and nobody's, nobody says grandma and grandpa, you're embarrassing us except Joe Rogan."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "Let me put it on you."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "You have a big platform."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "You're somewhat of an intelligent, eloquent guy."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "What, what role do you somewhat, what role do you play?"}, {"time": 1043, "text": "Why aren't you that leader?"}, {"time": 1045, "text": "Well, you're, I mean, I would argue that you're in, in ways becoming a leader."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "In ways becoming that leader."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "So I haven't taken enough risk."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Is that your idea?"}, {"time": 1055, "text": "What should I do or say at the moment?"}, {"time": 1058, "text": "No, you're a little bit, no, you have taken quite a big risks and we'll, we'll talk about it."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "But you're also on the outside shooting in, meaning, um, you're, uh, dismantling the institution from the outside as opposed to becoming the institution."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "Do you remember that thing you brought up when you were on the view, the view?"}, {"time": 1085, "text": "When you were on Oprah, I didn't make, I didn't get the invite."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "When you were on Bill Maher's program, what was that thing you were saying?"}, {"time": 1096, "text": "They don't know we're here."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "They may watch us."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "They may quietly slip us a direct message, but they pretend that this internet thing is, uh, some dangerous place where only lunatics play."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "Well, who has the bigger platform, the portal or Bill Maher's program or the view, Bill Maher and the view in terms of viewership or in terms of what's the metric of size?"}, {"time": 1124, "text": "Well, first of all, the key thing is, um, take, take a newspaper and even imagine that it's completely fake."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "And then there's very little in the way of circulation."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "Yet imagine that it's an a hundred year old paper and that it's still part of this game, this internal game of media."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "The key point is, is that those sources that have that kind of, um, mark of respectability to the institutional structures matter in a way that even if I say something on a very large platform that makes a lot of sense, if it's outside of what I've called the gated institutional narrative or gin, I'm sorry, institutional narrative or gin, it sort of doesn't matter to the institutions."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "So the game is if it happens outside of the club, we can pretend that it never happened."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "How can you get the credibility and the authority from outside the, the gated institutional narrative?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Well, first of all, you and I both share, um, institutional credibility coming from organizations."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "So you, we were both at MIT, were you at Harvard at any point?"}, {"time": 1199, "text": "Well, I lived in Harvard square."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "So did I, but you know, at some level, the issue isn't whether you have credentials in that sense."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "The key question is, can you be trusted to file a flight plan and not deviate from that flight plan when you are in an interview situation, will you stick to the talking points?"}, {"time": 1220, "text": "Not, and that's why you're not going to be allowed in the general conversation, which amplifies these sentiments, but I'm still trying to, um, so your, your point, it would be, is that we're, let's say both."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "So you've done how many Joe Rogan for I've done for two, right?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So both of us are somewhat frequent guests."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "The show is huge."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "You know, the power as well as I do, and people are going to watch this conversation."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "A huge number watched our last one, by the way, I want to thank you for that one."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "That was a terrific, terrific conversation."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "Really did change my life."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "Like you're brilliant interviewer."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "So thank you."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "That was that you changed my life too."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "That you gave me a chance."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "So I was so glad I did that one."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "What I would say is, is that we keep mistaking how big the audience is for whether or not you have the kiss and the kiss is a different thing."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "Well, it doesn't, it's not an acronym yet."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "Um, it's uh, but thank you for asking."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "It's a question of, are you part of the inter interoperable institution friendly discussion?"}, {"time": 1285, "text": "And that's the discussion which we ultimately have to break into."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "But that's what I'm trying to get at is how do we, how do you, how does Eric Weinstein become the president of the United States?"}, {"time": 1296, "text": "I shouldn't become the president of the United States."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Not interested."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "Thank you very much for asking."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "That leader, you know, can that leader emerge from the current institutions or alternatively, can it also emerge from the outside?"}, {"time": 1341, "text": "I guess that's what I was asking."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "So my belief is, is that this is the last hurrah for the elderly centrist kleptocrats."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "Can you define each of those terms?"}, {"time": 1351, "text": "Elderly."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "I mean people who were born at least a year before I was, that's a joke."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "You can laugh."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "Uh, no, because I'm born at the cusp of the gen X boomer divide."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "Um, centrist they're pretending, you know, there are two parties, Democrat and Republican party in the United States."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "I think it's easier to think of the mainstream of both of them as part of a, an aggregate party that I sometimes call the looting party, which gets us to kleptocracy, which is ruled by thieves."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And the great temptation has been to treat the U S like a trough."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And you just have to get yours because it's not like we're doing anything productive."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "So everybody's sort of looting the family mansion and somebody stole the silver and somebody is cutting the pictures out of the frames and you know, roughly speaking, we're watching our elders, uh, we'll live it up in a way that doesn't make sense to the rest of us."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "So if it's the last hurrah, this is the time for leaders to step up."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "We're not ready yet."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "We're not ready."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "I just disagree with that."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "I call, I call out, you know, the head of the CDC should resign, should resign."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "The surgeon general should resign."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Trump should resign."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Pelosi should resign."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "De Blasio should resign."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "I understand that."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "So that's why."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "So we'll wait."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "No, but that's not how revolutions work."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "You don't wait for people to resign."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "You, uh, step up and inspire the alternative."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "Do you remember the Russian revolution of 1907?"}, {"time": 1443, "text": "It's before my time, but there wasn't a Russian revolution of 1907."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "So you're thinking we're in 1907."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "I'm saying we're too early."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "But we got this, you know, Spanish flu came in 17, 18."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "So I would argue that there's a lot of parallels there or there were one."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "I think it's not time yet."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "Like John Prine, the, uh, uh, the songwriter just died of COVID."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "That was a pretty big, really?"}, {"time": 1474, "text": "By the way, you, yes, of course."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "I, um, every time we do this, uh, we discover our mutual appreciation of obscure brilliant witty songwriter."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "He's really, he's really quite good, right?"}, {"time": 1486, "text": "He's, he's really good."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "My understanding is that he passed recently due to complications of Corona."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "So we haven't had large enough, enough large, large enough shocking deaths yet, picturesque deaths, deaths of a family that couldn't get treatment."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "There are stories that will come and break our hearts and we have not had enough of those."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "The visuals haven't come in, but I think they're coming."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "Well, we'll find out."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "But that you gotta, you have to be there."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "He has to be there when they come."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "I mean, but we didn't get the visual for example of falling man from nine 11."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "So the outside world did, but Americans were not, it was thought that we would be too delicate."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "So just the way you remember Pulitzer prize winning photographs from the Vietnam era, you don't easily remember the photographs from all sorts of things that have happened since because something changed in our media."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "We are in sense that we cannot feel or experience our own lives and the tragedy that would animate us to action."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "But I think there, again, I think there's going to be that suffering that's going to build and build and build in terms of businesses, mom and pop shops that close."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "And I, like, I think for myself, I think often that, that I'm being weak and, and like I feel like I should be doing something."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "I should be becoming a leader on a small scale."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "You can't, this is not world war II, and this is not Soviet Russia."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Because our internal programming, the malware that sits between our ears is much different than the propaganda is malware of the Soviet era."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "I mean, people were both very indoctrinated and also knew that some level it was BS."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "They had a double mind."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "There must be a great word in Russian for being able to think both of those things simultaneously."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "You don't think people are actually sick of the partisanship, sick of incompetence."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "Yeah, but I called for revolt the other day on Joe Rogan."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "People found it quixotic."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "Well, because I think you're not, I think revolt is different."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "I think that's like, okay, I'm really angry."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "I'm, I'm furious."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "I cannot stand that this is my country at the moment."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "I'm embarrassed."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "So let's build a better one."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "That's the, I'm in."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "So, well, okay, so let's take over a few universities."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "Let's start running a different experiment at some of our better universities."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "Like when I did this experiment and I said, what, at this, if this were 40 years ago, the median age, I believe of a university president was 51 that would have the person in gen X and we'd have a bunch of millennial presidents, a bunch of, you know, more than half gen X it's almost 100% baby boom at this point."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "Um, and how did that happen?"}, {"time": 1678, "text": "We can get into how they changed retirement, but this generation of people are not going to be able to do that."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "But this generation above us does not feel for even even the older generous silent generous."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "I had Roger Penrose on my program."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "And I thank you."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "I really appreciate that."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "And I asked him a question that was very important to me."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "I said, look, you're in your late eighties."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "Is there anyone you could point to as a successor that we should be watching?"}, {"time": 1708, "text": "We can get excited."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "You know, I said, here's an opportunity to pass the baton and he said, well, let me, let me hold off on that."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "It was like, Oh, is it ever the right moment to point to somebody younger than you to keep your flame alive after you're gone?"}, {"time": 1720, "text": "And also like, I don't know whether, I'm just going to

story is that Einstein sets the canvas and then we order all the stuff that we want and then that paints the picture that is our universe."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "So you order the, the, the paint,

concrete."}, {"time": 4165, "text": "Well, somehow you need to get three copies, for example, of generations with 16 particles each, right?"}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And so the question would be
