[{"title": "Max Tegmark: Life 3.0 | Lex Fridman Podcast #1", "id": "Gi8LUnhP5yU", "quotes": [{"time": 333, "text": "I think it's much more prudent to say, let's be really grateful for this amazing opportunity we've had and make the best of it just in case it is down to us."}, {"time": 344, "text": "So from a physics perspective, do you think intelligent life, so it's unique from a sort of statistical view of the size of the universe, but from the basic matter of the universe, how difficult is it for intelligent life to come about?"}, {"time": 359, "text": "The kind of advanced tech building life is implied in your statement that it's really difficult to create something like a human species."}, {"time": 367, "text": "Well, I think what we know is that going from no life to having life that can do a level of tech, there's some sort of two going beyond that than actually settling our whole universe with life."}, {"time": 382, "text": "There's some major roadblock there, which is some great filter as it's sometimes called, which is tough to get through."}, {"time": 393, "text": "It's either that roadblock is either behind us or in front of us."}, {"time": 398, "text": "I'm hoping very much that it's behind us."}, {"time": 401, "text": "I'm super excited every time we get a new report from NASA saying they failed to find any life on Mars."}, {"time": 408, "text": "I'm like, yes, awesome."}, {"time": 410, "text": "Because that suggests that the hard part, maybe it was getting the first ribosome or some very low level kind of stepping stone so that we're home free."}, {"time": 420, "text": "Because if that's true, then the future is really only limited by our own imagination."}, {"time": 425, "text": "It would be much suckier if it turns out that this level of life is kind of a dime a dozen, but maybe there's some other problem."}, {"time": 432, "text": "Like as soon as a civilization gets advanced technology, within a hundred years, they get into some stupid fight with themselves and poof."}, {"time": 440, "text": "That would be a bummer."}, {"time": 441, "text": "Yeah, so you've explored the mysteries of the universe, the cosmological universe, the one that's sitting between us today."}, {"time": 451, "text": "I think you've also begun to explore the other universe, which is sort of the mystery, the mysterious universe of the mind of intelligence, of intelligent life."}, {"time": 462, "text": "So is there a common thread between your interest or the way you think about space and intelligence?"}, {"time": 468, "text": "Oh yeah, when I was a teenager, I was already very fascinated by the biggest questions."}, {"time": 477, "text": "And I felt that the two biggest mysteries of all in science were our universe out there and our universe in here."}, {"time": 485, "text": "So it's quite natural after having spent a quarter of a century on my career, thinking a lot about this one, that I'm now indulging in the luxury of doing research on this one."}, {"time": 495, "text": "It's just so cool."}, {"time": 497, "text": "I feel the time is ripe now for you trans greatly deepening our understanding of this."}, {"time": 505, "text": "Just start exploring this one."}, {"time": 506, "text": "Yeah, because I think a lot of people view intelligence as something mysterious that can only exist in biological organisms like us, and therefore dismiss all talk about artificial general intelligence as science fiction."}, {"time": 521, "text": "But from my perspective as a physicist, I am a blob of quarks and electrons moving around in a certain pattern and processing information in certain ways."}, {"time": 530, "text": "And this is also a blob of quarks and electrons."}, {"time": 533, "text": "I'm not smarter than the water bottle because I'm made of different kinds of quarks."}, {"time": 537, "text": "I'm made of up quarks and down quarks, exact same kind as this."}, {"time": 541, "text": "There's no secret sauce, I think, in me."}, {"time": 545, "text": "It's all about the pattern of the information processing."}, {"time": 548, "text": "And this means that there's no law of physics saying that we can't create technology, which can help us by being incredibly intelligent and help us crack mysteries that we couldn't."}, {"time": 561, "text": "In other words, I think we've really only seen the tip of the intelligence iceberg so far."}, {"time": 566, "text": "Yeah, so the perceptronium."}, {"time": 571, "text": "So you coined this amazing term."}, {"time": 573, "text": "It's a hypothetical state of matter, sort of thinking from a physics perspective, what is the kind of matter that can help, as you're saying, subjective experience emerge, consciousness emerge."}, {"time": 584, "text": "So how do you think about consciousness from this physics perspective?"}, {"time": 589, "text": "Very good question."}, {"time": 590, "text": "So again, I think many people have underestimated our ability to make progress on this by convincing themselves it's hopeless because somehow we're missing some ingredient that we need."}, {"time": 605, "text": "There's some new consciousness particle or whatever."}, {"time": 609, "text": "I happen to think that we're not missing anything and that it's not the interesting thing about consciousness that gives us this amazing subjective experience of colors and sounds and emotions."}, {"time": 623, "text": "It's rather something at the higher level about the patterns of information processing."}, {"time": 628, "text": "And that's why I like to think about this idea of perceptronium."}, {"time": 634, "text": "What does it mean for an arbitrary physical system to be conscious in terms of what its particles are doing or its information is doing?"}, {"time": 643, "text": "I don't think, I hate carbon chauvinism, this attitude you have to be made of carbon atoms to be smart or conscious."}, {"time": 650, "text": "There's something about the information processing that this kind of matter performs."}, {"time": 655, "text": "Yeah, and you can see I have my favorite equations here describing various fundamental aspects of the world."}, {"time": 660, "text": "I feel that I think one day, maybe someone who's watching this will come up with the equations that information processing has to satisfy to be conscious."}, {"time": 668, "text": "I'm quite convinced there is big discovery to be made there because let's face it, we know that so many things are made up of information."}, {"time": 678, "text": "We know that some information processing is conscious because we are conscious."}, {"time": 685, "text": "But we also know that a lot of information processing is not conscious."}, {"time": 688, "text": "Like most of the information processing happening in your brain right now is not conscious."}, {"time": 692, "text": "There are like 10 megabytes per second coming in even just through your visual system."}, {"time": 698, "text": "You're not conscious about your heartbeat regulation or most things."}, {"time": 702, "text": "Even if I just ask you to like read what it says here, you look at it and then, oh, now you know what it said."}, {"time": 708, "text": "But you're not aware of how the computation actually happened."}, {"time": 711, "text": "Your consciousness is like the CEO that got an email at the end with the final answer."}, {"time": 716, "text": "So what is it that makes a difference?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "I think that's both a great science mystery."}, {"time": 725, "text": "We're actually studying it a little bit in my lab here at MIT, but I also think it's just a really urgent question to answer."}, {"time": 732, "text": "For starters, I mean, if you're an emergency room doctor and you have an unresponsive patient coming in, wouldn't it be great if in addition to having a CT scanner, you had a consciousness scanner that could figure out whether this person is actually having locked in syndrome or is actually comatose."}, {"time": 753, "text": "And in the future, imagine if we build robots or the machine that we can have really good conversations with, which I think is very likely to happen."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Wouldn't you want to know if your home helper robot is actually experiencing anything or just like a zombie, I mean, would you prefer it?"}, {"time": 773, "text": "What would you prefer?"}, {"time": 774, "text": "Would you prefer that it's actually unconscious so that you don't have to feel guilty about switching it off or giving boring chores or what would you prefer?"}, {"time": 782, "text": "Well, certainly we would prefer, I would prefer the appearance of consciousness."}, {"time": 788, "text": "But the question is whether the appearance of consciousness is different than consciousness itself."}, {"time": 795, "text": "And sort of to ask that as a question, do you think we need to understand what consciousness is, solve the hard problem of consciousness in order to build something like an AGI system?"}, {"time": 808, "text": "No, I don't think that."}, {"time": 810, "text": "And I think we will probably be able to build things even if we don't answer that question."}, {"time": 816, "text": "But if we want to make sure that what happens is a good thing, we better solve it first."}, {"time": 820, "text": "So it's a wonderful controversy you're raising there where you have basically three points of view about the hard problem."}, {"time": 828, "text": "So there are two different points of view."}, {"time": 832, "text": "They both conclude that the hard problem of consciousness is BS."}, {"time": 836, "text": "On one hand, you have some people like Daniel Dennett who say that consciousness is just BS because consciousness is the same thing as intelligence."}, {"time": 845, "text": "There's no difference."}, {"time": 846, "text": "So anything which acts conscious is conscious, just like we are."}, {"time": 853, "text": "And then there are also a lot of people, including many top AI researchers I know, who say, oh, consciousness is just bullshit because, of course, machines can never be conscious."}, {"time": 862, "text": "They're always going to be zombies."}, {"time": 864, "text": "You never have to feel guilty about how you treat them."}, {"time": 867, "text": "And then there's a third group of people, including Giulio Tononi, for example, and Krzysztof Koch and a number of others."}, {"time": 877, "text": "I would put myself also in this middle camp who say that actually some information processing is conscious and some is not."}, {"time": 884, "text": "So let's find the equation which can be used to determine which it is."}, {"time": 889, "text": "And I think we've just been a little bit lazy, kind of running away from this problem for a long time."}, {"time": 894, "text": "It's been almost taboo to even mention the C word in a lot of circles because, but we should stop making excuses."}, {"time": 903, "text": "This is a science question and there are ways we can even test any theory that makes predictions for this."}, {"time": 911, "text": "And coming back to this helper robot, I mean, so you said you'd want your helper robot to certainly act conscious and treat you, like have conversations with you and stuff."}, {"time": 920, "text": "I think so."}, {"time": 921, "text": "But wouldn't you, would you feel, would you feel a little bit creeped out if you realized that it was just a glossed up tape recorder, you know, that was just zombie and was a faking emotion?"}, {"time": 931, "text": "Would you prefer that it actually had an experience or would you prefer that it's actually not experiencing anything so you feel, you don't have to feel guilty about what you do to it?"}, {"time": 942, "text": "It's such a difficult question because, you know, it's like when you're in a relationship and you say, well, I love you."}, {"time": 948, "text": "And the other person said, I love you back."}, {"time": 949, "text": "It's like asking, well, do they really love you back or are they just saying they love you back?"}, {"time": 955, "text": "Don't you really want them to actually love you?"}, {"time": 958, "text": "It's hard to, it's hard to really know the difference between everything seeming like there's consciousness present, there's intelligence present, there's affection, passion, love, and it actually being there."}, {"time": 976, "text": "I'm not sure, do you have?"}, {"time": 977, "text": "But like, can I ask you a question about this?"}, {"time": 979, "text": "Like to make it a bit more pointed."}, {"time": 980, "text": "So Mass General Hospital is right across the river, right?"}, {"time": 983, "text": "Suppose you're going in for a medical procedure and they're like, you know, for anesthesia, what we're going to do is we're going to give you muscle relaxants so you won't be able to move and you're going to feel excruciating pain during the whole surgery, but you won't be able to do anything about it."}, {"time": 997, "text": "But then we're going to give you this drug that erases your memory of it."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Would you be cool about that?"}, {"time": 1004, "text": "What's the difference that you're conscious about it or not if there's no behavioral change, right?"}, {"time": 1011, "text": "Right, that's a really, that's a really clear way to put it."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "That's, yeah, it feels like in that sense, experiencing it is a valuable quality."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "So actually being able to have subjective experiences, at least in that case, is valuable."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And I think we humans have a little bit of a bad track record also of making these self serving arguments that other entities aren't conscious."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "You know, people often say, oh, these animals can't feel pain."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "It's okay to boil lobsters because we ask them if it hurt and they didn't say anything."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "And now there was just a paper out saying, lobsters do feel pain when you boil them and they're banning it in Switzerland."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And we did this with slaves too often and said, oh, they don't mind."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "They don't maybe aren't conscious or women don't have souls or whatever."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "So I'm a little bit nervous when I hear people just take as an axiom that machines can't have experience ever."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "I think this is just a really fascinating science question is what it is."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Let's research it and try to figure out what it is that makes the difference between unconscious intelligent behavior and conscious intelligent behavior."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "So in terms of, so if you think of a Boston Dynamics human or robot being sort of with a broom being pushed around, it starts pushing on a consciousness question."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "So let me ask, do you think an AGI system like a few neuroscientists believe needs to have a physical embodiment?"}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Needs to have a body or something like a body?"}, {"time": 1105, "text": "No, I don't think so."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "You mean to have a conscious experience?"}, {"time": 1110, "text": "To have consciousness."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "I do think it helps a lot to have a physical embodiment to learn the kind of things about the world that are important to us humans, for sure."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "But I don't think the physical embodiment is necessary after you've learned it to just have the experience."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "Think about when you're dreaming, right?"}, {"time": 1131, "text": "Your eyes are closed."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "You're not getting any sensory input."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "You're not behaving or moving in any way but there's still an experience there, right?"}, {"time": 1139, "text": "And so clearly the experience that you have when you see something cool in your dreams isn't coming from your eyes."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "It's just the information processing itself in your brain which is that experience, right?"}, {"time": 1150, "text": "But if I put it another way, I'll say because it comes from neuroscience is the reason you want to have a body and a physical something like a physical, you know, a physical system is because you want to be able to preserve something."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "In order to have a self, you could argue, would you need to have some kind of embodiment of self to want to preserve?"}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Well, now we're getting a little bit anthropomorphic into anthropomorphizing things."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "Maybe talking about self preservation instincts."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "I mean, we are evolved organisms, right?"}, {"time": 1190, "text": "So Darwinian evolution endowed us and other evolved organism with a self preservation instinct because those that didn't have those self preservation genes got cleaned out of the gene pool, right?"}, {"time": 1202, "text": "But if you build an artificial general intelligence the mind space that you can design is much, much larger than just a specific subset of minds that can evolve."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "So an AGI mind doesn't necessarily have to have any self preservation instinct."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "It also doesn't necessarily have to be so individualistic as us."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Like, imagine if you could just, first of all, or we are also very afraid of death."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "You know, I suppose you could back yourself up every five minutes and then your airplane is about to crash."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "You're like, shucks, I'm gonna lose the last five minutes of experiences since my last cloud backup, dang."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "You know, it's not as big a deal."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "Or if we could just copy experiences between our minds easily like we, which we could easily do if we were silicon based, right?"}, {"time": 1250, "text": "Then maybe we would feel a little bit more like a hive mind actually, that maybe it's the, so I don't think we should take for granted at all that AGI will have to have any of those sort of competitive as alpha male instincts."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "On the other hand, you know, this is really interesting because I think some people go too far and say, of course we don't have to have any concerns either that advanced AI will have those instincts because we can build anything we want."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "That there's a very nice set of arguments going back to Steve Omohundro and Nick Bostrom and others just pointing out that when we build machines, we normally build them with some kind of goal, you know, win this chess game, drive this car safely or whatever."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "And as soon as you put in a goal into machine, especially if it's kind of open ended goal and the machine is very intelligent, it'll break that down into a bunch of sub goals."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "And one of those goals will almost always be self preservation because if it breaks or dies in the process, it's not gonna accomplish the goal, right?"}, {"time": 1316, "text": "Like suppose you just build a little, you have a little robot and you tell it to go down the store market here and get you some food, make you cook an Italian dinner, you know, and then someone mugs it and tries to break it on the way."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "That robot has an incentive to not get destroyed and defend itself or run away, because otherwise it's gonna fail in cooking your dinner."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "It's not afraid of death, but it really wants to complete the dinner cooking goal."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "So it will have a self preservation instinct."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "Continue being a functional agent somehow."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And similarly, if you give any kind of more ambitious goal to an AGI, it's very likely they wanna acquire more resources so it can do that better."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "And it's exactly from those sort of sub goals that we might not have intended that some of the concerns about AGI safety come."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "You give it some goal that seems completely harmless."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And then before you realize it, it's also trying to do these other things which you didn't want it to do."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "And it's maybe smarter than us."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So it's fascinating."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "And let me pause just because I am in a very kind of human centric way, see fear of death as a valuable motivator."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "So you don't think, you think that's an artifact of evolution, so that's the kind of mind space evolution created that we're sort of almost obsessed about self preservation, some kind of genetic flow."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "You don't think that's necessary to be afraid of death."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "So not just a kind of sub goal of self preservation just so you can keep doing the thing, but more fundamentally sort of have the finite thing like this ends for you at some point."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "Do I think it's necessary for what precisely?"}, {"time": 1427, "text": "For intelligence, but also for consciousness."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So for those, for both, do you think really like a finite death and the fear of it is important?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "So before I can answer, before we can agree on whether it's necessary for intelligence or for consciousness, we should be clear on how we define those two words."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Cause a lot of really smart people define them in very different ways."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "I was on this panel with AI experts and they couldn't agree on how to define intelligence even."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "So I define intelligence simply as the ability to accomplish complex goals."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "I like your broad definition, because again I don't want to be a carbon chauvinist."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "And in that case, no, certainly it doesn't require fear of death."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "I would say alpha go, alpha zero is quite intelligent."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "I don't think alpha zero has any fear of being turned off because it doesn't understand the concept of it even."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "And similarly consciousness."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "I mean, you could certainly imagine very simple kind of experience."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "If certain plants have any kind of experience I don't think they're very afraid of dying or there's nothing they can do about it anyway much."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "So there wasn't that much value in, but more seriously I think if you ask, not just about being conscious but maybe having what you would, we might call an exciting life where you feel passion and really appreciate the things."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "Maybe there somehow, maybe there perhaps it does help having a backdrop that, Hey, it's finite."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "No, let's make the most of this, let's live to the fullest."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "So if you knew you were going to live forever do you think you would change your?"}, {"time": 1537, "text": "Yeah, I mean, in some perspective it would be an incredibly boring life living forever."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "So in the sort of loose subjective terms that you said of something exciting and something in this that other humans would understand, I think is, yeah it seems that the finiteness of it is important."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "Well, the good news I have for you then is based on what we understand about cosmology everything is in our universe is probably ultimately probably finite, although."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "Big crunch or big, what's the, the infinite expansion."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "Yeah, we could have a big chill or a big crunch or a big rip or that's the big snap or death bubbles."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "All of them are more than a billion years away."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "So we should, we certainly have vastly more time than our ancestors thought, but there is still it's still pretty hard to squeeze in an infinite number of compute cycles, even though there are some loopholes that just might be possible."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "But I think, you know, some people like to say that you should live as if you're about to you're going to die in five years or so."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "And that's sort of optimal."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "Maybe it's a good assumption."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "We should build our civilization as if it's all finite to be on the safe side."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "So you mentioned defining intelligence as the ability to solve complex goals."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Where would you draw a line or how would you try to define human level intelligence and superhuman level intelligence?"}, {"time": 1630, "text": "Where is consciousness part of that definition?"}, {"time": 1633, "text": "No, consciousness does not come into this definition."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So, so I think of intelligence as it's a spectrum but there are very many different kinds of goals you can have."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "You can have a goal to be a good chess player a good goal player, a good car driver, a good investor good poet, et cetera."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "So intelligence that by its very nature isn't something you can measure by this one number or some overall goodness."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "There are some people who are more better at this."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "Some people are better than that."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "Right now we have machines that are much better than us at some very narrow tasks like multiplying large numbers fast, memorizing large databases, playing chess playing go and soon driving cars."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "But there's still no machine that can match a human child in general intelligence but artificial general intelligence, AGI the name of your course, of course that is by its very definition, the quest to build a machine that can do everything as well as we can."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "So the old Holy grail of AI from back to its inception in the sixties, if that ever happens, of course I think it's going to be the biggest transition in the history of life on earth but it doesn't necessarily have to wait the big impact until machines are better than us at knitting that the really big change doesn't come exactly at the moment they're better than us at everything."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "The really big change comes first there are big changes when they start becoming better at us at doing most of the jobs that we do because that takes away much of the demand for human labor."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And then the really whopping change comes when they become better than us at AI research, right?"}, {"time": 1741, "text": "Because right now the timescale of AI research is limited by the human research and development cycle of years typically, you know how long does it take from one release of some software or iPhone or whatever to the next?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "But once Google can replace 40,000 engineers by 40,000 equivalent pieces of software or whatever but then there's no reason that has to be years it can be in principle much faster and the timescale of future progress in AI and all of science and technology will be driven by machines, not humans."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "So it's this simple point which gives right this incredibly fun controversy about whether there can be intelligence explosion so called singularity as Werner Vinge called it."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "Now the idea is articulated by I.J."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "Good is obviously way back fifties but you can see Alan Turing and others thought about it even earlier."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "So you asked me what exactly would I define human level intelligence, yeah."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "So

important insights, very important lessons we can always draw from these kinds of successes."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "One of them is when you look at the human brain, you see it's very complicated, 10th of 11 neurons, and there are all these different kinds of neurons and yada, yada, and there's been this long debate about whether the fact that we have dozens of different kinds is actually necessary for intelligence."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "We can now, I think, quite convincingly answer that question of no, it's enough to have just one kind."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "If you look under the hood of AlphaZero, there's only one kind of neuron and it's ridiculously simple mathematical thing."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "So it's just like in physics, it's not, if you have a gas with waves in it, it's not the detailed nature of the molecule that matter, it's the collective behavior somehow."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "Similarly, it's this higher level structure of the network that matters, not that you have 20 kinds of neurons."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "I think our brain is such a complicated mess because it wasn't evolved just to be intelligent, it was involved to also be self assembling and self repairing, right?"}, {"time": 3648, "text": "And evolutionarily attainable."}, {"time": 3651, "text": "And so on and so on."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "So I think it's pretty, my hunch is that we're going to understand how to build AGI before we fully understand how our brains work, just like we understood how to build flying machines long before we were able to build a mechanical bird."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "Yeah, that's right."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "You've given the example exactly of mechanical birds and airplanes and airplanes do a pretty good job of flying without really mimicking bird flight."}, {"time": 3678, "text": "And even now after 100 years later, did you see the Ted talk with this German mechanical bird?"}, {"time": 3683, "text": "I heard you mention it."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "Check it out, it's amazing."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "But even after that, right, we still don't fly in mechanical birds because it turned out the way we came up with was simpler and it's better for our purposes."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "And I think it might be the same there."}, {"time": 3695, "text": "That's one lesson."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "And another lesson, it's more what our paper was about."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "First, as a physicist thought it was fascinating how there's a very close mathematical relationship actually between our artificial neural networks and a lot of things that we've studied for in physics go by nerdy names like the renormalization group equation and Hamiltonians and yada, yada, yada."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "And when you look a little more closely at this, you have, at first I was like, well, there's something crazy here that doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 3733, "text": "Because we know that if you even want to build a super simple neural network to tell apart cat pictures and dog pictures, right, that you can do that very, very well now."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "But if you think about it a little bit, you convince yourself it must be impossible because if I have one megapixel, even if each pixel is just black or white, there's two to the power of 1 million possible images, which is way more than there are atoms in our universe, right, so in order to, and then for each one of those, I have to assign a number, which is the probability that it's a dog."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "So an arbitrary function of images is a list of more numbers than there are atoms in our universe."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "So clearly I can't store that under the hood of my GPU or my computer, yet somehow it works."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "So what does that mean?"}, {"time": 3781, "text": "Well, it means that out of all of the problems that you could try to solve with a neural network, almost all of them are impossible to solve with a reasonably sized one."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "But then what we showed in our paper was that the fraction, the kind of problems, the fraction of all the problems that you could possibly pose, that we actually care about given the laws of physics is also an infinite testimony, tiny little part."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "And amazingly, they're basically the same part."}, {"time": 3815, "text": "Yeah, it's almost like our world was created for, I mean, they kind of come together."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "Yeah, well, you could say maybe where the world was created for us, but I have a more modest interpretation, which is that the world was created for us, but I have a more modest interpretation, which is that instead evolution endowed us with neural networks precisely for that reason."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "Because this particular architecture, as opposed to the one in your laptop, is very, very well adapted to solving the kind of problems that nature kept presenting our ancestors with."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "So it makes sense that why do we have a brain in the first place?"}, {"time": 3849, "text": "It's to be able to make predictions about the future and so on."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "So if we had a sucky system, which could never solve it, we wouldn't have a world."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "So this is, I think, a very beautiful fact."}, {"time": 3864, "text": "We also realize that there's been earlier work on why deeper networks are good, but we were able to show an additional cool fact there, which is that even incredibly simple problems, like suppose I give you a thousand numbers and ask you to multiply them together, and you can write a few lines of code, boom, done, trivial."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "If you just try to do that with a neural network that has only one single hidden layer in it, you can do it, but you're going to need two to the power of a thousand neurons to multiply a thousand numbers, which is, again, more neurons than there are atoms in our universe."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "But if you allow yourself to make it a deep network with many layers, you only need 4,000 neurons."}, {"time": 3913, "text": "It's perfectly feasible."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "That's really interesting."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "So on another architecture type, I mean, you mentioned Schrodinger's equation, and what are your thoughts about quantum computing and the role of this kind of computational unit in creating an intelligence system?"}, {"time": 3934, "text": "In some Hollywood movies that I will not mention by name because I don't want to spoil them."}, {"time": 3941, "text": "The way they get AGI is building a quantum computer."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "Because the word quantum sounds cool and so on."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "First of all, I think we don't need quantum computers to build AGI."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "I suspect your brain is not a quantum computer in any profound sense."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "So you don't even wrote a paper about that a lot many years ago."}, {"time": 3964, "text": "I calculated the so called decoherence time, how long it takes until the quantum computerness of what your neurons are doing gets erased by just random noise from the environment."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "And it's about 10 to the minus 21 seconds."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "So as cool as it would be to have a quantum computer in my head, I don't think that fast."}, {"time": 3987, "text": "On the other hand, there are very cool things you could do with quantum computers."}, {"time": 3995, "text": "Or I think we'll be able to do soon when we get bigger ones."}, {"time": 3999, "text": "That might actually help machine learning do even better than the brain."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "So for example, one, this is just a moonshot, but learning is very much same thing as search."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "If you're trying to train a neural network to get really learned to do something really well, you have some loss function, you have a bunch of knobs you can turn, represented by a bunch of numbers, and you're trying to tweak them so that it becomes as good as possible at this thing."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "So if you think of a landscape with some valley, where each dimension of the landscape corresponds to some number you can change, you're trying to find the minimum."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "And it's well known that if you have a very high dimensional landscape, complicated things, it's super hard to find the minimum."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "Quantum mechanics is amazingly good at this."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "Like if I want to know what's the lowest energy state this water can possibly have,

to its minimum."}, {"time": 4072, "text": "And this happens metaphorically at the energy landscape too."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "And quantum mechanics even uses some clever tricks, which today's machine learning systems don't."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "Like if you're trying to find the minimum and you get stuck in the little local minimum here, in quantum mechanics you can actually tunnel through the barrier and get unstuck again."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "Yeah, so it may be, for example, that we'll one day use quantum computers that help train neural networks better."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "Okay, so as a component of kind of the learning process, for example."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "Let me ask sort of wrapping up here a little bit, let me return to the questions of our human nature and love, as I mentioned."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "So do you think, you mentioned sort of a helper robot, but you could think of also personal robots."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "Do you think the way we human beings fall in love and get connected to each other is possible to achieve in an AI system and human level AI intelligence system?"}, {"time": 4140, "text": "Do you think we would ever see that kind of connection?"}, {"time": 4143, "text": "Or, you know, in all this discussion about solving complex goals, is this kind of human social connection, do you think that's one of the goals on the peaks and valleys with the raising sea levels that we'll be able to achieve?"}, {"time": 4157, "text": "Or do you think that's something that's ultimately, or at least in the short term, relative to the other goals is not achievable?"}, {"time": 4163, "text": "I think it's all possible."}, {"time": 4165, "text": "And I mean, in recent, there's a very wide range of guesses, as you know, among AI researchers, when we're going to get AGI."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "Some people, you know, like our friend Rodney Brooks says it's going to be hundreds of years at least."},

get AGI within decades."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "So if that happens, of course, then I think these things are all possible."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "But in terms of whether it will happen, I think we shouldn't spend so much time asking what do we think will happen in the future?"}, {"time": 4203, "text": "As if we are just some sort of pathetic, your passive bystanders, you know, waiting for the future to happen to us."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "Hey, we're the ones creating this future, right?"}, {"time": 4211, "text": "So we should be proactive about it and ask ourselves what sort of future we would like to have happen."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "We're going to make it like that."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "Well, what I prefer is just some sort of incredibly boring, zombie like future where there's all these mechanical things happening and there's no passion, no emotion, no experience, maybe even."}, {"time": 4229, "text": "No, I would of course, much rather prefer it if all the things that we find that we value the most about humanity are our subjective experience, passion, inspiration, love, you know."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "If we can create a future where those things do happen, where those things do exist, you know, I think ultimately it's not our universe giving meaning to us, it's us giving meaning to our universe."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "And if we build more advanced intelligence, let's make sure we build it in such a way that meaning is part of it."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "A lot of people that seriously study this problem and think of it from different angles have trouble in the majority of cases, if they think through that happen, are the ones that are not beneficial to humanity."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "And so, yeah, so what are your thoughts?"}, {"time": 4285, "text": "What's should people, you know, I really don't like people to be terrified."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "What's a way for people to think about it in a way we can solve it and we can make it better?"}, {"time": 4299, "text": "No, I don't think panicking is going to help in any way."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "It's not going to increase chances of things going well either."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "Even if you are in a situation where there is a real threat, does it help if everybody just freaks out?"}, {"time": 4311, "text": "No, of course, of course not."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "I think, yeah, there are of course ways in which things can go horribly wrong."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "First of all, it's important when we think about this thing, about the problems and risks, to also remember how huge the upsides can be if we get it right, right?"}, {"time": 4328, "text": "Everything we love about society and civilization is a product of intelligence."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "So if we can amplify our intelligence with machine intelligence and not anymore lose our loved one to what we're told is an incurable disease and things like this, of course, we should aspire to that."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "So that can be a motivator, I think, reminding ourselves that the reason we try to solve problems is not just because we're trying to avoid gloom, but because we're trying to do something great."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "But then in terms of the risks, I think the really important question is to ask, what can we do today

aspire towards?"}, {"time": 4458, "text": "And then let's think really hard about how we can actually get there."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "So start with, don't start thinking about the risks, start

husband proposed to me by building a WALLI and he actuated it."}, {"time": 549, "text": "So it's seven degrees of freedom, including the lens thing."}, {"time": 553, "text": "And it kind of came in and it had the, he made it have like the belly box opening thing."}, {"time": 561, "text": "So it just did that."}, {"time": 563, "text": "And then it spewed out this box made out of Legos that open slowly and then bam, yeah."}, {"time": 571, "text": "Yeah, it was quite, it set a bar."}, {"time": 574, "text": "That could be like the most impressive thing I've ever heard."}, {"time": 579, "text": "That was special connection to WALLI, long story short."}, {"time": 580, "text": "I like WALLI because I like animation and I like robots and I like the fact that this was, we still have this robot to this day."}, {"time": 589, "text": "How hard is that problem, do you think of the expressivity of robots?"}, {"time": 594, "text": "Like with the Boston Dynamics, I never talked to those folks about this particular element."}, {"time": 600, "text": "I've talked to them a lot, but it seems to be like almost an accidental side effect for them that they weren't, I don't know if they're faking it."}, {"time": 608, "text": "They weren't trying to, okay."}, {"time": 611, "text": "They do say that the gripper, it was not intended to be a face."}, {"time": 617, "text": "I don't know if that's a honest statement, but I think they're legitimate."}, {"time": 621, "text": "Probably yes."}, {"time": 621, "text": "And so do we automatically just anthropomorphize anything we can see about a robot?"}, {"time": 629, "text": "So like the question is, how hard is it to create a WALLI type robot that connects so deeply with us humans?"}, {"time": 636, "text": "It's really hard, right?"}, {"time": 637, "text": "So it depends on what setting."}, {"time": 639, "text": "So if you wanna do it in this very particular narrow setting where it does only one thing and it's expressive, then you can get an animator, you know, you can have Pixar on call come in, design some trajectories."}, {"time": 653, "text": "There was a, Anki had a robot called Cosmo where they put in some of these animations."}, {"time": 658, "text": "That part is easy, right?"}, {"time": 660, "text": "The hard part is doing it not via these kind of handcrafted behaviors, but doing it generally autonomously."}, {"time": 669, "text": "Like I want robots, I don't work on, just to clarify, I don't, I used to work a lot on this."}, {"time": 698, "text": "I think that when robots move, they can communicate so much about internal states or perceived internal states that they have."}, {"time": 709, "text": "And I think that's really useful and an element that we'll want in the future because I was reading this article about how kids are, kids are being rude to Alexa because they can be rude to it and it doesn't really get angry, right?"}, {"time": 731, "text": "It doesn't reply in any way, it just says the same thing."}, {"time": 735, "text": "So I think there's, at least for that, for the correct development of children, it's important that these things, you kind of react differently."}, {"time": 782, "text": "What is the person actually perceiving?"}, {"time": 785, "text": "What do they think about the robots?"}, {"time": 788, "text": "Something or rather, and then you have to optimize in that system."}, {"time": 792, "text": "And so that means that you have to understand how your motion, your actions end up sort of influencing the observer's kind of perception of you."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And it's very hard to write math about that."}, {"time": 805, "text": "Right, so when you start to think about incorporating the human into the state model, apologize for the philosophical question, but how complicated are human beings, do you think?"}, {"time": 816, "text": "Like, can they be reduced to a kind of almost like an object that moves and maybe has some basic intents?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "Or is there something, do we have to model things like mood and general aggressiveness and time?"}, {"time": 832, "text": "I mean, all these kinds of human qualities or like game theoretic qualities, like what's your sense?"}, {"time": 838, "text": "How complicated is... How hard is the problem of human robot interaction?"}, {"time": 843, "text": "Yeah, should we talk about what the problem of human robot interaction is?"}, {"time": 847, "text": "Yeah, what is human robot interaction?"}, {"time": 850, "text": "And then talk about how that, yeah."}, {"time": 852, "text": "So, and by the way, I'm gonna talk about this very particular view of human robot interaction, right?"}, {"time": 859, "text": "Which is not so much on the social side or on the side of how do you have a good conversation with the robot, what should the robot's appearance be?"}, {"time": 866, "text": "It turns out that if you make robots taller versus shorter, this has an effect on how people act with them."}, {"time": 871, "text": "So I'm not talking about that."}, {"time": 874, "text": "But I'm talking about this very kind of narrow thing, which is you take, if you wanna take a task that a robot can do in isolation, in a lab out there in the world, but in isolation, and now you're asking what does it mean for the robot to be able to do this task for, presumably what its actually end goal is, which is to help some person."}, {"time": 896, "text": "That ends up changing the problem in two ways."}, {"time": 902, "text": "The first way it changes the problem is that the robot is no longer the single agent acting."}, {"time": 908, "text": "That you have humans who also take actions in that same space."}, {"time": 912, "text": "Cars navigating around people, robots around an office, navigating around the people in that office."}, {"time": 918, "text": "If I send the robot over there in the cafeteria to get me a coffee, then there's probably other people reaching for stuff in the same space."}, {"time": 925, "text": "And so now you have your robot and you're in charge of the actions that the robot is taking."}, {"time": 930, "text": "Then you have these people who are also making decisions and taking actions in that same space."}, {"time": 936, "text": "And even if, you know, the robot knows what it should do and all of that, just coexisting with these people, right?"}, {"time": 942, "text": "Kind of getting the actions to gel well, to mesh well together."}, {"time": 947, "text": "That's sort of the kind of problem number one."}, {"time": 950, "text": "And then there's problem number two, which is, goes back to this notion of if I'm a programmer, I can specify some objective for the robot to go off and optimize and specify the task."}, {"time": 963, "text": "But if I put the robot in your home, presumably you might have your own opinions about, well, okay, I want my house clean, but how do I want it cleaned?"}, {"time": 974, "text": "And how should robot move, how close to me it should come and all of that."}, {"time": 977, "text": "And so I think those are the two differences that you have."}, {"time": 980, "text": "You're acting around people and what you should be optimizing for should satisfy the preferences of that end user, not of your programmer who programmed you."}, {"time": 990, "text": "Yeah, and the preferences thing is tricky."}, {"time": 993, "text": "So figuring out those preferences, be able to interactively adjust to understand what the human is doing."}, {"time": 999, "text": "So really it boils down to understand the humans in order to interact with them and in order to please them."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "So why is this hard?"}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Yeah, why is understanding humans hard?"}, {"time": 1011, "text": "So I think there's two tasks about understanding humans that in my mind are very, very similar, but not everyone agrees."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "So there's the task of being able to just anticipate what people will do."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "We all know that cars need to do this, right?"}, {"time": 1027, "text": "We all know that, well, if I navigate around some people, the robot has to get some notion of, okay, where is this person gonna be?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "So that's kind of the prediction side."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "And then there's what you were saying, satisfying the preferences, right?"}, {"time": 1041, "text": "So adapting to the person's preferences, knowing what to optimize for, which is more this inference side, this what does this person want?"}, {"time": 1048, "text": "What is their intent?"}, {"time": 1048, "text": "What are their preferences?"}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And to me, those kind of go together because I think that at the very least, if you can understand, if you can look at human behavior and understand what it is that they want, then that's sort of the key enabler to being able to anticipate what they'll do in the future."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "Because I think that we're not arbitrary."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "We make these decisions that we make, we act in the way we do because we're trying to achieve certain things."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "And so I think that's the relationship between them."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "Now, how complicated do these models need to be in order to be able to understand what people want?"}, {"time": 1090, "text": "So we've gotten a long way in robotics with something called inverse reinforcement learning, which is the notion of if someone acts, demonstrates how they want the thing done."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "What is inverse reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 1104, "text": "You just briefly said it."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "Right, so it's the problem of take human behavior and infer reward function from this."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "So figure out what it is that that behavior is optimal with respect to."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "And it's a great way to think about learning human preferences in the sense of you have a car and the person can drive it and then you can say, well, okay, I can actually learn what the person is optimizing for."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "I can learn their driving style, or you can have people demonstrate how they want the house clean."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "And then you can say, okay, this is, I'm getting the trade offs that they're making."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "I'm getting the preferences that they want out of this."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "And so we've been successful in robotics somewhat with this."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "And it's based on a very simple model of human behavior."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "It was remarkably simple, which is that human behavior is optimal with respect to whatever it is that people want, right?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "So you make that assumption and now you can kind of inverse through."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "That's why it's called inverse, well, really optimal control, but also inverse reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "So this is based on utility maximization in economics."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Back in the forties, von Neumann and Morgenstern were like, okay, people are making choices by maximizing utility, go."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And then in the late fifties, we had Luce and Shepherd come in and say, people are a little bit noisy and approximate in that process."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "So they might choose something kind of stochastically with probability proportional to how much utility something has."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So there's a bit of noise in there."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "This has translated into robotics and something that we call Boltzmann rationality."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "So it's a kind of an evolution of inverse reinforcement learning that accounts for human noise."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "And we've had some success with that too, for these tasks where it turns out people act noisily enough that you can't just do vanilla, the vanilla version."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "You can account for noise and still infer what they seem to want based on this."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Then now we're hitting tasks where that's not enough."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "And because... What are examples of spatial tasks?"}, {"time": 1243, "text": "So imagine you're trying to control some robot, that's fairly complicated."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "You're trying to control a robot arm because maybe you're a patient with a motor impairment and you have this wheelchair mounted arm and you're trying to control it around."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Or one task that we've looked at with Sergei is, and our students did, is a lunar lander."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "So I don't know if you know this Atari game, it's called Lunar Lander."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "It's really hard."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "People really suck at landing the thing."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "Mostly they just crash it left and right."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "Okay, so this is the kind of task we imagine you're trying to provide some assistance to a person operating such a robot where you want the kind of the autonomy to kick in, figure out what it is that you're trying to do and help you do it."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "It's really hard to do that for, say, Lunar Lander because people are all over the place."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "And so they seem much more noisy than really irrational."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "That's an example of a task where these models are kind of failing us."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And it's not surprising because we're talking about the 40s, utility, late 50s, sort of noisy."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "Then the 70s came and behavioral economics started being a thing where people were like, no, no, no, no, no, people are not rational."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "People are messy and emotional and irrational and have all sorts of heuristics that might be domain specific."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "And they're just a mess."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "So what does my robot do to understand what you want?"}, {"time": 1334, "text": "And it's a very, it's very, that's why it's complicated."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "It's, you know, for the most part, we get away with pretty simple models until we don't."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "And then the question is, what do you do then?"}, {"time": 1346, "text": "And I had days when I wanted to, you know, pack my bags and go home and switch jobs because it's just, it feels really daunting to make sense of human behavior enough that you can reliably understand what people want, especially as, you know, robot capabilities will continue to get developed."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "You'll get these systems that are more and more capable of all sorts of things."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "And then you really want to make sure that you're telling them the right thing to do."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "Well, read it in human behavior."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "So if I just sat here quietly and tried to understand something about you by listening to you talk, it would be harder than if I got to say something and ask you and interact and control."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "Can you, can the robot help its understanding of the human by influencing the behavior by actually acting?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "So one of the things that's been exciting to me lately is this notion that when you try to, that when you try to think of the robotics problem as, okay, I have a robot and it needs to optimize for whatever it is that a person wants it to optimize as opposed to maybe what a programmer said."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "That problem we think of as a human robot collaboration problem in which both agents get to act in which the robot knows less than the human because the human actually has access to, you know, at least implicitly to what it is that they want."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "They can't write it down, but they can talk about it."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "They can give all sorts of signals."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "They can demonstrate and, but the robot doesn't need to sit there and passively observe human behavior and try to make sense of it."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "The robot can act too."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "And so there's these information gathering actions that the robot can take to sort of solicit responses that are actually informative."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "So for instance, this is not for the purpose of assisting people, but with kind of back to coordinating with people in cars and all of that."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "One thing that Dorsa did was, so we were looking at cars being able to navigate around people and you might not know exactly the driving style of a particular individual that's next to you, but you wanna change lanes in front of them."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Navigating around other humans inside cars."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Yeah, good, good clarification question."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "So you have an autonomous car and it's trying to navigate the road around human driven vehicles."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "Similar things ideas apply to pedestrians as well, but let's just take human driven vehicles."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "So now you're trying to change a lane."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "Well, you could be trying to infer the driving style of this person next to you."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "You'd like to know if they're in particular, if they're sort of aggressive or defensive, if they're gonna let you kind of go in or if they're gonna not."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "And it's very difficult to just, if you think that if you wanna hedge your bets and say, ah, maybe they're actually pretty aggressive, I shouldn't try this."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "You kind of end up driving next to them and driving next to them, right?"}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And then you don't know because you're not actually getting the observations that you're getting away."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "Someone drives when they're next to you and they just need to go straight."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "It's kind of the same regardless if they're aggressive or defensive."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And so you need to enable the robot to reason about how it might actually be able to gather information by changing the actions that it's taking."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "And then the robot comes up with these cool things where it kind of nudges towards you and then sees if you're gonna slow down or not."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Then if you slow down, it sort of updates its model of you and says, oh, okay, you're more on the defensive side."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "So now I can actually like."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "That's a fascinating dance."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "That's so cool that you could use your own actions to gather information."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "That feels like a totally open, exciting new world of robotics."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "I mean, how many people are even thinking about that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1588, "text": "A handful of us, I'd say."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "It's rare because it's actually leveraging human."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "I mean, most roboticists, I've talked to a lot of colleagues and so on, are kind of, being honest, kind of afraid of humans."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "Because they're messy and complicated, right?"}, {"time": 1607, "text": "Going back to what we were talking about earlier, right now we're kind of in this dilemma of, okay, there are tasks that we can just assume people are approximately rational for and we can figure out what they want."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "We can figure out their goals."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "We can figure out their driving styles, whatever."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "There are these tasks that we can't."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "So what do we do, right?"}, {"time": 1623, "text": "Do we pack our bags and go home?"}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And this one, I've had a little bit of hope recently."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "And I'm kind of doubting myself because what do I know that, you know, 50 years of behavioral economics hasn't figured out."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "But maybe it's not really in contradiction with the way that field is headed."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "But basically one thing that we've been thinking about is, instead of kind of giving up and saying people are too crazy and irrational for us to make sense of them, maybe we can give them a bit the benefit of the doubt."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And maybe we can think of them as actually being relatively rational, but just under different assumptions about the world, about how the world works, about, you know, they don't have, when we think about rationality, implicit assumption is, oh, they're rational, and they're all the same assumptions and constraints as the robot, right?"}, {"time": 1679, "text": "What, if this is the state of the world, that's what they know."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "This is the transition function, that's what they know."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "This is the horizon, that's what they know."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "But maybe the kind of this difference, the way, the reason they can seem a little messy and hectic, especially to robots, is that perhaps they just make different assumptions or have different beliefs."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's another fascinating idea that this, our kind of anecdotal desire to say that humans are irrational, perhaps grounded in behavioral economics, is that we just don't understand the constraints and the rewards under which they operate."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "And so our goal shouldn't be to throw our hands up and say they're irrational, it's to say, let's try to understand what are the constraints."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "What it is that they must be assuming that makes this behavior make sense."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "Good life lesson, right?"}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Good life lesson."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "That's true, it's just outside of robotics."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "That's just good to, that's communicating with humans."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "That's just a good assume that you just don't, sort of empathy, right?"}, {"time": 1744, "text": "This is maybe there's something you're missing and it's, you know, it especially happens to robots cause they're kind of dumb and they don't know things."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And oftentimes people are sort of supra rational and that they actually know a lot of things that robots don't."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Sometimes like with the lunar lander, the robot, you know, knows much more."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "So it turns out that if you try to say, look, maybe people are operating this thing but assuming a much more simplified physics model cause they don't get the complexity of this kind of craft or the robot arm with seven degrees of freedom with these inertias and whatever."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "So maybe they have this intuitive physics model which is not, you know, this notion of intuitive physics is something that you studied actually in cognitive science was like Josh Denenbaum, Tom Griffith's work on this stuff."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "And what we found is that you can actually try to figure out what physics model kind of best explains human actions."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "And then you can use that to sort of correct what it is that they're commanding the craft to do."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "So they might, you know, be sending the craft somewhere but instead of executing that action, you can sort of take a step back and say, according to their intuitive, if the world worked according to their intuitive physics model, where do they think that the craft is going?"}, {"time": 1823, "text": "Where are they trying to send it to?"}, {"time": 1826, "text": "And then you can use the real physics, right?"}, {"time": 1828, "text": "The inverse of that to actually figure out what you should do so that you do that instead of where they were actually sending you in the real world."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And I kid you not at work people land the damn thing and you know, in between the two flags and all that."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "So it's not conclusive in any way but I'd say it's evidence that yeah, maybe we're kind of underestimating humans in some ways when we're giving up and saying, yeah, they're just crazy noisy."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "So then you try to explicitly try to model the kind of worldview that they have."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "That they have, that's right."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "And it's not too, I mean, there's things in behavior economics too that for instance have touched upon the planning horizon."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "So there's this idea that there's bounded rationality essentially and the idea that, well, maybe we work under computational constraints."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "And I think kind of our view recently has been take the Bellman update in AI and just break it in all sorts of ways by saying state, no, no, no, the person doesn't get to see the real state."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "Maybe they're estimating somehow."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Transition function, no, no, no, no, no."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "Even the actual reward evaluation, maybe they're still learning about what it is that they want."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "Like,

kind of problem spaces are you thinking about?"}, {"time": 1930, "text": "So is it robots, like wheeled robots with autonomous vehicles?"}, {"time": 1936, "text": "Is it object manipulation?"},

physical space, but it could just happen in the virtual space."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "So where's the boundaries of this field for you when you're thinking about the things we've been talking about?"}, {"time": 1971, "text": "Yeah, so I try to find kind of underlying, I don't know what to even call them."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "I try to work on, you know, I might call what I do, the kind of working on the foundations of algorithmic human robot interaction and trying to make contributions there."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "And it's important to me that whatever we do is actually somewhat domain agnostic when it comes to, is it about, you know, autonomous cars or is it about quadrotors or is it about, is this sort of the same underlying principles apply?"}, {"time": 2010, "text": "Of course, when you're trying to get a particular domain to work, you usually have to do some extra work to adapt that to that particular domain."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "But these things that we were talking about around, well, you know, how do you model humans?"}, {"time": 2022, "text": "It turns out that a lot of systems need to core benefit from a better understanding of how human behavior relates to what people want and need to predict human behavior, physical robots of all sorts and beyond that."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "And so I used to do manipulation."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "I used to be, you know, picking up stuff and then I was picking up stuff with people around."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "And now it's sort of very broad when it comes to the application level, but in a sense, very focused on, okay, how does the problem need to change?"}, {"time": 2054, "text": "How do the algorithms need to change when we're not doing a robot by itself?"}, {"time": 2059, "text": "You know, emptying the dishwasher, but we're stepping outside of that."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "I thought that popped into my head just now."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "On the game theoretic side, I think you said this really interesting idea of using actions to gain more information."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "But if we think of sort of game theory, the humans that are interacting with you, with you, the robot?"}, {"time": 2084, "text": "Wow, I'm thinking the identity of the robot."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "Yeah, I do that all the time."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "Yeah, is they also have a world model of you and you can manipulate that."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "I mean, if we look at autonomous vehicles, people have a certain viewpoint."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "You said with the kids, people see Alexa in a certain way."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "Is there some value in trying to also optimize how people see you as a robot?"}, {"time": 2115, "text": "Or is that a little too far away from the specifics of what we can solve right now?"}, {"time": 2121, "text": "So, well, both, right?"}, {"time": 2124, "text": "So it's really interesting."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "And we've seen a little bit of progress on this problem, on pieces of this problem."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "So you can, again, it kind of comes down to how complicated does the human model need to be?"}, {"time": 2138, "text": "But in one piece of work that we were looking at, we just said, okay, there's these parameters that are internal to the robot and what the robot is about to do, or maybe what objective, what driving style the robot has or something like that."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "And what we're gonna do is we're gonna set up a system where part of the state is the person's belief over those parameters."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "And now when the robot acts, that the person gets new evidence about this robot internal state."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "And so they're updating their mental model of the robot."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "So if they see a car that sort of cuts someone off, they're like, oh, that's an aggressive car."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "They know more."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "If they see sort of a robot head towards a particular door, they're like, oh yeah, the robot's trying to get to that door."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "So this thing that we have to do with humans to try and understand their goals and intentions, humans are inevitably gonna do that to robots."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And then that raises this interesting question that you asked, which is, can we do something about that?"}, {"time": 2198, "text": "This is gonna happen inevitably, but we can sort of be more confusing or less confusing to people."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "And it turns out you can optimize for being more informative and less confusing if you have an understanding of how your actions are being interpreted by the human, and how they're using these actions to update their belief."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "And honestly, all we did is just Bayes rule."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "Basically, okay, the person has a belief, they see an action, they make some assumptions about how the robot generates its actions, presumably as being rational, because robots are rational."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "It's reasonable to assume that about them."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "And then they incorporate that new piece of evidence in the Bayesian sense in their belief, and they obtain a posterior."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "And now the robot is trying to figure out what actions to take such that it steers the person's belief to put as much probability mass as possible on the correct parameters."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "So that's kind of a mathematical formalization of that."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "But my worry, and I don't know if you wanna go there with me, but I talk about this quite a bit."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "The kids talking to Alexa disrespectfully worries me."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "I worry in general about human nature."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "Like I said, I grew up in Soviet Union, World War II, I'm a Jew too, so with the Holocaust and everything."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "I just worry about how we humans sometimes treat the other, the group that we call the other, whatever it is."}, {"time": 2285, "text": "Through human history, the group that's the other has been changed faces."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "But it seems like the robot will be the other, the other, the next other."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "And one thing is it feels to me that robots don't get no respect."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "They get shoved around."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "Shoved around, and is there, one, at the shallow level, for a better experience, it seems that robots need to talk back a little bit."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "Like my intuition says, I mean, most companies from sort of Roomba, autonomous vehicle companies might not be so happy with the idea that a robot has a little bit of an attitude."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "But I feel, it feels to me that that's necessary to create a compelling experience."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "Like we humans don't seem to respect anything that doesn't give us some attitude."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "That, or like a mix of mystery and attitude and anger and that threatens us subtly, maybe passive aggressively."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "It seems like we humans, yeah, need that."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "Do you, what are your, is there something, you have thoughts on this?"}, {"time": 2351, "text": "All right, I'll give you two thoughts on this."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "One is, one is, it's, we respond to, you know, someone being assertive, but we also respond to someone being vulnerable."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "So I think robots, my first thought is that robots get shoved around and bullied a lot because they're sort of, you know, tempting and they're sort of showing off or they appear to be showing off."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "And so I think going back to these things we were talking about in the beginning of making robots a little more, a little more expressive, a little bit more like, eh, that wasn't cool to do."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "And now I'm bummed, right?"}, {"time": 2389, "text": "I think that that can actually help because people can't help but anthropomorphize and respond to that."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "Even that though, the emotion being communicated is not in any way a real thing."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "And people know that it's not a real thing because they know it's just a machine."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "We're still interpreting, you know, we watch, there's this famous psychology experiment with little triangles and kind of dots on a screen and a triangle is chasing the square and you get really angry at the darn triangle because why is it not leaving the square alone?"}, {"time": 2418, "text": "So that's, yeah, we can't help."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "So that was the first thought."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "The vulnerability, that's really interesting that, I think of like being, pushing back, being assertive as the only mechanism of getting, of forming a connection, of getting respect, but perhaps vulnerability, perhaps there's other mechanisms that are less threatening."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "Well, I think, well, a little bit, yes, but then this other thing that we can think about is, it goes back to what you were saying, that interaction is really game theoretic, right?"}, {"time": 2450, "text": "So the moment you're taking actions in a space, the humans are taking actions in that same space, but you have your own objective, which is, you know, you're a car, you need to get your passenger to the destination."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "And then the human nearby has their own objective, which somewhat overlaps with you, but not entirely."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "You're not interested in getting into an accident with each other, but you have different destinations and you wanna get home faster and they wanna get home faster."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "And that's a general sum game at that point."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "And so that's, I think that's what, treating it as such is kind of a way we can step outside of this kind of mode that, where you try to anticipate what people do and you don't realize you have any influence over it while still protecting yourself because you're understanding that people also understand that they can influence you."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "And it's just kind of back and forth is this negotiation, which is really talking about different equilibria of a game."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "The very basic way to solve coordination is to just make predictions about what people will do and then stay out of their way."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "And that's hard for the reasons we talked about, which is how you have to understand people's intentions implicitly, explicitly, who knows, but somehow you have to get enough of an understanding of that to be able to anticipate what happens next."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "And so that's challenging."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "But then it's further challenged by the fact that people change what they do based on what you do because they don't plan in isolation either, right?"}, {"time": 2541, "text": "So when you see cars trying to merge on a highway and not succeeding, one of the reasons this can be is because they look at traffic that keeps coming, they predict what these people are planning on doing, which is to just keep going, and then they stay out of the way because there's no feasible plan, right?"}, {"time": 2562, "text": "Any plan would actually intersect with one of these other people."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "So that's bad, so you get stuck there."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "So now kind of if you start thinking about it as no, no, no, actually these people change what they do depending on what the car does."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Like if the car actually tries to kind of inch itself forward, they might actually slow down and let the car in."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "And now taking advantage of that, well, that's kind of the next level."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "We call this like this underactuated system idea where it's kind of underactuated system robotics, but it's kind of, you're influenced these other degrees of freedom, but you don't get to decide what they do."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "I've somewhere seen you mention it, the human element in this picture as underactuated."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "So you understand underactuated robotics is that you can't fully control the system."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "You can't go in arbitrary directions in the configuration space."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "Under your control."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "Yeah, it's a very simple way of underactuation where basically there's literally these degrees of freedom that you can control, and these degrees of freedom that you can't, but you influence them."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "And I think that's the important part is that they don't do whatever, regardless of what you do, that what you do influences what they end up doing."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "I just also like the poetry of calling human robot interaction an underactuated robotics problem."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "And you also mentioned sort of nudging."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "It seems that they're, I don't know."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "I think about this a lot in the case of pedestrians I've collected hundreds of hours of videos."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "I like to just watch pedestrians."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "And it seems that."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "It's a funny hobby."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "Yeah, it's weird."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "Cause I learn a lot."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "I learned a lot about myself, about our human behavior, from watching pedestrians, watching people in their environment."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "Basically crossing the street is like you're putting your life on the line."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "I don't know, tens of millions of time in America every day is people are just like playing this weird game of chicken when they cross the street, especially when there's some ambiguity about the right of way."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "That has to do either with the rules of the road or with the general personality of the intersection based on the time of day and so on."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "And this nudging idea, it seems that people don't even nudge."}, {"time": 2707, "text": "They just aggressively take, make a decision."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "Somebody, there's a runner that gave me this advice."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "I sometimes run in the street, not in the street, on the sidewalk."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "And he said that if you don't make eye contact with people when you're running, they will all move out of your way."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "It's called civil inattention."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "Civil inattention, that's a thing."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "Oh wow, I need to look this up, but it works."}, {"time": 2732, "text": "My sense was if you communicate like confidence in your actions that you're unlikely to deviate from the action that you're following, that's a really powerful signal to others that they need to plan around your actions."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "As opposed to nudging where you're sort of hesitantly, then the hesitation might communicate that you're still in the dance and the game that they can influence with their own actions."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "I've recently had a conversation with Jim Keller, who's a sort of this legendary chip architect, but he also led the autopilot team for a while."}, {"time": 2772, "text": "And his intuition that driving is fundamentally still like a ballistics problem."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "Like you can ignore the human element that is just not hitting things."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "And you can kind of learn the right dynamics required to do the merger and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "And then my sense is, and I don't know if I can provide sort of definitive proof of this, but my sense is like an order of magnitude are more difficult when humans are involved."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "Like it's not simply object collision avoidance problem."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "Where does your intuition, of course, nobody knows the right answer here, but where does your intuition fall on the difficulty, fundamental difficulty of the driving problem when humans are involved?"}, {"time": 2820, "text": "I have many opinions on this."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "Imagine downtown San Francisco."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "Yeah, it's crazy, busy, everything."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "Okay, now take all the humans out."}, {"time": 2832, "text": "No pedestrians, no human driven vehicles, no cyclists, no people on little electric scooters zipping around, nothing."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "I think we're done."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "I think driving at that point is done."}, {"time": 2845, "text": "There's nothing really that still needs to be solved about that."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "Well, let's pause there."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "I think I agree with you and I think a lot of people that will hear will agree with that, but we need to sort of internalize that idea."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "So what's the problem there?"}, {"time": 2862, "text": "Cause we might not quite yet be done with that."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "Cause a lot of people kind of focus on the perception problem."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "A lot of people kind of map autonomous driving into how close are we to solving, being able to detect all the, you know, the drivable area, the objects in the scene."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "Do you see that as a, how hard is that problem?"}, {"time": 2887, "text": "So your intuition there behind your statement was we might have not solved it yet, but we're close to solving basically the perception problem."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "I think the perception problem, I mean, and by the way, a bunch of years ago, this would not have been true."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "And a lot of issues in the space were coming from the fact that, oh, we don't really, you know, we don't know what's where."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "But I think it's fairly safe to say that at this point, although you could always improve on things and all of that, you can drive through downtown San Francisco if there are no people around."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "There's no really perception issues standing in your way there."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "I think perception is hard, but yeah, it's, we've made a lot of progress on the perception, so I had to undermine the difficulty of the problem."}, {"time": 2930, "text": "I think everything about robotics is really difficult, of course, I think that, you know, the planning problem, the control problem, all very difficult, but I think what's, what makes it really kind of, yeah."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "It might be, I mean, you know, and I picked downtown San Francisco, it's adapting to, well, now it's snowing, now it's no longer snowing, now it's slippery in this way, now it's the dynamics part could, I could imagine being still somewhat challenging, but."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "No, the thing that I think worries us, and our intuition's not good there, is the perception problem at the edge cases."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "Sort of downtown San Francisco, the nice thing, it's not actually, it may not be a good example because."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "Because you know what you're getting from, well, there's like crazy construction zones and all of that."}, {"time": 2983, "text": "Yeah, but the thing is, you're traveling at slow speeds, so like it doesn't feel dangerous."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "To me, what feels dangerous is highway speeds, when everything is, to us humans, super clear."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "Yeah, I'm assuming LiDAR here, by the way."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "I think it's kind of irresponsible to not use LiDAR."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "That's just my personal opinion."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "That's, I mean, depending on your use case, but I think like, you know, if you have the opportunity to use LiDAR, in a lot of cases, you might not."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "Good, your intuition makes more sense now."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "So you don't think vision."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "I really just don't know enough to say, well, vision alone, what, you know, what's like, there's a lot of, how many cameras do you have?"}, {"time": 3024, "text": "Is it, how are you using them?"}, {"time": 3025, "text": "There's details."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "There's all, there's all sorts of details."},

using LiDAR."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "That's kind of the safety focus."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "But then the sort of the, I also sympathize with the Elon Musk statement of LiDAR is a crutch."},

kind of true in the sense that if, you know, we want to stick to the comfort zone, you see this in academic and research settings all the time, the things that work force you to not explore outside, think outside the box."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "I mean, that happens all the time."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "The problem is in the safety critical systems, you kind of want to stick with the things that work."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "So it's an interesting and difficult trade off in the case of real world sort of safety critical robotic systems, but so your intuition is, just to clarify, how, I mean, how hard is this human element for, like how hard is driving when this human element is involved?"}, {"time": 3115, "text": "Are we years, decades away from solving it?"}, {"time": 3120, "text": "But perhaps actually the year isn't the thing I'm asking."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "It doesn't matter what the timeline is, but do you think we're, how many breakthroughs are we away from in solving the human robotic interaction problem to get this, to get this right?"}, {"time": 3135, "text": "I think it, in a sense, it really depends."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "I think that, you know, we were talking about how, well, look, it's really hard because anticipate what people do is hard."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "And on top of that, playing the game is hard."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "But I think we sort of have the fundamental, some of the fundamental understanding for that."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "And then you already see that these systems are being deployed in the real world, you know, even driverless."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "Like there's, I think now a few companies that don't have a driver in the car in some small areas."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "I got a chance to, I went to Phoenix and I, I shot a video with Waymo and I needed to get that video out."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "People have been giving me slack, but there's incredible engineering work being done there."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "And it's one of those other seminal moments for me in my life to be able to, it sounds silly, but to be able to drive without a ride, sorry, without a driver in the seat."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "I mean, that was an incredible robotics."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "I was driven by a robot without being able to take over, without being able to take the steering wheel."}, {"time": 3211, "text": "That's a magical, that's a magical moment."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "So in that regard, in those domains, at least for like Waymo, they're solving that human, there's, I mean, they're going, I mean, it felt fast because you're like freaking out at first."}, {"time": 3225, "text": "That was, this is my first experience, but it's going like the speed limit, right?"}, {"time": 3229, "text": "30, 40, whatever it is."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "And there's humans and it deals with them quite well."}, {"time": 3233, "text": "It detects them, it negotiates the intersections, the left turns and all of that."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "So at least in those domains, it's solving them."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "The open question for me is like, how quickly can we expand?"}, {"time": 3246, "text": "You know, that's the, you know, outside of the weather conditions, all of those kinds of things, how quickly can we expand to like cities like San Francisco?"}, {"time": 3254, "text": "Yeah, and I wouldn't say that it's just, you know, now it's just pure engineering and it's probably the, I mean, and by the way, I'm speaking kind of very generally here as hypothesizing, but I think that there are successes and yet no one is everywhere out there."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "So that seems to suggest that things can be expanded and can be scaled and we know how to do a lot of things, but there's still probably, you know, new algorithms or modified algorithms that you still need to put in there as you learn more and more about new challenges that you get faced with."}, {"time": 3295, "text": "How much of this problem do you think can be learned through end to end?"}, {"time": 3299, "text": "Is it the success of machine learning and reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 3302, "text": "How much of it can be learned from sort of data from scratch and how much, which most of the success of autonomous vehicle systems have a lot of heuristics and rule based stuff on top, like human expertise injected forced into the system to make it work."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "How much, what will be the role of learning in the near term and long term?"}, {"time": 3328, "text": "I think on the one hand that learning is inevitable here, right?"}, {"time": 3337, "text": "I think on the other hand that when people characterize the problem as it's a bunch of rules that some people wrote down, versus it's an end to end RL system or imitation learning, then maybe there's kind of something missing from maybe that's more."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "So for instance, I think a very, very useful tool in this sort of problem, both in how to generate the car's behavior and robots in general and how to model human beings is actually planning, search optimization, right?"}, {"time": 3375, "text": "So robotics is the sequential decision making problem."}, {"time": 3378, "text": "And when a robot can figure out on its own how to achieve its goal without hitting stuff and all that stuff, right?"}, {"time": 3390, "text": "All the good stuff for motion planning 101, I think of that as very much AI, not this is some rule or something."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "There's nothing rule based around that, right?"}, {"time": 3400, "text": "It's just you're searching through a space and figuring out are you optimizing through a space and figure out what seems to be the right thing to do."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "And I think it's hard to just do that because you need to learn models of the world."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "And I think it's hard to just do the learning part where you don't bother with any of that, because then you're saying, well, I could do imitation, but then when I go off distribution, I'm really screwed."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "Or you can say, I can do reinforcement learning, which adds a lot of robustness, but then you have to do either reinforcement learning in the real world, which sounds a little challenging or that trial and error, you know, or you have to do reinforcement learning in simulation."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "And then that means, well, guess what?"}, {"time": 3443, "text": "You need to model things, at least to model people, model the world enough that whatever policy you get of that is actually fine to roll out in the world and do some additional learning there."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "Do you think simulation, by the way, just a quick tangent has a role in the human robot interaction space?"}, {"time": 3464, "text": "Like, is it useful?"}, {"time": 3466, "text": "It seems like humans, everything we've been talking about are difficult to model and simulate."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "Do you think simulation has a role in this space?"}, {"time": 3474, "text": "I think so because you can take models and train with them ahead of time, for instance."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "But the models, sorry to interrupt, the models are sort of human constructed or learned?"}, {"time": 3490, "text": "I think they have to be a combination because if you get some human data and then you say, this is how, this is gonna be my model of the person."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "What are for simulation and training or for just deployment time?"}, {"time": 3505, "text": "And that's what I'm planning with as my model of how people work."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "Regardless, if you take some data and you don't assume anything else and you just say, okay, this is some data that I've collected."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "Let me fit a policy to how people work based on that."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "What tends to happen is you collected some data and some distribution, and then now your robot sort of computes a best response to that, right?"}, {"time": 3532, "text": "It's sort of like, what should I do if this is how people work?"}, {"time": 3536, "text": "And easily goes off of distribution where that model that you've built of the human completely sucks because out of distribution, you have no idea, right?"}, {"time": 3545, "text": "If you think of all the possible policies and then you take only the ones that are consistent with the human data that you've observed, that still leads a lot of, a lot of things could happen outside of that distribution where you're confident then you know what's going on."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "By the way, that's, I mean, I've gotten used to this terminology of not a distribution, but it's such a machine learning terminology because it kind of assumes, so distribution is referring to the data that you've seen."}, {"time": 3576, "text": "The set of states that you encounter at training time."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "They've encountered so far at training time."}, {"time": 3580, "text": "But it kind of also implies that there's a nice like statistical model that represents that data."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "So out of distribution feels like, I don't know, it raises to me philosophical questions of how we humans reason out of distribution, reason about things that are completely, we haven't seen before."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "And so, and what we're talking about here is how do we reason about what other people do in situations where we haven't seen them?"}, {"time": 3611, "text": "And somehow we just magically navigate that."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "I can anticipate what will happen in situations that are even novel in many ways."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And I have a pretty good intuition for, I don't always get it right, but you know, and I might be a little uncertain and so on."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "But I think it's this that if you just rely on data, you know, there's just too many possibilities, there's too many policies out there that fit the data."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "And by the way, it's not just state, it's really kind of history of state, cause to really be able to anticipate what the person will do, it kind of depends on what they've been doing so far, cause that's the information you need to kind of, at least implicitly sort of say, oh, this is the kind of person that this is, this is probably what they're trying to do."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "So anyway, it's like you're trying to map history of states to actions, there's many mappings."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "And history meaning like the last few seconds or the last few minutes or the last few months."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "Who knows, who knows how much you need, right?"}, {"time": 3664, "text": "In terms of if your state is really like the positions of everything or whatnot and velocities, who knows how much you need."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "And then there's so many mappings."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "And so now you're talking about how do you regularize that space?"}, {"time": 3677, "text": "What priors do you impose or what's the inductive bias?"}, {"time": 3681, "text": "So, you know, there's all very related things to think about it."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "Basically, what are assumptions that we should be making such that these models actually generalize outside of the data that we've seen?"}, {"time": 3695, "text": "And now you're talking about, well, I don't know, what can you assume?"}, {"time": 3698, "text": "Maybe you can assume that people like actually have intentions and that's what drives their actions."}, {"time": 3703, "text": "Maybe that's, you know, the right thing to do when you haven't seen data very nearby that tells you otherwise."}, {"time": 3711, "text": "I don't know, it's a very open question."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "Do you think sort of that one of the dreams of artificial intelligence was to solve common sense reasoning, whatever the heck that means."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "Do you think something like common sense reasoning has to be solved in part to be able to solve this dance of human robot interaction, the driving space or human robot interaction in general?"}, {"time": 3734, "text": "Do you have to be able to reason about these kinds of common sense concepts of physics, of, you know, all the things we've been talking about humans, I don't even know how to express them with words, but the basics of human behavior, a fear of death."}, {"time": 3754, "text": "So like, to me, it's really important to encode in some kind of sense, maybe not, maybe it's implicit, but it feels that it's important to explicitly encode the fear of death, that people don't wanna die."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "Because it seems silly, but like the game of chicken that involves with the pedestrian crossing the street is playing with the idea of mortality."}, {"time": 3783, "text": "Like we really don't wanna die."}, {"time": 3784, "text": "It's not just like a negative reward."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "I don't know, it just feels like all these human concepts have to be encoded."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "Do you share that sense or is this a lot simpler than I'm making out to be?"}, {"time": 3795, "text": "I think it might be simpler."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "And I'm the person who likes to complicate things."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "I think it might be simpler than that."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "Because it turns out, for instance, if you say model people in the very, I'll call it traditional, I don't know if it's fair to look at it as a traditional way, but you know, calling people as, okay, they're rational somehow, the utilitarian perspective."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "Well, in that, once you say that, you automatically capture that they have an incentive to keep on being."}, {"time": 3830, "text": "You know, Stuart likes to say, you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead."}, {"time": 3836, "text": "Stuart Russell, by the way."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "So when you're sort of treating agents as having these objectives, these incentives, humans or artificial, you're kind of implicitly modeling that they'd like to stick around so that they can accomplish those goals."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "So I think in a sense, maybe that's what draws me so much to the rationality framework, even though it's so broken, we've been able to, it's been such a useful perspective."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "And like we were talking about earlier, what's the alternative?"}, {"time": 3873, "text": "I give up and go home or, you know, I just use complete black boxes, but then I don't know what to assume out of distribution that come back to this."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "It's just, it's been a very fruitful way to think about the problem in a very more positive way, right?"}, {"time": 3887, "text": "People aren't just crazy."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "Maybe they make more sense than we think."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "But I think we also have to somehow be ready for it to be wrong, be able to detect when these assumptions aren't holding, be all of that stuff."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "Let me ask sort of another small side of this that we've been talking about the pure autonomous driving problem, but there's also relatively successful systems already deployed out there in what you may call like level two autonomy or semi autonomous vehicles, whether that's Tesla Autopilot, work quite a bit with Cadillac SuperGuru system, which has a driver facing camera that detects your state."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "There's a bunch of basically lane centering systems."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "What's your sense about this kind of way of dealing with the human robot interaction problem by having a really dumb robot and relying on the human to help the robot out to keep them both alive?"}, {"time": 3953, "text": "Is that from the research perspective, how difficult is that problem?"}, {"time": 3959, "text": "And from a practical deployment perspective, is that a fruitful way to approach this human robot interaction problem?"}, {"time": 3968, "text": "I think what we have to be careful about there is to not, it seems like some of these systems, not all are making this underlying assumption that if, so I'm a driver and I'm now really not driving, but supervising and my job is to intervene, right?"}, {"time": 3988, "text": "And so we have to be careful with this assumption that when I'm, if I'm supervising, I will be just as safe as when I'm driving."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "That I will, if I wouldn't get into some kind of accident, if I'm driving, I will be able to avoid that accident when I'm supervising too."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "And I think I'm concerned about this assumption from a few perspectives."}, {"time": 4016, "text": "So from a technical perspective, it's that when you let something kind of take control and do its thing, and it depends on what that thing is, obviously, and how much it's taking control and how, what things are you trusting it to do."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "But if you let it do its thing and take control, it will go to what we might call off policy from the person's perspective state."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "So states that the person wouldn't actually find themselves in if they were the ones driving."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "And the assumption that the person functions just as well there as they function in the states that they would normally encounter is a little questionable."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "Now, another part is the kind of the human factor side of this, which is that I don't know about you, but I think I definitely feel like I'm experiencing things very differently when I'm actively engaged in the task versus when I'm a passive observer."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "Like even if I try to stay engaged, right?"}, {"time": 4069, "text": "It's very different than when I'm actually actively making decisions."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "And you see this in life in general."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "Like you see students who are actively trying to come up with the answer, learn this thing better than when they're passively told the answer."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "I think that's somewhat related."}, {"time": 4084, "text": "And I think people have studied this in human factors for airplanes."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "And I think it's actually fairly established that these two are not the same."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "On that point, because I've gotten a huge amount of heat on this and I stand by it."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "Because I know the human factors community well and the work here is really strong."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "And there's many decades of work showing exactly what you're saying."}, {"time": 4108, "text": "Nevertheless, I've been continuously surprised that much of the predictions of that work has been wrong in what I've seen."}, {"time": 4115, "text": "So what we have to do, I still agree with everything you said, but we have to be a little bit more open minded."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "So the, I'll tell you, there's a few surprising things that supervise, like everything you said to the word is actually exactly correct."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "But it doesn't say, what you didn't say is that these systems are, you said you can't assume a bunch of things, but we don't know if these systems are fundamentally unsafe."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "That's still unknown."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "There's a lot of interesting things, like I'm surprised by the fact, not the fact, that what seems to be anecdotally from, well, from large data collection that we've done, but also from just talking to a lot of people, when in the supervisory role of semi autonomous systems that are sufficiently dumb, at least, which is, that might be the key element, is the systems have to be dumb."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "The people are actually more energized as observers."}, {"time": 4178, "text": "So they're actually better, they're better at observing the situation."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "So there might be cases in systems, if you get the interaction right, where you, as a supervisor, will do a better job with the system together."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "I agree, I think that is actually really possible."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "I guess mainly I'm pointing out that if you do it naively, you're implicitly assuming something, that assumption might actually really be wrong."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "But I do think that if you explicitly think about what the agent should do so that the person still stays engaged."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "What the, so that you essentially empower the person to do more than they could, that's really the goal, right?"}, {"time": 4219, "text": "Is you still have a driver, so you wanna empower them to be so much better than they would be by themselves."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "And that's different, it's a very different mindset than I want them to basically not drive, right?"}, {"time": 4233, "text": "And, but be ready to sort of take over."}, {"time": 4240, "text": "So one of the interesting things we've been talking about is the rewards, that they seem to be fundamental too, the way robots behaves."}, {"time": 4249, "text": "So broadly speaking, we've been talking about utility functions and so on, but could you comment on how do we approach the design of reward functions?"}, {"time": 4259, "text": "Like, how do we come up with good reward functions?"}, {"time": 4262, "text": "Well, really good question, because the answer is we don't."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "This was, you know, I used to think, I used to think about how, well, it's actually really hard to specify rewards for interaction because it's really supposed to be what the people want, and then you really, you know, we talked about how you have to customize what you wanna do to the end user."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "But I kind of realized that even if you take the interactive component away, it's still really hard to design reward functions."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "So I do motion planning on my robot arm, I specify some cost function like, you know, this is how far away you should try to stay, so much it matters to stay away from people, and this is how much it matters to be able to be efficient and blah, blah, blah, right?"}, {"time": 4353, "text": "I need to make sure that whatever I specified, those constraints or trade offs or whatever they are, that when the robot goes and solves that problem in every new situation, that behavior is the behavior that I wanna see."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "And what I've been finding is that we have no idea how to do that."}, {"time": 4428, "text": "And so I think this is a lesson that I don't know, kind of, I guess I close my eyes to it for a while cause I've been, you know, tuning cost functions for 10 years now, but it's really strikes me that, yeah, we've moved the tuning and the like designing of features or whatever from the behavior side into the reward side."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "And yes, I agree that there's way less of it, but it still seems really hard to anticipate any possible situation and make sure you specify a reward function that when optimized will work well in every possible situation."}, {"time": 4475, "text": "So you're kind of referring to unintended consequences or just in general, any kind of suboptimal behavior that emerges outside of the things you said, out of distribution."}, {"time": 4486, "text": "Suboptimal behavior that is, you know, actually optimal."}, {"time": 4489, "text": "I mean, this, I guess the idea of unintended consequences, you know, it's optimal respect to what you specified, but it's not what you want."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "And there's a difference between those."}, {"time": 4497, "text": "But that's not fundamentally a robotics problem, right?"}, {"time": 4499, "text": "That's a human problem."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "That's the thing, right?"}, {"time": 4503, "text": "So there's this thing called Goodhart's law, which is you set a metric for an organization and the moment it becomes a target that people actually optimize for, it's no longer a good metric."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "What's it called?"}, {"time": 4517, "text": "So the moment you specify a metric, it stops doing its job."}, {"time": 4521, "text": "Yeah, it stops doing its job."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "So there's, yeah, there's such a thing as optimizing for things and, you know, failing to think ahead of time of all the possible things that might be important."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "And so that's, so that's interesting because Historia works a lot on reward learning from the perspective of customizing to the end user, but it really seems like it's not just the interaction with the end user that's a problem of the human and the robot collaborating so that the robot can do what the human wants, right?"}, {"time": 4555, "text": "This kind of back and forth, the robot probing, the person being informative, all of that stuff might be actually just as applicable to this kind of maybe new form of human robot interaction, which is the interaction between the robot and the expert programmer, roboticist designer in charge of actually specifying what the heck the robot should do, specifying the task for the robot."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "That's so cool, like collaborating on the reward design."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "Right, collaborating on the reward design."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "And so what does it mean, right?"}, {"time": 4588, "text": "What does it, when we think about the problem, not as someone specifies all of your job is to optimize, and we start thinking about you're in this interaction and this collaboration."}, {"time": 4599, "text": "And the first thing that comes up is when the person specifies a reward, it's not, you know, gospel, it's not like the letter of the law."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "It's not the definition of the reward function you should be optimizing, because they're doing their best, but they're not some magic perfect oracle."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "And the sooner we start understanding that, I think the sooner we'll get to more robust robots that function better in different situations."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "And then you have kind of say, okay, well, it's almost like robots are over learning, over putting too much weight on the reward specified by definition, and maybe leaving a lot of other information on the table, like what are other things we could do to actually communicate to the robot about what we want them to do besides attempting to specify a reward function."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "Yeah, you have this awesome, and again, I love the poetry of it, of leaked information."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "So you mentioned humans leak information about what they want, you know, leak reward signal for the robot."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "So how do we detect these leaks?"}, {"time": 4668, "text": "Yeah, what are these leaks?"}, {"time": 4669, "text": "Whether it just, I don't know, those were just recently saw it, read it, I don't know where from you, and it's gonna stick with me for a while for some reason, because it's not explicitly expressed."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "It kind of leaks indirectly from our behavior."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "From what we do, yeah, absolutely."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "So I think maybe some surprising bits, right?"}, {"time": 4691, "text": "So we were talking before about, I'm a robot arm, it needs to move around people, carry stuff, put stuff away, all of that."}, {"time": 4700, "text": "And now imagine that, you know, the robot has some initial objective that the programmer gave it so they can do all these things functionally."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "It's capable of doing that."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "And now I noticed that it's doing something and maybe it's coming too close to me, right?"}, {"time": 4719, "text": "And maybe I'm the designer, maybe I'm the end user and this robot is now in my home."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "And I push it away."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "So I push away because, you know, it's a reaction to what the robot is currently doing."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "And this is what we call physical human robot interaction."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "And now there's a lot of interesting work on how the heck do you respond to physical human robot interaction?"}, {"time": 4741, "text": "What should the robot do if such an event occurs?"}, {"time": 4743, "text": "And there's sort of different schools of thought."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "Well, you know, you can sort of treat it the control theoretic way and say, this is a disturbance that you must reject."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "You can sort of treat it more kind of heuristically and say, I'm gonna go into some like gravity compensation mode so that I'm easily maneuverable around."}, {"time": 4759, "text": "I'm gonna go in the direction that the person pushed me."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "And to us, part of realization has been that that is signal that communicates about the reward."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "Because if my robot was moving in an optimal way and I intervened, that means that I disagree with his notion of optimality, right?"}, {"time": 4780, "text": "Whatever it thinks is optimal is not actually optimal."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "And sort of optimization problems aside, that means that the cost function, the reward function is incorrect, or at least is not what I want it to be."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "How difficult is that signal to interpret and make actionable?"}, {"time": 4799, "text": "So like, cause this connects to our autonomous vehicle discussion where they're in the semi autonomous vehicle or autonomous vehicle when a safety driver disengages the car, like, but they could have disengaged it for a million reasons."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "Yeah, so that's true."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "Again, it comes back to, can you structure a little bit your assumptions about how human behavior relates to what they want?"}, {"time": 4824, "text": "And you can, one thing that we've done is literally just treated this external torque that they applied as, when you take that and you add it with what the torque the robot was already applying, that overall action is probably relatively optimal in respect to whatever it is that the person wants."}, {"time": 4841, "text": "And then that gives you information about what it is that they want."}, {"time": 4844, "text": "So you can learn that people want you to stay further away from them."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "Now you're right that there might be many things that explain just that one signal and that you might need much more data than that for the person to be able to shape your reward function over time."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "You can also do this info gathering stuff that we were talking about."}, {"time": 4861, "text": "Not that we've done that in that context, just to clarify, but it's definitely something we thought about where you can have the robot start acting in a way, like if there's a bunch of different explanations, right?"}, {"time": 4873, "text": "It moves in a way where it sees if you correct it in some other way or not, and then kind of actually plans its motion so that it can disambiguate and collect information about what you want."}, {"time": 4884, "text": "Anyway, so that's one way, that's kind of sort of leaked information, maybe even more subtle leaked information is if I just press the E stop, right?"}, {"time": 4892, "text": "I just, I'm doing it out of panic because the robot is about to do something bad."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "There's again, information there, right?"}, {"time": 4898, "text": "Okay, the robot should definitely stop, but it should also figure out that whatever it was about to do was not good."}, {"time": 4905, "text": "And in fact, it was so not good that stopping and remaining stopped for a while was a better trajectory for it than whatever it is that it was about to do."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "And that again is information about what are my preferences, what do I want?"}, {"time": 4917, "text": "Speaking of E stops, what are your expert opinions on the three laws of robotics from Isaac Asimov that don't harm humans, obey orders, protect yourself?"}, {"time": 4931, "text": "I mean, it's such a silly notion, but I speak to so many people these days, just regular folks, just, I don't know, my parents and so on about robotics."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "And they kind of operate in that space of, you know, imagining our future with robots and thinking what are the ethical, how do we get that dance right?"}, {"time": 4951, "text": "I know the three laws might be a silly notion, but do you think about like what universal reward functions that might

is good evidence about what the person wants."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "And I should interpret that evidence in the context of these situations that it was specified for."}, {"time": 5051, "text":

you still go through that process and and by way of advice for people that are more sort of amateurish like me, how to deal with that quitting voice?"}, {"time": 601, "text": "I think a lot of times when the quitting voice kind of comes in, it, what it does is it kind of just, it comes in with the added disadvantage, I guess, in this situation of being kind of a narrow scoped view where you're looking at like, what it's doing to you in the moment or how you're feeling in the moment versus how are you feeling about the whole process?"}, {"time": 623, "text": "So one thing that I started

race or an event or something like that, it's often four, six months out ahead of time, you're planning to like kind of do a series of workouts and a flow of things where you're going through the process of getting fit, getting ready, preparing for the specifics of the day and all that stuff."}, {"time": 676, "text": "And then you get to the race itself or the event itself."}, {"time": 676, "text": "And it's very easy to look at that and think that's an isolation."}, {"time": 680, "text": "Like I'm going to run 12 hours today, or I'm going to run a hundred miles today or whatever it ends up being."}, {"time": 686, "text": "And it's a lot easier to quit when you think to yourself, I'm 40 miles into a hundred mile race."}, {"time": 691, "text": "You know, that's just a 40 mile run, which sounds kind of silly to most people, but in perspective, then we're talking about the ultra marathon running community."}, {"time": 703, "text": "You know, it's a lot easier just to say like, well, you know, I'll scrap this 40 miles and try again."}, {"time": 707, "text": "It's a lot harder to say I'm going to scrap the entire last four months, the entire reason why I was doing it, the countless hours I spent in there."}, {"time": 718, "text": "So I think I just try to reposition it of like, I'm in a bad place right now, maybe in my head or I'm not, I'm hitting a low point here, but I'm 99% of the way towards the goal I set out four months ago when I add in all the work I did leading up to that."}, {"time": 732, "text": "So I think it's important to ask yourself why, because, I mean, there are times when you're doing something and you ask yourself why, and you don't have a good reason."}, {"time": 738, "text": "And then maybe it is advantageous to step back and really reflect on that and decide, is this something I actually want to invest time and energy into?"}, {"time": 747, "text": "Because, you know, someone like yourself who is very much into a variety of different things, it can be easy probably to overextend and get, I mean, I'm a very curious person."}, {"time": 760, "text": "So there's like a hundred things I would love to do if I wasn't doing what I'm doing."}, {"time": 764, "text": "And I know how to enjoy all of them."}, {"time": 764, "text": "So at a certain point though, you have to say, okay, which one is going to be the most meaningful for me?"}, {"time": 769, "text": "And if the answer keeps coming back to saying, I guess this is still the most meaningful to me out of that a hundred things that I could otherwise be doing, then I know that I'm in it for the right reason."}, {"time": 782, "text": "Then I just need to identify some of those things like, well, why did this one take the top spot out of the hundred things that I could have picked from?"}, {"time": 787, "text": "And keeping like a list of those in your head so that when you get to that point where you start saying, why am I doing this?"}, {"time": 791, "text": "Why am I here?"}, {"time": 796, "text": "You just have those kind of ready loaded in your head to say, well, I already took inventory on that before I started this."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And I knew this voice was going to come at some point, whether it's early, middle or late."}, {"time": 803, "text": "And then you just remind yourself kind of what you were thinking when you had a little more of a level head."}, {"time": 808, "text": "Well, there's something about the thing you mentioned when you mentioned the death march."}, {"time": 812, "text": "It seems extremely valuable to just never quitting."}, {"time": 812, "text": "Like in the moment, if you decide to do something, like never quitting, even if you do go through the process and realize that it's not the wisest thing to be doing within the full context of your life."}, {"time": 833, "text": "Like once you decide to do it, it seems like never quitting prevents you from sort of having that escape clause from other things in your life."}, {"time": 840, "text": "So I've quit on a few things in my life."}, {"time": 840, "text": "And I think I still, I deeply regret that because it opened that door."}, {"time": 846, "text": "It's almost like a muscle."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So I think I'm, I don't know, maybe everyone is, but I think I'm kind of a quitter."}, {"time": 861, "text": "Like I'm really good at coming up with reasons to quit."}, {"time": 867, "text": "My mind is really good at that."}, {"time": 867, "text": "And I, it feels like I have to come up with, like really work hard to make sure that there's no quit."}, {"time": 873, "text": "That I never allow myself to quit no matter how stupid the thing I'm doing is."}, {"time": 879, "text": "I don't know if that any of that makes sense, but it just, maybe to rephrase this whole thing."}, {"time": 885, "text": "Do you think it's good to live life by the ethos of never quit?"}, {"time": 892, "text": "Yeah, that's a really interesting thing."}, {"time": 892, "text": "And I think it actually resonates with a lot of ultra marathon runners because there seems to be a trend when you have someone who's been in the sport for a long time where there's a point where they start the sport, right?"}, {"time": 903, "text": "And they're like, super excited about everything."}, {"time": 908, "text": "Everything's new."}, {"time": 908,

hundred case, first time I ever in a hundred miles and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And when you're doing that for the first time, I think there's a heightened motivation to not quit because you don't want your first attempt to be a failure."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And then you get a little further along and you start reflecting on the landscape and all the opportunities that are out there and you find yourself quitting on an event."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And there does seem to be a trend where once you do that once, now all of a sudden, like you, like you described perfectly that quit pops up in your head maybe a little sooner than next time or maybe a little bit before."}, {"time": 950, "text": "And I've certainly had these experiences in my career as well."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And what happens, I think if you stick with it, again, I think it is important to assess whether you really want to be doing what you're doing."}, {"time": 961, "text": "But if you start recognizing that about yourself in a certain activity where it's like, I think I might be pulling the plug early on some of this stuff."}, {"time": 970, "text": "I think you just need to kind of get into a position where you just at that point, you need to make a decision."}, {"time": 976, "text": "Do I want to keep doing this?"}, {"time": 976, "text": "If the answer is yes, you hold yourself accountable to not quitting."}, {"time": 980, "text": "And eventually what will happen is you'll find yourself in a position where I'll use ultra marathons, for example, where you're just clicking on all cylinders for that day."}, {"time": 990, "text": "And you still get those scenarios where doubt creeps in your mind."}, {"time": 990, "text": "You have these low points, but for whatever reason, when those low points are high, you're going to find yourself in a reason when those low points come, you're able to push through them better than you would have in the past."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And then you push through maybe two or three more than you did after you had quit the time before."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Then it's accountability time, right?"}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Because then you have to look back at that and say, well, why did this time, was I able to be mentally more strong and kind of push through those extra opportunities to quit when I wasn't before?"}, {"time": 1022, "text": "And it can be easy to look back and say, and live kind of retroactively in the sense where you're regretting, well, why did I drop out of those races?"}, {"time": 1032, "text": "Why did I do this wrong there?"}, {"time": 1032, "text": "And I just think that's where you have to kind of catch yourself and say, no, those things happened to me in order to put me in a position where I decided, well, this time I'm not going to quit no matter what, minus my leg falling off."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "I'm not going to quit."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "And then you put yourself in a position to have that day where you push through more times than you ever have before."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And you just redefine what you're capable of."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And then once I think you do that, you start looking at those earlier lessons as, as lessons, you know, were they failures on paper at the time?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "But can you pull things from them to learn as to like, well, where is your actual threshold?"}, {"time": 1067, "text": "Where is the limit actually for you?"}, {"time": 1067, "text": "And then kind of start redefining that stuff."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Um, so I think like the never quit mentality can be good in certain situations, but I don't think it's necessarily like a, like a holistic thing where you need to be in something where it's never quit, always do more."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Cause then you end up in a situation where you find this like margin of diminishing returns, especially when it comes to training and workouts and things like that, where there are times where often there are times where you want to actually quit a little bit before you would have to, because the stress that was required to elicit a, a growth response has already occurred."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "And then just to do more is just going to require more recovery time to get back and do it again."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "This is the tricky trade off living by the never quit mentality."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "You're not going to achieve optimal performance in your head."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "You might."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "It seems like when you look at the full arc of human history, the people who do great things are more leaning towards the never quit."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "Like, uh, I feel like at any one moment you're more in danger of quitting than you are being suboptimal."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "So like, um, in terms of advice, it just feels like never quitting is always the right advice."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "Unless you deeply know the person, maybe this is like wrestling mentality."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "I've seen too many, and because I'm annoyed with the current culture telling me to relax and, and, uh, have a work life balance and all those kinds of things, uh, which all have a deep, deep truth to them."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "But the reality is like, there's not enough people that walk up to me and like slap me and say, get your shit together."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Like don't quit, work harder."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "I think we need to hear that more."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "I, and like, I remember that, um, from the wrestling rooms, like that when you're pushed that way, when you're forced to the very limit and you don't quit, that makes better humans."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "I think people need to get that in their life."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "I think they need to have situations where that becomes kind of the reality for them so they can see that avenue, experience that avenue, um, where I think it's maybe to the extreme as if it becomes like your entire life philosophy where like every little thing you do is never quit."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "But life is short, Zach."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "I mean, this is the problem I have."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "This is probably the programming thing too is over optimization is dangerous."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "Uh, it's like every once in a while, I mean, you're, you do this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "You're not, for example, with a hundred mile run, you're, I mean, you could just be doing that for the rest of your life and do like the most optimal hundred mile run ever, but you keep taking on like new challenges and there's a lot more chaos in that."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "And there it feels like the muscle of never quit will be much more important than the optimality of your training."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "So there's probably a couple sides to me with that kind of a thing where for one, I think when we talked about the why, so like, I think the why can kind of shift a bit and it probably will if you do something long enough or evolve maybe is a better way to call it, to put it."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "And for me, like one of my my big drives and one of my big passions within ultra running is to first of all, find an event that I really, really love to train for and participate in."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "So for me, I feel like I've kind of identified that to a degree and that's kind of runnable hundred milers."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "So once I found that it became more of a driver for me to see like, well, how fast can I run a hundred miles in a very controlled environment?"}, {"time": 1291, "text": "So let's eliminate weather, let's eliminate, you know, elevation, let's eliminate like having to wait extra long to get crew or support and that sort of thing."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And that's how you find yourself on a 400 meter track running a hundred miles."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "But for me, like the important part of that is that I can control the environment enough where if I come back year after year, I can retest myself and have a decent ability to kind of say I improved or I regressed or I stayed stagnant."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And I think that's a big driver for me."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "But one thing I've recognized within that is if you just keep doing that, like if I could probably pick three flat runnable hundred milers a year and optimally prepare, race, recover and repeat without like burning myself out."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "So almost like happiness."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "Well, here's the example."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "Like, I mean, I love running in trails to most people would consider me a flat road track runner, runnable ultra runner."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "But I like to do trail runs too."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So and at the end of two thousand and eighteen, I recognized that I had been kind of pushing the gas pedal on trying to run fast hundred milers for quite a while without really a break in that where it was like, OK, I did one."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "Now I'm going to take a brief off season, but then I'm going to ultimately build up and peak for another one."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "I might introduce some fun trail races in the context, but they're going to be races are going to be training races, time on feet type of stuff that are going to kind of mimic like a long run, essentially."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And but the main focus always in the back of my mind was like getting on the track and seeing how much faster I can run a hundred miles."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "And that just kind of that energy that it takes to continually think by that, that I think the motivation to keep that stoke high enough to really meet your full potential fades if you don't step away from it for a little bit."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "So I took essentially half a year away from runnable stuff and just decided I'm going to prepare for the San Diego hundred mile, which is like a much more elevation, technical trail type of an event."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "Is that a trail run or no?"}, {"time": 1435, "text": "It's a trail hundred miler actually just kind of just outside of San Diego."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "And yeah, it goes through it goes over part of the Pacific Crest Trail and stuff."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "So it's very different than running on a runnable surface."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "So to give you some context, like I ran was I think just under 17 hours for that race, whereas on a flat surface I can run 11 hours and 19 minutes."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "So just the environment alone added an extra, you know, five plus hours to the day."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "So it's just a different experience, different skill set."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "And what it did is it allowed me to kind of step away from kind of focusing on like splits on a track, running flat stuff, like preparing for things specifically for a flat environment and start training for something that's more climbing and descending, more technical running skill sets and things like that."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "And the cool part about it was, first of all, you know, when you step away from something and after something a lot different, I mean, it's still running."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "There's still a huge advantage I had from the running I'd done in the past that was going to put me in a good position to be successful."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "But there was a much higher or a much bigger range of potential improvement for me."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "So through the like four plus months I spent preparing for that race, you know, I noticed, oh wow, I'm getting faster on this climb or I'm getting better at descending this technical trail."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "It was one of the most fun races I've run actually."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "So it was kind of a cool experience."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "I ended up taking the lead at like 93 miles."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "So you were racing, racing, like you were trying to get first."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "So it's still a race."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "So what was the enjoyable aspect of it?"}, {"time": 1531, "text": "I don't think I've recognized it so much while I was doing it actually."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "It surfaced afterwards."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "I mean, the enjoyment of the race itself is like when you find yourself in a position where you're sitting in basically second place all day long and then you take the lead at 90, I think it was like 91 or 92 miles."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "It's like, yeah, that's kind of a cool way to race."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "But afterwards I recognized a few things just about kind of pacing and you know, how to maybe pace the first half of a hundred miler versus a second half."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "I also recognized shortly thereafter once I finished or covered and decided my next event was going to be a flat runnable race that, wow, I really was way more excited to do the workouts that I needed to do to get ready to run a fast, flat hundred miler."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "And I don't think that would have been the case had I just tried to do another flat, fast hundred miler earlier or during that year and end up in a situation where like I maybe had like normalized a suboptimal like outlook on like something that I had just done so many times already."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "And I recognize that it was just every workout I did."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "I was like, I did this workout a year ago and it was not nearly this much fun."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "And our, you know, the interesting thing about these track hundreds too, is like you find yourself doing like your peaking phase where you're running your long runs, which for me are usually like, you know, around 30 miles or so, and I'll do them on back to back days."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "And you know, I try to replicate the environment I'm going to race on."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "So I'm finding myself on a 400 meter track."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And it's like when I started doing that again, I just felt like I was super motivated to go out there Saturday and Sunday and do those back to back long runs and see the progress and then head out again the next week and do it again."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "So I had some of my more enjoyable long runs, which are going to be the most specific to the race day environment that I had in quite some time."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "And I think that was really beneficial and kind of putting me in the right spot to be able to push through barriers on race day and put me in a position where quitting was going to be much less of a likelihood, given the enjoyment I had in the months leading into the race itself."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "Yeah, even the thought of quitting."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "So you mentioned the track, you've also ran 100 miles on the treadmill, and the trail 100 mile."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "Broadly, if we zoom out, what does it take to run 100 miles?"}, {"time": 1658, "text": "For most of the world, that seems like a crazy distance to run."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "So maybe it's interesting to ask, not only is just setting the world record, but purely running, what does it take to run that far?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think people probably overestimate what it takes in terms of just getting it done."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "I think this is consistent in just running in general."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "I think the marathon was always a big one with that where people thought like, well, you have to do this training, or you just literally won't physically be able to complete a marathon."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "And then we got into an era of kind of like, running as more of an enjoyment thing versus a performance thing."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And then you'd have people running, granted much slower."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "I think if you look at the Boston Marathon average finishing times, it goes from like, or maybe it wasn't the Boston Marathon, it might have been marathons in general, went from like three hours to five hours or something like that."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "So it's like, people, I think got past the fact that you can only do it if you're optimally prepared to, well, I can do it and maybe not meet my full potential if I'm going to like, not do much training, which I wouldn't necessarily advise."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "But I mean, I've I've talked to people who basically run 100 miles, sometimes almost off the couch."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "And it's like, it's, to me, what that says is just the human body is incredible, and what it can tolerate above and beyond what it's been exposed to, if it has to, or if it feels like it has to."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "So that's the basic sort of getting from point A, from the start to the finish."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "It's the human body and the human mind is capable of doing it without much preparation."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "But then you start to increase the goal of performance, and you try to get actually a good, like, the most out of your body that you can."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "How does that start to change then?"}, {"time": 1756, "text": "Yeah, going from fun to performance?"}, {"time": 1756, "text": "Yeah, I think once you start putting marks or goals on outside of just finishing, that's where it starts getting interesting."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "Because now you could maybe go on with multiple goals where like, if one falls off due to something that you didn't expect, then you have another one to target."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "But you can always build those up and try to think like, well, I want to run faster than last time, or I want to, you know, break a course record or an age group record or something like that."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And that that I think is just going to be a little bit of a different mindset."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "Because now you're looking at every little thing from what do I need to do to prepare as well as what I need to do to be efficient on the day itself."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "So like transitioning aid stations and things like that, or do I want a pacer or not?"}, {"time": 1801, "text": "Or does this race allow someone to like hand me a bottle at a certain spot?"}, {"time": 1801, "text": "Or do I have to be in specific areas to get that type of stuff?"}, {"time": 1807, "text": "And it what ends up doing is it ends up bringing a lot more variables to the table."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "And I think it's interesting, because there's always going to be more variables on the day than you are able to account for."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "So at a certain degree, you have to kind of find yourself in a position where I'm going to make sure I take care of the big ones, or the ones that are like, obviously, I need to be ready for like, my fueling strategy, my hydration strategy, my pacing strategy, what workouts are going to put me in a position to physiologically have this process go as well as possible?"}, {"time": 1838, "text": "How am I going to like, you know, hold myself accountable in aid station transition, so I'm not like having a ton of non moving time versus moving time and things like that."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "So there's these like, big variables that you're aware of, and you're trying to optimize over the space of variables."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "So you get to start to play with that."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "When you're looking for performance, it's almost like moving from checkers to chess, right?"}, {"time": 1879, "text": "Or, you know, which one of these pacing strategies is going to get me to the finish line faster than the other one and that sort of stuff."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "So it gets more complicated, more interesting, and in my opinion, anyway, also, there's I mean, but there's a breaking point with that too, because, like I said, there's an endless number of variables you could account for."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "And there's a distance gets longer, that list gets longer too."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "So you find yourself in this position where, where you have to at some point say, okay, I've accounted for everything I can reasonably account for."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "Now I need to be in a mental space where when something happens that I wasn't able to account for, I'm able to respond to it with the right decision and keep going and not dwell on it."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "Because that's another thing."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "I mean, you're running slow enough when you're doing 100 miles, where if you make a mistake, you can sit there and just fixate on that mistake and say, why did I do that?"}, {"time": 1928, "text": "That cost me 10 minutes, blah, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "When in reality, what you need to do is that happened."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "Everyone else out here is gonna have a situation like that at some point."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "Mine happened now."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "I need to figure out how I can move forward at the fastest sustainable pace and not think about what happened back there."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "And that's where I think it gets really interesting."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "What would you say it takes to set a world record in the 100 miler?"}, {"time": 1948, "text": "First of all, I think you probably have to focus on that specific event."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "I mean, there's the interesting thing about ultra running where it maybe deviates a bit from just other endurance sports is there's such a wide range."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "I mean, we talked about a little bit when I talked about the San Diego 100 versus kind of flat runnable stuff."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "So can you maybe paint a picture of what are there's a huge range of different kinds of ultra marathon events?"}, {"time": 1975, "text": "What are like, the big ones in your mind?"}, {"time": 1975, "text": "So marathon, we know the distance for a marathon."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "There's 50k, what are different kinds of there's 100 mile that in your mind, like kind of these islands where, where people gather off?"}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So there's a few that really stand out."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "I would say the three biggest ultra marathons right now, even from a historic, maybe not necessarily a historical standpoint, but in modern day ultra running is going to be the Western States 100."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "That's the biggest, most competitive 100 miler."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "It's on the trail side of things in the United States."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "Then there's ultra trail Mount Blanc, which is probably the most competitive 100 miler on the planet right now."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "In previous years, it's been debatable as whether Western States or ultra trail Mount Blanc is more competitive."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "I think in the most recent few years, you're just seeing a lot more like of the bulk of international talent on the trail side of the sport heading over that way."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "And then you have the road running side of things where the comrades marathon, which is technically 56 miles, but they call it the comrades marathon, is going to generally be the most competitive ultra marathon."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "The weird thing is the distance thing, right?"}, {"time": 2041, "text": "Cause most people in the think of endurance sports, they're thinking about precise distances, like five kilometers, 10 kilometers and all that stuff."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And then, then you get into the ultra running world and it's like, sometimes it's the event."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "So like the Western course itself is much more important than the distance, right?"}, {"time": 2052, "text": "So the Western States 100 is actually 100.2 miles, which isn't that big of a deviation when you think about it, especially when you figure like tangents are going to probably account for more than 0.2 miles on a hundred mile race."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "But the ultra trail Mount Blanc, you know, that's listed as a hundred mile, but it's actually, I think like 104, 105 miles."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "So, you know, it's more, there's different cultures too."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "So the United States is definitely more motivated, I think, to try to get as close to the exact distance."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "You're going to hear maybe a little more grumbling."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "If someone says, I signed up for this hundred mile and it turned out to be 103 miles versus like over in Europe, they don't really care too much about the distance."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "They're more interested in like a specific route or a loop."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "Is consistency important in terms of the exact length of the, of the route?"}, {"time": 2095, "text": "So like you can compare performances from previous years, or are they a little bit more flexible?"}, {"time": 2098, "text": "Like they redefine the trail from year to year."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "I mean, it's definitely hard to compare."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "I mean, there's events that take, for example, I would say the best ultra marathoner in the world today on the men's side is Jim Walmsley."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "The reason I think Jim Walmsley is the best is because he is the most versatile and not only the most versatile, but he's arguably the best at almost everything up to a hundred miles."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "So there's a race called the Angela's crest hundred miler."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "They, the trail has drastically changed from when they originally had that event and it's a different time of year."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "So it's much warmer on that course."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And Jim's not the kind of guy who would sit back and say like, I can't chase that record."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "But I think Angela crest, when he looks at the segments and the pacing for that one, he's like, that one is maybe not even the same event anymore."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "So you have that, you have some that are a little more controlled and a little more kind of like preserved, I guess you would say, but I think it gets really rare on the trail side."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "I mean, comrades is going to be very comparable from one year to the next because that's a road race."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "And that's where you get, you maybe get like the split in the sport from people who really want that kind of like, I want to compare myself to someone who ran this course in 1970 versus like someone who just says, I want to be competitive today."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And you know, maybe the weather is going to be 30 degrees different from one year to the next on this course."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "But if I beat everyone on this day, then I'm the champion of that big name race, like ultra trail Montblanc or Western States, 100."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "And my legacy will be cemented because I won that big race."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "And it doesn't matter when or how the course was or what the time even was to some degree."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "When you were optimizing for trying to set the world record in the hundred miler, were you doing like analysis of maybe like what were the variables you were looking at?"}, {"time": 2203, "text": "Is it more in the realm of the actual race day, the track, what it looks like versus like the variables of the training leading up to the, to the race?"}, {"time": 2216, "text": "I mean, it evolved a bit."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "Like, I think the, as I learned more about just like, what is required to kind of really do that stuff."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "So there's some variables you can control for, you know, I try to control for as many as I can."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "The big one that kind of stands out that you can't necessarily control for is it's pretty rare where you get an event where they're just doing a hundred miles on a track."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "It's usually like a, like an event of like a series of different events where they might be like some people out there doing 50 K, some people out there doing 24 or something like the event I did at, there was six day folks out there."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "They're trying to see how far they could get in six days."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "So you have like this much wider range of pacing just due to like the distance."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "So, you know, track protocol is always like you pass on the outside."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "So if you're running one of the faster paces of the day, which when you go on up to six days, you're going to, and you're doing a hundred miles, you're probably going to be running faster than most people out there."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "Then, you know, you just end up running more because you end up running in lane two around the turns and then sometimes lane three around the turns."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "So it's down to those little details that have a big impact."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "So I had to build that into my pacing strategy."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "I also have to build into the pacing strategy, like relative nonmoving time."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "You know, I did a race just recently, it was the US track and field hundred mile road championships."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "And I did not stop once other than like, I guess I technically stopped like in the aid station for like a few seconds to like grab bottles and get myself wet."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "Cause it was like 94 degrees that day, but I didn't like stop at all during that race from like what I would say is like a long period of time where we're getting up to like a minute, but that's pretty rare."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "Even on the track, like when I ran 11 hours and 19 minutes, I think I stopped three times for maybe a total of like, I believe I have to look back for sure, but I think it was like three to four minutes or something like that."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "So you got to, you got to figure that into your pacing strategy, especially if you're chasing a specific time."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "Cause you know, if I'm pacing for, you know, at the time the world record was 1128."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "So if I'm pacing for say 1127, 30 or something like that, and I don't account for that three minutes of stoppage, then I might run the exact pace I had planned on, but then I'm a minute off of the world record."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "So 1128, we're talking about 11 hours, we're talking about a hundred miles."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "Can you mention what the world record was?"}, {"time": 2347, "text": "What kind of world record you set?"}, {"time": 2347, "text": "Can you tell your own story here of what you were able to accomplish that world record that I broke actually just recently got rebroke by a guy over in Lithuania, Alex Sorkin, phenomenal race."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "I mean, he's won the 24 hour world championships."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "He's won the Spartathlon, which is another big historic ultra marathon rates, 153 miles."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "So it's getting a little more lengthy than some of the stuff that I've traditionally done."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "He ran 1114, I believe it was 56 or 57."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "So his pace was 645 per mile."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "Mine was 647 and a half in terms of just like the pacing strategy."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "I mean, it's, it's just really cool because for me, the motivation with chasing the world record was, it was multifaceted."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "I think there was, as I kind of moved through, cause I mean, it took me almost six years from the day I decided I wanted to chase that time to the day I actually did it."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "And through that five to six years, I think I merged from just like my number one goal was to try to break the world record to my number one goal is how fast can I run this thing?"}, {"time": 2416, "text": "And then ultimately what needs to be done for a human to break 11 hours in a hundred miles."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "Cause I think that's going to be, I think that's going to happen soon."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "I think it's going to happen in the next few years."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "What pace would that be?"}, {"time": 2431, "text": "Sub 11 would be, I think like, I think it's like 635 right about per mile."}, {"time": 2431, "text": "You're moving quick, but not so quick that like you're, you're, you know, void of being able to think about everything as it's happening."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "So what's the pace in terms of, if you look for each of the one mile segments for the hundred miles, is it pretty steady six, like in order to break 11 hours, would it be pretty steady 635?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Does it go up and down?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Do you speed up at the very end?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Like what's, what's the pacing?"}, {"time": 2463, "text": "If you were to maybe how much variability is there in the pacing for an optimal performance here?"}, {"time": 2469, "text": "So if you're talking about someone, let's say that there was someone, well, let's just take me for example, let's say that we could just like, we had this infinite knowledge and we knew for a fact, a perfect performance for me would produce a 10 59, but I'm not going a second faster and I need to do everything right in order to run a 10 59."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "Uh, I would definitely want to either have a slight negative or slight positive split."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "So when, um, and I think there's, I think there's a, there's a range in there where like being a little bit faster the first half and the second half isn't going to necessarily change your outcome or being a little bit slower the first half and a little bit faster."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "The second half isn't going to drastically change your outcome."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "So that's what you're referring to."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "The split is you're looking at the first 50 miles and the second 50 miles."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "And you can break it down as tiny as you want."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "Like I think, uh, when you take out the outlier laps where I stopped to use the bathroom, which would have been that like three to four minute nonmoving time that I talked about before, my splits were really tight."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "Um, I had a couple that were, um, it was weird cause that, that track that I did that on was actually like 400 and some weird number, like 400 and like 38 meters or something like that."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "So I actually like ran like my numbers based on that."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "So they're there normally I'm dealing with 400 meters and then it's a little more like clean as to like what my lap splits are going to range from one event to the next."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "So we're talking about running a hundred miles on a track."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "And so that you can be really scientific about getting the, the, this, the, um, the pacing, right."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "And, uh, you're, you're running on the inside lane or is there some kind of tricks to this?"}, {"time": 2565, "text": "Like, are you alternating directions?"}, {"time": 2565, "text": "They'll switch directions at most events every four hours."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "So you'll do four hours one way and then they usually put a cone out."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "And once it hits like, like, let's say it hits four hours, you finish the lap you're on and then you do a loop around and then you start the next, your next lap."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "Would you say you take the exact same number of steps?"}, {"time": 2586, "text": "Like when you're really in the groove, when you take in the pacing, are we talking about that level of precision or is it a little bit more feel?"}, {"time": 2592, "text": "You mean like foot strike frequency?"}, {"time": 2598, "text": "Like frequency then over the distance to the lap."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "Would you say it's so precise that you're like, you get in this groove where it's like, gosh, you're making me wish I would have strapped more like a foot pod to my head."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "But like, yeah, so I think like my guess is it's pretty precise."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "Like is there a video of this?"}, {"time": 2614, "text": "I keep interrupting."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "Is there a video of this?"}, {"time": 2614, "text": "Cause I, I've actually, this is now three years ago, build a computer vision algorithm that counts foot strikes."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "For fun."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "I was trying to understand, uh, we'll talk about this later."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "We have the same definition of fun when I got my, find myself on a track for all day and you find yourself counting foot strikes."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "I was trying to understand if, if there's how much variability there's in a extreme, like elite performers within a particular race, but also across races."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "It was just interesting to me from a robotics perspective, if like how much variability there is in the human body and in the way they use legs to move quickly."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "I think my guess would be that at the individual level, it's going to be pretty precise, assuming the pacing is consistent."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "So you get, so my pacing on that day, I ran two minutes faster the second 50 miles than I did the first 50 miles."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "So my splits were very even most of the day."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "I actually ran some of my fastest miles at the end."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "Uh, so there's going to be probably a slight variance from my fastest miles to my slowest mile in like your cadence or your foot strike."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "Uh, but probably not by a huge margin, but you might have a pretty big variance from one person to the next."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "So you get someone whose gate is just a little bit different."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "So like for me, I supinate, which means I kind of come down on the outside of my foot and I'm kind of more of a mid forefoot striker."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "So that's going to kind of impact my cadence to a degree."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "Whereas you might have someone who is kind of more mid to rear their foot or heel striker and they might pronate where their foot kind of rolls in."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "Uh, so that person may have a little bit of a different cadence as well."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "So you get someone, and I think you see this in elite marathoning too, which is going to probably just be a much larger data pool, uh, much, much more probably precise from just like a number of opportunities to study this."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "And I think even their ranges from one person to the next can be, I wouldn't say drastic, but, you know, to the degree of like 10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or something like that from one person to the next."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "But most people, the faster they go, the higher their cadence is going to be."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "The slower they go, the lower their cadence is going to be, but there's going to be probably a range of optimal lowness and I don't know, probably optimal highness too than that."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "If you can just linger on the 11 hours, the person, first of all, would you like to be the person that breaks 11 hours?"}, {"time": 2759, "text": "And second of all, the person that does break 11 hours, like what would, what would it take?"}, {"time": 2765, "text": "And third question is, is it even possible in your intuition?"}, {"time": 2770, "text": "I mean, I would def I would be lying to you if I said I didn't want to be the first person to break 11 hours and a hundred miles."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "I think that'll be, um, would be a cool like barrier to be the one to usher that in."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "But with that said, I think I'm much more motivated in seeing it done from the sense that like, I think when we're talking about records, it's something that is inevitable that it's going to get broken."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "So, I mean, we were talking about happiness before this, right?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "So I've contemplated this in the past, um, where I was thinking to myself, like, uh, if my motivation is to break a world record or any record for that matter, course record and have that be my defining reason or my defining motivator, I probably need to do an assessment of what I'm kind of where my mind is at and where my focus is at."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "Uh, and just reflect on how I'm behaving in life because it's going to get broken, right?"}, {"time": 2821, "text": "I mean, I could run 10 50 tomorrow and in 10 years, chances are that's no longer going to be my world record anymore."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "Someone's going to run faster than that."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "So if you're living to hold on to a record versus living to try to move the sport forward, which anytime you break a world record, you're moving the sport forward, then, then you have to look at that as like, that was my contribution."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "And whether I contribute again or not is kind of besides the point."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "What you want is that your performance, your contribution brings new people into the sport who are excited, motivated, and they can make their contribution."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "And then we can ultimately see, well, how fast can someone run a controlled environment, a hundred miler."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "And that's what I really want to see."}, {"time": 2873, "text": "Uh, cause I think I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport."}, {"time": 2873, "text": "I mean, I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "I've been able to turn it into a career."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "And I think there's, there's other people who can do the same thing and it's not necessarily going to come at the expense of my career."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "Uh, but it's going to bring more attention to the sport."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "It's going to bring more interest in the sport."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "It's going to open the sport up to people who maybe otherwise would have never thought about it, seen it, considered it."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "And to me, I think that's like a much more rewarding goal than saying I want to break this record and I want to hold it for decades or I want to die with this record."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "So I never have to see someone go faster than me."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "Well, that's the progress of human civilization was down on the shoulders of giants and we keep creating cool stuff."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "Well, and it's, it's the other thing is just like, if you're honest with yourself too, it's, uh, I mean, we're seeing this right now in the running world where, you know, new innovations come in, new technologies come in, new nutritional approaches come in."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And then we see like the new crop of folks have advantages that the old crop didn't have."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "And it can be easy to look back on that and say like, Hey, well, um, you know, if I would have had that product or if I would have done that, I would have run this."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "But then you're getting into that negative, you know, thought process again, which I generally try to stay off of."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "It's like the caveman."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "If I had fire, I would have done right."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "But with this, look at these idiots up there with their cars."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "If I would have had a car back then, I would have been ruled the world."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "Um, let me just zoom up briefly and ask you about kind of beauty and love."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "What's the most beautiful thing about running to you?"}, {"time": 2958, "text": "Why do you love it?"}, {"time": 2964, "text": "I think, uh, there's kind of a couple of directions to look at it through our lenses, look at it through."}, {"time": 2969, "text": "There's like the, in the moment, right?"}, {"time": 2969, "text": "There's always going to be that run where, uh, you're clicking along and things just feel great."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "You get some endorphins and you get the, the, you know, the, the quote unquote runner's high and that sort of stuff."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "And that's like just like this great feeling that you can kind of tap into on the like the real, like, like in the moment type of level."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "Uh, you know, you've, my wife and I talk about this because she's a competitive ultra runner as well."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "And, um, you will, you'll, we'll have a day where, you know, we'll take a forced day off or something like that."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "And it's necessary, right?"}, {"time": 2998, "text": "It's going to allow the enjoyment to continue."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "But you get into this like routine of, I wake up in the morning, I do this run and that kind of gets my day started."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "That gets my energies up."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "I get that runner's high afterwards."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "You remove that from the equation for a rest day."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "And you just start like, oh man, I don't feel like I never got started today."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "Like, you know, it's just this weird thing."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "It's almost, I think it's, it's funny because non runners don't always like necessarily recognize it because for them it's the complete opposite."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "They're like, if I can get away from not having to run today, that's going to be a good day versus."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "But it's one of those things that I think gets more addictive the more you do it."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "So, uh, so that's purely from the running perspective."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "There's this joy of, uh, of the runner's high of the post after the run."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "You feel like you can take on the world, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "And I think that's one of the drivers from just the quality of life standpoint."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "Uh, just, uh, you know, and in the moment, immediate gratification, uh, standpoint."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "But then there's like, I think the bigger picture stuff or the longer term stuff."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "And for me, that enjoyment is like just the process like of, uh, okay, I'm starting at this fitness level and I'm going to do these workouts and by doing these workouts, I'm going to see incremental progress from them."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "And then that's another kind of like, kind of short term gratification."}, {"time": 3075, "text": "That's maybe a little longer than the day to day, but, um, still like shorter than like a career or a, or a buildup for a particular race where you're saying you're seeing yourself like, okay, maybe I'm focusing on short intervals right now."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "And on week one, I covered this much distance in three minutes, but by week four, I'm covering this much distance and you can just see that progress is almost like, uh, in elementary school when you get the gold star for reading a book, it's like, did that gold star really mean anything?"}, {"time": 3102, "text": "I don't know, but I felt great when they gave it to me."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "There's something about just finding improvement and people love to see improvement, I think."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "So that's where, uh, I think you can also get some value in it saying like I started here and I got there."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "Um, and then I think there's also just like, uh, I would call this maybe more the cherry on top, which is like where you express your work, which is the race itself, where that's going to be kind of the thing that kind of like, uh, shows up on the end result and where it kind of identifies whether you did things right or wrong."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "So there's a sense which, in which training is a kind of, uh, preparation towards race day and race day being the thing where you get to be the artist."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "You get to create this, this piece of art and they might suck, it might be beautiful."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "Like in grappling, that means for me, that means like not stalling, like taking big risks and trying to dominate another person in the, in the context of grappling and, and do it, like push myself to the limit, both cardio wise and technique wise, and just play, play beautifully."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "I mean, you see this in kind of chess, there's systematic chess players and there's people that allow themselves to have those moments of genius where they take the big risk that eventually pays off or doesn't."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "And that to me is art that, I mean, there's art within running, there's art within chess, there's art within grappling."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "And you got a chance, like all the training is more like science."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "And then it feels like the competition days art."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "I think that that that's a really cool, cool way to look at."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "And I think it's when you really open up the perspective of that too, it's like even, uh, obviously, you know, having a great day, like winning the tournament or, you know, getting further than you were expected to, or beating someone who you've never beaten before or something like that."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "Uh, or in the running perspective, like achieving that goal time, uh, that sort of stuff."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "Obviously those are kind of like the ones you, if, when you're honest with yourself, you really want, and you're going to probably get the most satisfaction out of, but even when they don't go wrong, like maybe like with your grappling tournament, uh, analogy, the, you know, maybe the guy you're grappling against does a move on you and you're like, I was not prepared for that move."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "So now the enjoyment becomes, okay, back to the drawing board."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "Now I need to find out what do I do when that happens to me next time."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "And that's where the, I think the why comes in again, same thing with running."}, {"time": 3273, "text": "Like maybe I make a mistake and, you know, like eat something I didn't really want to eat or, or thought was going to work, but didn't work."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "And it costs me more time than I gained by having it or something like that."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "And then I go back to the drawing board and say, okay, well, I can't do that."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "Or if I'm going to do that, I need to be more prepared to be able to do it."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "And I love that part of the sport."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "Um, just the rearranging of things and adjusting and tinkering."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "There's some sense in which the mistakes and like the flaws give us meaning."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "Cause like if, if everything, um, if you weren't able to find mistakes and something you've done, it feels like the life would be void of meaning."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "It's a lost opportunity too."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "Like if, I mean, like when I look at even my a hundred mile race of 11, 19, I can find spots in there where I was like, Oh, you know what?"}, {"time": 3324, "text": "I could clean that up a little bit."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "Maybe if I do this differently."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "And I mean, that's going to get me, you know, a little bit faster."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "If I sat back and said, Hey, well things went great that day."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "Let's see if we can replicate it."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "Then, you know, I probably run 11, 19 again."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "So can we talk about training a little bit?"}, {"time": 3337, "text": "What does your training look like year round day to day, hour to hour, like optimal?"}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Maybe, uh, maybe you want to pick a race in the context of what you want to discuss that, but, and also people should follow you on Instagram."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "You have a lot of kind of interesting, um, like little glances into your training process and into your training thinking, which is quite fascinating."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "But if you look at an optimal training process, what does that look like?"}, {"time": 3370, "text": "So I think, uh, the, if we were looking at it from like a philosophical level or like an approach level, I think there's some things that carry over from regardless of the distance."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "So I think working on your weaknesses and things that are least specific to what you're going to do on race day, but are still going to be important things in terms of improving your ability to perform on race day or maximizing your potential, uh, with the things that are specific you do first."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "I say that, but there's a caveat with endurance sport."}, {"time": 3406, "text": "I think maybe even more specifically with things like our ultra marathons or a hundred miles where you want a really strong aerobic foundation or like a base before you really start, I think, structuring things towards a specific one."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "So for me, I think like a target for me is oftentimes like, uh, you know, getting really fit at like what my pace would be at like my aerobic threshold or what a lot of people may be called like a maximum aerobic function."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "Um, I mean, the running world is kind of weird where we have like these terminologies where there's sometimes multiple words that essentially mean the same thing, but one is from like, uh, just an actual physiological reaction and one is just like a feeling and stuff like that."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "So you mentioned time on feet versus time in optimal physiological state."}, {"time": 3445, "text": "Like how important is it just to get like running done versus like running in a particular pace that would depend on the event."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "I would say to a degree and there's contradicting ideas about like kind of how to structure it."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "I think a lot of times like, uh, you do want to like time on feet in most cases is just going to be like I'm running easy, whatever feels easy that day."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "And that can be different from one day to the next."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "Like I might feel great and you know, that produces a much faster pace than if I feel really miserable or something like that."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "Um, so that's why I think a lot of times running, well they'll, they'll do the whole perceived, perceived effort or perceived exertion."}, {"time": 3490, "text": "And there you're looking at kind of understanding the response your body has to a certain effort level and you're supposed to target a certain effort level in order to like get a certain response."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "So to maybe simplify that a little bit or make it a little clearer, like I think I focus on essentially like short intervals."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "I focus on longer intervals or tempo runs."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "Uh, I focus on, um, like race pace intensity, which is a lot of times what I'll build my long run around."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "Um, but I'll also like, those are kind of like the small pieces to the puzzle."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "Those are the options you're working with."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "Yeah, but I'm going to always try to work with those options on top of a massive aerobic base, which is going to probably be like 80% of the work."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "So how do you build that massive aerobic base?"}, {"time": 3535, "text": "Just distance?"}, {"time": 3535, "text": "Distance and essentially, so I like to call it microstressing because you're going to always start at a different spot depending on where your fitness level is at and depending on where you're at as an individual."}, {"time": 3543, "text": "I'm going to be targeting my aerobic threshold."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "I'm going to get right up to it, but not necessarily cross over it."}, {"time": 3551, "text": "Um, it's, it, you know, it's, it's been popularized as maximum aerobic function as kind of a training philosophy."}, {"time": 3556, "text": "That philosophy in itself, I think maybe is a little more like holistic where they're saying, do this basically all the time."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "And by doing so, you're going to, like, you're going to raise your aerobic potential by so much that, you know, you can kind of like race yourself into shape at that point."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "And this would be maybe more specific for like shorter distance or endurance runs where you're not going to really race yourself in the shape of a hundred milers."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "But for five Ks, you might, you might do like a huge base building phase where you're going up to that maximum aerobic function or that aerobic threshold and you're watching your pace come down at that."}, {"time": 3593, "text": "So the rule there is basically like if you're seeing improvement, that's the sign you're looking for, or which would just be your pace dropping at that heart rate or at that intensity."}, {"time": 3602, "text": "And, uh, if you're seeing that continually go down, you're heading in the right direction."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "If you start seeing it go the opposite way, you're, you're probably overreaching where you're trying to do too much of it."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "So that's kind of dictates how much the dose, I guess you'd say, when we talk about max aerobic function, we're talking about heart rate as the ultimate, as the really important metric here."}, {"time": 3619, "text": "So maintaining a particular heart rate during the run."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "Uh, is that the measure that, like, how do you know you're in the right place?"}, {"time": 3625, "text": "And then that's where it gets a little tricky because like, unless you go into a lab and get your aerobic threshold tested, it's really hard to have like an exact number on it."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "Um, you know, Dr. Phil Maffetone with the maximum function process, he'll say 180 minus your age is going to give you your."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "That's the MAF 180 formula that I thought was fascinating for, it's like, uh, in the same way E equals E equals MC squared is fascinating that there could be a formula that captures like optimal running."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "So that for people who don't know that's 180 minus your age, if you train at that heart rate, if you run at that heart rate, you're going to progress a lot."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "And here's the advantage of that."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "I think like with any of these things, you want to look at it through where are the advantages here and I need to account for those."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "And then where are the potential disadvantages and then decide for me as an individual, do these advantages outweigh the disadvantages on what's the alternative approach and is that going to produce more advantages or less?"}, {"time": 3680, "text": "So with, with maximum function, uh, here's some advantages."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "Like it is low enough intensity where you can train pretty consistently at a fairly high volume with a very low injury risk with a very low, like things that are going to maybe lower your quality of life, like muscle damage and things like that."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "So they could be like a, what they call like a fat adapted athlete."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "So you can go to your fat stores for energy if you're applying this math."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "What is it called by the way?"}, {"time": 3728, "text": "Math 180."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "Is that a good, what are your thoughts about in general for yourself and for the broader population?"}, {"time": 3734, "text": "I think the math 180 formula is about as good of a formula as you're going to find in terms of capturing as many people as you can get away with capturing with a kind of a universal thing."}, {"time": 3747, "text": "Uh, like any of these things, I mean, it's, it's more likely kind of on a bell curve where like the bulk of that 180 minus their age is probably going to be a pretty good, at least starting point to kind of figure out where that is."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "There's some other things you can like maybe use to kind of check it that I like to do."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "If I'm, let's say I just, I did 180 minus my age and I went out and I started running and it was like, I'm running along and I'm just like, my, my breathing is labored."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "I'm, you know, I'm struggling to get a sentence out without gasping for breath."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "Well, that's my body telling me I'm probably not actually at my true like math number or my true, like underneath my true aerobic threshold, like aerobic threshold and maximum function, you should be able to do that for hours and you should be able to breathe pretty efficiently and talk."}, {"time": 3790, "text": "Carry a conversation."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "I had, uh, actually when I was in, in better shape, I had trouble getting to that math number."}, {"time": 3816, "text": "I found myself like that I would be doing way too much work."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "Like it was too hard to do."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "It was too hard to get to that number."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "I was running a much lower heart rate, like 10 to 20, what do you call that beats lower."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "And that's, I was still for myself, happy with the pace."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "It was a good pace and, and I was, felt good."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "I was smiling and enjoying life and, uh, I did."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "And the moment I take myself to that, uh, level of like the, the math 180 level, that's like, that felt like a real workout."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "And it felt like I can't do that for five, 10, 15 miles."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "Like I, I started feeling it like this is a one or two mile thing."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "No, but I think his answer to that, uh, Phil Meftone's answer is maybe you're supposed to like, uh, what, maybe do some more sprints or something like that, or build up your, maybe like I'm too weak."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "Musculature wise to like, uh, yeah, like that, that's a sign that you need to work on some stuff."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "You can't just keep enjoying life."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "There's, there's two ways to look at that, I think."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "And I think you're, you're, you're right on."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "I think that what the advice from that, from that kind of a process would say is either you, you're doing too much of it."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "So it's getting too hard for where your skeletal muscle system is currently at for that particular activity."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "So like, it can be different too."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "So for you, like, you know, you're prioritizing, like, uh, uh, wrestling and mixed martial arts or not mixed martial arts, but jujitsu type stuff."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "So, uh, you know, running is maybe kind of that, that, uh, that secondary activity versus the primary activity."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "But yeah, so what they would say is probably like, maybe instead of doing that at, let's say you were doing that for like 30 miles a week or something like that, and it was getting too hard to continue there, they'd say, you know, come back to 20, get used to 20, get comfortable with 20, then let's get you up to 25 and 30 and kind of just like inch you along."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "One of the intuitions I had about the ways I was failing at running is the form was probably not great."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "Like the way to get to those 30, 40 miles is to get the form right."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "Maybe I was doing too big of steps, not so like playing with a different gate, playing with a different kind of, um, the form of your form, the economy, the efficiency."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "So that was, that was the intuition."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "Like I was doing something wrong, but I suppose that's the benefit of these kind of formulas."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "It challenges you to think like, how can I improve this kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 3979, "text": "Well, and it also, it simplifies it so much that you're forced to, right?"}, {"time": 3984, "text": "You're forced to optimize within that real strict parameter versus am I doing my short intervals right, but my long runs wrong?"}, {"time": 3989, "text": "Or am I doing my like long intervals right, but my short intervals, and then you just, it kind of complicates things when you start throwing a lot of stuff there."}, {"time": 3999, "text": "And for most people, especially when they're first getting started, you know, you're, you can't overcomplicate it or you're just going to like, you're going to do like a bunch of half right, half wrong things and then not really know where your progress or your deficits are necessarily at."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "So I do think this is an amazing approach, especially for people who are just getting into it and building that, that foundation, um, where, where I think maybe you want to deviate from that a little bit, especially when you start getting to these events that are operating well outside that intensity."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "So you take something like, um, you know, let's say it's a race that takes you in the neighborhood of around like 12 minutes or something like that, then you're going to be running significantly faster than your, your maximum function pace."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "So most of the research is going to say at some point in time, you need to get around to practicing the pace at which you're going to perform at and really fine tuning the mechanics, uh, the efficiencies, uh, how it feels, how to judge it, how to pace it at the pace you're going to try to compete at."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "So there's obviously like a large range of targets there when we're talking about the endurance world in general, where, you know, you have these shorter events, like five kilometers, and then you also have a hundred mile races, which are going to typically be quite a bit below your maximum heroic function in, especially on these trail races."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "I need to admit something."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "So I don't measure the runs at all in terms of, uh, time, uh, because I get competitive with myself."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "So I kind of decided that running for me is going to be this thing where I just go by feel."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "Is it possible to be that kind of runner and, you know, still have running as part of your life and be a good performer in running?"}, {"time": 4093, "text": "I actually think that's, that's where you want to get to."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "The problem is most people have a hard time getting to that because they'll go out and they'll run with a friend and match their pace."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "Or they'll go out and they'll say, well, I want to run this pace."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "So they'll target that pace or target a specific heart rate, which is, you know, not necessarily how they maybe feel good doing it."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "So I think like once you, I mean, obviously I think when you put a race on the calendar, if your goal is performance, it's a little harder to just say like, well, I'm going to run whatever feels good today because eventually you have to get around to doing what's specific."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "But from just a fitness standpoint, health standpoint, enjoyment standpoint, um, I think it's totally fine to go out and say, I'm going to run what feels good today."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "And you know, maybe someday you will feel like at the end of the run, I'm going to do a couple of sprints just to get some, you know, that, because it does, that one's a hard one to kind of jumpstart, but once you do it and you realize how kind of good it feels, maybe to throw in a few accelerations at the end of a run."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "And then you, you say, oh wow, that feels pretty good to do that."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "I feel a little more accomplished."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "That's a forcing function, but I like to finish runs with sprints anyway."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "Because you're already there without, right."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "You don't need to the timing."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "I'm afraid of the time becoming a drug, but the flip side of that, it's a useful tool to get you to learn the right form, the right feel, like what it feels like to have to be in good shape."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "And then you can throw out the time."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "Well, I think too with, with feel running."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "And what I mean by that is that kind of back to that perceived effort thing where like you do enough of it and you start being able to recognize, like I can go out and if you said, okay, run, you know, 60 minutes at your aerobic threshold, I could go, I could know where that is on my heart rate."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "And I could go out there and just say like, okay, I know what that feels like and go out and run that feel."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "And I'm going to hit that spot."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "Like I bet you if we looked at my heart rate data after that, it'd be right in there."}, {"time": 4199, "text": "And I wouldn't have to look at some of that's just experience."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "Someone's just understanding like when like noticing the physiological responses, when you cross over versus step a little bit too below it, uh, you can get yourself daydreaming and forget."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "I'll do this sometimes too, where I'll be tart."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "Cause I'm kind of like you too, where when I'm getting really fit, uh, especially with my foundation, like I gotta, you know, I'm moving pretty quick at my aerobic threshold."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "So like if I start daydreaming too much, I can notice, Oh, I'm drifting back a little bit."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "I looked down at my heart rate matter."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "Oh yeah, I'm 10 beats under, you know, so you do it."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "It does take a little bit of, I think just awareness."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "Um, but it's also not necessarily something where you have to be so exact that you're hitting things, you know, an exact heart rate all the time."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "There's usually a range and there's even like some fluctuations where like if you've been healthy for a year or two without any injuries and you've been fit that you can probably add five beats to your maximum aerobic function."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "If you're using that as kind of your, your target from the 180 minus your age formula."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "So let's try this, lay this out for yourself, but for others, you, you offer readymade plans for people, you know, depending on their, I think the key thing there is the distance."}, {"time": 4266, "text": "Maybe you can elaborate, but what does that plan look like?"}, {"time": 4266, "text": "Usually what are the key options as you've already kind of mentioned?"}, {"time": 4273, "text": "And how does your week look like?"}, {"time": 4273, "text": "How do a lot of people's week look like in terms of splits?"}, {"time": 4279, "text": "Are we talking about, um, you know, in terms of rest days, in terms of how often do you do speed work versus longer distance?"}, {"time": 4285, "text": "You mentioned long runs."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "Like, is there something you could say that's generally applicable about the, the structure of these plans?"}, {"time": 4298, "text": "The readymade plans, I definitely follow like a philosophy, um, and it's going to be like kind of like lockstep in that."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "Um, so for those, like there's always going to be a sacrifice when you do like a readymade plan because there's, you're removing the individual context there."}, {"time": 4312, "text": "So for folks who are like really want to get into the weeds, I usually do like a personalized coaching plan with them where we sit down and we actually look at their strengths, their weaknesses and really kind of go in from that perspective and fine tune it."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "And it also like it avoids it avoids a situation where, Oh, my readymade plan says I'm supposed to do this run today, but I don't feel great today."}, {"time": 4332, "text": "So what do I do?"}, {"time": 4332, "text": "I mean, some people are fine with that because they're, they're, they're aware enough of like the process that they can adjust it themselves."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "Other folks just need a little more support."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "So, um, that's kind of the difference there, but in terms of the structure of it, it kind of goes with an approach where ogre saying you build this foundation, you're going to spend, you know, usually anywhere between eight to 12 weeks just building up your, your aerobic foundation."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "You're going to be doing a lot of stuff that are kind of at, I call them base runs, but they're basically your maximum aerobic function or you're up to your aerobic threshold type stuff."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "And they're really going to get really fit with that."}, {"time": 4366, "text": "And once they kind of have that foundation laid, then it's time to get into the specifics of whatever distance they're doing."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "So if it, where it will differ will be like if they're doing a right now on those plans, I think I've got 5k half marathon marathon, 50k, 80 to a hundred K and then a hundred miles."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "So if they pick a 5k plan, the order of operations is going to be different than if they pick the a hundred mile plan, you're going to see some of the same workouts show up in that plan."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "It just going to be different areas of it."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "So once they're really fit at that, uh, you know, that foundational level, then, you know, if they're doing say a hundred mile plan, they might start doing some short intervals, which I would, on my plans, I usually range between 30 seconds up to four minutes."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "It's kind of that short interval range."}, {"time": 4408, "text": "Can you describe what you mean by short interval?"}, {"time": 4408, "text": "It's like a sprint and then a rest."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "So I'll use basically like, I'll use like a, basically a 12 minute time trial and that's going to kind of like dictate for them what the intensity and the pace is going to be for some of those."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "When they're under a minute, they'll push past that a little bit."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "Um, but usually when we're up to like above a minute and certainly up to four minutes, like whatever pace or intensity that they get for that kind of 12 minute time trial, where they're just seeing how far they can go in 12 minutes is going to be, um, kind of like about where they're going to target for those intervals."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "So then those intervals are going to be structured."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "Let's say we were doing two minute intervals."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "They're going to do two minutes at that intensity that they could do for 12 minutes at a time trial."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "Then they're going to do a two minute real easy jog, or maybe even walk just to kind of bounce back."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "And they're going to repeat it."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "How do you figure out how far you can go in 12 minutes?"}, {"time": 4458, "text": "Is that just a trial and error you build up to it?"}, {"time": 4458, "text": "There's formulas with, yeah, there's some newer formulas that are probably a little less, uh, um, brutal, uh, where you kind of, uh, I haven't really dove into these that that in depth yet."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "I know like, um, that you can kind of replicate it by doing like a short, a very short interval and then a slightly longer one."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "Um, and then like another one where like at the end one, that last one will kind of indicate what it is."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "Uh, and so you're doing less of it to get the same answer to the question."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "But sometimes I think when it's someone who's new, I'd rather them just do a 12 minute time trial because it's easy for them to execute in the sense that it's pretty clear."}, {"time": 4496, "text": "You do a warm up, you do some strides, maybe some dynamic stretches, and you just run as hard as you can for 12 minutes as evenly paced as you can manage."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "And, uh, I mean, if the, if it's going to produce the data I'm looking for, uh, and I mean, it's also no matter what happens, they'll produce the data."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "I mean, you can, you can screw it up."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "I guess you can go way too fast."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "Then you have this scenario where like, Oh, it looks like your, you know, your first two minutes were drastically faster than your last two."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "And then it's like, Oh, we maybe screwed that one up."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "But, um, but I mean really like you don't even need to do the time trial technically."}, {"time": 4565, "text": "And as you do a few of them, you just get to know the pacing of it a little better."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "And then you start seeing more even split."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "So like, you know, their first two minute intervals pretty close within a couple seconds of their second, or, you know, I guess we'd be looking at distance if we're doing time."}, {"time": 4576, "text": "So like you went approximately the same distance on that last one as you did the first one."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "And then we're just looking for improvement over time."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "So, you know, we might spend four, six weeks kind of focusing on improving that we're going to still include kind of foundational running volume where you're going to be running like an easy pace and enjoyable pace kind of in the interim."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "And then there's going to be some rest days and that's going to be where the levels come in."}, {"time": 4597, "text": "My like level one plans are going to be like four day a week training plans."}, {"time": 4601, "text": "Level two are going to be five day level three are going to be six day with one day off."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "Um, and you can obviously operate outside of those, those, those are just the ones that I put up for the readymade when I'm coaching people kind of personalized."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "We just, we look at like what their history is with running their schedule, all sorts of stuff."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "Cause oftentimes people get hung up on like, well, what are the elites doing?"}, {"time": 4621, "text": "What are the professionals doing?"}, {"time": 4621, "text": "What are the Olympians doing?"}, {"time": 4621, "text": "It's like, well, it's like what the Olympians are doing is they're waking up and they're living and breathing everything around this one race that they're going to do in four years."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "Or so it's like, we need to step away from that."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "If you're working, you know, 10 hours a day and you got kids and all this other stuff too."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "So, um, there's a lot of variables that make it more interesting to coach someone who's actually like not an elite athlete or someone who's a professional athlete, I should say, uh, the, but, but yeah, so they're, they're going to do that stuff."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "Those, those shorter intervals, um, for probably about like four to six weeks."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "If they're doing, if they're doing a longer race, like a hundred miles, if they were doing say a 5k, we'd start bringing those workouts in near the end of their plan."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "Cause that's going to be specific to their race pace."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "That's going to be the intensity that maybe they're doing for, you know, like a three K or a five K or something like that."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "So it's going to be more relative to what they're going to use."}, {"time": 4669, "text": "So it follows that philosophy."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "The plans follow that philosophy of weaknesses and least specific stuff early."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "And then we start phasing closer to most specific stuff and strengths as you get kind of near to the end of the plan."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "And then the distance of, or the time that you're going to spend out doing whatever event it is, is going to dictate how those kind of get ordered in there."}, {"time": 4689, "text": "I wonder if I could ask you for some sort of advice, maybe almost, uh, maybe look at me as a case study of a particular runner and runner and then see how we can plan stuff out."}, {"time": 4701, "text": "So which context to give."}, {"time": 4701, "text": "So I have been, first, let me say how much we're currently in Austin."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "I want to say how much I love Austin for many reasons."}, {"time": 4714, "text": "Uh, first and foremost, people are super kind and just like, there's so much love that I've experienced immediately when I came to the city versus many of the other cities I've been in."}, {"time": 4726, "text": "It's, uh, it's not quite as welcoming and full of kindness immediately."}, {"time": 4726, "text": "I mean, I really love, love it here in Austin."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "And because I've been going through a bunch of stressful stuff, I just kind of gave myself a chance to say, okay, I'm going to stick to a diet of carnivore, keto, but I'm going to eat as much as I want because, uh, primarily because just barbecue was part of the love I was getting here."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "And I was like, either I resist or just give in."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "And I decided to give in and actually use this as an opportunity to relax and have fun for the past three, four months, plus whiskey and so on."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "And then the training kind of all, I also let go of the training a little bit, just to relax, to really focus on the work, focus on the love I've been getting all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "But now I just kind of want to set a goal for myself to get back into both competing and grappling, but also doing a, um, hanging out with David Goggins and, uh, doing a conversation with him, but almost this is my own personal kind of race that I'm looking forward to."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "And in terms of distance, that means running with David, uh, something like a marathon plus plus it's like, it's unclear what plus."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "So my goal would be to, uh, continue eating carnivore, which is a whole nother topic that I'd love to talk to you about."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "I feel great psychologically, sort of in terms of mental performance in my work when I eat carnivore and physically, I love it."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "I've never felt any kind of need for carbs to, uh, to improve performance in my running or anything else."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "Combine that with fasting, intermittent fasting, or eating once a day."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "I just, that's when I, uh, feel the best."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "I also feel best."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "And this is something you can push back on."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "I feel best when I just run every day, like no breaks ever, and usually the same way every day."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "So like, I know this is suboptimal."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "It'd be interesting to hear your opinion of just how suboptimal that is."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "Uh, so I think that actually lays out like where my mind is."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "I'm happy eating carnivore once a day."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "I like running every day."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "Uh, the goal is to run a marathon in two months ish, two months plus, and then about three months to do a bunch of competitions and grappling."}, {"time": 4866, "text": "With those parameters, I think like you actually probably would be a great candidate for maximum heroic function training strategy."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "Like you want that consistency where I'm going to do the same thing each day."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "Uh, you don't want to beat yourself up so much any one day that you can't get out and do it the next one."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "So, um, where you could maybe get creative would be if you decided that it's a hard, fast rule that you run an hour every day, seven days a week."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "But we find out that to run your maximum robot function means you probably are better off sticking to 30 minutes."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "Then what you would maybe do is you would run underneath your maximum aerobic function for the first 15 minutes in the last 15 minutes, maybe throw some of those strides in there if you want to do that at the very end."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "Uh, and then that middle 30 minutes is going to be maximum road function target."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "And then maybe after, you know, four weeks, you start noticing, you know what, this 30 minutes isn't wearing me out near as much as it used to."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "Um, I feel like I could easily push past that."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "Well, let's up that to 40 minutes."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "So that 60, you're always staying within that 60 minute parameter that keeps your, your schedule consistent, your routine consistent."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "I'm wearing a heart rate monitor to sort of as I run to monitor it."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "You could do that."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "You could go perceived effort."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "Um, I like to use them in tandem in the sense that like early on, I'll maybe look at my heart rate a little more often, especially for shorter length."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "There is heart rate can get messy the longer you go."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "So I, I end up kind of maybe stepping away from heart rate a little more than some will at a certain point because I'm ultimately I'm going to be usually training or working with someone to run like, you know, a race that's really long and they get cardiac drift, dehydration, heat and things that are going to make the heart rate super messy."}, {"time": 4992, "text": "But you're probably your ability to measure perceived effort is exceptionally good."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "Mine is actually really weak."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "Heart rate then I need to do the, still the work of connecting heart rate to the perceived effort."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "And that's exactly what I would use heart rate for then."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "And you'll get to a point probably by like in the first couple of months where you, you can still lean on heart rate if you want, but it'll be kind of one of those things where you keep looking at, you're like, Oh wow, I can guess it."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "And you play a game with yourself too."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "And you say, well, how close can I guess?"}, {"time": 5019, "text": "You'll get it."}, {"time": 5019, "text": "So like for me, what I'll do is I'll do the run and then I'll look at the heart rate afterwards and be like, Oh cool."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "I was right there."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "Or I remember feeling like I was speeding up a little bit there and their show is right there on the heart rate or."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "I also love sort of something we haven't talked about."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "I love pushups and pull ups of like body weight workouts."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "Again, it's mostly mental."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "I just enjoy the mental challenge of it."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "I also like, it makes me feel like if all I'm doing is running, it makes me feel I'm not like."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "I mean, there's some aspect to running that's not to be like hippie about it, but like, you know, you're, you're with nature, you're running in the, it's like, we're born to do this thing."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "And that same way, I feel like when I'm doing pushups and pull ups, I feel like I was born to do that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5065, "text": "Like it's like this body weight exercise that is, body weight exercises have that way about them."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "It's, it doesn't have that dumbbell feel or doing bench press or squats, squats with weight."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "When you're just doing squats, body weight, we do pushups and pull ups, body weight, even just basic ab stuff, core stuff, body weight."}, {"time": 5087, "text": "I just love the way I feel doing that."}, {"time": 5087, "text": "So it's usually, I forgot to mention that part."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "I combine that with the running afterwards, doing some basic body weight stuff."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "And I think like you're going to get from, if we're not looking at it from like specifically, like training at a pace in order to get both the skeletal muscle adaptations, as well as the cardiovascular benefits, you're probably tapping into some of the higher intensity stuff with that body weight."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "So this, and unless you're doing, I guess no rest."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "So is it, you get pretty high heart rate from that."}, {"time": 5119, "text": "Higher than running."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "So you're checking that box there from just like a lifestyle, enjoyment, fitness, overall fitness standpoint."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "I think you want to keep your running more aerobic then because you're getting that and you're probably getting it from like your grappling workouts too, I would guess."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "So there's just not as big of a need for you from a big picture standpoint to be doubling down on that stuff with your runs as well."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "And it sounds like you prefer not to."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "So I mean, what about the distance of marathon versus a hundred miles?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "Is that a big difference?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "What's a good goal to work towards?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "Is it marathon and the rest of it just takes care of itself?"}, {"time": 5163, "text": "So you want to do a marathon and then ultimately do a hundred mile after that?"}, {"time": 5168, "text": "I have no idea what the guy."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "Oh, so he's going to tell you spot on what you're doing."}, {"time": 5173, "text": "So you have to be ready for anything."}, {"time": 5173, "text": "For anything."}, {"time": 5177, "text": "My own personal goal is to feel somewhat challenged, but comfortable running a marathon."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "The longest I've ever run is 22 miles, but there's been many stretches of my life where I would regularly run."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "Like the long run would be close to 20 miles."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "And then I was comfortably running 10 miles four months ago."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "Feels like forever ago."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "Until I injured myself a little bit by running in the snow and stubbing my toe to where it was like, you don't realize how much you appreciate your toes until you stub them."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "That big toes where all that power comes off."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "And so it was surprising how long it took to heal and how essential it was and how unpleasant running, how much I hated running with it."}, {"time": 5223, "text": "And then I kept like coming, trying to get back out there to run to think, I think it's okay."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "And no, it's not okay."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "You really need to let it fully heal."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "At least that was my experience."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "I couldn't like just suck it up."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "It was making it worse every time."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "And one of those injuries that could really feel, even though it's so small, but it's essential."}, {"time": 5237, "text": "So is there any difference between the goal of marathon or a hundred miles?"}, {"time": 5243, "text": "Would you say, should I be prepping for a hundred miles if that's at all a possibility?"}, {"time": 5248, "text": "The big difference is going to be like you're dropping intensity significantly by going up to a hundred miles versus the marathon."}, {"time": 5253, "text": "So the maximum aerobic function I think is actually going to feed into that maybe a little bit better."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "It's probably gonna be a little closer."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "It all varies a bit because people will focus on specific distances and they'll get very efficient and very adapted to that."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "So it's what makes running kind of messy where you'll get, for example, the average person can hit their lactate threshold for probably about 60 minutes or something like that."}, {"time": 5284, "text": "Whereas you get these elite marathoners who've been basically spending their entire life preparing for a marathon race."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "They can push almost up to their lactate threshold and after lactate threshold for almost like two hours."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "So it gets a little messy when you start looking at it from that lens, but you're, you don't really have to worry about that too much because you're not really focusing on being the best possible hundred mile or the best possible marathon."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "Or you could be, you want enough overall fitness that you can just do either one of them without absolute misery because you did the couch to a hundred miles."}, {"time": 5316, "text": "So I think like for a hundred miles, the biggest difference I think given your context is just like the more physical things you are doing, the better prepared you're going to be for the hundred mile."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "So it's almost given your context."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "I wouldn't say irrelevant."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "You want to be doing running, but you're going to be doing that."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "Once you put it in your program, it sounds like it's going to be pretty locked in."}, {"time": 5336, "text": "If you view it this way, it's probably going to be more mentally beneficial to where, Hey, today I did my run."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "I did my body weight exercises."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "I did some grappling practice."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "You know, I spent three hours working out today."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "If you think of it like that, then you know, you're, you're moving your body, you're doing things that are active for a good chunk of the day, especially relative to most people."}, {"time": 5361, "text": "So that's going to actually be very helpful for you."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "Uh, the, the problem or the, the, the battle to get over is going to just be like the, you know, you're going to break down physically running a hundred miles and you're gonna break down physically running a marathon too."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "So like the, you might just have to push through a little more discomfort, like from a physical standpoint compared to be a few decided I'm gonna do everything I can in these next like 24 weeks to be able to run a, a full hundred, a hundred miler."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "Would you say it's physical or is it mental discomfort?"}, {"time": 5394, "text": "Like, uh, I mean, isn't everything physically uncomfortable?"}, {"time": 5400, "text": "Like what, uh, do you train for if you're training for the chaos of, uh, so it's not necessarily the hundred miles."}, {"time": 5406, "text": "It's the chaos of the unexpected, which might include a hundred miles, but it might also include a thousand pushups in my case."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "So like, you need a bit jack of all trades is what you need to be."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "But also like building up the confidence or maybe not."}, {"time": 5419, "text": "How do you survive a thousand pushups?"}, {"time": 5419, "text": "It's combination of confidence that you have to know that you can do that kind of thing."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "Not necessarily the actual number, but like doing crazy stuff."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "And the, the second is probably the base strength and endurance and also just the practicing that process of not quitting."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "I feel like that's one of the things I really need to do in the running space is like doing slightly unpleasant things where I'm yeah, practicing that, like bringing my mind back and saying, Nope, uh, I'm going to keep doing it."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "And part of the running every day has that benefit because some days you really don't want to feel, don't feel like running and doing that."}, {"time": 5464, "text": "Then you're practicing that muscle of, um, of doing it anyway."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "Um, I don't know if there's something you can say in terms of advice, how to practice the, like doing something unpleasant every day frequently."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "What I would do with that is I would try to make the unpleasant thing be different from one day to the next if you can."}, {"time": 5487, "text": "So the fear I would have with making running unpleasant every time would be, it becomes like a negative feedback loop in your physiologically potentially as well as mentally, where if the entire running process is miserable, you're going to be miserable when you step on that starting line, whether it's a marathon or a hundred miles."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So you've trained yourself that running equals miserable."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "Well, and here's the thing."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "Like if you look at just like, here's where the literature says on paper are like the dozen workouts you should do in a training plan."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "And this is how you should structure them right down to the minute."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "And you just say, like, I'm going to give everyone this schedule and they're going to do this every time rinse and repeat."}, {"time": 5530, "text": "My biggest concern with that approach is you are potentially putting them in a position where the training is so boring and so monotonous that like if they hit a roadblock mentally, they're going to fall apart very quick because they've already exhausted themselves mentally, just trying to do the same old interval every time doing the same old workout."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "And it doesn't necessarily have to be like one specific plan in its entirety could just be like, like the, the mix of things within it."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "So like, rather than like, if I just said, do, oh, we're going to do three minute intervals, this entire short interval process or two minute intervals or four minute intervals or 62nd intervals, you know, by that sixth week, they might be so sick of that, that they're not actually maximizing their potential within that because there's no flavor there."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "Uh, so like, I think what you want to do is you want to introduce the misery."}, {"time": 5617, "text": "So if you can possibly say like, okay, on Tuesdays, the pushup workout, I'm going to go 10 pushups more than I want to."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "I'm going to get to that point where I'm like, there's no more."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "And then I'm going to do 10 more and you're going to make that one miserable."}, {"time": 5631, "text": "And then maybe on, uh, you know, Thursdays you decide to do like some of those sprints or something at the end where you do a few of them and you're like, okay, this is where I'd be comfortable to stop."}, {"time": 5641, "text": "Like, well, I'm going to do two more of them because I know I don't want to do two more of them, um, but mix that up."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "So you're not, so at least you're getting enjoyment from some of it and not just getting complete disgust from the entire process."}, {"time": 5652, "text": "There's actually quite a lot of ways that I can introduce misery into the running, get creative, including, um, you know, even just like stuff outside of the running, like taking a freezing cold showers, those kinds of things, just introducing random kind of chaos into the, into the system, um, or having conversations with people as an introvert."}, {"time": 5673, "text": "More podcasts."}, {"time": 5673, "text": "So, um, now starting, uh, the training and, uh, Zach, you've been kind enough to also kind of, um, be willing to help me out throughout this process."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "So I look forward to where that goes."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "It's kind of, uh, fascinating."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "Um, on the diet side, you're, uh, one of, one of the many things that, uh, make you fascinating is, uh, you've played with diet as well and you're, um, somewhat famous, I would say, for doing low carb or playing with low carb or meat based diets."}, {"time": 5706, "text": "Can you describe the potential, like how you're thinking about that has evolved and the potential beneficial role of a carnivore diet or keto diet or a meat based diet in training as an ultra marathon runner?"}, {"time": 5717, "text": "And I think like where a lot of times things get confusing for people here is the context of it too, where it's like, they want an answer as to what do I eat for endurance sport?"}, {"time": 5726, "text": "And it's like, well, endurance sport is quite wide ranging as we've talked about many, many times here."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "So there's going to be differences, I think, in just like what you want to maybe necessarily prioritize, uh, both for the event you're doing and the intensity that's required for it, the training that's required for that event."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "And then also the individual component too, where I think this one often gets overlooked, where we tend to say like, well, we've got all these Olympic medalists at the marathon and below distance who are, you know, eating a moderate to high carbohydrate diet."}, {"time": 5761, "text": "So everyone needs to do that if they want to reach their potential in, you know, say the three K to the marathon."}, {"time": 5766, "text": "And, you know, in a perfect world, maybe that would be true, but there's a lot of other variables that often get forgotten then that could positively or negatively impact that decision choice."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "So I think Dr. Jeff Volk has done a great job of kind of highlighting this in the sense that, you know, when he works with people, he works with people in the health sphere as well as the performance sphere."}, {"time": 5786, "text": "And, you know, he's one of the main guys at Virta health who's, uh, they've got like a 60% success rate with working with folks with the type two diabetes to, um, reverse their type two diabetes."}, {"time": 5796, "text": "Uh, and I mean, that's an astounding, when you, when you think of just any nutritional protocol, its success rate, they're all incredibly low."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "They're very, very low."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "And the big difference with his is the coaching aspect of it."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "Like the give support."}, {"time": 5812, "text": "So these people like have someone to turn to when they make a mistake, or if they're thinking about doing something differently, or they don't know what to do rather than just kind of throwing, throwing it all up in the air and quitting."}, {"time": 5820, "text": "They, they, they have a resource there."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "And that's probably a big reason why that's the success rate that they have

just been identifying that, uh, you know, Olympic distance athletes that can tolerate a very large portion of their diet coming from carbohydrate is going to just, it's going to filter those ones towards the Olympics filter those towards interesting."}, {"time": 5851, "text": "And that doesn't mean that like, uh, if we would have taken say the gold medals in the five came, put them on a low carb diet, they'd run faster."}, {"time": 5858, "text": "They probably wouldn't, because we may have already selected that that person's thriving on carbohydrate."}, {"time": 5865, "text": "Uh, what I would be interested in is like, you have, let's say we have someone with equal talent, but got weeded out along the way potentially because for whatever reason, they just weren't able to tolerate like the, both the training and the nutrition requirements that they're being told to do."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "So the coaches can, there's a culture where the coaches would really push a carb heavy diet and that that would in itself would do the filtering process of people that are not, it would filter out the people that are not able to tolerate carbs as part of their training."}, {"time": 5896, "text": "I mean, I might be an example of this actually where, you know, you take someone where, uh, they, for whatever reason, the carbs aren't working for them."}, {"time": 5900, "text": "Like it's unsustainable for them to continue that path."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "Or if they do, they might have a shortened career, so they might be able to eke out a few really good years, but then, you

put them on a low carb diet, uh, if you can control everything else, like their entire lifestyle is based around training and racing, then, uh, you know, they may still have better potential by introducing carbohydrates at a higher level."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "But if that's not going to, if that's not going to be sustainable for them as a person, then, you know, what's the point kind of

for, for some context, like I followed what I would call a low carbohydrate diet for the last 10 years."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "And just like kind of the training, I periodize it to a degree where there are parts of my training where I do bring back a little more carbohydrate."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "And there's periods of my training, especially like the off season where I'm like very low and I might be like kind of in that ballpark of, uh, like, you know, ketogenic, strict ketogenic or no carbohydrates for, for periods of time."}, {"time": 6014, "text": "And what kind of food are we

a lot of work over time from the training side of things."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "I just think like anytime you hyper focus on one area or pick a couple of variables and just target those, you find yourself in a position where you are, you're putting other things in the most uncharitable light possible."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "So, so then you have this situation where like, it's actually a combination of a variety of different things."}, {"time": 6220, "text": "So where are the big movers?"}, {"time": 6220, "text": "And you know, for me, nutritional shift was pretty clear that that

this."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "I've had like several moments in my life where you kind of realize the body is weird and it's weirder than the average advice."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "Like one of them is how well I perform for my own standards when I fast."}, {"time": 6304, "text": "First of all, intellectually, but that's more known and understandable."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "But like

grams of carbs and see how you actually feel."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "Not like in that moment, but over a period of several weeks and then doing everything else right with based on best available

and now we got this opposite end of the spectrum coming at us."}, {"time": 6444, "text": "But I think, well, I mean, what this all tells, what this all tells me is like, there is a, for one, like in

some of the research of Dominic DiAgostino and Jeff Volokh was looking at the ketogenic diet, which of carnivore diet is basically going to be a part of a ketogenic."}, {"time": 6517, "text": "I mean, you could always go like way too high on the protein, I guess, but most people that I see doing carnivore, they're cognizant enough that at least if they're doing it for therapeutic reasons, they're not going like, you know, 50% protein, 50%."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "They're more like 70, 30, 80, 20, something like that."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "And, and I think like you, you do see some, some work with like the brain."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "So the mental stuff, I know some of the, I'm not sure if this was part of the DARPA funding that, that Dr. Dominic DiAgostino had where they were looking at things like mental stuff, like post traumatic stress disorder and that sort of stuff with, with like a strict ketogenic diet."}, {"time": 6558, "text": "So I wonder if some of that, like the depression related stuff has to do with that, where now like their body is just fueling their brain differently than maybe they were in the past, but that's just, you know, wild guesses on my part."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "And I'm deviating from the conversation, but like, no, that's brilliant."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "In terms of your own story on food, can you say something?"},

sessions, like maybe the day before, let's go even that far during, and maybe a few hours after."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "It'll be a little different for racing than it will be for like a big

"You're going to replicate the race almost up to it in training."}, {"time": 6611, "text": "Whereas with a hundred miles, you can't, you might replicate a third of it."}, {"time": 6616, "text": "So, so I'll do, I'll walk you through kind of my approach for, for like a hundred mile race."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "And I can tell you maybe what I would do differently on like a training day."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "But yeah, so for where, where the community is an agreement is that you do want to be very good at burning fat for ultra marathons."}, {"time": 6633, "text": "I mean, there's just like the intensity is low."}, {"time": 6633, "text": "If your, if your ratios are skewed very high towards carbohydrate metabolism, then you're going to have to defend your muscle glycogen through tons of carbohydrate consumption."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "And that's just going to be very hard to do over the course of an entire day, even at low intensities."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "So it's a fuel tank thing."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "I mean, it's like your, your leanest endurance athletes have way more fat than they do."}, {"time": 6656, "text": "Glycogen stores."}, {"time": 6661, "text": "When you're doing the low intensity performance, you want to be burning high levels of fat and sparing that muscle glycogen."}, {"time": 6665, "text": "What I tend to do is I want to start the race burning really high levels of fat."}, {"time": 6671, "text": "So I'm going to, I'll maybe have some carbohydrate the night before for dinner, but then I'm going to lean into the overnight fast breakfast the morning of I'm going to stay away from carbohydrates for a hundred mile or anyway."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "And I'm going to have something like something that's pretty like a high energy, low volume."}, {"time": 6685, "text": "So like I'll do like an S fuels, a life bar."}, {"time": 6693, "text": "They've got like, what's in an S fuel life bar?"}, {"time": 6693, "text": "Are we talking about carbs or we're talking about protein fat and protein?"}, {"time": 6698, "text": "Fat protein bar."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "And then they make some awesome."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "So it's, it's not as low carb."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "They make S fuels makes a whole product line."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "That's like kind of positioned for a low carb athlete."}, {"time": 6709, "text": "So they have some products on their lineup that offers some carbohydrate, which is perfect for me because I do introduce some carbohydrate on racing and some of my bigger training sessions and things, but the majority of their products are low carb."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "So like they have like, you know how you get like the powders that you put into like your drinks that are like high carbohydrate, you know, sports products."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "They make a version of that."}, {"time": 6733, "text": "That's like fat based."}, {"time": 6733, "text": "That you can mix in with water."}, {"time": 6733, "text": "So they've got like a creamer version and then a fruity flavored version."}, {"time": 6739, "text": "So you can like replicate the taste and the feel of drinking like a, like, you know, a sports drink."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "Science is awesome."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "I know it is."}, {"time": 6747, "text": "Well, and that's so much of it too, cause people are always like, well, I don't know."}, {"time": 6747, "text": "I just, I just like to have my Gatorade or whatever."}, {"time": 6750, "text": "It's like, well, you can have it now."}, {"time": 6750, "text": "It just, it won't have all that."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "So you can bring that kind of thing with you."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "So I'm leaning on a lot of those like kind of liquid calories, like those low volume, high energy fat protein stuff the morning of so that when I start the race, my body's going to be encouraged to start out burning high levels of fat."}, {"time": 6768, "text": "Once I get going probably about 45 minutes in, I'll start introducing small amounts of carbohydrate."}, {"time": 6775, "text": "So at that point, my body's been revving pretty high fat metabolism and by introducing some carbohydrate in the context of the, you know, let's say my a hundred mile, uh, personal record, you know, I'm, I'm running approximately nine miles every hour."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "So I'm probably going through about a thousand calories in an hour's time."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "Uh, I'm going to start just like defending muscle glycogen by burning super high levels of fat at the heart rate I would do for that."}, {"time": 6803, "text": "I'm probably burning somewhere between 80, 90% fat, you know, 12 hours of that you can chip away at your muscle glycogen, uh, to the point where you don't necessarily want to go zero carb."}, {"time": 6812, "text": "So I'm basically just trying to defend what I know I'm going to be burning from the carbohydrate side of that 80 to 90% fat, 10 to 20% carbohydrate by taking in like, usually, you know, I've gone as low as about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour and as high as 40 grams."}, {"time": 6829, "text": "Um, and the reality is somewhere in between is probably the sweet spot, but 40, I can get away without any digestion issues."}, {"time": 6834, "text": "So I'm not really concerned pushing up to that during a race since I'm only concerned about performance on that day, the carbs, the problem, or is it fiber?"}, {"time": 6845, "text": "Oh, from going above 40 grams or just cause you mentioned digestion issues."}, {"time": 6845, "text": "Like one of the things for me, like one of the cool things about fatty protein protein and fat is like my stomach just feels way better."}, {"time": 6856, "text": "So like carbs introduce like bloating and just not feeling great."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "And I think the funny thing is like, if you look at the position paper for ultra marathon single day events and it's, you know, it's very limited in the sense that then it's not anyone's fault."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "It's just, we don't have a lot of great research on a hundred mile race."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "It's really hard to study what's going on when someone's running a hundred miles, but they'll say moderate carbohydrate diet is recommended, but they'll also say that it's like something like 60% of participants are going to report some sort of like digestion issue during the event."}, {"time": 6885, "text": "So then it kind of becomes an issue of, do you want to flip that coin?"}, {"time": 6889, "text": "Do you want to flip that coin and be the 40%."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "So for me, what I found is like, I can push up to 40 grams without getting any digestion issues."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "Um, do I need 40 grams?"}, {"time": 6900, "text": "Probably not, at least not based on kind of the numbers that would be like, uh, that, that I would see on, like if I went and actually got a, like a metabolic heart test or something like that."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "Um, but it's possible."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "I mean, if I had a really good race that I would get close to burning that per hour, um, most folks that are following a moderate high carbohydrate diet are going to be recommended to do like 50 to 70 grams during a single day ultra marathon events."}, {"time": 6924, "text": "And you'll see some, you know, some recommendations of up to like a hundred grams, uh, not so much for ultra marathons, but just in general, from like a performance standpoint, which I mean, it's one of those things where it's like application versus like what you can do in a lab for one hour is going to be a lot different, especially when you're stretching out distances well past that."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "And you, you, there's, there's, I'm diverting a little here, but I mean, there's like an approach of like training your gut so you can like be able to tolerate that much carbohydrate, which you can do, and you may have to, if you're going to follow a high carbohydrate diet."}, {"time": 6980, "text": "Most people who are running ultra marathons aren't going to be, you know, probably training much past 10 hours per week."}, {"time": 6984, "text": "And they're probably not going to have the, I'll call it their, a dietary budget to tolerate a hundred grams of carbohydrate consumption during their workouts and still be able to stay healthy."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "And, you know, so I think that's kind of like a, a bit of a, of a non, a non starter for the majority of people, unless we want to talk about like a tiny percentage of the 1% of top performers."}, {"time": 7011, "text": "So maybe you can talk about the training, like fueling yourself during training as well."}, {"time": 7015, "text": "Is there, and also as part of that, is it possible to train mostly fasted?"}, {"time": 7022, "text": "Because as a side comment, let me just say, I like, again, not anywhere, not even like one 10th of your level of performance, but you know, I, I try to push myself and I just feel much better when I'm fasted."}, {"time": 7035, "text": "So water and maybe some salt for longer runs for anything over like 10, 15 miles, but not no food."}, {"time": 7041, "text": "I think, I mean, I like to train on an empty stomach."}, {"time": 7041, "text": "I do most of my, my biggest training session usually in the morning."}, {"time": 7047, "text": "And it usually what will determine whether I eat something or not before that is like, how much do I need to eat that day in order to stay on top of it, to build training in the next day."}, {"time": 7053, "text": "So I'll, I'll, I'll

about to talk to me, we're about at the end of that process."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So most of what we're doing now is not putting in even what you would consider common sense, but more putting in

the complement of that, the white space, if you will."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So what did the writer of this sentence assume that the reader already knew about the world?"}, {"time": 1212, "text":

out with something like, the judge, dot, dot, dot, then you assume it's the judge at his trial."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "If my next sentence starts out something like, the arresting officer, dot,

about the world and so on, there are all sorts of inconsistencies that creep in here and there that will sort of kill some attempt to build some enormous globally consistent knowledge base."},

1546, "text": "In much the same way, the psych knowledge base is divided up into almost like tectonic plates, which are individual contexts."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "And each context is more or less consistent, but there can be small inconsistencies at the boundary between one context and the next one and so on."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "And so by the time you move say 20 contexts over, there could be glaring inconsistencies."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "So eventually you get from the normal modern real world context that we're in right now to something like roadrunner cartoon context where physics is very different."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "And in fact, life and death are very different because no matter how many times he's killed, the coyote comes back in the next scene and so on."},

level, it's mostly empty space and so on."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So then that's fascinating, but it puts a lot of pressure on context to do a lot of work."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So you say tectonic plates, is it possible to formulate contexts that are general and big that do this kind of capture of knowledge bases?"}, {"time": 1649, "text": "Or do you then get turtles on top of turtles, again, where there's just a huge number of contexts?"}, {"time": 1659, "text": "So it's good you asked that question because you're pointed in the right direction, which is you want context to be first class objects in your system's knowledge base, in particular, in psych's knowledge base."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And by first class object, I mean that we should be able to have psych think about and talk about and reason about one context or another context the same way it reasons about coffee cups and tables and people and fishing and so on."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "And so contexts are just terms in its language, just like the ones I mentioned."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "And so psych can reason about context, context can arrange hierarchically and so on."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And so you can say things about, let's say, things that are true in the modern era, things that are true in a particular year would then be a subcontext of the things that are true in a broader, let's say, a century or a millennium or something like that."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "Things that are true in Austin, Texas are generally going to be a specialization of things that are true in Texas, which is going to be a specialization of things that are true in the United States and so on."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "And so you don't have to say things over and over again at all these levels."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "You just say things at the most general level that it applies to, and you only have to say it once, and then it essentially inherits to all these more specific contexts."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "To ask a slightly technical question, is this inheritance a tree or a graph?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Oh, you definitely have to think of it as a graph."},

representation could only have one parent node."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "So if you had a table that was a wooden object, a black object, a flat object, and so on, you have to choose one, and that's the only parent it could have."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "When, of course, depending on what it is you need to reason about it, sometimes it's important to know that it's made out of wood, like if we're talking about a fire."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "Sometimes it's important to know that it's flat if we're talking about resting something on it, and so on."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "So one of the problems was that they wanted a kind of Dewey decimal numbering system for all of their concepts, which meant that each node could only have at most 10 children, and each node could only have one parent."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "And while that does enable the Dewey decimal type numbering of concepts, labeling of concepts, it prevents you from representing all the things you need to about objects in our world."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "And that was one of the things which they never were able to overcome, and I think that was one of the main reasons that that project failed."},

way, I should mention that Marvin wouldn't do his estimate until someone brought him an envelope so that he could literally do a back of the envelope calculation to come up with his number."},

1873, "text": "A few people get together and plant the seed of ideas, and they reverberate throughout history."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "And some kind of dissipate and disappear, and some, you know,

aliens finally show up, that equation will get even more valuable because then we'll get, be able to, in the long arc of history, the Drake equation will prove to be quite useful, I think."}, {"time":

between what you think of as facts and the kind of things that we represent."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "So we map to and essentially make sure that psych has the ability to, as it were, read and access the kind of facts you might find, say, in Wikidata or stated in a Wikipedia article or something like that."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So what we're representing, the things that we need a small number of tens of millions of, are more like rules of thumb, rules of good guessing, things which are usually true and which help you to make sense of the facts that are sort of sitting off in some database or some other more static storage."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "So they're almost like platonic forms."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "So like when you read stuff on Wikipedia, that's going to be like projections of those ideas."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "You read an article about the fact that Elvis died, that's a projection of the idea that humans are mortal."}, {"time": 1968, "text":

the things that were assumed?"}, {"time": 1981, "text": "And so those are things like if you have a problem with something, turning it off and on often fixes it for reasons we don't really understand

2%, maybe it's the final 99%."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "So even if I'm wrong, all I really need to build is a system which has primed the pump enough that it can begin that cascade upward, that self

of it like this kind of synergy where you want the right brain machine learning to quickly come up with possible answers."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "You want the left brain psych like AI to think

was missing in computer programs was that even if they got things right, because they didn't really understand the way the world works and why things are the way they are, they weren't able to give explanations of their answer."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "And it's one thing to use a machine learning system that says, I think you should get this operation and you say why and it says 0.83 and you

"So, you have these nodes that represent concepts or words or terms and then there are some arcs that connect them that might be labeled."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "And so, you might have a node with like one person that represents one person and let's say a husband link that then points to that person's husband."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "And so, there'd be then another link that went from that person labeled wife that went back to the first node and so on."}, {"time": 4070, "text": "So, having this kind of representation is really good if you want to represent binary relations, essentially relations between two things."}, {"time": 4088, "text": "So, if you have equivalent of like three word sentences, like Fred's wife is Wilma or something like that, you can represent that very nicely using these kinds of graph structures or using something like the Semantic Web and so on."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "But the problem is that very often what you want to be able to express takes a lot more than three words and a lot more than simple graph structures like that to represent."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "So, for instance, if you've read or seen Romeo and Juliet, I could say to you

you could say a lot of things, but it might not be obvious to a lot of people when they do a Google search that, just like you said, while there might be something that's called a Knowledge Graph, it

like some weird combination of surface level hacks that work exceptionally well, but they don't understand the full contents of the websites that they're searching."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "So,

up with a way for the computer to be able to truly understand the contents of those pages."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "So, let me first give you an anecdote, and then I'll answer your question."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "So, there's a search engine you've probably never heard of called Northern Light, and it went out of business, but the way it worked, it was a kind of vampiric search engine, and what it did was it didn't index the internet at all."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "All it did was it negotiated and got access to data from the big search engine companies about what query was typed in, and where the user ended up being happy, and actually then they type in a completely different query, unrelated query and so on."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "So, it just went from query to the webpage that seemed to satisfy them eventually, and that's all."}, {"time": 4328, "text": "So, it had actual no understanding of what was being typed in, it had no statistical data other than what I just mentioned, and it did a fantastic job."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "It did such a good job that the big search engine company said, oh, we're not going to sell you this data anymore."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "So, then it went out of business because it had no other way of taking users to where they would want to go and so on."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "And of course, the search engines are now using that kind of idea."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "So, let's go back to what you said about the Semantic Web."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "So, the dream Tim Berners Lee and others dream about the Semantic Web at a general level is, of course, exciting and powerful, and in a sense, the right dream to have, which is to replace the kind of statistically mapped linkages on the internet into something that's more meaningful and semantic and actually gets at the understanding of the content and so on."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "And eventually, if you say, well, how can we do that?"}, {"time": 4403, "text": "There's sort of a low road, which is what the knowledge graphs are doing and so on, which is to say, well, if we just use the simple binary relations, we can actually get some fraction of the way toward understanding and do something where in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king kind of thing."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "And so, being able to even just have a toe in the water in the right direction is fantastically powerful."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "And so, that's where a lot of people stop."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "But then you could say, well, what if we really wanted to represent and reason with the full meaning of what's there?"}, {"time": 4444, "text": "For instance, about Romeo and Juliet with the reasoning about what Juliet believes that Romeo will believe that Juliet believed and so on."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "Or if you look at the news, what President Biden believed that the leaders of the Taliban would believe about the leaders of Afghanistan if they blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "So, in order to represent complicated sentences like that, let alone reason with them, you need something which is logically much more

{"time": 6273, "text": "And let me ask you another way too, because I've talked to a few people on this podcast, AI folks, that bring up Psych as an example of a project that has a beautiful vision and is a beautiful dream, but it never really materialized."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "That's how it's spoken about."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "I suppose you could say the same thing about neural networks and all ideas until they are."}, {"time": 6296, "text": "So why do you think people say that, first of all?"}, {"time": 6305, "text": "And second of all, did you feel that ever throughout your journey?"}, {"time": 6305, "text": "And did you ever consider quitting on this mission?"}, {"time": 6313, "text": "We keep a very low profile."}, {"time": 6313, "text": "We don't attend very many conferences."}, {"time": 6313, "text": "We don't give talks."}, {"time": 6313, "text": "We don't write papers."}, {"time": 6321, "text": "We don't play the academic game at all."}, {"time": 6321, "text": "And as a result, people often only know about us because of a paper we wrote 10 or 20 or 30 or 37 years ago."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "They only know about us because of what someone else secondhand or thirdhand said about us."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "So thank you for doing this podcast, by the way."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "It shines a little bit of light on some of the fascinating stuff you're doing."}, {"time": 6352, "text": "Well, I think it's time for us to keep a higher profile now that we're far enough along that other people can begin to help us with the final N%."}, {"time": 6359, "text": "Maybe N is maybe 90%."}, {"time": 6359, "text": "But now that we've gotten this knowledge pump primed, it's going to become very important for everyone to help if they are willing to, if they're interested in it."}, {"time": 6378, "text": "Retirees who have enormous amounts of time and would like to leave some kind of legacy to the world, people because of the pandemic who have more time at home or for one reason or another to be online and contribute."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "If we can raise awareness of how far our project has come and how close to being primed the knowledge pump is, then we can begin to harness this untapped amount of humanity."}, {"time": 6407, "text": "I'm not really that concerned about professional colleagues opinions of our project."}, {"time": 6416, "text": "I'm interested in getting as many people in the world as possible actively helping and contributing to get us from where we are to really covering all of human knowledge and different human opinion including contrasting opinion that's worth representing."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "So I think that's one reason."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "A, I don't think there was ever a time where I thought about quitting."}, {"time": 6444, "text": "There are times where I've become depressed a little bit about how hard it is to get funding for the system."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "Occasionally there are AI winters and things like that."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "Occasionally there are AI what you might call summers where people have said, why in the world didn't you sell your company to company X for some large amount of money when you had the opportunity and so on."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "Company X here are like old companies maybe you've never even heard of like Lycos or something like that."}, {"time": 6512, "text": "So five years ago almost all of our money came from the government."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Now virtually none of it comes from the government."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Almost all of it is from companies that are actually using it for something, hospital chains using it for medical reasoning about patients and energy companies using it and various other manufacturers using it to reason about supply chains and things like that."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "So there's so many questions I want to ask."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "So one of the ways that people can help is by adding to the knowledge base and that's really basically anybody if the tooling is right."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "And the other way, I kind of want to ask you about your thoughts on this."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "So you've had like you said in government and you had big clients, you had a lot of clients but most of it is shrouded in secrecy because of the nature of the relationship of the kind of things you're helping them with."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "So that's one way to operate and another way to operate is more in the open where it's more consumer facing."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "And so you know hence something like open cycle is born at some point or there's... No that's a misconception."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "Oh well this let's go there."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "So what is open cycle and how is it born?"}, {"time": 6589, "text": "Two things I want to say and I want to say each of them before the other so it's going to be difficult."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "But we'll come back to open cycle in a minute."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "But one of the terms of our contracts with all of our customers and partners is knowledge you have that is genuinely proprietary to you."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "We will respect that, we'll make sure that it's marked as proprietary to you in the psych knowledge base."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "No one other than you will be able to see it if you don't want them to and it won't be used in inferences other than for you and so on."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "However, any knowledge which is necessary in building any applications for you and with you which is publicly available general human knowledge is not going to be proprietary."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "It's going to just become part of the normal psych knowledge base and it will be openly available to everyone who has access to psych."}, {"time": 6642, "text": "So that's an important constraint that we never went back on even when we got pushback from companies which we often did who wanted to claim that almost everything they were telling us was proprietary."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "So there's a line between very domain specific company specific stuff and the general knowledge that comes from that."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "Yes or if you imagine say it's an oil company there are things which they would expect any new petroleum engineer they hired to already know and it's not okay for them to consider that that is proprietary and there sometimes a company will say well we're the first ones to pay you to represent that in psych and our attitude is some polite form tough."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "The deal is this take it or leave it and in a few cases they've left it and in most cases they'll see our point of view and take it because that's how we've built the psych system by essentially tacking with the funding wins where people would fund a project and half of it would be general knowledge that would stay permanently as part of psych."}, {"time": 6719, "text": "So always with these partnerships it's not like a distraction from the main psych development."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "It's a small distraction."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "It's a small but it's not a complete one so you're adding to the knowledge base."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "Yes absolutely and we try to stay away from projects that would not have that property."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "So let me go back and talk about open psych for a second."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "So I've had a lot of trouble expressing and convincing other AI researchers how important it is to use an expressive representation language like we do this higher order logic rather than just using some triple store knowledge graph type representation."}, {"time": 6761, "text": "And so as an attempt to show them why they needed something more we said oh well we'll represent this unimportant projection or shadow or subset of psych that just happens to be the simple binary relations, the relation argument one argument two triples and so on."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "And then you'll see how much more useful it is if you had the entire psych system."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "So it's all well and good to have the taxonomic relations between terms like person and night and sleep and bed and house and eyes and so on."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "But think about how much more useful it would be if you also had all the rules of thumb about those things like people sleep at night, they sleep lying down, they sleep with their eyes closed, they usually sleep in beds in our country, they sleep for hours at a time, they can be woken up, they don't like being woken up and so on and so on."}, {"time": 6835, "text": "So it's that massive amount of knowledge which is not part of open psych and we thought that all the researchers would then immediately say oh my god of course we need the other 90% that you're not giving us, let's partner and license psych so that we can use it in our research."}, {"time": 6855, "text": "But instead what people said is oh even the bit you've released is so much better than anything we had, we'll just make do with this."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "But there's two parts to open psych."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "So one is convincing people on the idea and the power of this general kind of representation of knowledge and the value that you hold in having acquired that knowledge and built it and continue to build it."}, {"time": 6902, "text": "And the other is the code base."}, {"time": 6902, "text": "This is the code side of it."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "So my sense of the code base that psych or psych is operating with, I mean it has the technical debt of the three decades plus right."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "This is the exact same problem that Google had to deal with with the early version of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 6923, "text": "It's still dealing with that."}, {"time": 6923, "text": "They had to basically break compatibility with the past several times and that's only over a period of a couple years."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "But they I think successfully opened up, it's very risky, very gutsy move to open up TensorFlow and then PyTorch on the Facebook side."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "And what you see is there's a magic place where you can find a community, where you could develop a community that builds on the system without taking away any of, not any, but most of the value."}, {"time": 6957, "text": "So most of the value that Google has is still a Google."}, {"time": 6965, "text": "Most of the value that Facebook has still Facebook even though some of this major machine learning tooling is released into the open."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "My question is not so much on the knowledge, which is also a big part of open psych, but all the different kinds of tooling."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "So there's the kind of, all the kinds of stuff you can do on the knowledge graph, knowledge base, whatever we call it."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "There's the inference engines."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "So there could be some, there probably are a bunch of proprietary stuff you want to kind of keep secret."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "And there's probably some stuff you can open up completely and then let the community build up enough community where they develop stuff on top of it."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "Yes, there will be those publications and academic work and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "And also the tooling of adding to the knowledge base, right?"}, {"time": 7011, "text": "Like developing, you know, there's incredible amount, like there's so many people that are just really good at this kind of stuff in the open source community."}, {"time": 7020, "text": "So my question for you is like, have you struggled with this kind of idea that you have so much value in your company already?"}, {"time": 7026, "text": "You've developed so many good things."}, {"time": 7026, "text": "You have clients that really value your relationships."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "And then there's this dormant giant open source community that as far as I know, you're not utilizing."}, {"time": 7037, "text": "There's so many things to say there, but there could be magic moments where the community builds up large enough to where the artificial intelligence field that is currently 99.9% machine learning is dominated by machine learning, has a face shift towards like, or at least in part towards more like what you might call symbolic AI."}, {"time": 7065, "text": "This whole place where psych is like at the center of, and then as you know, that requires a little bit leap of faith because you're now surfing and there'll be obviously competitors that will pop up and start making you nervous and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7079, "text": "So do you think about the space of open sourcing some parts and not others, how to leverage the community, all those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 7090, "text": "And I think you phrased it the right way, which is we're constantly struggling with the question of what to open source, what to make public, what to even publicly talk about."}, {"time": 7103, "text": "And there are enormous pluses and minuses to every alternative."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "And it's very much like negotiating a very treacherous path."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "Partly the analogy is like if you slip, you could make a fatal mistake, give away something which essentially kills you or fail to give away something which failing to give it away hurts you and so on."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "So it is a very tough, tough question."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "Usually what we have done with people who've approached us to collaborate on research is to say we will make available to you the entire knowledge base and executable copies of all of the code, but only very, very limited source code access if you have some idea for how you might improve something or work with us on something."}, {"time": 7169, "text": "So let me also get back to one of the very, very first things we talked about here, which was separating the question of how could you get a computer to do this at all versus how could you get a computer to do this efficiently enough in real time."}, {"time": 7190, "text": "And so one of the early lessons we learned was that we had to separate the epistemological problem of what should the system know, separate that from the heuristic problem of how can the system reason efficiently with what it knows."}, {"time": 7205, "text": "And so instead of trying to pick one representation language which was the sweet spot or the best tradeoff point between expressiveness of the language and efficiency of the language, if you had to pick one, knowledge graphs would probably be, associative triples would probably be about the best you could do."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "And that's why we started there."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "But after a few years, we realized that what we could do is we could split this and we could have one nice, clean, epistemological level language, which is this higher order logic, and we could have one or more grubby but efficient heuristic level modules that opportunistically would say, oh, I can make progress on what you're trying to do over here."}, {"time": 7260, "text": "I have a special method that will contribute a little bit toward a solution."}, {"time": 7265, "text": "Of course, some subset of that knowledge."}, {"time": 7269, "text": "So by now, we have over a thousand of these heuristic level modules, and they function as a kind of community of agents."}, {"time": 7274, "text": "And there's one of them, which is a general theorem prover."}, {"time": 7274, "text": "And in theory, that's the only one you need."}, {"time": 7280, "text": "But in practice, it always takes so long that you never want to call on it."}, {"time": 7289, "text": "You always want these other agents to very efficiently reason through it."}, {"time": 7289, "text": "It's sort of like if you're balancing a chemical equation."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "You could go back to first principles, but in fact, there are algorithms which are vastly more efficient."}, {"time": 7299, "text": "Or if you're trying to solve a quadratic equation, you could go back to first principles of mathematics."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "But it's much better to simply recognize that this is a quadratic equation and apply the binomial formula and snap, you get your answer right away and so on."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "So think of these as like a thousand little experts that are all looking at everything the site gets asked and looking at everything that every other little agent has contributed, almost like notes on a blackboard, notes on a whiteboard, and making additional notes when they think they can be helpful."}, {"time": 7339, "text": "And gradually, that community of agents gets an answer to your question, gets a solution to your problem."}, {"time": 7344, "text": "And if we ever come up in a domain application where Psych is getting the right answer but taking too long, then what we'll often do is talk to one of the human experts and say, here's the set of reasoning steps that Psych went through."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "You can see why it took it a long time to get the answer."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "How is it that you were able to answer that question in two seconds?"}, {"time": 7370, "text": "And occasionally, you'll get an expert who just says, well, I just know it."}, {"time": 7377, "text": "I just was able to do it or something."}, {"time": 7377, "text": "And then you don't talk to them anymore."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "But sometimes you'll get an expert who says, well, let me introspect on that."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "Yes, here is a special representation we use just for aqueous chemistry equations, or here's a special representation and a special technique, which we can now apply to things in this special representation and so on."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "And then you add that as the 1001st HL heuristic level module."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "And from then on, in any application, if it ever comes up again, it'll be able to contribute and so on."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "So that's pretty much one of the main ways in which Psych has recouped this loss deficiency."}, {"time": 7415, "text": "A second important way is meta reasoning."}, {"time": 7423, "text": "So you can speed things up by focusing on removing knowledge from the system till all it has left is minimal knowledge needed."}, {"time": 7432, "text": "But that's the wrong thing to do, right?"}, {"time": 7438, "text": "That would be like in a human extirpating part of their brain or something."}, {"time": 7438, "text": "That's really bad."}, {"time": 7442, "text": "So instead, what you want to do is give it meta level advice, tactical and strategic advice, that enables it to reason about what kind of knowledge is going to be relevant to this problem, what kind of tactics are going to be good to take in trying to attack this problem."}, {"time": 7455, "text": "When is it time to start trying to prove the negation of this thing, because I'm knocking myself out trying to prove it's true, and maybe it's false."}, {"time": 7466, "text": "And if I just spend a minute, I can see that it's false or something."}, {"time": 7470, "text": "So it's like dynamically pruning the graph to only like, based on the particular thing you're trying to infer."}, {"time": 7477, "text": "And so by now, we have about 150 of these sort of like breakthrough ideas that have led to dramatic speed ups in the inference process, where one of them was this ELHL split and lots of HL modules."}, {"time": 7493, "text": "Another one was using meta and meta level reasoning to reason about the reasoning that's going on and so on."}, {"time": 7499, "text": "And 150 breakthroughs may sound like a lot, but if you divide by 37 years, it's not as impressive."}, {"time": 7512, "text": "So there's these kind of heuristic modules that really help improve the inference."}, {"time": 7512, "text": "How hard, in general, is this?"}, {"time": 7521, "text": "Because you mentioned higher order logic."}, {"time": 7521, "text": "In the general theorem prover sense, it's intractable, very difficult problem."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "So how hard is this inference problem when we're not talking about if we let go of the perfect and focus on the good?"}, {"time": 7537, "text": "I would say it's half of the problem in the following empirical sense, which is over the years, about half of our effort, maybe 40% of our effort has been our team of inference programmers."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "And the other 50, 60% has been our ontologists or ontological engineers putting in knowledge."}, {"time": 7562, "text": "So our ontological engineers in most cases don't even know how to program."}, {"time": 7568, "text": "They have degrees in things like philosophy and so on."}, {"time": 7572, "text": "So it's almost like the..."}, {"time": 7572, "text": "I love to hang out with those people actually."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "Oh yes, it's wonderful."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "But it's very much like the Eloy and the Morlocks in H.G."}, {"time": 7582, "text": "Wells Time Machine."}, {"time": 7582, "text": "So you have the Eloy who only program in the epistemological higher order logic language."}, {"time": 7589, "text": "And then you have the Morlocks who are under the ground figuring out what the machinery is that will make this efficiently operate and so on."}, {"time": 7596, "text": "And so, you know, occasionally they'll toss messages back to each other and so on."}, {"time": 7603, "text": "But it really is almost this 50 50 split between finding clever ways to recoup efficiency when you have an expressive language and putting in the content of what the system needs to know."}, {"time": 7617, "text": "And yeah, both are fascinating."}, {"time": 7623, "text": "To some degree, the entirety of the system, as far as I understand, is written in various variants of Lisp."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "So my favorite program language is still Lisp."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "I don't program in it much anymore because, you know, the world has in majority of its system has moved on."}, {"time": 7637, "text": "Like everybody respects Lisp, but many of the systems are not written in Lisp anymore."}, {"time": 7644, "text": "But Syke, as far as I understand, maybe you can correct me, there's a bunch of Lisp in it."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "So it's based on Lisp code that we produced."}, {"time": 7657, "text": "Most of the programming is still going on in a dialect of Lisp."}, {"time": 7657, "text": "And then for efficiency reasons, that gets automatically translated into things like Java or C. Nowadays, it's almost all translated into Java because Java has gotten good enough that that's really all we need to do."}, {"time": 7678, "text": "So it's translated into Java, and then Java is compiled down to bytecode."}, {"time": 7683, "text": "Okay, so that's sort of that's a that that that's a, you know, it's a process that probably has to do with the fact that when Syke was originally written, and you build up a powerful system, like there is some technical depth you have to deal with, as is the case with most powerful systems that span years."}, {"time": 7702, "text": "Have you ever considered this, this would help me understand, because my perspective, so much of the value of everything you've done with Syke and Cycorp is the is the is the knowledge."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "Have you ever considered just like throwing away the code base and starting from scratch, not really throwing away, but sort of moving it to like throwing away that technical debt, starting with a more updated programming language?"}, {"time": 7733, "text": "Is that throwing away a lot of value or no?"}, {"time": 7739, "text": "How much of the value is in the silly software engineering aspect, and how much of the value is in the knowledge?"}, {"time": 7747, "text": "So development of programs in Lisp proceeds, I think, somewhere between a thousand and fifty thousand times faster than development in any of what you're calling modern or improved computer languages."}, {"time": 7770, "text": "Well, there's other functional languages like, you know, Clojure and all that."}, {"time": 7770, "text": "But I mean, I'm with you."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "I like Lisp."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "I just wonder how many great programmers there are."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "There's still like..."}, {"time": 7780, "text": "So it is true when a new inference programmer comes on board, they need to learn some of Lisp."}, {"time": 7788, "text": "And in fact, we have a subset of Lisp, which we call cleverly Sub L, which is really all they need to learn."}, {"time": 7795, "text": "And so the programming actually goes on in Sub L, not in full Lisp."}, {"time": 7795, "text": "And so it does not take programmers very long at all to learn Sub L. And that's something which can then be translated efficiently into Java."}, {"time": 7808, "text": "And for some of our programmers who are doing, say, user interface work, then they never have to even learn Sub L. They just have to learn APIs into the basic psych engine."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "So you're not necessarily feeling the burden of like, it's extremely efficient."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "That's not a problem to solve."}, {"time": 7831, "text": "The other thing is, remember that we're talking about hiring programmers to do inference, who are programmers interested in effectively automatic theorem proving."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "And so those are people already predisposed to representing things in logic and so on."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "And Lisp really was the programming language based on logic that John McCarthy and others who developed it basically took the formalisms that Alonzo Church and other philosophers, other logicians, had come up with and basically said, can we basically make a programming language which is effectively logic?"}, {"time": 7872, "text": "And so since we're talking about reasoning about expressions written in this epistemological language and we're doing operations which are effectively like theorem proving type operations and so on, there's a natural impedance match between Lisp and the knowledge, the way it's represented."}, {"time": 7896, "text": "So I guess you could say it's a perfectly logical language to use."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "Okay, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 7902, "text": "I'll even let you get away with that."}, {"time": 7906, "text": "Okay, thank you."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "So I'll probably use that in the future without credit."}, {"time": 7913, "text": "But no, I think the point is that the language you program in isn't really that important."}, {"time": 7921, "text": "It's more that you have to be able to think in terms of, for instance, creating new helpful HL modules and how they'll work with each other and looking at things that are taking a long time and coming up with new specialized data structures that will make this efficient."}, {"time": 7940, "text": "So let me just give you one very simple example, which is when you have a transitive relation like larger than, this is larger than that, which is larger than that, which is larger than that."}, {"time": 7950, "text": "So the first thing must be larger than the last thing."}, {"time": 7953, "text": "Whenever you have a transitive relation, if you're not careful, if I ask whether this thing over here is larger than the thing over here, I'll have to do some kind of graph walk or theorem proving that might involve like five or 10 or 20 or 30 steps."}, {"time": 7968, "text": "But if you store, redundantly store the

be your one and only test for intelligence."}, {"time": 8593, "text": "In terms of tests of intelligence, you know, with the Lobner Prize, which is a very kind of, you want to say a more strict formulation of the Turing test as originally formulated."}, {"time": 8605, "text": "And then there's something like Alexa Prize, which is more, I would say a more interesting formulation of the test, which is like, ultimately the metric is how long does a human want to talk to the AI system?"}, {"time": 8618, "text": "So it's like if the goal is you want it to be 20 minutes, it's basically not just have a convincing conversation, but more like a compelling one or a fun one or an interesting one."}, {"time": 8633, "text": "And that seems like more to the spirit maybe of what Turing was imagining."}, {"time": 8641, "text": "But what for you do you think in the space of tests is a good test?"}, {"time": 8646, "text": "When you see a system based on psych that passes that test, you'd be like, damn, we've created something special here."}, {"time": 8657, "text": "The test has to be something involving depth of reasoning and recursiveness of reasoning, the ability to answer repeated why questions about the answer you just gave."}, {"time": 8670, "text": "How many why questions in a row can you keep answering?"}, {"time": 8676, "text": "Just have like a young curious child and an AI system and how long will an AI system last before it wants to quit?"}, {"time": 8684, "text": "And again, that's not the only test."}, {"time": 8685, "text": "Another one has to do with argumentation."}, {"time": 8688, "text": "In other words, here's a proposition, come up with pro and con arguments for it and try and give me convincing arguments on both sides."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "And so that's another important kind of ability that the system needs to be able to exhibit in order to really be intelligent, I think."}, {"time": 8712, "text": "So there's certain, I mean, if you look at IBM Watson and like certain impressive accomplishments for very specific tests, almost like a demo, right?"}, {"time": 8724, "text": "There's some, like I talked to the guy who led the Jeopardy effort, and there's some kind of hard coding heuristics tricks that you try to pull it all together to make the thing work in the end for this thing, right?"}, {"time": 8743, "text": "That seems to be one of the lessons with AI is like, that's the fastest way to get a solution that's pretty damn impressive."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "So here's what I would say is that as impressive as that was, it made some mistakes, but more importantly, many of the mistakes it made were mistakes which no human would have made."}, {"time": 8767, "text": "And so part of the new or augmented Turing tests would have to be, and the mistakes you make are ones which humans don't basically look at and say, what?"}, {"time": 8784, "text": "So for example, there was a question about which 16th century Italian politician, blah, blah, blah, and Watson said Ronald Reagan."}, {"time": 8797, "text": "So most Americans would have gotten that question wrong, but they would never have said Ronald Reagan as an answer because among the things they know is that he lived relatively recently and people don't really live 400 years and things like that."}, {"time": 8813, "text": "So that's, I think, a very important thing, which is if it's making mistakes which no normal sane human would have made, then that's a really bad sign."}, {"time": 8825, "text": "And if it's not making those kinds of mistakes, then that's a good sign."}, {"time": 8830, "text": "And I don't think it's any one very, very simple test."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "I think it's all of the things you mentioned, all the things I mentioned is really a battery of tests, which together, if it passes almost all of these tests, it'd be hard to argue that it's not intelligent."}, {"time": 8845, "text": "And if it fails several of these tests, it's really hard to argue that it really understands what it's doing and that it really is generally intelligent."}, {"time": 8853, "text": "So to pass all of those tests, we've talked a lot about psych and knowledge and reasoning."}, {"time": 8860, "text": "Do you think this AI system would need to have some other human like elements, for example, a body or a physical manifestation in this world?"}, {"time": 8872, "text": "And another one which seems to be fundamental to the human experience is consciousness."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "The subjective experience of what it's like to actually be you."}, {"time": 8884, "text": "Do you think it needs those to be able to pass all of those tests and to achieve general intelligence?"}, {"time": 8890, "text": "I think in the case of a body, no, I know there are a lot of people like Penrose who would have disagreed with me and others, but no, I don't think it needs to have a body in order to be intelligent."}, {"time": 8904, "text": "I think that it needs to be able to talk about having a body and having sensations and having emotions and so on."}, {"time": 8913, "text": "It doesn't actually have to have all of that, but it has to understand it in the same way that Helen Keller was perfectly intelligent and able to talk about colors and sounds and shapes and so on, even though she didn't directly experience all the same things that the rest of us do."}, {"time": 8935, "text": "So knowledge of it and being able to correctly make use of that is certainly an important facility, but actually having a body, if you believe that that's just a kind of religious or mystical belief, you can't really argue for or against it, I suppose."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "It's just something that some people believe."}, {"time": 8959, "text": "What about an extension of the body, which is consciousness?"}, {"time": 8964, "text": "It feels like something to be here."}, {"time": 8968, "text": "But what does that really mean?"}, {"time": 8970, "text": "It's like, well, if I talk to you, you say things which make me believe that you're conscious."}, {"time": 8975, "text": "I know that I'm conscious, but you're just taking my word for it now."}, {"time": 9006, "text": "If we want to call that consciousness, then yes, psych is already conscious."}, {"time": 9011, "text": "But I don't think that I would ascribe anything mystical to that."}, {"time": 9015, "text": "Again, some people would, but I would say that other than our own personal experience of consciousness, we're just treating everyone else in the world, so to speak, at their word about being conscious."}, {"time": 9029, "text": "And so if a computer program, if an AI is able to exhibit all the same kinds of response as you would expect of a conscious entity, then doesn't it deserve the label of consciousness just as much?"}, {"time": 9047, "text": "So there's another burden that comes with this whole intelligence thing that humans got is the extinguishing of the light of consciousness, which is kind of realizing that we're going to be dead someday."}, {"time": 9062, "text": "And there's a bunch of philosophers like Ernest Becker, who kind of think that this realization of mortality, and then fear, sometimes they call it terror of mortality, is one of the creative forces behind human condition, like, it's the thing that drives us."}, {"time": 9084, "text": "Do you think it's important for an AI system?"}, {"time": 9087, "text": "You know, when Psych proposed that it's not human, and it's one of the moderators of his contents, you know, there's another question it could ask, which is like, it kind of knows that humans are mortal, am I mortal?"}, {"time": 9107, "text": "And I think one really important thing that's possible when you're conscious is to fear the extinguishing of that consciousness, the fear of mortality."}, {"time": 9119, "text": "Do you think that's useful for intelligence, thinking like, I might die, and I really don't want to die?"}, {"time": 9126, "text": "I think it may help some humans to be better people."}, {"time": 9132, "text": "It may help some humans to be more creative, and so on."}, {"time": 9136, "text": "I don't think it's necessary for AIs to believe that they have limited lifespans, and therefore they should make the most of their behavior."}, {"time": 9146, "text": "Maybe eventually the answer to that and my answer to that will change, but as of now I would say that that's almost like a frill or a side effect that is not, in fact, if you look at most humans, most humans ignore the fact that they're going to die most of the time."}, {"time": 9163, "text": "Well, but that's like, this goes to the white space between the words."}, {"time": 9169, "text": "So what Ernest Becker argues is that that ignoring is we're living in an illusion that we constructed on the foundation of this terror."}, {"time": 9177, "text": "So we're escape life as we know it, pursuing things, creating things, love, everything we can think of that's beautiful about humanity is just trying to escape this realization that we're going to die one day."}, {"time": 9193, "text":

clearly it infiltrates all of Russian literature."}, {"time": 9224, "text": "And AI doesn't have to have fear of death as a motivating force in that we can build in motivation."}, {"time": 9235,

leads to bursts of creativity in humans."}, {"time": 9258, "text": "I think AI really needs to understand death deeply in order to be able to drive a car, for example."}, {"time": 9264, "text": "I think there's just some, like, there... No, I really disagree."}, {"time": 9270, "text": "I think it needs to understand the value of human life, especially the value of human life to other humans, and understand that certain things are more important than other things."}, {"time": 9282, "text": "So it has to have a lot of knowledge about ethics and morality and so on."}, {"time": 9288, "text": "But some of it is so messy that it's impossible to encode."}, {"time": 9291, "text": "For example, there's..."}, {"time": 9293, "text": "So if there's a person dying right in front of us, most human beings would help that person, but they would not apply that same ethics to everybody else in the world."}, {"time": 9304, "text": "This is the tragedy of how difficult it is to be a doctor, because they know when they help a dying child, they know that the money they're spending on this child cannot possibly be spent on every other child that's dying."}, {"time": 9318, "text": "And that's a very difficult to encode decision."}, {"time": 9324, "text": "Perhaps it is...

of death is just one of the quirks of like the way our brains have evolved, but it's not a necessary feature of intelligence."}, {"time": 9462, "text": "Others certainly are always doing this kind of estimate, even if it's unconscious, subconscious, of what are the chances of various bad outcomes happening?"}, {"time": 9472, "text": "Like for instance, if I don't wait for this pedestrian or

to him, which only comes with extreme preparation, I think."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "His level of dedication was extremely inspiring to me."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "I used to do a job where it was serious enough that the price could be death."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "And I arm wrestled throughout that entire period."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "And I always kind of looked at the cost of doing an activity, being death, limited to soldiering."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And I kind of changed my mind a lot after that match."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "I realized that anything that you're in love with, once you get far enough down the road, and professional enough at it, it's going to kill you."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "Doesn't matter what you're doing, if you're crazy enough about

{"time": 2510, "text": "I was now in the world of professional arm wrestling."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "And I realized that what was I doing?"}, {"time": 2518, "text": "How serious was I?"}, {"time": 2520, "text": "So Dennis is an incredible guy."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "Is there moments in that match, there's humility there, too, from him."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "That was a fascinating sort of, it seemed like you realized that you just hit a wall and you were not ready enough for it."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "There was so many things that I remember about the Dennis match."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "I mean, I remember seeing videos of somebody and then meeting them in person, it's different."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "I remember in the weigh ins, sorry, not the weigh ins, the standoff that we did before the match."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "I'm looking at him, I'm close."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "I'm looking at his arms."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "And his bicep, it looked like an ass."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "It was like a freaking glute muscle."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "Like his entire structure was so sinewy and just so strong."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "I was like, wow, he's physically so impressive."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "And I remember when I arm wrestled him at a certain time, he allowed me to kind of set my position."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "You can't really tell because it happens very quickly."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "But he let me set my position, which means I kind of got my locks in, where you can kind of really do a great hold."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "And he just ripped through me."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "So you were able to get this great position."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "So it was tore right through me."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "And the first time I ever thought that I had torn something."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "I thought, after the match, I'm like, geez, did he rip my chest right in half?"}, {"time": 2618, "text": "What, did it?"}, {"time": 2620, "text": "No, I think it was 100%."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "Yeah, no, I didn't actually."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "Nothing went purple or anything."},

would take me just being a little bit stronger and more healthy, yeah."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "My left was not as healthy as it should be."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "I didn't have a full rounded

years before you're starting to hit technical proficiency the way you should be."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "And yeah, just a bit stronger."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "How do you interpret the calmness on his face?"}, {"time": 2673, "text": "Well, what is that about?"}, {"time": 2675, "text": "Is he actually that calm or is he just trained?"}, {"time": 2677, "text": "It's a Russian thing, I think."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "I see a lot of Russians like that."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "They're so stoic."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "And I'm such a fan of Russia."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "I

you have to manage all of that, because ultimately, you have to focus on the fight ahead."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "Yeah, a lot of my strength comes from just being in a familiar place, doing my routine."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "I love to travel."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "I love to get out there and meet people and new experiences."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "But when I just want to really prepare for a big match, yeah, home is where I get strong."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "So that loss against Dennis was one of the few losses in your career."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "How did that feel in the moments after, in the days after, in the months after, in the years after?"}, {"time": 2808, "text": "How has it changed you as an arm wrestler as a human being?"}, {"time": 2813, "text": "Well, it's tough to lose."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "Still haunt you?"}, {"time": 2822, "text": "I actually was really happy to lose to Dennis, because sometimes when you lose a match, there's a lot of matches that I've lost where they upset me, because I know I made a mistake."}, {"time": 2833, "text": "I didn't make a mistake with Dennis."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "He was just way better."},

handed."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "So knowing that's possible is almost like inspiration to you that I can be at that level, too."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "Seeing what Dennis did, just trying to absorb a little bit of his knowledge planted seeds in me."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "When I look at my career, it's a bit like the stock market."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "But for sure, I'm trending upwards."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And since really kind of wrapping my mind around some of the Russian philosophies, they really changed my training systems."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "There were some base philosophies that they talked to me about over there that massively impacted my training."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "Is it possible to convert some of those philosophies into words?"},

these guys."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "Well, once you do, that's the deepest bonds you can form."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "I think that I was raised under, I believe it's a flawed."}, {"time": 2926,

thing that's just so ingrained in our fitness society is no pain, no gain."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "And just pushing, and sweating, and going harder, and fighting through, and grit, and tough."},

2961, "text": "Always feel good."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "It should always feel good."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "And those two philosophies express themselves very differently."}, {"time": 2971,

massive principle."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "And volume is very hard to achieve when you're believing in no pain, no gain."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "They don't really go together."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "No pain, no gain, more injuries."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "So is there parallels?"}, {"time": 3000, "text": "Because in wrestling, some of the greatest wrestlers of all time are Russian."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "And they were big, Dan Gable talks about it, they were big on play."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "Like, lighter wrestling is probably, ultimately, actually, it boils down to that's how you achieve higher volume."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "Like, over the stretch of years, the way to reduce injury."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "I mean, in wrestling also, technique might have greater value than it does in arm wrestling."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "Obviously, technique is extremely important in arm wrestling."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "But power can defeat technique, it seems like."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "In wrestling, you can get away."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "There's a lot of ways you can really do sneak attacks, sort of use leverage on those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "So there's even more incentive to do play and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "But do you see the parallels between the two worlds, wrestling and arm wrestling?"}, {"time": 3059, "text": "Well, you saw what I did the other night, right?"}, {"time": 3061, "text": "So I'm playing on the table for hours, right?"}, {"time": 3064, "text": "So that's my number one training thing that I do, is I go on the table for hours and I play."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "Yeah, when you did, Sergey, can you pull up that video?"}, {"time": 3076, "text": "It's on Devin's channel, the water tank one."}, {"time": 3080, "text": "Oh, it's like 180p."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "It's like, the wifi in there was so bad."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "It's great, I love it."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "It's, maybe, I don't know if it was fish eye, but it had a fish eye feel, it was crowded."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "I mean, so much camaraderie, it was amazing."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "But maybe just a brief mention of Dimitri, the Russian guy."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "What, in that play, what are some memorable things here?"}, {"time": 3108, "text": "Like, when you go against a bunch of different people, a bunch of strangers, what are all the differences and how do you grow from them, how do you learn from them?"}, {"time": 3116, "text": "Well, everybody's a bit different."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "So, I love to go to new clubs, because the energy's always high."}, {"time": 3124, "text": "Like, the first time you go to a club, everybody's trying to kill you."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "Yeah, so they're gonna."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "There's excitement and there's this, and so you feed off of that."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "Yeah, you do, you can, if you're able to be strong enough to absorb it without injury, it's awesome, it's awesome."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "Because they're giving you everything they can."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "Right, so it's very specific, right?"}, {"time": 3146, "text": "Like, I'm gonna get way stronger at arm wrestling."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "And what I try and do, when I go to these places, is I make an assumption, I make an assumption that I'm the best guy there."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "And so, I'll arm wrestle in a way that kind of protects them, because the more I can protect them and kind of keep them kind of in a good position, they can actually give me more, right?"}, {"time": 3169, "text": "So, I kind of give them little pieces that I think will put them in a place that they can really give me more."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "And so, yeah, that's what I'm doing."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "And then, when I see somebody like Dimitri, I pull that in a little bit, right?"}, {"time": 3186, "text": "So, okay, so I know Dimitri's the number one guy in Texas."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "Lots of respect to the guy."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "I won't give him all the pieces until I really kind of gauge where he's at, because I certainly, in training, don't wanna fail."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "I don't want that, I don't want to."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "When you fail in arm wrestling, imagine it's just bad technique."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "And you're trying, and bad technique, you're gonna get hurt, yeah."}, {"time": 3211, "text": "So, you always want to be in a strong position here."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "What about, how does endurance come into play here?"}, {"time": 3217, "text": "And here's video of you strapping up with Dimitri."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "How do you, I mean, you went for like, I don't know, two hours?"}, {"time": 3223, "text": "Yeah, it was long."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "So, this first run of the video, I think, was a little over an hour, and then I took a break, and I probably did another 45 minutes or so, but."}, {"time": 3233, "text": "I mean, do you, how can, are you okay with the endurance aspect of this?"}, {"time": 3238, "text": "Yeah, that's probably, like, when you talk to the arm wrestling world, that's probably what I'm best known for, is my endurance."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "So, this helps build that."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "It does, but that's not why I'm doing it."}, {"time": 3248, "text": "I'm doing it to get strong."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "In my opinion, this is one of the best ways to get strong, especially far away from a tournament, or any kind of an event."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "I wouldn't wanna do this, you know, even a month, or even six weeks, or even, maybe even eight weeks before a big event."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "I'd want to already be kind of shrinking my volume, but far away from an event, yeah, as much volume as your body can handle, and you'll feel it."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "You'll feel it."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "Like, I felt it at times, like, you know, after the hour mark, I'm like, okay, I can feel my blood sugar kind of diminishing."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "I can feel, like, the blood that's going to my muscles is kinda like, it's not really pushing more good stuff in."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "It's, I'm starting to break down, and you don't want that."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "You don't want that."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "Bathroom break?"}, {"time": 3299, "text": "I'm good, I'm good."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "I kinda need one."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "I'll maybe get a sweater, it's a bit."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "Does that matter?"}, {"time": 3306, "text": "Does that care for kind of continuity?"}, {"time": 3308, "text": "I can make it warmer."}, {"time": 3309, "text": "No, no, no, I'll just put a sweater on, it's fine, but that doesn't matter."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "And I still love the idea of you going to Russia."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And training there."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "I'm also making a trip out to Russia."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "Oh yeah, when?"}, {"time": 3319, "text": "For different reasons."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "Well, it's hard with the current conflict, the tensions there, but I'm hoping before your match, actually, so May, for a couple of interviews with a couple of folks, some of which people know."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "Maybe I could ask you about, to comment on some matches that stand out to you in your career."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Is there something, is there a particular, I have a bunch that I really enjoy, but is there something that stands out to you as memorable?"}, {"time": 3354, "text": "We talked about sort of a defining loss, perhaps, to Dennis."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "Then you faced Michael Todd, like you mentioned, John Brzenk, you faced Matt."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "Is there something that stands out to you that technically or psychologically you've learned a lot from?"}, {"time": 3377, "text": "I feel like I try and learn something from every match, but there is a very special match to me that to this day, I can't explain."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "Very weird phenomenon."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "So, I think it was 2005 was my first combat tour overseas."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "So, it was a active tour."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "Among other things, I got shot during that tour, we got blown, long tour, rough tour."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "And I trained the whole time through knowing that at the end of this, I was gonna have a big match."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "So, there's a champion, a guy called Ron Bath."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "He's kind of, if there was no John Brzenk, there would be Ron Bath."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "Okay, so, extremely decorated, unbelievable arm wrestler from the United States."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "And this is kind of when I was just kind of coming up in the sport still."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "I was fairly well established, I was definitely the best guy in Canada."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "And I had been for a few years, but I hadn't really expanded internationally too much."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "So, I had a one on one match with Ron Bath and that's the one."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "Yeah, extremely hard fought battle."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "Was three one, I think, three one, but every match was really close and he won the first one."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And I had to kind of dig my way out of the trenches and ended up coming back and winning."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "But it was a match that was probably, it was probably one of my closest matches ever."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "It seems like there's frustration on you."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "What was going through your mind here with these?"}, {"time": 3486, "text": "Was it, first of all, going in, did you think you could beat him?"}, {"time": 3489, "text": "What was the level of confidence?"}, {"time": 3490, "text": "I always think I can win, like I always do."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "But, you know, a lot of respect to the guy."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "But yeah, I mean, I always think I can do it."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "So how did, what lessons did you take away from it?"}, {"time": 3504, "text": "Why is it so meaningful to you?"}, {"time": 3507, "text": "Well, it's what happened afterwards."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "So, I had some kind of a release afterwards."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "And that was the strange thing to me."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "So, match ended and I felt like, so relaxed afterwards, so calm, so, so, you know, satisfied."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "Because it was one of those matches that kind of takes everything from you, but you win it."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "And I was relaxing in the chair and I've never had this sensation before."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "I've never had it afterwards, but it's like the center of my backbone just exploded."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "And it was like, it's so weird, right?"}, {"time": 3551, "text": "Cause I'm not really spiritual that much or religious even, but it's like a fire just ripped through me and it only lasted an instant."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "Just exploded through my whole body, out the top, through my feet."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "And then it was gone, that was it."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "Weirdest thing I've ever felt in my entire life."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "Yeah, but it was as a result of, yeah, but it was as a result of what happened in the match and leading up to it, I had some kind of a release."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "To what it does, it almost, how did you interpret it psychologically?"}, {"time": 3588, "text": "Was it like some kind of, I mean, not to be spiritual or whatever, but some kind of superpower that was like, like a lingering feeling like, holy shit, I, you know."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "I can't, I can't explain it."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "And I haven't really tried hard enough to try to."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "But something changed."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "Something happened there, yeah."}, {"time": 3612, "text": "Something happened to me."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "I was sore for about three or four months afterwards."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "It's like it smoked out my entire body."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "Yeah, that whole summer I was kind of sore."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And yeah, and then after that, like two or three years later, that's when I won the world championships."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "Yeah, I mean, all the matches are, you know, you get something from people, like, you know, you study them, you take something from them."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "People have an invisible crown and he had one."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "And I think I took it from him."},

of fighting is when humans get a chance to express themselves deeply, like that mix of the bravery, the integrity, the, whatever that is that makes us human, that human spirit can really shine."},

"text": "Close quarter battle is team fighting."}, {"time": 4366, "text": "So, and it can look a lot of different ways, but basically it's ground troops doing something and it's ground troops doing some kind of a mission."}, {"time": 4380, "text": "And it's the orchestrated movement that is the skill."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "The orchestrated movement and the drills done quickly and accurately, it's very difficult to do."}, {"time": 4390, "text": "With communication?"}, {"time": 4391, "text": "With communication."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "Yeah, so it's basically cooperating together, communicating, there's some strategy, there's some adapting to the changing environment."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "And the more the team works together, the less communication there is."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "And that's an amazing thing to do, to be part of a machine, well, machine, a team of people who can fight together like that."}, {"time": 4415, "text": "I think it's, we're really designed to do it."}, {"time": 4419, "text": "Like, as good as we can fight as individuals, the thing that makes us really good is our ability to fight as a team."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "Yeah, that's one of the things that makes us really human is that collective intelligence, that social aspect."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "And fighting is the highest of stakes."}, {"time": 4436,

human."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "It's, I mean, obvious to say that it's tragic that it results in so much loss of life and well being."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "Let me, if it's okay, for a brief moment to take us back to arm wrestling."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "We did this offline, we talked about, you gave me some advice about arm wrestling."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "But maybe do a high level overview of the different styles and strategies that we've talked about."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "We talked about the importance of strength and power."}, {"time": 4486, "text": "But is there offensive, defensive styles?"}, {"time": 4489, "text": "Is there, we mentioned King's move."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "What would you classify your style as?"}, {"time": 4495, "text": "It's nice for people that don't know."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "Maybe even zoom back out."}, {"time": 4499, "text": "So arm wrestling is a sport where two people have to, when we talk about strictly the sport, put their elbow on a particular pad, means they have to keep that elbow on that pad."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "And they win when the back of one of their hands crosses some kind of, or basically touches the table."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "And when you actually lock up, you do so, depending on the organization, without straps, meaning there's just you, agree, it's like mutual agreement that you're going to clasp your hands in a way that's fair and there's a referee that helps ensure that it's fair."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "But of course there's these little games going on."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "And then when you actually go all out with this battle, if there's no straps, you can slip out."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "So often you'll put the straps, which means you're, it's like marriage, you're committed for, like somebody will have to lose essentially."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "There's no pulling out."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "So that's sort of the battle within that."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "What are the different styles that you can speak to that people that don't know arm wrestling could understand?"}, {"time": 4577, "text": "Yeah, we can start to kind of just dance around the subject a bit."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "I'd say there's a lot of different types."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "There's specialists and there's kind of blenders and people who are very versatile."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "A lot of guys win world championships on one singular move."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "They get just extremely crisp at say a hook or a top roll."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "And their style is very kind of focused."}, {"time": 4606, "text": "And you'll see it with a lot of athletes, like kind of a talk about guy who's very active, a guy called Jerry Cataret."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "As soon as you think Jerry Cataret, he's got a very unique style."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "He's got a flop wrist press."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "So most of his technique is built around this one system."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "Flop wrist means what it sounds like."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "Your wrist is flopped, so it looks like you're losing."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "So he is pushing from a losing position."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "No, he will be offensive."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "So he will be in a press, so offensively, so he'll give his hand away so that he can get his shoulder behind it properly."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "So he doesn't, wow."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "So you can press, press means push."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "Push, yeah, without having that hook position."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "Which is what most people are always looking for."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "And Jerry's looking for it as well."}, {"time": 4661, "text": "And then, so example, there's another one."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "There's another specialist, Matt Mask."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "He's a top roller, right?"}, {"time": 4668, "text": "Basically, that's his great move is a top roll."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "And his other weapons aren't nearly as powerful."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "Just incredible top roll."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "And then you have a lot of athletes that are more blended."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "They have a lot of good options."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "I think that I probably fall more into that category."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "You have people who are more speed guys, okay?"}, {"time": 4690, "text": "So they try and do very little, I call it attrition, right?"}, {"time": 4697, "text": "So a lot of people are very willing to trade energy, right?"}, {"time": 4701, "text": "Because they have faith that their gas tank or their pool eventually will tire the other person out."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "So anytime there's a trade, they'll trade."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "Whereas a guy like Travis Bajan, he was very, very well known as being extremely explosive, right?"}, {"time": 4718, "text": "But if the match stops, typically he's gonna lose."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "All right, so based off of your genetics, your hands, there's a lot of ways to skin it."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "So I think you said something like you're a 22nd guy."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "That's right, I'm a 22nd guy."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "So what are the seconds we're talking about?"}, {"time": 4743, "text": "So a lot of the power people, they want to win in the first maybe five seconds, like just that first push, that first press."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "Absolutely, right to the pad, yeah."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "And so you're trying to hold off that attack."}, {"time": 4757, "text": "Yeah, if I beat you in a second, we're not in the same world, yeah."}, {"time": 4761, "text": "But when I'm with my peer group, I will typically win 20 seconds and beyond."}, {"time": 4768, "text": "That's a typical win for me when I'm with a peer."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "Whereas other guys, when they're with their peers, they'll win in a second, right?"}, {"time": 4777, "text": "That's how they do it, that's the way they're built, that's the way they train."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "Yeah, most guys at a higher level at all starts to kind of, it starts to get more and more difficult to be a specialist at the high level now."}, {"time": 4791, "text": "Some people just have little holes in their games."}, {"time": 4796, "text": "It's rare to get someone who can really do all the moves."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "Where would you put Levan?"}, {"time": 4806, "text": "I would not say he's a specialist."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "I'd say his top roll is his strongest move."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "Top roll?"}, {"time": 4812, "text": "Top roll is his strongest move, yeah."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "And the interesting thing about the specialist versus the blender, there's a counter, right?"}, {"time": 4823, "text": "Every move has a move that theoretically should be the right choice."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "So if you're a single move guy, there's gonna be a guy out there who'll get you."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "Yeah, it'll be very difficult for you to beat that guy."}, {"time": 4839, "text": "But when you come to a tournament, typically specialists do much better in tournament scenarios because their singular move can get them through a tournament very quickly and efficiently."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "Whereas you get a blender in a tournament, they typically will have longer and more difficult matches."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "And by, oh, right, yeah."}, {"time": 4860, "text": "But in supermatch format, typically blenders do better."}, {"time": 4866, "text": "So we offline also talked about arm sumo or freedom arm wrestling."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "I don't know how you wanna call it."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "Oh, I love freedom."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "Well, exactly, North American way."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "So this is this idea, and I watched a few videos, and it looks fun, is basically removing the restriction of having to keep your elbow on the pad and just being able to arm wrestle over the whole table."}, {"time": 4895, "text": "I think you've mentioned that the criticism that gets is it might be injury prone or something like that."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "So can you describe this arm sumo, freedom arm wrestling idea?"}, {"time": 4905, "text": "When you come to freedom arm wrestling, basically it removes the limitation of a standard arm wrestling table."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "So basically every single thing is a freedom arm wrestling table."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "Some are better than others."}, {"time": 4917, "text": "So looking for that nice table where we can kind of stand apart from each other and we're anatomically in a fairly safe position."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "And the rules in freedom, the way you win, is the knuckles must either touch the tabletop or you hold it off the edge for a three count."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "So this is the main way to win."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "Yes, you can foul, like if you lift your elbow up, it's still a foul, but you have the entire playing surface."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "So your elbow's no longer limited to your seven by seven or seven by nine pad, so you can move it all over the table."}, {"time": 4950, "text": "You can move your body around the table a bit too."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "And if it's a big table, your body could largely be on the table."}, {"time": 4958, "text": "Yeah, so basically it's like adjusting your ring size."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "So arm wrestling, you're fighting in a phone booth, right?"}, {"time": 4964, "text":

"Just, I mean, it's just like, you know, you know exactly what you need, the prescription is kind of, a band is kind of like, and a lot of people, myself included, I like to know exactly my outputs,

right?"}, {"time": 5339, "text": "If you have a super sharp ax, you could have a shitty handle."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "Yeah, so focus on that, the tip of the ax."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "Yeah, the tip of the ax is so important, right?"}, {"time": 5351, "text": "Like if I have an awesome bicep and I can't quite use it, what's it good for, right?"}, {"time": 5356, "text": "Yeah, I think a lot of the motions with the wrist that you mentioned are, just thinking about jiu jitsu, especially in the gi, there's a lot of, I mean, there's so much importance to this, and people don't often work it explicitly."}, {"time": 5372, "text": "So many of the chokes require ability to, it's almost like exactly like arm wrestling."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "Very close."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "Because you're weak here, what's that called, flop wrist, and you're strong with the cup, yeah."}, {"time": 5385, "text": "And so just getting the, whatever that's involved, the muscle, the turning, the pressure, because that's where also the choke comes."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "That little, the thing that makes you win in arm wrestling is also the thing that finishes the person when you have them grabbed."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "The strength is very similar."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "Yeah, it's fascinating, actually."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "Of course, like you said, if you wanna be very good, you should be doing the very specific exact motion."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "Yeah, so if I was gonna do jiu jitsu, I'd be like working out with the gi."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "Yeah, the problem is, you know, it's difficult to construct the exact, so you have to actually go with people, and then they don't like being choked on, right?"}, {"time": 5428, "text": "So like it's hard to, I'm actually a big, we have these kinds of debates all the time, is, you know, I'm a big believer in drilling."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "I love doing something thousands of times."}, {"time": 5440,

volume."}, {"time": 5482, "text": "You can play a lot."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "Well, that's the, if you really wanna get it good is you're talking about, I mean, that's why a lot of these folks are training three times a day."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "They're doing, you know, they're putting in the hours, eight hours, nine hours, just."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "Well, that's tough, oh my God."}, {"time": 5501, "text": "Well, so there are a lot of them are not going hard."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "It's just being on the mat."}, {"time": 5505, "text": "Some of it is just sitting there talking through ideas, watching others or teaching, explaining stuff."}, {"time": 5510, "text": "It's just, it's like, it's not just physical."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "It's mental too, because you're keeping in your mind."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "And some of the greatest, they talk about the wrestlers I've talked with, the fighters, at the top of their career, they basically, George St.

believe that, I mean, just to be very basic, I mean, if you're eating enough food, you're probably gonna be okay."}, {"time": 5632, "text": "So it's just calories."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "I mean,

don't think it's as important as a lot of other people do."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "I'm certainly irresponsible in a lot, but the thing is, back to like, volume, right?"}, {"time": 5657, "text":

5713, "text": "So it's interesting that that journey of just exploring can take you to figure out something about your own self."}, {"time": 5722, "text": "One of the most interesting things that I heard about nutrition was, I heard there was a."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "Actually, Doritos, I forgot about that."}, {"time": 5731, "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm an idiot."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "Now, I'd say over the last couple of years, I've really gone into carbs a lot and high glycemic carbs."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "And just to, I feel like it's one of the best things you can do if you're working out really hard."}, {"time": 5745, "text": "Just add carbs, yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 5748, "text": "But, oh, where was I?"}, {"time": 5755, "text": "So you've added, syrup is so delicious it's distracting."}, {"time": 5759, "text": "No, so you've added the high glycemic carbs into the mix."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "So those help, but that's for mass building."}, {"time": 5766, "text": "Right, so there was a study that I heard about by somebody who was trying to identify heart attacks."}, {"time": 5772, "text": "They did this great big study."}, {"time": 5774, "text": "And at the end of it, I mean, didn't matter what the people ate, the most important thing was how they felt about the food that they were eating."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "Yeah, so if you believe in the food, if you believe that it's gonna do good things for you, if you allocate it the right way, it's gonna have a positive impact."}, {"time": 5795, "text": "And I try and do that no matter what it is."}, {"time": 5797, "text": "Like I have my foods that I think do certain things."}, {"time": 5800, "text": "And so, you know, for me, I know that, actually, I mean, I learned about corn fed pumps when I was overseas."}, {"time": 5810, "text": "I realized that I never used to eat crap, really didn't."}, {"time": 5815, "text": "I ate super clean all the time."}, {"time": 5818, "text": "And when I was faced with imminent death more, I would be like, okay, I'm going out tonight, let's have a couple ice cream bars."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "You know, like whatever."}, {"time": 5832, "text":

"text": "And there's something about that that will give you incredible blood flow, yeah."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "And also your mind plugging in, enjoying that."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "And then believing it works, and that's how it makes it work better."}, {"time": 5879, "text": "I mean, I feel that way."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "I think this is really not, this has been frustrating to me about the health culture in the United States in the studies that are done."}, {"time": 5889, "text": "You know, you look at like the importance of sleep, the importance of X diet, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5896, "text": "I wish incorporated into that would be your mental relationship with all of these things."}, {"time": 5902, "text": "So for example, people that tell me, well, your sleep schedule is insane."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "Yes, perhaps."}, {"time": 5908, "text": "But also, it's insane because I'm doing what I love and I don't see it as a problem."}, {"time": 5915,

kind of source of happiness and pleasure and satisfaction, like being awake when others aren't."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "It's like the Mike Tyson thing or something, like training when you've convinced yourself everybody's sleeping and therefore you're somehow training much better."}, {"time": 5944, "text": "That's powerful even if you look statistically six hours may be worse than eight

so much food, it's tough."}, {"time": 5974, "text": "But I'd say the food that I rely on a lot when I'm getting ready to compete is sushi."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "Just because it normally comes in an all you can eat format, you know."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "So I love to go and just binge all you can eat buffets."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "Sushi is just super convenient."}, {"time": 5993,

person in the world."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "What was it like, I know sort of you guys maybe weren't going 1,000%, but what's it like?"}, {"time": 6028, "text": "Well he probably wasn't going 1,000%."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "But like what, it's interesting to think what does that strength feel like?"}, {"time": 6036, "text": "So it's a specialized strength in another sport."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "What, how strong was he, what are some kind of deep insights you've drawn from that battle?"}, {"time": 6050, "text": "I feel like if we were to go back 1,000 years and if you give him armor and a two handed sword he will just rip across the landscape."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "And no one will stop him."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "So this is the boxing match you came to, but there's

like Eddie Hall too."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "And I was just so, I'm just so caught up with the drama."}, {"time": 6098, "text": "Okay, so Eddie Hall and Hap Thor Bjornsson, two of the strongest

of back and forth."}, {"time": 6142, "text": "And basically from what I understand, they were gonna fight the knight of the World's Strongest Man."}, {"time": 6147, "text": "And they kind of got pulled apart and this heat between them got translated into a potential boxing match."}, {"time": 6155, "text": "So it's very real."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "It's a very real fight."}, {"time": 6158,

you mean as well?"}, {"time": 6186, "text": "I see Hap Thor as a bit more regimented, but I see Eddie Hall as like way more barbaric and like, I think he's a little bit more athletic, but Hap Thor is

I'll do it."}, {"time": 6250, "text": "I'm sure they got a thousand people who wanted to do it."}, {"time": 6253, "text": "But I'm like, listen, I'm an old man."}, {"time": 6256, "text": "Like I'm gimped up like everywhere outside the arm wrestling lanes."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "I said, but I will 100%."}, {"time": 6263, "text": "Like if you let me fight them, I'll give it my all."},

weeks before the event, and they're like, hey, Devin, were you serious?"}, {"time": 6279, "text": "And I'm like, oh, shit."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "And I'm like, yes, I was serious."}, {"time":

it."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "So they got back to me on Sunday, like, so right away I'm like skipping rope."}, {"time": 6303, "text": "And I'm like, and I'm so, I only arm wrestle legs."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "That's all I do."}, {"time": 6307, "text": "So what was your, you did some striking training."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "Yeah, so I went to this guy that he was awesome, Zach, Ben

called him on like Monday at two oclock by like seven oclock."}, {"time": 6353, "text": "I had my things packed and I went to Montreal and I spent four weeks in the fighter dorms."}, {"time": 6360,

I knew what I was getting into."}, {"time": 6388, "text": "Like I knew it was, I knew it was gonna be a losing battle, but I felt like the opportunity to fight Thor, like how cool is that?"}, {"time": 6397, "text": "Like I had to say, I had to do it."}, {"time": 6400, "text": "I loved the process and I learned a lot from doing it."}, {"time": 6406, "text": "Like the dorms, I wanna do something like that with arm wrestling."}, {"time": 6410, "text": "I think we're big enough now that we can have these kind of, you know, dorms, frat houses, whatever you wanna call it."}, {"time": 6416, "text":

"Administration."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "Yeah, exactly, that's it."}, {"time": 6426, "text": "So it removes all of that."}, {"time": 6427, "text": "Makes it so simple."}, {"time": 6428, "text": "You can just focus."}, {"time": 6429, "text": "You know, the gym is here, you live here."}, {"time": 6432, "text": "You know, that your life becomes simple."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "So there's a guy named Jimmy Pedro here in America."}, {"time": 6438, "text": "He's a famous coach, has a place up in Boston."}, {"time": 6441, "text": "He has kind of a dorm like that too."}, {"time": 6444,

in these kind of minimalist conditions where they just focus on the training, focus, focus, focus."}, {"time": 6462, "text": "Yeah, it wasn't enough time."}, {"time": 6463, "text": "I mean, I trained for about three or four weeks, but I loved the journey and... Well, what are some of the fun things you enjoy?"}, {"time": 6472, "text": "So you did mostly striking, did you?"}, {"time": 6474, "text": "Yeah, I guess it was... Yeah, it was boxing."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "It was straight up boxing."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "Boxing, yeah."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "What are some things that were transferable?"}, {"time": 6479, "text": "What are some cool things you learned from that?"}, {"time": 6482, "text": "So from the world of armwrestling, have you taken anything back?"}, {"time": 6485, "text": "Like some training regimens, ideas about training, even movements?"}, {"time": 6492, "text": "Because for us it's a unique mind as well for training."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "I mean, I've gone very far down the path of armwrestling."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "Boxing and armwrestling are very different."}, {"time": 6507, "text": "They're very different sports."}, {"time": 6510, "text": "The physicality required is very different."}, {"time": 6516, "text": "The mentality, I mean, it's fighting."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "So it's another form of fighting, which is cool."}, {"time": 6521, "text": "The big things that I took back from it, the things that I loved about it was I had to run again."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "So really work on endurance."}, {"time": 6532, "text": "Yeah, I was going for runs with guys in the dorms and they would just destroy me."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "Just like it was so bad."}, {"time": 6544, "text": "How did you feel in the actual boxing in terms of endurance?"}, {"time": 6548, "text": "Were you able to?"}, {"time": 6551, "text": "It's just torture."}, {"time": 6554, "text": "And the thing is it was so crazy for me because I really was good once upon a time."}, {"time": 6559, "text": "I really was."}, {"time": 6560, "text": "Like physically, I had incredible full body endurance."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "But being so specialized, I realized how much I had slipped."}, {"time": 6570, "text": "And yeah, it was fun to try and regain it."}, {"time": 6573, "text": "I think it's affected my body composition."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "I think since that training, I've become much more lean."}, {"time": 6579, "text": "I think it was a very healthy thing for me to do."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "Like health wise, I always think that when you're far away from competition, it's really good to kind of spread out."}, {"time": 6588, "text": "Really good."}, {"time": 6589, "text": "So I think that in that way."}, {"time": 6591, "text": "Also for your mind."}, {"time": 6592, "text": "Yeah, just like, yeah."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "Yeah, it's something about clearing your, I think you've talked about this is like you're basically taking steps back before you take steps forward."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "I forget how you call it."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "Yeah, the wave."}, {"time": 6610, "text": "Yeah, under, you know, you have to go under."}, {"time": 6613, "text": "You got to."}, {"time": 6614, "text": "You know, if you want to go above the line, you have to spend some time beneath it."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "And yeah, I was definitely beneath the line for a long time."}, {"time": 6622, "text": "But Mountain, I mean, like the interesting thing was as incredible as he is, you know, like what a monster."}, {"time": 6632, "text": "And I think if you had had him training in boxing, you know, for a long time and like from his youth, I think you, you know, the guy could be world champion, but you know, to be so specialized and then to switch, you're at a disadvantage."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "And also like I know from just fighting guys in the gym in TriStar, some of those guys were way scarier, for real."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "Like as scary as Thor is, like there's guys in that TriStar gym that don't look like anything that would murder me much worse, much worse."}, {"time": 6670, "text": "Yeah, but also, you know, that's the difference between being in the gym and under the lights too."}, {"time": 6675, "text": "I mean, GSB is an example, George St. Pierre is an example, somebody that maybe doesn't look terrifying."}, {"time": 6681, "text": "He's at a TriStar."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "Yep, he trains at TriStar, but he's quite, he's super nice, super humble, but is terrifying when he's fighting."}, {"time": 6692, "text": "He's dominating people."}, {"time": 6693, "text": "You mentioned death and your Canadian special forces and in general, thinking about mortality."}, {"time":

age."}, {"time": 6715, "text": "Are you afraid of it?"}, {"time": 6716, "text": "Yeah, I hate it."}, {"time": 6718, "text": "Yeah, I don't wanna die."}, {"time": 6719, "text": "Yeah, definitely don't wanna die."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "But there's times when I can rid myself of it, yeah."}, {"time": 6726, "text": "But for sure, I mean, I'm not happy that death is inevitable and I'm not happy that potentially it's inevitable for all of us, but it does, I like to fight against it."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "Does it, if you could be immortal, would you choose to?"}, {"time": 6748, "text": "That's my only wish."}, {"time": 6750, "text": "Oh, see, but here's the thing."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "That's, but the point is to have that wish."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "It's like the all you can eat buffet at sushi."}, {"time": 6760, "text": "It's, that sushi's more delicious if you have a limit."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "Do you have a, oh."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "I mean, I don't think I get sick of stuff."}, {"time": 6769, "text": "I'm very simple."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "Yeah, I don't think I would get tired of it."}, {"time": 6774, "text": "I mean, if someone would pose it to you, do you wanna live forever?"}, {"time": 6777, "text": "You would choose no?"}, {"time": 6779, "text": "Yeah, I would choose no."}, {"time": 6780, "text": "Choose no."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "Well, my answer's probably yes."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "Like, no, I would, it's more like the snooze button."}, {"time": 6788, "text": "Do you wanna, do you, do you want?"}, {"time": 6791, "text": "Well, you could go to sleep."}, {"time": 6793, "text": "But it's very difficult in the moment to go to sleep, but if I'm allowed to live forever, I'm going to delay all the crazy, like all the ambitious goals, all the, because, oh, there's always time."}, {"time": 6811, "text": "That's fine, but there is tomorrow, then."}, {"time": 6813, "text": "But there is tomorrow, but see, I think that takes away from the richness of, like, the richness of the lived experience of just each moment."}, {"time": 6822, "text": "I think the richness of each moment comes from saying, like, I could die tonight."}, {"time": 6828, "text": "Like, that, it tastes delicious because you're gonna die."}, {"time": 6831, "text": "I'm afraid if you're not, I'm afraid all of that goes away, all of that magic goes away if you can live forever."}, {"time": 6841, "text": "But I'll tell you, every time I have a near death experience or think I'm gonna die, I definitely live better afterwards, yeah."}, {"time": 6849, "text": "Like, it's always been that way."}, {"time": 6851, "text": "But yeah, no."}, {"time": 6854, "text": "That's why the Stoics, you know, they really preach contemplating your mortality often."}, {"time": 6859, "text": "It kind of reminds you."}, {"time": 6861, "text": "This whole thing could just end any moment and it makes you really appreciate."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "Certainly improving the quality of life is important."}, {"time": 6874, "text": "But part of me thinks that immortality is not as fun as we would like to imagine."}, {"time": 6883, "text": "Do you think that maybe you're, in what you're building potentially is immortal?"}, {"time": 6890, "text": "Well, that's what I definitely think about with robots."}, {"time": 6896, "text": "If they were to have a humanlike experience and be able to interact with humans in a deep, meaningful way, I think they too have to be mortal in some fundamental way that means mortal."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "Like, their ride has to end as well."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "Because they won't be able to interact with humans deeply unless that's the case."}, {"time": 6918, "text": "Like, to have fear, to have love, the ability to suffer, the ability to miss somebody, I think scarcity is important."}, {"time": 6932, "text": "You have to be able to truly lose somebody."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "You have to be, to fear things, you have to truly have the risk of destroying yourself."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "And to have a sense of what it means to be a self, you have to be able to lose it."},

a negative perspective on it."}, {"time": 6963, "text": "And then mortality?"}, {"time": 6964, "text": "Yeah, just think, well, now you just, you can get all those things done that you want to do."}, {"time": 6968, "text": "I hope you're right, I hope you're right."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "Yeah, I mean, potentially, you could invest even harder because you're like, wow, I'm actually going to be able to get all this stuff done."}, {"time": 6977, "text": "I think about this a lot, I hope you're right, but I fear that the drive to create, I can even do more, all of that dissipates, disappears if you have all the time in the world."}, {"time": 6991, "text": "I just know how lazy I am."}, {"time": 6993, "text": "And if I have all the time in the world, I'm just going to sit there and just

fatter."}, {"time": 7010, "text": "I can get in shape later, there's always time."}, {"time": 7013, "text": "That's like a long period of contemplation."}, {"time": 7016, "text": "Yeah, so for the first 1,000 years, it'll be the Dorito period of the Lex life."}, {"time": 7022, "text": "Yeah, you could be like Jabba the Hutt for 1,000 years."}, {"time": 7026, "text": "You mentioned aliens, very important topic."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "Do you actually think about this has been an increased interest, and there's been increased UFO sightings and encounters, all that kind of stuff, the US government at least releasing data, releasing videos of pilots, pilot observations, and from airplanes of UFOs."}, {"time": 7051, "text": "Because you mentioned in the following context, you mentioned like us humans will get our shit together when the aliens eventually come."}, {"time": 7062, "text": "What do you make of all the sightings?"}, {"time": 7065, "text": "I thought about it a lot when I was younger, and I've just, I made my conclusions, and yeah, I don't think that there's a possibility that there aren't aliens."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "I would think that it would be impossible for there not to be aliens."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "I feel like this is pretty good real estate, so you'd probably want it, but we already might be, well, I don't even think might."}, {"time": 7090, "text": "I mean, it's probably quite likely that we are to some degree aliens."}, {"time": 7093, "text": "I mean, all life is probably to some degree alien."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "I like the real estate, so the resources, but we're also kind of interesting."}, {"time": 7101, "text": "Whatever this ant colony of living organisms that we've created, it's kind of interesting to study."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "I tend to believe that the alien civilizations that are going to reach us or have reached us are far more intelligent, just orders of magnitude more intelligent than us, and so it's going to be very difficult both ways, actually, for us to understand them and for them to dumb themselves down enough to understand us."}, {"time": 7128, "text": "So they might even just miss our existence altogether just because I tend to believe, I don't know what you think, that we're not that special in terms of all the life forms in the universe."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "There's a lot of cool stuff out there."}, {"time": 7144, "text": "Has to be, has to be."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "But to us, we're special."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "Yeah, well, that's all that matters, right?"},

like trees on a scale of thousands of years."}, {"time": 7163, "text": "Maybe they're onto something."}, {"time": 7166, "text": "Lex, you know, I think that so much of what makes a person special is what they pass on, your kids."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "But I think that you are quite special because you're part of this thing that's potentially giving birth to the next thing."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "I should say, the funny thing is, while talking to Devon during this podcast, I had a doorbell ring, had to go downstairs, and there was a big box, medicine box with a new legged robot."},

that's the highest compute level in that robot."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "So I've been playing a lot with legged robots, the four legs, so like a dog."}, {"time": 7228, "text": "I like all the robots, but there's something about when a robot has legs, it's able to communicate, it's able to connect with humans in some kind of deep way, in the way a dog can, just show affection."}, {"time":

7252, "text": "It makes me feel noticed and heard in the same way I do when a dog notices me."}, {"time": 7259, "text": "That excitement, that stupid excitement of like, yes, fellow living organism."}, {"time": 7265, "text": "And what excites me about legged robots is that holy shit, it's possible to engineer this."}, {"time": 7273, "text": "It's possible to create that feeling, and I wonder where that can go."}, {"time": 7277, "text": "There's a lot of negative possible trajectories, but I have a sense that there's positive ones too."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "Adding more love to the world."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "You think that they'll take us with them?"}, {"time": 7287, "text": "Yeah, I think so because I, so there's this fear of robots that they become super intelligent and run away from us humans, and basically become so intelligent and then they almost just not giving a damn will destroy us."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "But I think in order for robots to become intelligent, they have to integrate themselves with society."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "So they, by the very nature of how they become intelligent, have to bring us along."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "So it's not that there'll be this separate thing."}, {"time": 7322, "text": "They have to, like, we'll have robots in the home."}, {"time": 7325, "text": "Well, they'll be interacting with us."},

your human to human relationships much more meaningful and richer."}, {"time": 7338, "text": "They bring more love to the world, but it's integrated."}, {"time": 7340, "text": "It's not like they'll be developing smarter and smarter as, like, sentient beings by themselves."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "I think that's very difficult to do."}, {"time": 7352, "text": "You have to be doing that together with humans, and so we'll come for the ride."}, {"time": 7355, "text": "There's technical things, like, we might merge, like, cyborgs more and more."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "Well, we already saw our cyborgs, right?"}, {"time": 7363, "text": "With the phones and so on, but more and more."}, {"time": 7366, "text": "So with Elon and Neuralink, deeper integration of robots and AI into, like, increasing the bandwidth at which they can communicate."}, {"time": 7376, "text": "So if we do implants in the brain, I think, again, a lot of people are really nervous about this, as am I, but I think there's a lot of trajectories that are positive there."}, {"time": 7390, "text": "That, to me, is exciting, and also, I just don't think it's possible to stop this development, so we should

pandemic."}, {"time": 947, "text": "And we started doing some FaceTime together and just talking about things related to science and health."}, {"time": 952, "text": "And I'm not a musician, I have no musical ability or talent."}, {"time": 956, "text": "I have a good ability to memorize lyrics and I love lyrics and I love poetry."}, {"time": 960, "text": "So I asked him a lot of questions about musicians that I happen to love that he's worked with and knows."}, {"time": 965, "text": "And so he would give me stories about musicians and I would talk to him about health."}, {"time": 970, "text": "And then eventually we formed a friendship where we would talk about any number of different topics in life."}, {"time": 975, "text": "And then we started spending time together in person when he was in town or nearby."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And as you now know, you know, Rick, in addition to all his incredible accomplishments, has an incredible understanding of how to get the brain and body into state, right?"}, {"time": 996, "text": "And as you pointed out, he's willing to do the things that allow him to help these incredible artists get into the best state to do their craft."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "And so if he needs to sit there and be quiet with his eyes closed for a minute or two or more, he'll do that."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "He has routines to allow himself to get into state."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "And it's really inspired me to think about states of mind as something that, you know, we'd all love to just flip the switch and say, we're focused or we're creative, but to actually ratchet through the challenging steps in order to do that and to figure out what one needs to do on a regular basis to get into a proper state."}, {"time":

really teaching oneself how to get into proper state."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Yeah, you did an episode on hypnosis."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "Do you think it's a kind of self hypnosis?"}, {"time": 1053, "text": "Because hypnosis is a, you limit the context, you're very alert and you're very calm."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "And he has a number of these different practices."}, {"time": 1064,

to a friend of mine who's a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist and they've become friendly."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "You know, Rick is one of these people that he sort of defies definition, incredibly kind, incredibly private person too."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "So, you know, I'm being respectful of that."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "But, and then of course he's a fan of your podcast."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "And so when I learned that, I just made natural sense to introduce you."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "And I know he really enjoyed meeting you."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "And we talk about you a lot."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And of course, in a positive light, you know, I think his dedication to getting into these states of mind and his willingness to do that has completely transformed my routines around life."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "Like for instance, before doing a very long podcast recording, the solo ones, which often take me several hours or more, six hours to record, sometimes more, sometimes less."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "I realized that there's a certain brain state associated with that."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "So I have to really limit the kind of

yet."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "But, you know, getting into state of mind is something that we'd all just imagine we flip the switch, but Rick really convinced me, you have to do the work to do the work."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "Can you maybe linger on that, elucidate a little bit more of your process of how you get in that space?"}, {"time": 1154, "text": "Cause I have to admit, I do everything last minute before a podcast."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Like there's a lot of anxiety because like whatever, if I have to pack, if I have to set up stuff, you were luckily a few minutes, you showed up a few minutes later."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Which for an academic is right on time."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Right on time."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "But the stress is immense."},

a very Rick Rubin kind of thing, right?"}, {"time": 1199, "text": "That the details really matter."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "The details really matter, right down to your relationship to the microphone, right?"}, {"time": 1207, "text": "Distance and whether or not it brings out the timbre in your voice."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "But of course that's what he does."}, {"time": 1211,

to say, and this has actually come up in some of our conversations about you."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "I mean, you are, you are an artist."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "And actually Joe Rogan, once I heard him talking about podcasting and the fact that he's always trying to get better at it, you know, and he described podcasting at one moment as an art, right?"}, {"time": 1252, "text": "And it is, it's a certain medium of communication and there's a cadence and a rhythm that when it's working, it really can facilitate the transfer of information."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "When it's not, it doesn't."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "I mean, obviously Joe just being himself has tapped into that cadence that allows and it's made so many people excited to hear him talk."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "Well, in his case and in general, I think part of the art is refusing the world as you get a bigger audience, change who you are."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "There's one quote that I've seen out there where he says, you know, I'm like the, talking about himself, he says, you know, I'm like the fish that got through the net."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "There's no stage version of me, right?"},

different relationships, of course, but it's true."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "I mean, we've had the, you know, the great fortune of spending time with him out away from the microphones, so to speak."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "Joe is Joe."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "So can you speak to your, that process you mentioned, the walking and the talking to yourself?"}, {"time": 1312, "text": "Cause that's fascinating."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Yeah, I try and do a couple of things."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "First of all, when I was a kid, I had a little bit of a grunting tick."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "When I was five or six, I would feel this buildup of tension in my throat and I would do this grunting tick."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "If I get very tired, I start to do it still."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "We actually know that this is related to these basal ganglia circuits for go, no go."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "You've got an accelerator and a brake basically in your neural circuitry and kids with Tourette's and OCD, the brake doesn't work quite as well."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "And so one thing that happens is if I wake up in the morning and especially if I'm well rested, well, if I'm not well rested, I do a hypnosis or yoga nidra in order to recover my sleep."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "But then once I'm into the process of preparing the podcast, I've already gone through my notes."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "I know what I want to say more or less in a kind of general contour."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "And then I take a walk and I try to, so no phone with me."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "And I try to assess whether or not my energy is too high or too low for podcasting."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "Because when you podcast, as you know, you have to punch out a lot of material, but then there's times when you really need to slow down and emphasize and articulate."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And so what I do, I've never revealed this."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "What I do actually is I will recite the lyrics of songs for about 10 minutes, songs I love while I walk out loud."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "It calms you and focuses you, what does it do for you?"}, {"time": 1394, "text": "I think it gets my vocal cords warmed up and it also."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "Do you sing or speak them?"}, {"time": 1401, "text": "I often sing them and fortunately nobody hears."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "And as I do this, I start to evaluate whether or not I'm straining to get the words out or whether or not I'm straining to make them slow enough so that I can articulate them."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "So there are days when I have so much energy that I'm trying to speak faster than I should in order to articulate properly."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "There are other days when I'm tired and I can't sort of keep up with my thoughts."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And so what I try and do is assess that and then adjust the transmission, the RPM, so to speak."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "For instance, I can speak very quickly and then I can slow down."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "So I can change the cadence of my voice."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And when you teach in the classroom, you learn as you know, cause you're an excellent teacher, I've watched your lectures in the classroom."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "As you teach in the classroom, when you want to slow down, every teacher knows you turn to the whiteboard or chalkboard and you start writing, right?"}, {"time": 1453, "text": "It gives you a break."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "And then you turn around and you fire back the kind of machine gun fire of information."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "And then you slow down or you underline something."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "When you podcast, you don't have that opportunity, right?"}, {"time": 1464, "text": "There are no visuals in my podcast."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "So what I try and do is always get my voice warmed up and make sure that I'm thinking and speaking at approximately the same rate."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "And then I also do this thing of as I put my vision into panoramic vision when I walk, which is very calming."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "And then I actually start to remind myself of the purpose of podcasting."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "This sounds very mission statementy, but you asked what I do."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "I remind myself first and foremost that what I want to communicate, what I want to come through is the beauty and utility of biology."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And I only feel comfortable saying the word beauty publicly now about science things thanks to you, because I think."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Love and beauty."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "Yeah, love and beauty."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Dr. Andrew Huberman."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "Love and beauty, but also darkness and hatred."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "And if you're talking about the Lex Friedman podcast, you have to adjust, you have to address the shadow also, the shadow side."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "But I think about the, I want to communicate the beauty and utility of biology."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And then I check my emotional state."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "I want to make sure that I'm not angry about anything."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "And certainly if I am that I'm going to set it aside for the podcast, because that's not a place for my, whatever I might be dealing with."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "I also really start to feel into the parts of the research and the papers I found that I really love, because that's the part of me that I like the most frankly."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And on the podcast, if there's a paper, like for instance, we have a paper, excuse me, a podcast coming out soon about heat as a tool, sauna, but some other things."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "And in researching this, I learned so much about these heat shock proteins and the use of sauna in Finland for increasing growth hormone, but also for the treatment of mental illness."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "And I realized I fell in love with this literature."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "It's just a beautiful literature."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "These people are true pioneers for doing this work."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "Now everyone's in the sauna, but this was 20 years ago."},

"text": "It's hilarious and great."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And so I start to think about, and I think, I just start to really access my love of the work."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "And then when we finally sit down, meaning my producer Rob and I and record, I just sort of want to just bask in sharing it."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Just like the little version of me when I was six or seven, I used to spend all weekend reading the encyclopedia, Guinness Book of World Records, making my mother drive me places to introduce me to, I had this obsession with trapping animals when I was a kid, meet these people."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "And then on Monday, I would insist on giving a lecture in class, which as a little kid."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "I just try and access that childlike energy."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "And so I want to be clear."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "The goal is always to make the information interesting, clear and actionable."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "And if it's also surprising, then that's a bonus."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "But that's basically the process."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "But yeah, I'm singing and talking and getting into state."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "And I used to feel very sheepish about sharing any of this."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "This is the first time I've ever shared it out loud, but Rick was the one who encouraged me to find a process that works and continue to develop that process and not let anything get near that process."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "People in my personal life know this."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "And when it's time, it's like, I don't care what else is going on, I'm moving into that brain state."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "And there's probably a process like that for anything that you do in life that you take seriously."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "So the people that have perfected this is athletes."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "Like if Olympic level athletes, they have to have a process like this."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "You know what, I think Tiger Woods actually was taught self hypnosis quite young and use self hypnosis often during his tournaments, sometimes to great success and other times less so."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "Is there other places in life that you use kind of a protocol, like a mental protocol to get ready?"}, {"time": 1700, "text": "Many of the best areas of life are their own form of hypnosis, right?"}, {"time": 1706, "text": "You know that you're in hypnosis, if for instance, you're in a movie and something happens and you feel the emotional lift without being self conscious about it."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "Yes, I think that one thing that we've tried to do in our house is around meal times to try and set a state that food isn't just something that we just throw down our throats."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "And I'm fortunate that my partner cooks really well."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "And so I try and give her the space to do that."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "And that's the whole thing of her getting into state."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "For the cooking."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "The preparation of all the."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "I can just see it."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "I just see the way she approaches the whole thing and the pleasure in serving it."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "And I'm an eater, not a cooker."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "Both are important roles."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "You could be a very good eater."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "Like there's something about, is there anything better in this world than that feeling?"}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Especially if it's a family, getting around a table."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Just the warmth of that."}, {"time": 1761, "text":

family?"}, {"time": 1776, "text": "No television?"}, {"time": 1778, "text": "I didn't really have television period outside of meals."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "So most of my time was spent, you know,

didn't understand."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "It would be like a Pepsi shirt or something."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And it was just, that was the gear."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "And it was like too large for me, but I thought I was the coolest person ever just wearing this fancy like Kanye like type of fashion."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "Yeah, there's something about, I feel like in Eastern Europe, they wear athletic gear where like the guys like zip up."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "Yeah, no, that's like fancy stuff."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "That's if you like, those are the cool kids."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Like the cool soccer players, football players that like they were in a league of some kind."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "So they would get uniforms or like, or they somehow, I always thought anyone who had anything nice had to do something really bad to get it."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "That was my way, view of the world."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "Because like, I guess I didn't understand how it's possible to be rich."}, {"time": 1882, "text": "Cause most of us were surrounded by people who are poor and that life is beautiful and simple."}, {"time": 1886,

this is three to five times a week is a lot for a muscle group."}, {"time": 9715, "text": "Squatting five times a week for five reps, meaning you're working pretty heavy, meaning you're close to failure, but not failure for strength generally."}, {"time": 9723, "text": "What Andy taught me is that people who are training mostly for strength can do these low rep type regimens frequently

other is through some sort of tension based changes in the molecular gene programs of cells that lead to protein synthesis that are distinct from damage."}, {"time": 9801, "text": "And the other are metabolic effects of like high repetition work of super fusion of the muscle with blood."}, {"time": 9806, "text": "We know that third category exists because people are now doing this blood

can just brush that off."}, {"time": 6919, "text": "But if you're someone they have dared to open their heart to, cause that's what admiration is, and then you betray that, then that's a real, they'll never forget it."}, {"time": 6934, "text": "And then they'll tell everyone too."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "So it takes a lot of alertness."}, {"time": 6939, "text": "And so Tammy and our life has got complicated because in Toronto, for example, we can't really just go for a walk."}, {"time": 6946, "text": "It's always a high drama production cause always people come up and they have some heart rending story to tell."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "And I'm not being cynical about that."}, {"time": 6958, "text": "It's a hard thing to bear because people don't do that."}, {"time": 6962, "text": "They don't just open themselves up to you like that and share the tragedy of their life."}, {"time": 6969, "text": "But that's an everyday occurrence."}, {"time": 6971, "text": "And so when we go up to our cottage, which is out of the city, it's a relief, because as wonderful as that is, like it's a weird, I have a weird life because everywhere I go, it's very weird."}, {"time": 6985, "text":

leap into familiarity."}, {"time": 7018, "text": "It really is like it's an old friend and it feels like that."}, {"time": 7021, "text": "For me personally, the experiences, the goodbye hurts because there's a sense where you're never gonna see that friend again."}, {"time": 7032, "text": "Yeah, that's a strange thing, eh?"}, {"time": 7034, "text": "So to me, a lot of it just feels like goodbyes."}, {"time": 7043, "text": "And I mean, that's, I suppose, in some sense, part of the pain of opening yourself up to people because they also, Tammy has been struck particularly."}, {"time": 7053, "text": "She said, I really never knew what men were like."}, {"time": 7055, "text": "I said, well, what do you mean?"}, {"time": 7056, "text": "She said, I cannot believe how polite the men are

mostly."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "And they're tentative and they're very polite, very, very polite."}, {"time": 7073, "text": "And they say, I hope I'm not bothering you."}, {"time": 7075, "text":

people you know."}, {"time": 7205, "text": "And so I really found that a relief."}, {"time": 7208, "text": "And so that was useful."}, {"time": 7210, "text": "And that in order to tolerate this, let's say, or to be able to sustain it, well, let's take a lot of negotiation on the part of Tammy and I, because she's dragged into this and, you know, her life is part of this, whatever this is."},

be on the tour this spring, and I was ill again for part of it."}, {"time": 7237, "text": "And that made it complicated, but she went away back home and she came back and she said, and she was nervous about, she said, I think I need my own room."}, {"time": 7245, "text": "And part of me was not happy with that."}, {"time": 7247, "text": "It's like, what do you mean you need your, like, are we not married anymore?"}, {"time": 7250, "text": "It's like, you need your own room?"}, {"time": 7252, "text": "And she said, well, you know, I can't, she has to do exercises because she was really sick and

this in order to continue."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "And I thought, well, okay, if you need this in order to continue, yes."}, {"time": 7279, "text": "Because she went away and didn't say, well, I don't want to be on the tour."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "She went away and prayed, let's say, how can I continue to do this?"}, {"time": 7288, "text": "And that was the answer."}, {"time": 7290,

I don't want her life to be miserable."}, {"time": 7313, "text": "And I want her to be fully on board."}, {"time": 7315, "text": "And so she has to be properly selfish."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "Like everyone does in a relationship."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "And you have to, not just that, this is a weird thing that you're doing."}, {"time": 7325, "text": "And you have to, both you and her have to figure out how to manage this very intense intellectual, social journey."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "Well, there's another element to it too that I didn't tell you about."}, {"time": 7336, "text": "So that was a typical day, but it's missing a big component because usually we also have a dinner with like 30 cultural representatives, I suppose, 10 to 30 from each country."}, {"time": 7348,

that."}, {"time": 7359, "text": "Now, sometimes that's on a day when I don't have a talk, but sometimes the talks are back to back."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "And so she also has to manage that and to be gracious."}, {"time": 7369, "text": "And then people are showing us exciting things and tours in the cities and which is all, like it's a surf fight of wonderful."}, {"time": 7377, "text": "But

{"time": 7397, "text": "I thought about that a lot too, you know, that I didn't do a really good job of explaining that while I was ill because it appeared in some sense that the reason I was ill was because I was taking benzodiazepines, but that isn't why I was ill. And then I took them and very low dose."}, {"time": 7413, "text": "And I took that for a long time and it helped whatever was wrong with me."}, {"time": 7417, "text": "And it looks like it was an allergy or maybe multiple allergies."}, {"time": 7422, "text": "And then that stopped working."}, {"time": 7425, "text": "And so I took a little bit more for about a month and that made it way worse."}, {"time": 7428, "text": "And so then I cut back a lot and then, then things really got out of hand."}, {"time": 7435, "text": "So there was a deeper thing in the Benzo."}, {"time": 7438,

Tammy has three immunological conditions, each of them quite serious."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "And I had psoriasis and peripheral uveitis, which is an autoimmune condition and alopecia areata and chronic gum disease, all of which appeared to be allergy related."}, {"time": 7462, "text": "And so Michaela seems to have got all of that."}, {"time": 7465, "text": "And so that, and that I think was at the bottom of, cause I also had this proclivity to depression that was part of my family history."}, {"time": 7472, "text": "But I think that was all immunological as far as I can tell."}, {"time": 7475, "text": "So one of the things that's happened to me, I always noticed I really couldn't breathe."}, {"time": 7480, "text": "Like I could breathe about one fifth as much as I sometimes could."}, {"time": 7486, "text": "And so I was always short of breath."}, {"time": 7488, "text": "And it looks like what that was perhaps was I was always on the border of an anaphylactic reaction, which is not pleasant."}, {"time": 7498, "text": "And that's hypersympathetic activation, no parasympathetic activation."}, {"time": 7503, "text": "I couldn't relax at all."}, {"time": 7505, "text": "That's an immunological response."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "Allergic response, yeah."}, {"time": 7509, "text": "So anyways, that was what seemed, now this, I don't like to talk about this much cause it's so bloody radical and I don't like to propagate it, but this diet seems to have stopped all of that."}, {"time": 7519, "text": "I don't have psoriasis, all of the patches have gone."}, {"time": 7522,

cleared up completely."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "What else has changed?"}, {"time": 7536, "text": "Well, I lost 50 pounds and like instantly kept it off."}, {"time": 7541, "text": "I should mention that I too am not a deep investigator of nutritional science."}, {"time": 7547, "text": "I have my skepticism towards the degree to which it is currently as a science."}, {"time": 7551, "text": "Cause like a lot of complex systems is full of mystery and full of profiteers, the people that profit of different kinds of diets."}, {"time": 7560, "text": "But I should say for me personally, it does seem that I feel by far the best when I eat only meat."}, {"time": 7567, "text": "And I discovered that a long time ago."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "First of all."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "How did you discover it?"}, {"time": 7572, "text": "So by, the discovery went like this."}, {"time": 7575, "text": "I started listening to ultra marathon runners about 15 years ago."}, {"time": 7580, "text": "And they started talking about fat adapted running."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "So I first discovered that I don't have to run super fast to enjoy running."}, {"time": 7592, "text": "And in fact, I really enjoy running at a slower pace."}, {"time": 7596, "text": "So that was like step one."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "It's like, oh, okay."}, {"time": 7598, "text": "If I maintain something called the math rule, which is the pretty low heart rate."}, {"time": 7605, "text": "If I maintain that you can actually get pretty fast while maintaining a pretty slow average speed in general."}, {"time": 7610,

"text": "So I discovered how incredible my mind feels when fasted."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "You know, people call it intermittent fasting, but."}, {"time": 7628, "text": "Well, that's an optimization of death because you're, when you fast, your body, logically and obviously, if you think about it biologically is, well, what is your body scavenge first?"}, {"time": 7640, "text": "Well, damaged tissue."}, {"time": 7644, "text": "So the, and I know the literature on fasting to some degree, and it's very compelling literature."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "If you starve dogs down, I think it's 20% below rats too, below their optimal body weight, they live 30% longer."}, {"time": 7658, "text": "That's a lot, 30%, like it's like 30%, yeah, 30%."}, {"time": 7663, "text": "Well, there is aspect to a lot of these things that make me nervous because I always feel like there's no free lunch that I'm gonna pay for it somehow."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "But there's a focus that I am able to attain when I fast, especially when I eat once a day."}, {"time": 7677, "text": "My mind is almost like nervously focused."}, {"time": 7681, "text": "It's almost like an anxiety, but a positive one or one that I can channel into just like an excitement."}, {"time": 7687, "text": "You know, I wonder how much of that's associated with, well, imagine that that signifies lack of food, which not that hard to imagine."}, {"time": 7696, "text": "Well, maybe you should be a lot more alert in that situation, right?"}, {"time": 7699, "text": "Biologically speaking, because you're in hunting mode, let's say, you know, not desperate, but in hunting mode."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "And God only knows maybe human beings should be in hunting mode all the time."}, {"time": 7711, "text": "Often, but we don't know that."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "So I wonder if it has a stress on the system that long term causes the system to get sick."}, {"time": 7719, "text": "It doesn't look like it."}, {"time": 7721, "text": "It seems in the case of fasting, not."}, {"time": 7723, "text": "And then on top of that, I discovered that the thing I enjoy, I just don't enjoy eating fat as much."}, {"time": 7732, "text": "So I love eating meat when you talk about low carb diet."}, {"time": 7735, "text": "So I just discovered through that process, if somewhat fatty meat, but just meat, I just feel a lot of the things that make me feel weird about food, like a little groggy or like full or just whatever, the aspects of food that I don't enjoy, they're not there with meat."}, {"time": 7755, "text": "And I'm still able to enjoy company."}, {"time": 7758, "text": "And when I eat once a day and eat meat, I said, at least in Texas, you could still have all the merriment of, you have dinner with friends."},

whiskey."}, {"time": 7781, "text": "I'll still do the things that add a little bit of spice into the thing."}, {"time": 7787, "text": "Now, when you completely remove the spice, it does become more difficult."}, {"time": 7792, "text": "Yeah, it's more difficult socially."}, {"time": 7793, "text": "And Tammy seems to only be able to eat lamb, although she might be able to eat non aged beef."},

her."}, {"time": 8988, "text": "And then as we progressed through the years, the amount of time that we spent in discussion increased in proportion in the sessions until by the time we stopped seeing

this hand."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "So that means I need to be calling X percent of the time and I put them on this range, et cetera."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "But then sometimes you'll have this

went and stuck him in one of these high stakes cash games with a bunch of like GTO people, he's gonna get ripped apart."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "But there's something that he has that when he's in the halls of the World Series of Poker specifically, amongst sort of amateurish players, he gets them to do crazy shit like that."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "And, but my little pet theory is that also, he just, the card, he's like a wizard and he gets the cards to do what he needs them to."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "Because he just expects to win and he expects to receive, you know, to get flopper

annoyed and it's almost like everybody else is stupid because he was obviously going to win with the spare."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "If that silly thing hadn't happened."}, {"time": 1690, "text":

Series, only at the World Series of Poker, it is like that."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "So I don't blame him for feeling that way."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "But he does, he has this X factor and the

his face, I'm not saying anything."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "I don't, he's got, he truly, I mean, he is one of the greatest."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "I don't know if he's the greatest, he's certainly the greatest at the World Series of Poker."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "And he is the greatest at, despite the game switching into a pure game, almost an entire game of math, he has managed to keep the magic alive."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "And this like, just through sheer force of will, making the game work for him."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "And that is incredible."}, {"time": 1768,

might be something to be said about optimality from studying him."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "What do you mean by optimality?"}, {"time": 1780, "text": "Meaning, or rather game design, perhaps."},

this machine basically would just like kill the workers all the time because it was just so hard to keep it running."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "They were always dying."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "So there was all this suffering that was required in order to keep the city going."}, {"time": 4544, "text": "And then the protagonist has this vision that this machine is actually this demon Moloch."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "So again, it's like this sort of like mechanistic consumption of humans in order to get more power."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "And then Allen Ginsberg wrote a poem in the 60s, which incredible poem called Howl about this thing Moloch."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "And a lot of people sort of quite understandably take the interpretation of that, that he's talking about capitalism."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "But then the sort of piece to resistance that's moved Moloch into this idea of game theory was Scott Alexander of Slate Style Codex wrote this incredible, well, literally I think it might be my favorite piece of writing of all time."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "It's called Meditations on Moloch."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "Everyone must go read it."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "I say Codex is a blog."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "It's a blog, yes."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "We can link to it in the show notes or something, right?"}, {"time": 4595, "text": "No, don't."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "I, yes, yes."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "But I like how you assume I have a professional operation going on here."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "I shall try to remember to... You were gonna assume."}, {"time": 4606, "text": "What do you... What are you, what do you want?"}, {"time": 4608, "text": "You're giving the impression of it."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "Yeah, I'll look, please."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "If I don't, please somebody in the comments remind me."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "I'll help you."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "If you don't know this blog, it's one of the best blogs ever probably."}, {"time": 4619,

migrated onto Substack, but yeah, it's still a blog."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "Substack better not fuck things up, but..."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "I hope not, yeah."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "I hope they don't, I hope they don't turn Molochy, which will mean something to people when we continue."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "When I stop interrupting for once."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "Go on, yeah."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "So anyway, so he writes, he writes this piece, Meditations on Moloch, and basically he analyzes the poem and he's like, okay, so it seems to be something relating to where competition goes wrong."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "And, you know, Moloch was historically this thing of like where people would sacrifice a thing that they care about, in this case, children, their own children, in order to gain power, a competitive advantage."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "And if you look at almost everything that sort of goes wrong in our society, it's that same process."}, {"time": 4672, "text": "So with the Instagram beauty filters thing, you know, if you're trying to become a famous Instagram model, you are incentivized to post the hottest pictures of yourself that

"And then more recently, these beauty filters where like at the touch of a button, it makes your face look absolutely incredible compared to your natural face."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "These technologies come along, it's everyone is incentivized to that short term strategy."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "But over on net, it's bad for everyone because now everyone is kind of feeling like they have to use these things."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "And these things like they make you like, the reason why I talked about them in this video is because I noticed it myself, you know, like I was trying to grow my Instagram for a while, I've given up on it now."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "But yeah, and I noticed these filters, how good they made me look."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "And I'm like, well, I know that everyone else is kind of doing it."}, {"time": 4737, "text": "Go subscribe to Liv's Instagram."}, {"time": 4738, "text": "Please, so I don't have to use the filters."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "I'll post a bunch of, yeah, make it blow up."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "So yeah, you felt the pressure actually."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "Exactly, these short term incentives to do this like, this thing that like either sacrifices your integrity or something else in order to like stay competitive, which on aggregate turns like, creates this like sort of race to the bottom spiral where everyone else ends up in a situation which is worse off than if they hadn't started, you know, than they were before."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "Kind of like if, like at a football stadium, like the system is so badly designed, a competitive system of like everyone sitting and having a view that if someone at the very front stands up to get an even better view, it forces everyone else behind to like adopt that same strategy just to get to where they were before."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "But now everyone's stuck standing up."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "Like, so you need this like top down God's eye coordination to make it go back to the better state."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "But from within the system, you can't actually do that."}, {"time": 4796, "text": "So that's kind of what this Moloch thing is."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "It's this thing that makes people sacrifice values in order to optimize for the winning the game in question, the short term game."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "But this Moloch, can you attribute it to any one centralized source or is it an emergent phenomena from a large collection of people?"}, {"time": 4816, "text": "Exactly that."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "It's an emergent phenomena."}, {"time": 4818, "text": "It's a force of game theory."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "It's a force of bad incentives on a multi agent system where you've got more, you know, prisoner's dilemma is technically a kind of Moloch system as well, but it's just a two player thing."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "But another word for Moloch is it multipolar trap."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "Where basically you just got a lot of different people all competing for some kind of prize."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "And it would be better if everyone didn't do this one shitty strategy, but because that strategy gives you a short term advantage, everyone's incentivized to do it."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "And so everyone ends up doing it."}, {"time": 4849, "text": "So the responsibility for, I mean, social media is a really nice place for a large number of people to play game theory."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "And so they also have the ability to then design the rules of the game."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "And is it on them to try to anticipate what kind of like to do the thing that poker players are doing to run simulation?"}, {"time": 4871, "text": "Ideally that would have been great."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "If, you know, Mark Zuckerberg and Jack and all the, you know, the Twitter founders and everyone, if they had at least just run a few simulations of how their algorithms would, you know, if different types of algorithms would turn out for society, that would have been great."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "That's really difficult to do that kind of deep philosophical thinking about thinking about humanity actually."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "So not kind of this level of how do we optimize engagement or what brings people joy in the short term,

"There aren't, that's the problem."}, {"time": 4924, "text": "And it's difficult because like, when you're starting up a social media company, you know, you're aware that you've got investors to please, there's bills to pay, you know, there's only so much R&D you can afford to do."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "You've got all these like incredible pressures, bad incentives to get on and just build your thing as quickly as possible and start making money."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "And, you know, I don't think anyone intended when they built these social media platforms and just to like preface it."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "So everyone's got this bad incentive of using, you know, as you called it, the clickbait industrial complex."}, {"time": 4982, "text": "That's a very molly key system because everyone is now using worse and worse tactics in order to like try and win this attention game."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "And yeah, so ideally these companies would have had enough slack in the beginning in order to run these experiments to see, okay, what are the ways this could possibly go wrong for people?"}, {"time": 5031, "text": "I think there should be an honesty when founders, I think there's a hunger for that kind of transparency of like, we don't know what the fuck we're doing."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "This is a fascinating experiment."}, {"time": 5039,

weird rats in a maze."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "None of us are controlling it."}, {"time": 5052, "text": "There's this kind of sense like the founders, the CEO of Instagram or whatever, Mark

world?"}, {"time": 5088, "text": "I think a big part of this as well is people, there's this philosophy, particularly in Silicon Valley of well, techno optimism, technology will solve all our issues."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "And there's a steel man argument to that where yes, technology has solved a lot of problems and can potentially solve a lot of future ones."}, {"time": 5108, "text":

have the stack that way where it's technology driving social interaction, which then drives like memetic culture and like which ideas become popular, that's Moloch."}, {"time": 5164, "text": "And we need the other way around, we need it."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "So we need to figure out what are the good memes?"}, {"time": 5168, "text": "What are the good values that we think we need to optimize for that like makes people happy and healthy and like keeps society as robust and safe as possible, then figure out what the social structure around those should be."}, {"time": 5183, "text":

start to reemphasize the memes that matter, the memes that bring out the best in us."}, {"time": 5226, "text": "You know, like the way I try to be in real life and the way I try to be online is to be about kindness and love."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "And I feel like I'm sometimes get like criticized for being naive and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5242, "text": "But I feel like I'm just trying to live within this game."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "I'm trying to be authentic."}, {"time": 5247, "text": "Yeah, but also like, hey, it's kind of fun to do this."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "Like you guys should try this too, you know, and that's like trying to redesign some aspects of the game within the game."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "I don't know, but I think we should try."}, {"time": 5266, "text": "I don't think we have an option but to try."}, {"time": 5268, "text": "Well, the other option is to create new companies or to pressure companies that, or anyone who has control of the rules of the game."}, {"time": 5279, "text": "I think we need to be doing all of the above."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "I think we need to be thinking hard about what are the kind of positive, healthy memes."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "You know, as Elon said, he who controls the memes controls the universe."}, {"time": 5293, "text": "He said that."}, {"time": 5294, "text": "I think he did, yeah."}, {"time": 5296, "text": "But there's truth to that."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "It's very, there is wisdom in that because memes have driven history."}, {"time": 5302, "text": "You know, we are a cultural species."}, {"time": 5304, "text": "That's what sets us apart from chimpanzees and everything else."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "We have the ability to learn and evolve through culture as opposed to biology or like, you know, classic physical constraints."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "And that means culture is incredibly powerful and we can create and become victim to very bad memes or very good ones."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "But we do have some agency over which memes, you know, we, but not only put out there, but we also like subscribe to."}, {"time": 5334, "text": "So I think we need to take that approach."}, {"time": 5336, "text": "We also need to, you know, because I don't want, I'm making this video right now called The Attention Wars, which is about like how Moloch, like the media machine is this Moloch machine."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "Well, is this kind of like blind dumb thing where everyone is optimizing for engagement in order to win their share of the attention pie."}, {"time": 5356, "text": "And then if you zoom out, it's really like Moloch that's pulling the strings because the only thing that benefits from this in the end, you know, like our information ecosystem is breaking down."}, {"time": 5363, "text": "Like we have, you look at the state of the US, it's in, we're in a civil war."}, {"time": 5368, "text": "It's just not a physical war."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "It's an information war."}, {"time": 5373, "text": "And people are becoming more fractured in terms of what their actual shared reality is."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "Like truly like an extreme left person, an extreme right person, like they literally live in different worlds in their minds at this point."}, {"time": 5385, "text": "And it's getting more and more amplified."}, {"time": 5387, "text": "And this force is like a razor blade pushing through everything."}, {"time": 5391, "text": "It doesn't matter how innocuous a topic is, it will find a way to split into this, you know, bifurcated cultural and it's fucking terrifying."}, {"time": 5398, "text": "Because that maximizes the tension."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "And that's like an emergent Moloch type force that takes anything, any topic and cuts through it so that it can split nicely into two groups."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "One that's... Well, it's whatever, yeah, all everyone is trying to do within the system is just maximize whatever gets them the most attention because they're just trying to make money so they can keep their thing going, right?"}, {"time": 5424, "text": "And the best emotion for getting attention, well, because it's not just about attention on the internet, it's engagement, that's the key thing, right?"}, {"time": 5433, "text": "In order for something to go viral, you need people to actually engage with it."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "They need to like comment or retweet or whatever."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "And of all the emotions that, there's like seven classic shared emotions that studies have found that all humans, even from like previously uncontacted tribes have."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "Some of those are negative, you know, like sadness, disgust, anger, et cetera, some are positive, happiness, excitement, and so on."}, {"time": 5461, "text": "The one that happens to be the most useful for the internet is anger."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "Because anger, it's such an active emotion."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "If you want people to engage, if someone's scared, and I'm not just like talking out my ass here, there are studies here that have looked into this."}, {"time": 5478, "text": "Whereas like if someone's like, disgusted or fearful, they actually tend to then be like, oh, I don't wanna deal with this."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "So they're less likely to actually engage and share it and so on, they're just gonna be like, ugh."}, {"time": 5487, "text": "Whereas if they're enraged by a thing, well now that triggers all the like, the old tribalism emotions."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "And so that's how then things get sort of spread, you know, much more easily."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "They out compete all the other memes in the ecosystem."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "And so this like, the attention economy, the wheels that make it go around are, is rage."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "I did a tweet, the problem with raging against the machine is that the machine has learned to feed off rage."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "Because it is feeding off our rage."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "That's the thing that's now keeping it going."}, {"time": 5519, "text": "So the more we get angry, the worse it gets."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "So the mullet in this attention, in the war of attention is constantly maximizing rage."}, {"time": 5530, "text": "What it is optimizing for is engagement."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "And it happens to be that engagement is more propaganda, you know."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "I mean, it just sounds like everything is putting, more and more things are being put through this like propagandist lens of winning whatever the war is in question."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "Whether it's the culture war or the Ukraine war, yeah."}, {"time": 5551, "text": "Well, I think the silver lining of this, do you think it's possible that in the long arc of this process, you actually do arrive at greater wisdom and more progress?"}, {"time": 5561, "text": "It just, in the moment, it feels like people are tearing each other to shreds over ideas."}, {"time": 5567, "text": "But if you think about it, one of the magic things about democracy and so on, is you have the blue versus red constantly fighting."}, {"time": 5573, "text": "It's almost like they're in discourse, creating devil's advocate, making devils out of each other."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "And through that process, discussing ideas."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "Like almost really embodying different ideas just to yell at each other."}, {"time": 5588, "text": "And through the yelling, over the period of decades, maybe centuries, figuring out a better system."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "Like in the moment, it feels fucked up."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "But in the long arc, it actually is productive."}, {"time": 5603, "text": "That said, we are now in the era of, just as we have weapons of mass destruction with nuclear weapons, you know, that can break the whole playing field, we now are developing weapons of informational mass destruction."},

"That's the thing, there are plenty of good actors within the system who are just trying to stay afloat in the game, so effectively doing monarchy things."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "But then on top of that, we have actual bad actors who are intentionally trying to, like, manipulate the other side into doing things."}, {"time": 5657, "text": "And using, so because it's a digital space, they're able to use artificial actors, meaning bots."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "Exactly, botnets, you know, and this is a whole new situation that we've never had before."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "Yeah, it's exciting."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "You know what I want to do?"}, {"time": 5674, "text": "You know what I want to do that, because there is, you know, people are talking about bots manipulating and, like, malicious bots that are basically spreading propaganda."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "I want to create, like, a bot army for, like, that fights that."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "For love?"},

have to be careful whenever you create, again, like, Moloch is very tricky."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "Hitler was trying to spread the love, too."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "Well, yeah, so we thought, but, you know, I agree with you that, like, that is a thing that should be considered, but there is, again, everyone, the road to hell is paved in good intentions."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "And this is, there's always unforeseen circumstances, you know, outcomes, externalities of you trying to adopt a thing, even if you do it in the very best of faith."}, {"time": 5723, "text": "But you can learn lessons of history."}, {"time": 5725, "text": "If you can run some sims on it first, absolutely."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "But also there's certain aspects of a system, as we've learned through history, that do better than others."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "Like, for example, don't have a dictator, so, like, if I were to create this bot army, it's not good for me to have full control over it."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "Because in the beginning, I might have a good understanding of what's good and not, but over time, that starts to get deviated, because I'll get annoyed at some assholes, and I'll think, okay, wouldn't it be nice to get rid of those assholes?"}, {"time": 5753, "text": "But then that power starts getting to your head, you become corrupted, that's basic human nature."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "So distribute the power somehow."}, {"time": 5759, "text": "We need a love botnet on a DAO."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "A DAO love botnet."}, {"time": 5767, "text":

still need the ability to coordinate, because that's the issue when something is too, you know, that's really, to me, like the culture wars, the bigger war we're dealing with is actually between the

that's the advice on YouTube, Twitter, you name it."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "And that's why, and the trouble with that is that it's a complexity reduction."}, {"time": 6402, "text": "And generally

the Einstein kind of sense of a really complex idea, a simplification in a way that still captures some core power of an idea of a person is also beautiful."}, {"time": 6456, "text": "And so maybe it's possible for social media to do that."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "A presentation, a sort of a slither, a slice, a look into a person's life that reveals something real about them."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "But in a simple way, in a way that can be displayed graphically or through words."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "Some way, I mean, in some way Twitter can do that kind of thing."}, {"time":

trouble."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "But in a certain sense, if you do take it in context, it reveals some kind of quirky little beautiful idea or a profound little idea from that particular person

with Tristan Harris from Center of Humane Technology."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "And he explained it as like, Twitter is where you have this amalgam of human culture and then this terribly designed algorithm that amplifies the craziest people and the angriest most divisive takes and amplifies them."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "And then the media, the mainstream media, because all the journalists are also on Twitter, they then are informed by that."}, {"time": 6592, "text": "And so they draw out the stories they can from this already like very boiling lava of rage and then spread that to their millions and millions of people who aren't even on Twitter."}, {"time": 6607, "text": "And so I honestly, I think if I could press a button, turn them off, I probably would at this point, because I just don't see a way of being compatible with healthiness, but that's not gonna happen."}, {"time": 6619, "text": "And so at least one way to like stem the tide and make it less malachy would be to change, at least if like it was on a subscription model, then it's now not optimizing for impressions."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "Cause basically what it wants is for people to keep coming back as often as possible."}, {"time": 6640, "text": "That's how they get paid, right?"}, {"time": 6642, "text": "Every time an ad gets shown to someone and the way is to get people constantly refreshing their feed."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "So you're trying to encourage addictive behaviors."}, {"time": 6649, "text": "Whereas if someone, if they moved on to at least a subscription model, then they're getting the money either way, whether someone comes back to the site once a month or 500 times a month, they get the same amount of money."}, {"time": 6662, "text": "So now that takes away that incentive, to use technology, to build, to design an algorithm that is maximally addictive."}, {"time": 6670, "text": "That would be one way, for example."}, {"time": 6672, "text": "Yeah, but you still want people to, yeah, I just feel like that just slows down, creates friction in the virality of things."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "But that's good."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "We need to slow down virality."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "It's good, it's one way."}, {"time": 6686, "text": "Virality is malach, to be clear."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "So malach is always negative then?"}, {"time":

all virality is negative then, is malach then."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "Because it's a good intuition, because we have a lot of data on virality being negative."}, {"time": 6712, "text": "But I happen to believe that the core of human beings, so most human beings want to be good more than they want to be bad to each other."}, {"time": 6723, "text": "And so I think it's possible, it might be just harder to engineer systems that enable virality, but it's possible to engineer systems that are viral that enable virality."}, {"time": 6735, "text": "And the kind of stuff that rises to the top is things that are positive."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "And positive, not like la la positive, it's more like win win, meaning a lot of people need to be challenged."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "Wise things, yes."}, {"time": 6749, "text": "You grow from it, it might challenge you, you might not like it, but you ultimately grow from it."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "And ultimately bring people together as opposed to tear them apart."}, {"time": 6758, "text": "I deeply want that to be true."}, {"time": 6760, "text": "And I very much agree with you that people at their core are on average

spread that day."}, {"time": 6821, "text": "And also like not just like happiness and connection between humans, but connection between humans in other ways that enables like productivity, like cooperation, solving difficult problems and all those kinds of stuff."}, {"time": 6836, "text": "So it's not just about let's be happy and have a fulfilling lives."}, {"time": 6840, "text": "It's also like, let's build cool shit."}, {"time": 6843, "text": "Let's get excited."}, {"time": 6844, "text": "Which is the spirit of collaboration, which is deeply anti Moloch, right?"}, {"time": 6846,

again, like the internet started out as that and it could have been that, but because of the way it was sort of structured in terms of, you know, very lofty ideal, they wanted everything to be open

know, you've got this third party interest, which means that you're then like, people having to optimize for that."}, {"time": 6888, "text": "And that is, you know, the actual consumer is actually the product, not the person you're making the thing for."}, {"time": 6896, "text": "In the end, you start making the thing for the advertiser."}, {"time": 6899, "text": "And so that's why it then like breaks down."}, {"time": 6903, "text": "Yeah, like it's, there's no clean solution to this."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "And I, it's a really good suggestion by you actually to like figure out how we

heavy conversation because we were trying to figure out whether or not I was gonna sell my apartment."}, {"time": 6997, "text": "Well, you know, he had already moved in, but I think we were just

about it as a dance because it is really about that."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "It's about sensing what state the other person's in and using that information to decide on how you're going to

{"time": 3752, "text": "It's intermixed into the whole thing."}, {"time": 3755, "text": "And in fact, when you take it away, people are unable to make decisions."}, {"time": 3759, "text": "They're really paralyzed."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "Like they can't go about their daily or their, you know, personal or professional lives."}, {"time": 3765, "text": "It does seem like there's probably some

emotions."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "But then like, see, I feel like emotion is part of communication."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "It's very much about communication."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "And then, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's and then that means it's also deeply connected to language."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "But then probably human intelligence is deeply connected to the collective intelligence between humans."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "It's not just the standalone thing."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "So the whole thing is really connected."}, {"time": 3836, "text": "So emotion is connected to language, language is connected to intelligence, and then intelligence is connected to consciousness, and consciousness is connected to emotion."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "The whole thing is that it's a beautiful mess."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "So can I comment on the emotions being a communication mechanism?"}, {"time": 3855, "text": "Because I think there are two facets of our emotional experiences."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "One is communication, right?"}, {"time": 3864, "text": "Like we use emotions, for example, facial expressions or other nonverbal cues to connect with other human beings and with other beings in the world, right?"}, {"time": 3874, "text": "But even if it's not a communication context, we still experience emotions and we still process emotions and we still leverage emotions to make decisions and to learn and, you know, to experience life."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "So it isn't always just about communication."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "And we learned that very early on in our and kind of our work at Affectiva."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "One of the very first applications we brought to market was understanding how people respond to content, right?"}, {"time": 3901, "text": "So if they're watching this video of ours, like, are they interested?"}, {"time": 3904, "text": "Are they inspired?"}, {"time": 3905, "text": "Are they bored to death?"}, {"time": 3907, "text": "And so we watched their facial expressions and we had, we weren't sure if people would express any emotions if they were sitting alone."}, {"time": 3915, "text": "Like if you're in your bed at night, watching a Netflix TV series, would we still see any emotions on your face?"}, {"time": 3921, "text": "And we were surprised that, yes, people still emote, even if they're alone, even if you're in your car driving around, you're singing along the song and you're joyful, you're smiling, you're joyful, we'll see these expressions."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "So it's not just about communicating with another person."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "It sometimes really isn't just about experiencing the world."}, {"time": 3941, "text": "And first of all, I wonder if some of that is because we develop our intelligence and our emotional intelligence by communicating with other humans."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "And so when other humans disappear from the picture, we're still kind of a virtual human."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "The code still runs."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "Yeah, the code still runs, but you also kind of, you're still, there's like virtual humans."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "You don't have to think of it that way, but there's a kind of, when you like chuckle, like, yeah, like you're kind of chuckling to a virtual human."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "I mean, it's possible that the code has to have another human there because if you just grew up alone, I wonder if emotion will still be there in this visual form."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "So yeah, I wonder, but anyway, what can you tell from the human face about what's going on inside?"}, {"time": 3998, "text": "So that's the problem that Effectiva first tackled, which is using computer vision, using machine learning to try to detect stuff about the human face, as many things as possible and convert them into a prediction of categories of emotion, anger, happiness, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "It's extremely hard."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "It's very, very hard because there is no one to one mapping between a facial expression and your internal state."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "There just isn't."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "There's this oversimplification of the problem where it's something like, if you are smiling, then you're happy."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "If you do a brow furrow, then you're angry."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "If you do an eyebrow raise, then you're surprised."}, {"time": 4039, "text": "And just think about it for a moment."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "You could be smiling for a whole host of reasons."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "You could also be happy and not be smiling, right?"}, {"time": 4048, "text": "You could furrow your eyebrows because you're angry or you're confused about something or you're constipated."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "So I think this oversimplistic approach to inferring emotion from a facial expression is really dangerous."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "The solution is to incorporate as many contextual signals as you can, right?"}, {"time": 4068, "text": "So if, for example, I'm driving a car and you can see me like nodding my head and my eyes are closed and the blinking rate is changing, I'm probably falling asleep at the wheel, right?"}, {"time": 4080, "text": "Because you know the context."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "You understand what the person's doing or add additional channels like voice or gestures or even physiological sensors, but I think it's very dangerous to just take this oversimplistic approach of, yeah, smile equals happy and..."}, {"time": 4100, "text": "If you're able to, in a high resolution way, specify the context, there's certain things that are going to be somewhat reliable signals of something like drowsiness or happiness or stuff like that."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "I mean, when people are watching Netflix content, that problem, that's a really compelling idea that you can kind of, at least in aggregate, highlight like which part was boring, which part was exciting."},

it's a relatively constrained environment."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "You have somebody sitting in front of..."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "Initially, we started with like a device in front of you, like a laptop, and then we graduated to doing this on a mobile phone, which is a lot harder just because of, you know, from a computer vision perspective, the profile view of the face can be a lot more challenging."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "We had to figure out lighting conditions because usually people are watching content literally in their bedrooms at night."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "Lights are dimmed."}, {"time": 4165, "text": "Yeah, I mean, if you're standing, it's probably going to be the looking up."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "The nostril view."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "Yeah, and nobody looks good at it."}, {"time": 4174, "text": "I've seen data sets from that perspective."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "It's like, this is not a good look for anyone."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "Or if you're laying in bed at night, what is it, side view or something?"}, {"time": 4184, "text": "And half your face is like on a pillow."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "Actually, I would love to know, have data about like how people watch stuff in bed at night, like, do they prop there, is it a pillow, the, like, I'm sure there's a lot of interesting dynamics there."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "From a health and well being perspective, right?"}, {"time": 4207, "text": "Like, oh, you're hurting your neck."}, {"time": 4208, "text": "I was thinking machine learning perspective, but yes, but also, yeah, yeah, once you have that data, you can start making all kinds of inference about health and stuff like that."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "Yeah, there's an interesting thing when I was at Google that we were, it's called active authentication, where you want to be able to unlock your phone without using a password."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "So it would face, but also other stuff, like the way you take a phone out of the pocket."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "So that kind of data to use the multimodal with machine learning to be able to identify that it's you or likely to be you, likely not to be you, that allows you to not always have to enter the password."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "But the funny thing about that is, I just want to tell a small anecdote is because it was all male engineers, except so my boss is, our boss was still one of my favorite humans, was a woman, Regina Dugan."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "Oh, my God, I love her."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "She's awesome."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "She's the best."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "So, but anyway, and there's one female brilliant female engineer on the team, and she was the one that actually highlighted the fact that women often don't have pockets."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "It was like, whoa, that was not even a category in the code of like, wait a minute, you can take the phone out of some other place than your pocket."}, {"time": 4301, "text": "So anyway, that's a funny thing when you're considering people laying in bed, watching a phone, you have to consider if you have to, you know, diversity in all its forms, depending on the problem, depending on the context."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "Actually, this is like a very important, I think this is, you know, you probably get this all the time."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "Like people are worried that AI is going to take over humanity and like, get rid of all the humans in the world."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "I'm like, actually, that's not my biggest concern."}, {"time": 4326, "text": "My biggest concern is that we are building bias into these systems."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "And then they're like deployed at large and at scale."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "And before you know it, you're kind of accentuating the bias that exists in society."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "Yeah, I'm not, you know, I know people, it's very important to worry about that, but the worry is an emergent phenomena to me, which is a very good one, because I think these systems are actually, by encoding the data that exists, they're revealing the bias in society."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "They're both for teaching us what the bias is."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "Therefore, we can now improve that bias within the system."},

open to scrutinizing the data."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "And if you just take it as ground."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "Or you don't even have to look at the, I mean, yes, the data is how you fix it."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "But then you just look at the behavior of the system."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "And you realize, holy crap, this thing is kind of racist."}, {"time": 4388, "text": "Like, why is that?"}, {"time": 4389, "text": "And then you look at the data, it's like, oh, okay."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "And then you start to realize that I think that some much more effective ways to do that are effective way to be introspective as a society than through sort of political discourse."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "Like AI kind of, because people are for some reason more productive and rigorous in criticizing AI than they're criticizing each other."}, {"time": 4415, "text": "So I think this is just a nice method for studying society and see which way progress lies."},

parts are boring."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "You're saying that's relatively constrained because you have a captive audience and you kind of know the context."}, {"time": 4437, "text": "And one thing you said that was really key is the aggregate."}, {"time": 4441, "text": "You're doing this in aggregate, right?"}, {"time": 4442, "text": "Like we're looking at aggregated response of people."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "And so when you see a peak, say a smile peak, they're probably smiling or laughing at something that's in the content."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "So that was one of the first

content."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "So it's important to call it for what it is."}, {"time": 4465, "text": "But it's still really, really useful data."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "I wonder how that compares to, so what like YouTube and other places will use is obviously they don't have, for the most case, they don't have that kind of data."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "They have the data of when people tune out, like switch to drop off."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "And I think that's an aggregate for YouTube, at least a pretty powerful signal."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "I worry about what that leads to because looking at like YouTubers that kind of really care about views and try to maximize the number of views, I think when they say that the video should be constantly interesting, which seems like a good goal, I feel like that leads to this manic pace of a video."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "Like the idea that I would speak at the current speed that I'm speaking, I don't know."},

extra signal."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "You have to really, I don't know, you have to really collect deeper long term data about what was meaningful to people."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "When they think 30 days from now, what they still remember, what moved them, what changed them, what helped them grow, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "You know, it would be a really interesting,

with you?"}, {"time": 4594, "text": "And then see if there's any, there ought to be maybe, there ought to be some correlation between these emotional experiences and, yeah, what you, what stays with

we met and honestly, it was the first, it was the only time I met with a CEO who had the same vision as I did."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "Like he basically said, yeah, our vision is to bridge the gap between human and automotive."}, {"time": 5601, "text": "Bridge the gap between humans and machines."}, {"time": 5603, "text": "I was like, oh my God, this is like exactly almost to the word, how we describe it too."}, {"time": 5609, "text": "And we started talking and first it was about, okay, can we align strategically here?"}, {"time": 5615, "text": "Like how can we work together?"}, {"time": 5616, "text": "Cause we're competing, but we're also like complimentary."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "And then I think after four months of speaking almost every day on FaceTime, he was like, is your company interested in an acquisition?"}, {"time": 5629, "text": "And it was the first, I usually say no, when people approach us, it was the first time that I was like, huh, yeah, I might be interested."}, {"time": 5638, "text": "Let's talk."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "So you just hit it off."}, {"time": 5642, "text": "So they're a respected, very respected in the automotive sector of like delivering products and increasingly sort of better and better and better for, I mean, maybe you could speak to that, but it's the driver's sense."}, {"time": 5655, "text": "If we're basically having a device that's looking at the driver and it's able to tell you where the driver is looking."}, {"time": 5662, "text": "It's able to."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "Also drowsiness stuff."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "Stuff from the face and the eye."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "Like it's monitoring driver distraction and drowsiness, but they bought us so that we could expand beyond just the driver."},

{"time": 5704, "text": "We can detect if a baby's in the car seat, right?"}, {"time": 5707, "text": "And if unfortunately in some cases they're forgotten, the parents just leave the car and forget the kid in the car."}, {"time": 5714, "text": "That's an easy computer vision problem to solve, right?"}, {"time": 5717, "text": "You can detect there's a car seat, there's a baby, you can text the parent and hopefully again, save lives."}, {"time": 5723, "text": "So that was the impetus for the acquisition."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "It's been a year."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "So that, I mean, there's a lot of questions."}, {"time": 5731, "text": "It's a really exciting space, especially to me, I just find this a fascinating problem."}, {"time": 5736, "text": "It could enrich the experience in the car in so many ways, especially cause like we spend still, despite COVID, I mean, COVID changed things so it's in interesting ways, but I think the world is bouncing back and we spend so much time in the car and the car is such a weird little world we have for ourselves."}, {"time": 5756, "text": "Like people do all kinds of different stuff, like listen to podcasts, they think about stuff, they get angry, they get, they do phone calls, it's like a little world of its own with a kind of privacy that for many people they don't get anywhere else."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "And it's a little box that's like a psychology experiment cause it feels like the angriest many humans in this world get is inside the car."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "So it's such an opportunity to explore how we can enrich, how companies can enrich that experience and also as the cars get, become more and more automated, there's more and more opportunity, the variety of activities that you can do in the car increases."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "So it's super interesting."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "So I mean, on a practical sense, SmartEye has been selected, at least I read, by 14 of the world's leading car manufacturers for 94 car models."}, {"time": 5820, "text": "So it's in a lot of cars."}, {"time": 5823, "text": "How hard is it to work with car companies?"}, {"time": 5826, "text": "So they're all different, they all have different needs."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "The ones I've gotten a chance to interact with are very focused on cost."}, {"time": 5836, "text": "So it's, and anyone who's focused on cost, it's like, all right, do you hate fun?"}, {"time": 5844, "text": "Let's just have some fun."}, {"time": 5845, "text": "Let's figure out the most fun thing we can do and then worry about cost later."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "But I think because the way the car industry works, I mean, it's a very thin margin that you get to operate under."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "So you have to really, really make sure that everything you add to the car makes sense financially."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "So anyway, is this new industry, especially at this scale of SmartEye, does it hold any lessons for you?"}, {"time": 5870, "text": "Yeah, I think it is a very tough market to penetrate, but once you're in, it's awesome because once you're in, you're designed into these car models for like somewhere between five to seven years, which is awesome."}, {"time": 5882, "text": "And you just, once they're on the road, you just get paid a royalty fee per vehicle."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "So it's a high barrier to entry, but once you're in, it's amazing."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "I think the thing that I struggle the most with in this industry is the time to market."},

5923, "text": "Oh, definitely, I think one of the biggest inventions or imperatives created by Tesla is like to me personally, okay, people are going to complain about this, but I know electric vehicle, I know autopilot AI stuff."}, {"time": 5939, "text": "To me, the software over there, software updates is like the biggest revolution in cars."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "And it is extremely difficult to switch to that because it is a culture shift."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "At first, especially if you're not comfortable with it, it seems dangerous."}, {"time": 5957, "text": "Like there's a, there's an approach to cars is so safety focused for so many decades that like, what do you mean we dynamically change code?"}, {"time": 5967, "text": "The whole point is you have a thing that you test, like, and like, it's not reliable because do you know how much it costs if we have to recall this cars, right?"}, {"time": 5981, "text": "There's a, there's a, and there's an understandable obsession with safety, but the downside of an obsession with safety is the same as with being obsessed with safety as a parent is like, if you do that too much, you limit the potential
