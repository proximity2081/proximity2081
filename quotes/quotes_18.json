it, big full screen, slow motion."}, {"time": 202, "text": "All right, let's talk about aliens."}, {"time": 203, "text": "We'll find places we disagree and places we agree, life, intelligence, consciousness, universe, all of that."}, {"time": 211, "text": "Let's start with a tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson stating his skepticism about aliens wanting to visit Earth."}, {"time": 219, "text": "Quote, how egocentric of us to think that space aliens who have mastered interstellar travel across the galaxy would give, pardon the French, would give a shit about humans on Earth."}, {"time": 234, "text": "So let me ask you, would aliens care about visiting Earth, observing, communicating with humans?"}, {"time": 240, "text": "Let's take a perspective of aliens, maybe Sarah first."}, {"time": 245, "text": "Are we interesting in the whole spectrum of life in the universe?"}, {"time": 251, "text": "I'm completely biased, at least as far as I think right now we're the most interesting thing in the universe."}, {"time": 256, "text": "So I would expect based on the intrinsic curiosity that we have and how much I think that's deeply related to the physics of what we are, that other intelligent aliens would want to seek out examples of the phenomena they are to understand themselves better."}, {"time": 274, "text": "And I think that's kind of a natural thing to want to do."}, {"time": 277, "text": "And I don't think there's any kind of judgment on it being a lesser being or not."}, {"time": 282, "text": "It's like saying you have nothing to learn by talking to a baby."}, {"time": 285, "text": "You have lots to learn, probably more than you do talking to somebody that's 90."}, {"time": 288, "text": "So yeah, so I think they absolutely would."}, {"time": 291, "text": "So whatever the phenomena is that is human, there will be an inkling of the same kind of phenomena within alien species and they will be seeking that same."}, {"time": 300, "text": "I think there's gotta be some features of us that are universal."}, {"time": 303, "text": "And I think the ones that are most interesting, and I hope I live in an interesting universe, are the ones that are driven by our curiosity and the fact that our intelligence allows us to do things that the universe wouldn't be able to do without things like us existing."}, {"time": 322, "text": "We're gonna define a lot of terms."}, {"time": 323, "text": "One of them is interesting."}, {"time": 326, "text": "That's a very interesting term to try to define."}, {"time": 329, "text": "Ali, what do you think?"}, {"time": 330, "text": "Are humans interesting for aliens?"}, {"time": 333, "text": "Well, let's take it from our perspective."}, {"time": 334, "text": "We want to go find aliens as a species quite desperately."}, {"time": 337, "text": "So if we put the shoe on the other foot, of course we're interesting."}, {"time": 341, "text": "But I'm wondering and assuming that we're at the right technological capabilities to go searching for aliens, then that's interesting."}, {"time": 348, "text": "So what I mean is, if there needs to be a massive leap in technology that we don't have, how will aliens prioritize coming to Earth and other places?"}, {"time": 358, "text": "But I do think that they would come and find us because they'd want to find out about our culture, what things are universal."}, {"time": 366, "text": "I mean, I'm a chemist."}, {"time": 367, "text": "I would say, well, is the chemistry universal, right?"}, {"time": 369, "text": "Are the creatures that we're going to find making all this commotion, are they made of the same stuff?"}, {"time": 377, "text": "What does their science look like?"}, {"time": 380, "text": "Are they off planet yet?"}, {"time": 382, "text": "I guess there's, so I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson is being slightly pessimistic and maybe trying to play the tune that the universe is vast and it's not worth them coming here."}, {"time": 395, "text": "I don't think that, but I just worry that maybe we don't have the ability to talk to them."}, {"time": 400, "text": "We don't have the universal translator."}, {"time": 402, "text": "We don't have the right physics, but sure, they should come."}, {"time": 405, "text": "We are interesting."}, {"time": 406, "text": "I want to know if they exist."}, {"time": 407, "text": "It would make it easier if they just came."}, {"time": 410, "text": "So again, I'm going to use your tweets like it's Shakespeare and analyze it."}, {"time": 416, "text": "So Sarah tweeted, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens."}, {"time": 421, "text": "So how much do you think aliens are thinking about other aliens, including humans?"}, {"time": 427, "text": "So you said, we humans want to visit."}, {"time": 433, "text": "Like we're longing to connect with aliens."}, {"time": 436, "text": "Can you introspect that?"}, {"time": 436, "text": "Is that an obvious thing that we should be, like what are we hoping to understand by meeting aliens exactly?"}, {"time": 443, "text": "Asking as an introvert, it's like, I ask myself this all the time."}, {"time": 446, "text": "Why go out on a Friday night to meet people?"}, {"time": 450, "text": "What are you hoping to find?"}, {"time": 451, "text": "I think the curiosity, so when I saw Sarah put that tweet, I think I answered it actually as well, which was we are thinking about trying to make contact."}, {"time": 458, "text": "So they almost certainly are, but maybe there's a number of classes."}, {"time": 463, "text": "There are those aliens that have not yet made contact with other aliens like us."}, {"time": 468, "text": "Those aliens have made contact with just one other alien and maybe it's an anticlimax and slime, right?"}, {"time": 475, "text": "And aliens have made contact with not just one set of intelligent species, but several."}, {"time": 479, "text": "That must be amazing actually."}, {"time": 481, "text": "Literally there are some place in the universe, there must be one alien civilization."}, {"time": 485, "text": "Let's not make contact with not one, but two other intelligent civilizations."}, {"time": 490, "text": "So they must be thinking about it."}, {"time": 492, "text": "There must be entire degree courses on aliens, thinking about aliens and universal cultural norms."}, {"time": 501, "text": "Do you think they will survive the meeting?"}, {"time": 504, "text": "And by the way, Lee did respond saying, that's all the universe wants."}, {"time": 508, "text": "So Sarah said, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens."}, {"time": 511, "text": "Lee said, that's all the universe wants."}, {"time": 514, "text": "And then Sarah responded, cheeky universe we live in."}, {"time": 518, "text": "So cheeky is a cheeky version of the word interesting, all of which we'll try to define mathematically."}, {"time": 525, "text": "Cheeky might be harder than interesting."}, {"time": 527, "text": "Because there's humor in that too."}, {"time": 529, "text": "I think there's a mathematical definition of humor, but we'll talk about that in a bit."}, {"time": 532, "text": "Oh interesting."}, {"time": 533, "text": "Yeah, sure there is, yeah."}, {"time": 534, "text": "So if you're a graduate student alien looking at multiple alien civilizations, do you think they survive the encounters?"}, {"time": 543, "text": "I think there's a tendency to anthropomorphize a lot of the discussions about alien life, which is a really big challenge."}, {"time": 550, "text": "So usually when I'm trying to think about these problems, I don't try to think about us as humans, but us as an example of phenomenon that exists in the universe that we have yet to explain."}, {"time": 561, "text": "And it doesn't seem to be the case that if I think about the features, I would argue are most universal about that phenomenon, that there's any reason to think that a first encounter with another lineage or example of life would be antagonistic."}, {"time": 604, "text": "And the quest there is really, you know, really to understand something totally new about the universe, and that thing just happens to be us."}, {"time": 612, "text": "There's something else more profound."}, {"time": 613, "text": "I think Neil was just being, again, he's just trying to stir the pot."}, {"time": 617, "text": "I would say from a contingency point of view, I want to know how many ways does the universe build structures, build memories, right?"}, {"time": 626, "text": "And then I want to know if those memories can interact with each other."}, {"time": 630, "text": "And if you have two different origins of life and then origins of intelligence, and then these things become conscious, surely you want to go and talk to them and figure out what commonalities you share."}, {"time": 641, "text": "And it might be that we're just unable to conceive of what they're going to look like."}, {"time": 644, "text": "They're just going to be completely different, you know, infrastructure, but surely we'll want to go and find out a map."}, {"time": 650, "text": "And surely curiosity is a property that evolution has made on earth."}, {"time": 655, "text": "And I can't see any reason that it won't happen elsewhere because curiosity probably exists because we want to find innovations in the environment."}, {"time": 663, "text": "We want to use that information to help our technology."}, {"time": 668, "text": "And also curiosity is like planning for the future."}, {"time": 670, "text": "Are they going to fight us?"}, {"time": 672, "text": "Are we going to be able to trade with them?"}, {"time": 675, "text": "So I think that Neil's just, I don't know, maybe, you know, I mean, give a shit."}, {"time": 679, "text": "That's really, I think that's really down on earth, right?"}, {"time": 682, "text": "How would aliens categorize humans, do you think?"}, {"time": 685, "text": "How would we?"}, {"time": 686, "text": "So let's put it the other way around."}, {"time": 688, "text": "Slime category."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Maybe, no, no, no."}, {"time": 690, "text": "Maybe we could, the thing is a bit odd, right?"}, {"time": 693, "text": "Look at Instagram, Twitter, all these people taking selfies."}, {"time": 696, "text": "I mean, does the universe is the ultimate state of consciousness, thinking beings that take photographs themselves and upload them to an internet with other thinking beings looking at each other's photos."}, {"time": 706, "text": "So I think that they will be."}, {"time": 710, "text": "I did not say there was anything wrong with it."}, {"time": 713, "text": "It's consciousness manifested at scale."}, {"time": 716, "text": "Selfies, Instagram."}, {"time": 718, "text": "It's like the mirror test at scale."}, {"time": 720, "text": "Yeah, I do think that curiosity is really the driving force for why we have our technology, right?"}, {"time": 725, "text": "If we weren't curious, we wouldn't go out, left the cave."}, {"time": 728, "text": "So I think that, so I think that Neil's got it completely wrong, in fact."}, {"time": 734, "text": "Actually, of course they'd want to come here."}, {"time": 736, "text": "It doesn't mean they are coming here."}, {"time": 737, "text": "We've seen evidence for that."}, {"time": 739, "text": "I guess we can argue about that, right?"}, {"time": 741, "text": "But I think that we want, I desperately, and I know that Sarah does too, but I won't speak for you, you're here."}, {"time": 748, "text": "I desperately want to have missions to look for life in the solar system right now."}, {"time": 752, "text": "I want to map life over the solar system."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And then I want to understand how we can go and find life as quickly as possible at the nearest stars, and also at the same time do it in the lab, just to compensate, you know?"}, {"time": 764, "text": "So, sure."}, {"time": 765, "text": "Yeah, just one more point on this."}, {"time": 767, "text": "If you think about sort of what's driven the most features of our own evolution as a species, and try to map that to alien species, I always think like optimism is what's gonna get us furthest."}, {"time": 777, "text": "And so I think a lot of people always think that it's like war and conflict is gonna be the way that alien species will expand out into the cosmos."}, {"time": 786, "text": "But if you just look at how we're doing it and how we talk about it, so is our future in space is always, you know, built from narratives of optimism."}, {"time": 794, "text": "And so it seems to me that if intelligence does get out in the universe, that it's gonna be more optimism and curiosity driving it than war and conflict, because those things end up crushing you."}, {"time": 805, "text": "So there might be some selective filter."}, {"time": 808, "text": "Of course, this is me being an optimist."}, {"time": 809, "text": "I'm a half full kind of person, but."}, {"time": 811, "text": "Is it obvious that curiosity, not obvious, but what do you think?"}, {"time": 816, "text": "Is curiosity a more powerful force in the universe than violence and the will to power?"}, {"time": 823, "text": "So, because you said you framed curiosity as a way to also plan on how to avoid violence, which is an interesting framing of curiosity."}, {"time": 832, "text": "But I could also argue that violence is a pretty productive way to operate in the world, which is like, that's one way to protect yourself."}, {"time": 842, "text": "The best defense is offense."}, {"time": 845, "text": "I'm not qualified to answer this, but I'll have a go."}, {"time": 847, "text": "I think violence, let's not talk about violence."}, {"time": 850, "text": "That's the summary of this podcast."}, {"time": 852, "text": "I would, yeah, maybe, I would, let's not call it violence, but I call it erasure."}, {"time": 857, "text": "So if you think about the way evolution works, or the way, obviously talk about assembly theory, but I won't."}, {"time": 864, "text": "So if you say you build, curiosity allows you to open up avenues, new graphs, right?"}, {"time": 869, "text": "So new features you can play."}, {"time": 873, "text": "The ability to erase those things allows you to start again and do some pruning."}, {"time": 877, "text": "So the universe, I think curiosity gets you furthest."}, {"time": 879, "text": "Curiosity gets you rockets that land."}, {"time": 881, "text": "It gets you robots that can make drugs."}, {"time": 883, "text": "It gets you poetry and art and communication."}, {"time": 888, "text": "And then, I often think wouldn't it be great in bureaucracy to have another world war, not literally a world war now, please no world war, but the equivalent so we get remove all the admin bureaucracy, right?"}, {"time": 899, "text": "All the admin violence, get rid of it and start again."}, {"time": 903, "text": "Because you get layers and you get redundant systems built."}, {"time": 906, "text": "So actually a reset, let's not call it violence, a reset in some aspects of our culture and our technology allows us to then build more important things about the, because how many cookies do I have to click on?"}, {"time": 922, "text": "How many extra clicks do I have in the future of my life that I could remove and a bit of a reset would allow us to start again."}, {"time": 933, "text": "And maybe that's how I suppose our encounter aliens will be."}, {"time": 937, "text": "Maybe they will fight with us and say, oh, we're not as excited by you as we thought."}, {"time": 941, "text": "We'll just get rid of you."}, {"time": 942, "text": "So they might want to reset Earth."}, {"time": 944, "text": "To be like, let's see how the evolution runs again."}, {"time": 947, "text": "This seems like they've, there's nothing new happening here."}, {"time": 951, "text": "They're observing for a while."}, {"time": 952, "text": "This is just not, let's keep it more fun."}, {"time": 955, "text": "Let's start with the fish again."}, {"time": 959, "text": "I like how you equated violence to resetting your cookies."}, {"time": 964, "text": "I suppose that's the kind of violence."}, {"time": 966, "text": "In this modern world where words are violence, resetting cookies is the kind of violence."}, {"time": 970, "text": "I don't know where that came from."}, {"time": 971, "text": "I'm completely, yeah."}, {"time": 972, "text": "That's poetic, really."}, {"time": 974, "text": "Okay, so let's talk about life."}, {"time": 979, "text": "What is non life?"}, {"time": 980, "text": "What is the line between life and non life?"}, {"time": 983, "text": "And maybe at any point, we can pull in ideas of assembly theory."}, {"time": 987, "text": "Like how do we start to try to define life?"}, {"time": 989, "text": "And for people listening, so Sarah identifies as a physicist and Lee identifies as a chemist."}, {"time": 997, "text": "Of course, they are very interdisciplinary in nature in general, but so what is life?"}, {"time": 1009, "text": "I love asking that question because it's so absurdly big."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "I know, I love it."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "It's my absolute favorite question in the whole universe."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "So I think I have three ways of describing it right now."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "And I like to say all three of them because people latch onto different facets of them."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "And so the whole idea of what Lee and I are trying to work on is not to try to define life, but to try to find a more fundamental theory that explains what the phenomenon we call life."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "And then it should explain certain attributes and you end up having a really different framing than the way people usually talk."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "So the way I talk about it three different ways."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "Life is how information structures matter across space and time."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "Life is, I don't know, this one's from you actually, simple machines constructing more complex machines."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "And the other one is the physics of existence, so to speak, which is life is the mechanism the universe has to explore the space of what's possible."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So can I, yeah, yeah, can I add on to that?"}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Okay, can you say the physics one again?"}, {"time": 1069, "text": "Physics of existence."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "Yeah, the physics of existence."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "If you think of all the things that could exist, only certain things do exist."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "And I think life is basically the universe's mechanism of bringing things into physically existing in the moment now."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "Yeah, and what's another one?"}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So we were debating this the other day."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "So if you think about a universe that has nothing in it, that's kind of hard to conceive of, right?"}, {"time": 1096, "text": "Because, and this is where physicists really go wrong."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "They think of a universe with nothing in it, they can't."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And you think."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "But nonexistence is really hard to think."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Nonexistence, yeah."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "And then you think of a universe with everything in it, that's really hard."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "And you just have this white blob, right?"}, {"time": 1110, "text": "It's just everything."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "But the fact we have discrete stuff in the universe, Beyonce planets, so you've got stars, space, planet stuff, right, the boring stuff, but I would define life or say that life is where there are architectures, any architectures, and we should stop fixating on what is building the architectures to start with."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "And the fact that the universe has discrete things and it is completely mind blowing."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "If you think about it for one second, the fact there's any objects at all, and there's, because for me, the object is a proxy for a machine that built it, some information being moved around, actuation, sensing, getting resource, and building these objects."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "So for me, everyone's been obsessing about the machine, but I'm like, forget the machine, let's see the objects."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "And I think in a way that assembly theory, we realized maybe a few months ago that assembly theory actually does account for the soul and the objects, not mystically like say, Sheldrake's morphic resonance, or Leibniz's monadology, seeing souls in things."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "But when you see an object, and I've said this before, but this object is evidence of thought, and then there's a lineage of those objects."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "So I think what is fascinating is that, you put it much more elegantly, but the barrier between life and non life is accruing enough memories to then actuate."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "So what that means is there are contingency, there are things that happen in the universe get trapped, these memories then have a causal effect on the future."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "And then when you get those concentrated in a machine, and you're actually able in real time, able to integrate the past, the present with the future, and do stuff, that's when you are most alive."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "You being the machine."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Wait a minute, why is the object, so one of the ways to define life, that Sarah said, is simple machines creating complex machines."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "So there's a million questions there."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So how the hell does a simple machine create a complex machine?"}, {"time": 1241, "text": "By mutation."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "So this is what we were talking about at the beginning, is you have the minimum replicator, so a molecule."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "So this is what I was trying to convince Sarah of the mechanism get there years ago, I think, but then you've been building on it and saying, you have a molecule that can copy itself, but then there has to be some variability, otherwise it's not gonna get more functional."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "So you need to add bits on."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "So you have a minimum molecule that can copy itself, but then it can add bits on, and that can be copied as well, and those add ons can give you additional function, to be able to acquire more stuff to exist."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "So existence is weird, but the fact that there is existence is why there is life, and that's why I realized a few days ago that there must be, that's why alien life must be everywhere, because there is existence."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Is there a conservation of cheeky stuff happening?"}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So how can you keep injecting more complex things?"}, {"time": 1298, "text": "Doesn't the machine that creates the object need to be as or more powerful than the things it creates?"}, {"time": 1308, "text": "So how can you get complexity from simplicity?"}, {"time": 1311, "text": "So the way you get complexity from simplicity is that you, I'm just making this up, but this is kind of my notion, and you have a large volume of stuff, so you're able to get seeds, if you like, random cues from the environment."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "So you just use those objects to basically write on your tape, ones and zeros, whatever."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "And that is necessarily rich, complex, okay?"}, {"time": 1337, "text": "But it has a low assembliness, but even though it has a high assembly number, we can talk about that."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "But then when you start to then integrate that all into a smaller volume, as over time, and you become more autonomous, you then make the transition."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "I don't know what you think about that."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "I think the easiest way to think about it is actually, which I know is a concept you hate, but I also hate, which is entropy, but people are more familiar with entropy than what we talk about in assembly theory."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "And also the idea that, like, say physics as we know it involves objects that don't exist across time, or as we would say, low memory objects."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "So one of the key distinctions that is... Low memory objects."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "Yeah, so physics is all..."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Physicists are low memory objects."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "Low memory objects."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "Physicists are creators of low memory objects or manipulators of low memory objects."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "It's a very nice way of putting it."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Yeah, no, it's okay."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Sorry to keep interrupting."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "No, no, no, it's fine."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "I like it too, it's very funny."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "But I think it's a good way of phrasing it because I think this kind of idea we have in assembly theory is that, you know, physics as we know it has basically removed time as being a physical observable of an object."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And the argument I would make is that when you look at things like water bottles or us, we're actually things that exist that have a large extent in time."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "So we actually have a physical size and time, and we measure that with something called the assembly index in molecules, but presumably everyone should have sort of a, do you want to explain what assembly?"}, {"time": 1434, "text": "Yeah, let's, you know what?"}, {"time": 1436, "text": "Let's step back and start at the beginning."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "Lee sent me some

blocks."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "They happen to be bonds."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "And then you can think of all the ways, for molecular assembly theory, you can think of all the ways of building up the original molecule."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "So there's all these paths that you can assemble it."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And the sort of rules of assembly is you can use pieces that have been generated already."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So it has this kind of recursive property to it."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "And so that's where kind of memory comes into assembly theory."},

in order to assemble that particular object."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "And the reason that this is significant is we figured out how to measure that with a mass spec in the lab."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "And we had this conjecture that if that minimal number of steps was sufficiently large, it would indicate that you required a machine or a system that had information about how to assemble that specific object because the combinatorial space of possibilities is getting exponentially large as the assembly index is increasing."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "So it's just, sorry to interrupt, so that means there's a sufficiently high assembly index that if observed in an object is an indicator that something lifelike created it or is the object itself lifelike?"}, {"time": 1568, "text":

the arguments, but it should be experimentally observable and Lee can talk more about that part of it."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "But the point I want to make about it is there was always this

another sort of potentially constant of nature."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "It might depend on the specific features of the system, but which we debate about sometimes."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "But

that."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "Yeah, but the point is that's a feature of the object."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "So when I think of all the things in this room, we see the projection of them as a

just have A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, D.

physically measured that string of letters."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "Then what you could do is you can infer sub graphs of maybe the four A's, the four B's, the four C's and the four C's, but you don't see them in the real world."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "You just infer them."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "And I really got stuck with that because there's a problem to try and work out what's the

can't infer your entire history, we know at some point the four A's were made, the four B's was made, the four C's were made, the four D's were made and they all got added together."}, {"time": 1815,

components, particularly molecules are good because you can break them up into smaller molecules, into atoms."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "The challenge will be making that more general across all the domains, but we're working on it right now and I think the theory will do that."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "So components, domains, so you're talking about basically measuring the complexity of an

of fusing that notions together."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "And then the team were like, yeah, but if I have enough energy and I have enough resources, I might not take the shortest path."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "I might go a bit longer."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "I might take a really long path because it allows me then to do something else."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "So what you can do is, let's say I've got two different objects, A and B, and they both have different shortest paths to get them."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "But then if you want to make A and B together, they will have a compromise."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "So in the joint assembly space, that might be an average, but actually it's the shortest way you can make both A and B with a minimum amount of resource in time."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "So suddenly you then layer these things up."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "And so the average becomes not important, but as you literally overlap those sets, you get a new shortest path."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "And so what we realized time and time again when we're doing the math, the shortest path is intrinsic, is fundamental, and is measurable, which is kind of mind blowing."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "So what we're talking about, some basic ingredients, maybe we'll talk about that, what those basic ingredients could be and how many steps, when you say shortest path, how many steps it takes to turn those basic ingredients into the final meal."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So how to make a, what's the shortest way to make a pizza?"}, {"time": 2255,

the blue one."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "These basic ingredients, and they're geographically constrained, or constrained in space or time, or something like that."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "They're

for some things."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "So just one point on the shortest path versus the average path, which I think we'll get to this, is you had a nice way of saying it's like the minimal compression is the shortest path for the universe to produce that."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "But it's also like the first time in the ordering of events that you might expect to see that object."},

nice features of assembly is you've basically gotten rid of, you just look at the things that exist, and you've gotten rid of the mechanisms for constructing them in some sense."}, {"time": 2456,

can only communicate with things as Lee was saying, if you have some overlap in the past history."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "So if you had an alien species that had absolutely no overlap, then there would be no means of communication."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "But as we progress further and further in time and more things become possible because the assembly spaces are larger, because you can have a larger assembly space in terms of index and also just the size of the space, because it's exponentially growing, then more things can happen in the future."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "And the example I like to give is actually when we made first contact with gravitational waves, because that's an alien phenomenon that's been permeating our planet, not alien in life phenomenon, but alien

causal graph have to start intersecting."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "Yeah, we needed the idea to emerge first, the abstraction, right?"}, {"time": 2538, "text": "And then we had to build the technology

possibilities is so vast, infinite almost, and you're able to actualize one of those in an object, then you are inventing it."}, {"time": 3384, "text": "So in mathematics, because there are infinite number of theorems, the fact you're actually pulling, there's no difference between inventing a mathematical structure and inventing the aeroplane."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "They're the same thing,

stuff."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "But we are just going to look at, we're going to find aliens that look most like us."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "Because those are the first ones we're likely to see."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "But I think it's really hard to imagine what the space of aliens is because the space is huge."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "Because, you know, like one of the arguments that you can make about why life emerges in chemistry is because chemistry is the first scale in terms of like, you know, building up objects from elementary objects."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "That the number of possible things that could exist is larger than the universe can possibly make all at once."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "So imagine you have two planets and they're cooking some geochemistry."}, {"time": 3871, "text": "You know, our planet invented one kind of biochemistry."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "And presumably as you start building up the complexity of the molecules, the

evolutionary path."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "So I think it's very difficult to imagine predicting the technologies that aliens are gonna have."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "I mean, it's so, you're looking at basically planets have kind of convergent chemistry, but there's some variability."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "And then you're looking basically at the outgrowth into the possibility space for chemistry."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "So do you think we would detect the technology, the objects created by aliens before we detect the aliens?"}, {"time": 3912, "text": "So when you're talking

point, and I've been trying to make this argument more recently, I might write an essay on it, is people talk about the great filter, right?"}, {"time": 4193, "text": "And which is, again, this doomsday thing that people wanna say there's no aliens out there because something terrible happened to them."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "And it matters whether that's in our past or our future as to

that's the sense I have is, I mean, you talk with physicists, engineers in general, there's this kind of idea that we have most of the tools already to hear the signal."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "But

to hear."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "We don't have the tools to really hear, to see."}, {"time": 4299, "text": "Aliens are everywhere."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "We just don't have the, yeah, well, oh, that's."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "I mean, I got this in part, actually, because you were like, you know, last time I was here, he was like, look at the carpet."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "You know, if

patterns, basically."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "So one way to think about high assembly index is interesting patterns of basic ingredients."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "I can give you an example, because I mean, in molecules, we've been talking about in objects, but we're also trying to do it in spatial trajectories."}, {"time": 4349, "text": "Like, imagine you're just, like, I always get bothered by the fact that, like, when you look at birds flocking, you can describe that with like a simple Boyd's model, or like, you know, people use spin glass to describe animal behavior."},

{"time": 4368, "text": "And basically, like, you can't help but think there must be some statistical signatures of the fact that they're, that's a group of agents versus, you know, like, I don't know, you know, the physics example, maybe like, I don't know, Brownian motion or something."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "And so what we're trying to do is actually apply assembly to trajectory data to try to say there's a minimal amount of causal history to build up certain trajectories for observed agents that's like an agency detector for behavior."}, {"time": 4395, "text": "Do you think it's possible to do some like Boyd's or those kinds of things, like artificial, like cellular automata, play with those ideas with assembly, with assembly theory?"}, {"time": 4408, "text": "Have you found any useful, really simple mathematical, like, simulation tools that allow you to play with these concepts?"}, {"time": 4418, "text": "So like one, of course, you're doing mass spec in this physical space with chemistry, but it just seems, well, I mean, computer science person, maybe, it seems easier to just."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "It seems even sexier in terms of tweeting visual information on Twitter or Instagram, more importantly, to play like, here's an organism of a low assembly index and here's an organism of a high assembly index and let's watch them create more and more memories and more and more complex objects."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "And so like, in mathematics, you get to observe what that looks like to build up an intuition what assembly index is like."}, {"time": 4455,

on earth will disagree that objects can exist elsewhere, right?"}, {"time": 4495, "text": "But they will disagree that life can exist elsewhere."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "But what perhaps I'm trying to say is that the acquisition, the universe's ability to acquire memory is the very first step for building life."}, {"time": 4510, "text": "And that must be, that's so easy to happen."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "So therefore alien life is everywhere because all alien life is, is those memories being compressed and minimalized and the alien equivalent of the cell working."}, {"time": 4524,

most interesting thing, as you're saying to these two organisms, different assemblies, there's one you get into biology."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Biology gets more and more weird, more and more contingent."}, {"time": 4546, "text": "Physics is, chemistry is less weird cause the rules of chemistry are smaller than the rules of biology."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "And then going away to physics where you have a very nicely tangible number of ways of arranging things."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "And I think assembly theory just helps you appreciate that."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "And so once we get there, my dream is that we are just gonna be able to suddenly, I mean, I'm maybe just being really arrogant here."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "I don't mean to be arrogant."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "It's just, I've got this hammer called assembly and everything's a nail."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "But I think that once we crack it, we'll be able to use assembly theory plus telescopes to find aliens."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "Do you have, Sarah, do you have disagreements with Lee on the number of aliens that are out there?"}, {"time": 4588, "text": "I do actually, yeah, well."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "And what they look like."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "So any of the things we've been talking about, is there nuanced, it's always nice to discover wisdom through nuanced disagreement."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "Yeah, I don't wholly disagree, but I think, but I do think I disagree."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "It's kind of, there's nuance there."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "But Lee made it."}, {"time": 4612, "text": "You can disagree."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "No, it's fine."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "It is nuanced, right?"}, {"time": 4615, "text": "So you made the point earlier that you think, once we discover what life is, we'll see alien life everywhere."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "And I think I agree on some levels in the sense that I think the physics that governs us is universal."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "But I don't know how far I would go to say, to say that we're a likely phenomenon because we don't understand all of the features of the transition at the origin of life, which we would just say in assembly, as you go from the no memory physics to there's like a critical transition around the assembly index where assembliness starts to increase."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "And that's what we call the evolution of the biosphere and complexification of the biosphere."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "So there's a principle of increasing assembliness where that goes back to what I was saying at the very beginning about the physics of the possible, that the universe basically gets in this mode of trying to make as much possibilities as possible."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "Now, how often that transition happens that you get the kind of cascading effect that we get in our biosphere, I think we don't know."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "If we did, we would know the likelihood of life in the universe."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "And a lot of people wanna say life is common, but I don't think that we can say that yet till we have the empirical data, which I think you would agree with."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "But then there's this other kind of thought experiment I have which I don't like, but I did have it, which is if life emerges on one planet and you get this real high density of things that can exist on that planet, is it sort of dominating the density of creation that the universe can actually generate?"}, {"time": 4699, "text": "So like if you're thinking about counting entropy, right?"}, {"time": 4701, "text": "Like the universe has a certain amount of stuff in it."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "And then assembly is kind of like an entropic principle."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "It's not entropy."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "But the idea is that now transformations among stuff or the actual physical histories of things now become things that you have to count as far as saying that these things exist and we're increasing the number of things that exist."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "And if you think about that cosmologically, maybe Earth is sucking up all the life potential of the whole universe, I don't know."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "But I haven't."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "How's that, can you expand that a little bit?"}, {"time": 4731, "text": "Why can any one geographical region suck up the creative capacity of the universe?"}, {"time": 4737, "text": "Just like, I know it's a ridiculous thought."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "I don't actually agree with it, but it was just a thought experiment."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "I love that you can have thoughts that you don't like and don't agree with, but you have to think through them anyway."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "The human mind is fascinating."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "Yeah, I think these sort of counterfactual thought experiments are really good when you're trying to build new theories because you have to think through all the consequences."}, {"time": 4759, "text": "And there are people that want to try to account for, say, the degrees of freedom on our planet in cosmological inventories of talking about the entropy of the universe."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "And when we're thinking about cosmological arrow of time and things like that."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "Now, I think those are pretty superficial proposals as they stand now, but assembly would give you a way of counting it."}, {"time": 4778, "text": "And then the question is if there's a certain maximal capacity of the universe's speed of generating stuff, which Lee always has this argument that assembly is about time."}, {"time": 4787, "text": "The universe is generating more states."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "Really what it's generating is more assembly possibilities."}, {"time": 4792, "text": "And then dark energy might be one manifestation of that, that the universe is accelerating its expansion because that makes more physical space."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "And what's happening on our planet is it's accelerating in the expansion of possible things that exist."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "And maybe the universe just has a maximal rate of what it can do to generate things."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "And then if there is a maximal rate, maybe only a certain number of planets can actually do that."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "Or there's a trade off about the pace of growth on certain planets versus others."}, {"time": 4818, "text": "I have a million questions there, but do you have thoughts on?"}, {"time": 4820, "text": "Just a quick, yeah, I'll just say something very quick."}, {"time": 4823, "text": "No, it's good, I think I get it."}, {"time": 4824, "text": "I think I get it."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "So what I want to say is when I mean aliens are everywhere, I mean memories are the prerequisite for aliens via selection and then concentration of selection when selection becomes autonomous."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "So what I would love to do is to build, say a magical telescope that was a memory, a magical one, or a real one, that would be a memory detector to see selection."}, {"time": 4851, "text": "So you could get to exoplanets and say that exoplanet looks like there's lots of selection going on there."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "Maybe there's evolution and maybe there's going to be life."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "So what I'm trying to say is narrow down the regions of space where you say there's definitely evidence of memory as high assembly there or not high assembly, because that would be life, but where it's capable of happening."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "And then that would also help us frame the search for aliens."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "I don't know how likely it is to make the transition to cells and all the other things."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "But I think that we just need to get more data."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "Well, I didn't like the thought experiment because I don't like the idea that if the universe has a maximal limit on the amount it can generate per unit time that our existence is actually precluding the existence of other things."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "Well, I'll just say one thing."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "But I think that's probably true anyway because of the resource limitations."}, {"time": 4895, "text": "So I don't like your thought experiment because I think it's wrong."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "Well, no, no, I do like the thought experiment."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "So what you're trying to say is like, there is a chain of events that goes back that's manifestly culminated with life on Earth."},

that have allowed life to merge here."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "That doesn't mean that life can't emerge elsewhere, but you're saying that the intersection of events may be concentrated here, right?"}, {"time": 4924, "text": "And I think there's... Not exactly."}, {"time": 4926, "text": "It's more like if you look at, say the causal graphs are fundamental, maybe space is an emergent property, which is consistent with some proposals on quantum gravity, but also how we talk about things in assembly theory."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "Then the universe is causal graphs generating more structure in causal graphs, right?"}, {"time": 4944, "text": "So this is how the universe is unfolding."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "And maybe there's a cap on the rate of generation."}, {"time": 4950, "text": "Like there's only so much stuff that gets made per update of the universe."}, {"time": 4954, "text": "And then if there's a lot of stuff being made in a particular region that happens to look the same locally, spatially, that's an after effect of the fact that the whole causal graph is updating."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "Like it's... Yeah, I don't know that."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "I think that that doesn't work."}, {"time": 4971, "text": "I don't think it works either, but I don't have a good argument in my mind about."},

"Let me ask real quick."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "Like why does different like local pockets of the universe start remembering stuff?"}, {"time": 4987, "text": "How does memory emerge exactly?"},

of other ways maybe."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "But I would say heterogeneity in matter is where the memory..."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "So you must have enough different ways of rearranging matter

can combine in a combinatorial set of ways."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "So there's a combinatorial explosion of the number of molecules or minerals or solid objects, bonds being made."}, {"time": 5057,

{"time": 5067, "text": "So you've got basically, and this is what one was up earlier where one universe where you've just got everything is possible."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "So you can take all the atoms and combine them and make everything."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "Then you've got basically what is the assembly combinatorial where you basically have to accrue information in steps."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "Then you've got assembly observed, and then you've got the object assembly going back."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "So what I'm trying to say is like, if you can take atoms and make bonds, let's say you take a nitrogen atom and add it to a carbon atom, you find an amino acid, then you add another carbon atom on in a particular configuration, then another one, all different molecules."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "They all represent different histories."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "So I would say for me right now, the most simple route into life seems to be through recording memories and chemistry."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "But that doesn't mean there can't be other ways and can't be other emergent effects."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "But I think if you can make bonds and lots of different bonds, and those molecules can have a causal effect on the future."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "So imagine a box of atoms, and then you combine those atoms in some way."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "So you make molecule A from load of atoms, and then molecule A can go back to the box and influence the box."}, {"time": 5145, "text": "Then you make A prime or AB or ABC."}, {"time": 5149, "text": "And that process keeps going, and that's where the memories come from, is that heterogeneity in the universe from bonding."}, {"time": 5157, "text": "I don't know if that makes any sense."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "And it's beginning to flourish at the chemistry level."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "So the physicists have no, like not enough."}, {"time": 5171, "text": "They're like desperately begging for more freedom and heterogeneous components to play with."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "What do you think about that, Sarah?"}, {"time": 5184, "text": "I mentioned already, I think it's significant that whatever physics governs life emerges actually in chemistry."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "It's not relevant at the subatomic scale or even at the atomic scale."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "It's in, well, atomic scale because chemistry."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "But like when you get into this combinatorial diversity that you get from combining things on the periodic table, that's when selection actually matters or the fact that some things can exist and others can't exist actually starts to matter."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "So I think of it like you don't study gravity inside the atomic nucleus."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "You study it in terms of large scale structure of the universe or black holes or things like that."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "And whatever we're talking about as physics of information or physics of assembly becomes relevant at a certain scale of reality."}, {"time": 5228, "text": "And the transition that you're talking about, I would think of as just when you get a sufficient density in terms of the assembly space of like the relationship of the overlap and the assembly space, which is like a feature of common memory, there is this transition to assembly dominated physics, whatever that is."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "Oh, like when we're talking about, and we're trying to map out exactly what that transition looks like."}, {"time": 5253, "text": "We're pretty sure of some of its features, but we haven't done all of the... Do you think if you were there in the early universe, you would have been able to predict the emergence of chemistry and biology?"}, {"time": 5263, "text": "And I ask that because at this stage as humans, do you think we can possibly predict the length of memory that might be able to be formed later on in this pocket of the universe?"}, {"time": 5276, "text": "Like how complex is, what is the ceiling of assembly?"}, {"time": 5282, "text": "I think as much time as you have in the past is how much you can predict in the future."}, {"time": 5286, "text": "Because it's actually physical in the system and you have to have enough time for features of that structure to exist."}, {"time": 5295, "text": "Wait, let me push back on that."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "Isn't there somewhere in the universe that's like a shortest path that's been, that stretches all the way to the beginning?"}, {"time": 5304, "text": "That's building some giant monster?"}, {"time": 5306, "text": "Maybe, yeah."},

predict."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "You can't predict any deeper than that, no."}, {"time": 5318, "text": "So like that, I guess what I'm saying is, like what intuition do you have about complexity living in the world that you'd have today?"}, {"time": 5326, "text": "Right, because you just, you can, I mean I guess how long does it get more fun?"}, {"time": 5334, "text": "Like isn't there gonna be at some point, because there's a heat death in the universe, isn't there going to be a point of the most, of the highest assembly of object, with the highest probability being generated?"},

wanna mention one thing that might be, is I do think assembly theory applies all the way back to subatomic particles."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "And I also think that cosmological selection might've been actually, there might've been, I would say it's a really boring bit, but it's really important for a cosmologist that universes have gone through."}, {"time": 5387, "text": "Was it Lee Smolin who proposed this?"}, {"time": 5389, "text": "Maybe that there is this, that basically a universe evolves, you've got the wrong constants, we'll start again."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "And the most productive constants where you can allow particles to form in a certain way, propagate to the next universe, and we go again."}, {"time": 5401, "text": "So actually selection goes all the way back,

that."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "There is a much more."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "So this is some aspect where through the selection process there's parameters that are being fine tuned, and we happen to be living in one where there's some level of fine tuning."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "Is there, given that, can you steel man the case that we humans are alone in the universe?"}, {"time": 5431,

a."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "Yes, it's possible."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "Let's assume."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "Well, we know."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "I mean, it's possible."}, {"time": 5447,

term thing."}, {"time": 5520, "text": "Chemistry can happen quickly."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "So maybe going on with the steel manning of the argument to say actually, the fact that life emerged quickly doesn't mean that life is easy."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "It just means that the chemistry was right on Earth, and Earth is very special."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "And that's why there's no life anywhere else in the universe."}, {"time": 5537, "text": "Yeah, so Sarah mentioned this kind of cascading thing."}, {"time": 5541, "text": "So what if that's the reason we're lucky, is that we got to have a rare cascading of, like an accelerating cascading effect in terms of the complexity of things."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "So like, maybe most of the universe is trying to get sticky with the memory, and it's not able to really form it."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "And then we got really lucky in that."}, {"time": 5563, "text": "And it has nothing, like there's a lot of Earth like

to run?"}, {"time": 5674, "text": "What volume of chemical space do you need to explore before you actually see an event?"}, {"time": 5680, "text": "And I like to make an analogy to one of my favorite

observed in our universe."}, {"time": 5691, "text": "And basically what they're doing is every time they don't see a proton decay event, they have a longer bound on the lifetime of a proton."},

physical volume in terms of space, but I actually mean volume in terms of the combinatorial space of chemistry."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "How do you nicely control the combinatorial exploration, the

for aliens."}, {"time": 5770, "text": "I think you explained it really well."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "We should carry on doing this."}, {"time": 5772, "text": "I should pretend the physics, be the

can you, can instead, can you give me money to make robots, to make molecules are interesting."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "And everyone went, yeah, okay, you can do that."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "And that's, so actually the funny thing is the computer project, which I have in my lab, which is very briefly, it's just basically, it's like literally an automated test tube."}, {"time": 5841, "text":

to make a search engine to get origin of life because they don't have a planet."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "And I thought about doing in a microfluidic format."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "So microfluidic is very nano, very small channels in device where you can basically have all the pipes lit dump produced by lithography."}, {"time": 5863, "text": "And you can have a chamber, maybe say between say 10 and a hundred microns in volume."}, {"time": 5868, "text": "And we slot them all together like Lego, and we can make an origin of life system."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And I could never get it to work."}, {"time": 5875, "text": "And I realized I had to make, do chemistry at the kind of test tube level and what you want to be able to do."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "Yeah, it goes

like, you know, eight years old, right?"}, {"time": 5944, "text": "Nine years old, going on nine years old."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "And then I invented the computer just because I wanted to build this origin of life grid."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "Which is like literally a billion test tubes connected together in real time and real space, basically throwing a chemical dice."}, {"time": 5963,

about."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "Because, you know, there's more money being spent on the origin of the gravity or looking at the Higgs boson than the origin of life, right?"}, {"time": 5979, "text":

you're putting too many, too much bets into this origin part?"}, {"time": 6012, "text": "Maybe the origin thing isn't, isn't there always a turtle underneath the turtle?"}, {"time": 6016, "text":

would think nothing interesting would emerge, but actually what we're looking at is something that I believe is called glider guns or a glider gun, which is moving objects in this multi cell space

think?"}, {"time": 6605, "text": "Is it a useful question to ask what happened before the Big Bang?"}, {"time": 6608, "text": "Is it a useful question to ask what's outside the universe?"}, {"time":

the past is that there is a thing we call the Big Bang."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "There's some signatures of our local environment that indicate that there was a very low information event that started our universe."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "I think that's actually just an artifact of the structure of the assembly space that when you start losing all the memory in the objects, it looks like what we call a Big Bang."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "So I think it makes sense to talk about where you are locally."}, {"time": 6676, "text": "I think it makes sense to talk about counterfactual possibilities, what could exist outside the universe in the sense that they become part of our reasoning and therefore part of our causal chain of things that we can do."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "So like the multiverse in my mind exists, but it doesn't exist as a multiverse of possible universes."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "It exists as an idea in our minds that allows us to reason about how physics works and then to do physics differently because we reason about it that way."}, {"time": 6702, "text": "So I always like to recenter it on things exist, but they don't always exist like we think they exist."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "So when we're thinking about things outside the universe, they absolutely exist because we're thinking about them, but they don't look like the projections

that."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "I think the most interesting things for us to be doing are finding explanations that allow us to do more, like that optimism."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "So I tend to

should we focus just on the memories that are still there?"}, {"time": 6788, "text": "Well, the point I was trying to make about the experiment is I was trying to say both things."}, {"time": 6791,

what happened before the Big Bang and before, before, before, without giving me any credible conjecture about how would we know the difference?"}, {"time": 6818, "text": "But the way you framed it is quite nice."}, {"time": 6820, "text": "It's like, what have we forgotten?"}, {"time": 6823, "text": "Is there room for God in assembly theory?"}, {"time": 6827, "text": "Who's God?"}, {"time": 6829,

interesting theological arguments are always about whether something has to exist or there was a first thing that had to exist."}, {"time": 6857, "text": "But I think there's a lot of logical loopholes in those kind of arguments."}, {"time": 6859, "text": "Well, so God here, meaning the machine that creates, that generates the stuff."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "But God, so what I was trying to say earlier is that."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "Isn't that just the universe though?"}, {"time": 6873, "text": "Well, yeah, well, but there's a difference between, I sort of imagine like a black box, like a machine."}, {"time": 6881, "text": "I mean, I would be more comfortable calling that God because it's a machine."}, {"time": 6885, "text": "You go into a room and there's a thing with a button."}, {"time": 6887, "text": "Yeah, I don't like the great programmer in the sky version."}, {"time": 6890, "text": "Yeah, but if it's more kind of like, I don't like to think of, if you look at a cellular automata, if it's the cells and the rules, that doesn't feel like God that generates a bunch of stuff."}, {"time": 6906, "text": "But if there's a machine like that does, that runs the cellular automata and set the rules, then that feels like God."}, {"time": 6915, "text": "That sort of, in terms of terminology."}, {"time": 6919, "text": "So I wonder if there's like a machine that's required to generate this universe."}, {"time": 6923, "text": "That's very sort of important for running this in the lab."}, {"time": 6926, "text": "So as I said earlier, I think I said this earlier, that I can't remember the phrase, but something like, I mean, does God exist in our universe?"}, {"time": 6935, "text": "Where does God exist?"}, {"time": 6936, "text": "God at least exists in abstraction in our minds, particularly of people who have religious faith they believe in."}, {"time": 6945, "text": "But let's then take, but you're talking a little bit more about generics, say, well, is there a mechanism beyond the universe you're calling God?"}, {"time": 6951, "text": "I would say God did not exist at the beginning, but he or she does now."}, {"time": 6959, "text": "Because I'm saying the mechanism."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "Well, you don't know that he didn't exist in the beginning."}, {"time": 6963, "text": "So like this could be us in our minds trying to, like just listening to gravitational waves, detecting gravitational waves."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "It's us trying to go back further and further into our memories to try to understand the machines that make up, that make up us."}, {"time": 6983, "text": "And so it's possible that we're trying to grasp at possible kind of what kind of machines could create."}, {"time": 6992, "text": "There's always a tweet."}, {"time": 6996, "text": "If the universe is a computer, then God must have built it because computers need creators."}, {"time": 7003, "text": "And then Joshe Bach replied, since there's

trash each other on Twitter apparently."}, {"time": 7036, "text": "Which part don't you agree with?"}, {"time": 7038, "text": "When he said if existence is default, then many computers exist, this comes back to the inventor and discovery argument."}, {"time": 7046, "text": "I would say the universe at the beginning wasn't capable of computation because there wasn't enough technology, enough states."}, {"time": 7054, "text": "So what you're saying is if God is a mechanism, so I might actually agree, but then the thing is lots of people see God as more than a mechanism."}, {"time": 7064, "text": "For me, God could be the causal graph in assembly theory that creates all the stuff that the memories we know."}, {"time": 7070, "text": "And the fact that we can even relate to each other is because we have the same, we share that heritage."}, {"time": 7074, "text": "And why we love each other or we like to see God in each other is it's just we know we have a shared existence."}, {"time":

creates."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "And if it's just the mechanism, we won't be able to communicate with the objects it creates."}, {"time": 7103, "text": "It can only create."}, {"time": 7104,

spark, yeah."}, {"time": 7117, "text": "But I think I liked your analogy of the machine and the rules, right?"}, {"time": 7122, "text": "But I think part of the problem is, I mean, we have this conception that we can disentangle the rules from the physical substrate, right?"}, {"time": 7131, "text": "And that's the whole thing about software and hardware being separate or the way Newton wrote his laws that there was some, like they exist outside the universe."}, {"time": 7138, "text": "They're not actually a feature of the universe."}, {"time": 7140, "text": "They don't have to emerge out of the universe itself."}, {"time": 7143, "text": "So I think if you merge your two views, then it gets back to the God is the universe."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "And then I think the deeper question is why does it seem like there's meaning and purpose?"}, {"time": 7152, "text": "And if I think about the features of the universe that give it the most meaning and purpose, those are what we would call the living components of the universe."}, {"time": 7161, "text": "So if you wanted to say God is a physically real thing, which you were saying is like an emergent property of our minds, but I would just say the way the universe creates meaning and purpose, there is really a physics there."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "It's not like a illusory thing."}, {"time": 7175, "text": "And that is just what the physics of life is."}, {"time": 7179, "text": "Is it possible that we've forgotten much of the mechanisms that created the universe?"}, {"time": 7185, "text": "So like, so basically, you know, whatever, if God is that mechanism, we just leave parts of that behind."}, {"time": 7192, "text": "Well, but the universe is constantly generating itself."}, {"time": 7194, "text": "So if God is that mechanism, it would be that that would still be active today."}, {"time": 7198, "text": "I don't, like, I'm agnostic, but if I recall the things I believe in God in the way that some people talk about God, I would say that God is, you know, like in the universe now, it's not an absent thing."}, {"time": 7216, "text": "So I think there's a mislabeling here because you're, I mean, I mean, I'm a professional idiot, actually, but, but, um."}, {"time": 7227, "text": "You should put that on your CV."}, {"time": 7230, "text": "Professionally, not recreationally or amateur, but professionally, you're paid for it."}, {"time": 7236, "text": "I would say if you were talking about God, I mean, again, I'm way out, way out of my depth here, and I almost feel uncomfortable."}, {"time": 7241, "text": "Yeah, but I feel quite uncomfortable articulating, but I'll try."}, {"time": 7245, "text": "For me, a lot of people that think of God as a consciousness and a reasoning entity that actually has causal power, and you're, and so you're, it's like, then you're saying like gravity could be God or time could be God."}, {"time": 7258, "text": "I mean, I think for me, for my conception of time is probably as fundamental as God because it gave rise to human intelligence and consciousness in which we can have this abstract notion of God."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "So I think that you're maybe talking about God in a very mechanistic, kind of unsophisticated sense, whereas other people say that God is more sophisticated and got all this, you know, feelings and love and, you know, and this abstracting ability."}, {"time": 7287, "text": "So is that what, or do you mean that?"}, {"time": 7289, "text": "Do you mean God as in this conscious entity that decided to flick the universe into existence?"}, {"time": 7296, "text": "Well, one of the features that God would have is the ability to flick the universe into existence."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "I, you know, like Windows 95, I don't know if God is Windows 95 or Windows XP or Windows 10, I don't know the full feature set."}, {"time": 7315, "text": "So at the very least, you have to flick the universe into existence, and then other features might include ability to interact with that universe in interesting ways, and then how do you interact with the universe in interesting ways?"}, {"time": 7331, "text": "You have to be able to speak the language of its different components."}, {"time": 7335, "text": "So in order to interact with humans, you have to know how to act humanlike."}, {"time": 7344,

inject."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "Like God was lonely?"}, {"time": 7366, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it could be just a teenager and another just playing a video game."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "Well, I was gonna say, I mean, I don't, so this is referring to our origin of life engine."}, {"time": 7377, "text": "It's like, I don't believe in God, but that doesn't mean I don't wanna be one."}, {"time":

there is."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "I mean, like when you have children, you're like one of the magical things of that is you're kind of mini gods."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "I mean, first of all,

7698, "text": "But there was something that would be different in their future."}, {"time": 7701, "text": "And there was a symmetry breaking you observe in the present based on that possibility of that future outcome."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "Then you could say that that system had some representation of some kind of goal in mind about what it wanted to do in the future."}, {"time": 7713, "text": "And I, so goals are interesting because they don't exist as instantaneous things."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "They exist across time, which is one of the reasons that assembly theories may be more naturally able to account for the existence of goals."}, {"time": 7728, "text": "So goals are, they only exist in time, or they manifest themselves in time through, you said, symmetry breaking."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "So it's almost like, imagine, like if representations in your mind are real, right?"}, {"time": 7745, "text": "And you can imagine future possibilities, but imagine everything else is physically equivalent."}, {"time": 7751, "text": "And the only thing that you actually change your decision based on is what you model as being the future outcome."}, {"time": 7757, "text": "Then somehow that representation in your mind of the future outcome becomes causal to what you're doing now."}, {"time": 7762, "text": "So there's kind of like retro causal effect, but it's not actually retro causal."}, {"time": 7765, "text": "It's just that your assembly space is actually includes those possibilities as part of the structure."}, {"time": 7772, "text": "It's just, you're not observing all the features of the assembly space in the current moment."}, {"time": 7776, "text": "Or the possibilities exist, but they don't become a goal until they're realized."}, {"time": 7782, "text": "So one of the features of assembly space that's super interesting, and it's easier to envision with like Legos, for example, is if you're thinking about an assembly space, you can't observe the entire assembly space in any instant in time."}, {"time": 7794, "text": "So if you imagine a stack of Legos, and you wanna look at the assembly space of a stack of Legos, you have to break the Legos apart, and then you look at all the possible ways of building up the original object."}, {"time": 7805, "text": "So now you have in your mind the goal of building that object, and you have all the possible ways of doing it."}, {"time": 7810, "text": "And those are actual physical features of that object, but that object doesn't always exist."}, {"time": 7814, "text": "What exists is the possibility of generating it."}, {"time": 7817, "text": "And the possibilities are always infinite."}, {"time": 7820, "text": "Well, for that particular object, like it has a well defined assembly space."}, {"time": 7825, "text": "And I guess what I'm saying is that object is the assembly space, but you actually have to unpack that object across time to view that feature of it."}, {"time": 7833, "text": "It's only an observable across time."}, {"time": 7835, "text": "The term goal is such a important and difficult to explain concept, right?"}, {"time": 7841, "text": "Because what you want is a way is like, I think only conscious beings can have conscious goals."}, {"time": 7849, "text": "Everything else is doing selection."}, {"time": 7851, "text": "And but selection does invent goals."}, {"time": 7853, "text": "And in a way that the way that biology reinterprets the past in the present is kind of helped you to understand there was a goal in the past now, right?"}, {"time": 7865, "text": "It's kind of like goals only exist back in time."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "So first of all, only conscious beings can have conscious goals."}, {"time": 7877, "text": "I'm not even gonna touch that one."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "Go for it, come on."}, {"time": 7883, "text": "The line between conscious goals and non conscious goals, exactly."}, {"time": 7888, "text": "And also maybe just on top of that, you said a Turing test for goal directed behavior."}, {"time": 7893, "text": "What does a Turing test potentially look like?"}, {"time": 7899, "text": "So if you've got two objects, we were thinking about this."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "So we actually got some funding to work to go on two teams."}, {"time": 7903, "text": "So I'm trying to do, and part of this is I'm trying to do a bit of theory and Sarah is teaching me a bit of theory and Sarah is trying to design experiments and I'm teaching experiments."}, {"time": 7912, "text":

{"time": 7922, "text": "Yeah, and I can explain why we wouldn't want to call it a Turing test after, but Dan Dennett."}, {"time": 7925, "text": "So Dan Dennett wrote this really nice essay about herding cats and freewill inflation."}, {"time": 7932, "text": "The title is so brilliant."}, {"time": 7934, "text": "That's the actual title?"}, {"time": 7934, "text": "That's the title, yeah."}, {"time": 7935, "text": "Herding cats and freewill inflation."}, {"time": 7939, "text": "I mean, it's not, maybe not."}, {"time": 7942, "text": "So if you've got a, let's imagine you've got two objects on a hillside, okay?"}, {"time": 7946, "text": "And it just happens to be a snowy hill and let's just say you see an object get rolling down the hill."}, {"time": 7951, "text": "Or you, and the rock rolls down the hill but the start goes to the end."}, {"time": 7956, "text": "How do you know that object's had a goal?"}, {"time": 7958, "text": "Now you unveil the object and you'll see it's actually a skier."}, {"time": 7961, "text": "And the skier starts at the top and goes down the bottom."}, {"time": 7965, "text": "Then you look at the rock."}, {"time": 7966, "text": "Rock rolls down the hill and goes to the bottom."}, {"time": 7968, "text": "How can you tell the difference between the two?"}, {"time": 7971, "text": "So, and what Dan says is like, well, this is clear."}, {"time": 7974, "text": "The skier's in control."}, {"time": 7976, "text": "And because they're adjusting the trajectory, so there's some updating going on."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "Then the only way you could really do that is if you put the skier back to the top of the hill again, they would tend to start roughly in the same space and probably take all that complex set of trajectories and end up pretty much at the same finish point, right?"}, {"time": 7992, "text": "With plus or minus a few meters."}, {"time": 7993, "text": "Whereas if it was just a random rock going down to a random trajectory, that wouldn't happen."}, {"time": 7998, "text": "And so what Sarah and I were kind of doing when we were writing this grant, we were like, we need to somehow instantiate the skier and the rock in an experiment."}, {"time": 8007, "text": "And then say, okay, when does the object, so for an object to have a goal, it has to have an update."}, {"time": 8014, "text": "It has to have some sensing and some kind of, you know, inbuilt actuation to respond to the environment."}, {"time": 8021, "text": "And then we just have to iterate on that."}, {"time": 8024, "text": "And maybe Sarah, you can then fill in the Turing test part."}, {"time": 8027, "text": "Well, yeah, I guess the motivation for me was slightly different."}, {"time": 8030, "text": "So I get really frustrated about conversations about consciousness as most people do."}, {"time": 8034, "text": "You know, a lot of people are, which is not necessarily related to free will directly or to this goal directed behavior."}, {"time": 8041, "text": "But I think there's a whole set of bundled and related topics here."}, {"time": 8044, "text": "But I think for me, I was, you know, everybody's always interested in explaining intrinsic experience and quantifying intrinsic experience."}, {"time": 8052, "text": "And there's all sorts of problems with that because you can never actually be another physical system."}, {"time": 8057, "text": "So you can't know what it's like to be another physical system."}, {"time": 8060, "text": "So I always thought there must be some way of getting at this problem about if an agent or an entity is conscious or at least has internal representations and those are real physical things, that it must have causal consequences."}, {"time": 8074, "text": "So the way I would ask the question of consciousness is not, you know, what is it like intrinsically?"}, {"time": 8080, "text": "But if things have intrinsic experience, is there any observable difference from the outside about the kind of causation that that physical system would enact in?"}, {"time": 8090, "text": "And for me, the most interesting thing that humans do is have imagination."}, {"time": 8093, "text": "So like we can imagine rockets centuries before we build them."}, {"time": 8097, "text": "They've become real physical things because we imagine them."}, {"time": 8100, "text": "And people might disentangle that from conscious experience, but I think a lot of the sort of imagination we do is actually a conscious process."}, {"time": 8106, "text": "So then this becomes a question of if I were observing systems and I said, one had an internal representation, which is slightly different than a conscious experience, obviously."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "So I'm entangling some concepts, but it's a loose set of thought experiments."}, {"time": 8122, "text": "Then how, and I set them up in a physically equivalent situation."}, {"time": 8128, "text": "Would it be the case that there would be experimental observables associated with it?"}, {"time": 8134, "text": "And that became the idea of trying to actually measure for internal representation and conscious."}, {"time": 8140, "text": "So Turing basically didn't wanna do that."}, {"time": 8142, "text": "You just wanted the machine that could emulate and trick you into having the behavior, but never dealt with the internal experience because he didn't know how to do that."}, {"time": 8151, "text": "And I guess I was wondering, is there a way to set up the experiment where you could actually test for that?"}, {"time": 8157, "text": "For imagination that led to the thing."}, {"time": 8160, "text": "That there was something internal going on, some kind of inner world, as people say, or you could say, it actually is an agent, it's making decisions, it has an internal representation."}, {"time": 8173, "text": "And whether you say that's experience or not is a different thing, but at least the feature that there's some abstraction it's doing that's not obvious from looking at the physical substrates."}, {"time": 8183, "text": "Do you think it's possible to do that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 8185, "text": "One of the compelling things about the Turing test is that defining intelligence, defining any complicated concept as a thing like observing it from the surface and not caring about what's going on deep inside because how do you know?"}, {"time": 8203, "text": "So the idea is exactly that."}, {"time": 8231, "text": "But then what we wanna try and do is train the oil droplets to be like crabs, give them an internal representation, give them the ability to integrate information from the environment so they remember the past, are in the present, and can imagine a future."}, {"time": 8251, "text": "And in a very limited way, their kind of game engine, their limited simulation of the world allows them to then make a decision."}, {"time": 8258, "text": "They're objects across time."}, {"time":

cats, in the title by Daniel Dennett, Herding Cats and the Free Will Inflation."}, {"time": 8286, "text": "So, I love this."}, {"time": 8287, "text": "What does herding cats mean, what does free will inflation mean?"}, {"time": 8290, "text": "So this, I love this essay, because it explained to me how I can live in a deterministic universe, but have, not free will, but have freedom."}, {"time": 8304, "text": "And also it helped me explain that time needed to be a real thing in this universe."}, {"time": 8310, "text": "So what basically Dan was saying here is like, how do you, how do these cats appear to just do what they want, right?"}, {"time": 8318, "text": "And if you live in a deterministic universe, why do the cats do these things?"}, {"time": 8323, "text": "You know, aren't they just, isn't it all obvious?"}, {"time": 8326, "text": "And how does free will inflate the universe?"}, {"time": 8328, "text": "And for me, I mean, probably I love the essay because my interpretation of the essay in assembly theory makes complete sense."}, {"time": 8337, "text": "Because you need an expanding universe in assembly theory to create novelty that you search for, that then when you find something interesting and you keep doing it because it's cool and it gives you an advantage, then it appears in the past to be a goal."}, {"time": 8355, "text": "So what does, in assembly theory, the expansion of the universe look like?"}, {"time": 8362, "text": "Why does the expansion of the universe give you more possibilities of novelty and cool stuff?"}, {"time": 8370, "text": "So for me, I don't think about the universe in terms of big bang and space."}, {"time": 8374, "text": "I think about it in terms of the big memory expansion."}, {"time": 8377, "text": "That you have one, you only have the ability to store one bit of information, so then you can't do very much."}, {"time": 8383, "text": "So what the universe has been doing since forever, it's been creating more, it's been increasing the size of its RAM, okay?"}, {"time": 8393, "text": "So it's like one megabyte, two megabyte, three megabyte, four megabytes, all the way up."}, {"time": 8397, "text": "And so the more RAM you have, the more you can remember about the past, which allows you to do cooler things in the future."}, {"time": 8407, "text": "So if you can remember how to launch a rocket, then you might be able to imagine how to land a rocket, and then relaunch, reland, and carry on."}, {"time": 8415, "text": "And so you're able to expand the space and remember the past."}, {"time": 8421, "text": "And so that's why I think it's very important."}, {"time": 8423, "text": "But not a perfect memory."}, {"time": 8425, "text": "It's an interesting question, whether there's some forgetting that happens that might increase."}, {"time": 8430, "text": "Is the expansion of the forgetting, at some point, accelerate faster than the remembering?"}, {"time": 8459, "text": "Arguably, the way that we come up with new physical laws."}, {"time": 8462, "text": "I think that there is a great deal to be gained from having the ability to remember things, but then when you forget them, you can then have a, you can basically do the simulation again and work out if you get to that compressed representation."}, {"time": 8483, "text": "So that's in cycles."}, {"time": 8485, "text": "So cycles of remembering and forgetting are probably important, but there shouldn't be excuse to have a universe with no memory in it."}, {"time": 8494, "text": "The universe is gonna remember that it forgot, but just not tell you."}, {"time": 8500, "text": "I'm looking at this paper and it's talking about a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet,

about time quite a bit."}, {"time": 8528, "text": "What is time in all of this?"}, {"time": 8530, "text": "We kind of mentioned it a bunch."}, {"time": 8533, "text": "Is it not important at all in

talked about like memories."}, {"time": 8544, "text": "Is that the fundamental thing that we should be thinking about?"}, {"time": 8546, "text": "And time is just a useful measurement device or something like that."}, {"time": 8550, "text": "Well, there's different concepts of time, right?"}, {"time": 8552, "text": "So I think in assembly theory, when we're talking about time, we're talking about the ordering of things."}, {"time": 8556, "text": "So that's the causal graph part."}, {"time": 8558, "text": "And so then the fundamental structure of the universe is that there is a certain ordering and certain things can't happen till other things happen."}, {"time": 8564, "text": "But usually when we colloquially talk about time, we're talking about the flow of time."}, {"time": 8571,

time, but that when the universe is updating, it's transitioning between things that exist now and things that exist now."}, {"time": 8589, "text": "That's really the flow of time."}, {"time": 8591, "text": "So you have to separate out those concepts at bare minimum."}, {"time": 8595, "text": "And then there's also an arrow of time that people talk about in physics, which is that time doesn't appear to have a directionality in fundamental physics, but it does to us, right?"}, {"time": 8605, "text": "Like we can't go backwards in time."}, {"time": 8606, "text": "And usually that would be explained in physics in terms of, well, there's a cosmological arrow of time, but there's also the thermodynamic arrow of time of increasing entropy."}, {"time": 8616, "text": "But what we would say in assembly theory is that there is a clear directionality."}, {"time": 8619, "text": "The universe only runs in one direction, which is why some things, it's easy to make, if the universe runs in one direction, it's easy to make processes look reversible."}, {"time": 8627, "text": "For example, if they have no memory, they're easy to run forward and backwards, which is why the laws of physics that we have now look the way they do, because they involve objects that have no memory."}, {"time": 8636, "text": "But when you get to things like us, it becomes very clear that the universe has a directionality associated to it."}, {"time": 8641, "text": "So it's not reversible at all."}, {"time": 8643, "text": "It's the no man ever steps in the same river."}, {"time": 8646, "text": "I just have to bring that out because you walked on the river."}, {"time": 8648, "text": "No man ever steps in the same river twice before he's not the same river and he's not the same man."}, {"time": 8654,

being fundamental and the irreversibility as being emergent."}, {"time": 8663, "text": "But I think what we would say from how we think about it, and it certainly seems to be the case for our

experimentally to be proof that time, as I've labeled it, is fundamental and exists as a physical thing that creates space."}, {"time": 8974, "text": "Okay, so if you can prove that novelty is always being created, you're saying that it's possible to also then prove that it's always expanding in the state space."}, {"time": 8985, "text": "Those are things that have to be proven."}, {"time": 8988,

there's a lot."}, {"time": 9060, "text": "I think what I'm interested in as far as the phenomena of free will is, do we have individual autonomy and agency?"}, {"time": 9070, "text": "And when I do things, is it really me or is it my atoms that did it?"}, {"time": 9076, "text": "And that's the part that's interesting to me."}, {"time": 9079, "text": "I guess there's also the determinism versus randomness part."}, {"time": 9083, "text": "But the way I think about it is like each of us are like a thread or like an assembly space through this giant possibility space."}, {"time": 9093, "text": "And it's like we're moving on our own trajectory through that space and that is defined by our history."}, {"time": 9099, "text": "So we're sort of causally contingent on our past, but also because of the sort of intersection of novelty generation, it's not completely predetermined by the past."}, {"time": 9112, "text": "And so then you have the causal control of the determinism part that you are your causal history and there's some determinism from that past, but there's also room for creativity."}, {"time": 9124, "text": "And I think it's actually necessary that something like free will exists if the universe is gonna be as creative as possible."}, {"time": 9163, "text": "And it's intrinsic and local property of that system."}, {"time": 9166, "text": "There's a greater number of

9179, "text": "So causal power, the word consciousness, is the causal power somehow correlated with consciousness?"}, {"time": 9185, "text": "I mean, that's why I have this conception of consciousness being related to imagination, because the more that we can imagine can happen and the more counterfactual possibilities you have in mind, the more you can actually implement."}, {"time": 9196, "text": "And somehow free will is also at the intersection of the counterfactual becoming the actual."}, {"time": 9201, "text": "So can you elaborate on that a little bit, that consciousness is imagination?"}, {"time": 9205, "text": "I don't know exactly how to articulate it, and I'm sure people will aim at certain things I'm saying, but I think the language is really imprecise, so I'm not the best way to."}, {"time": 9215, "text": "It's really interesting, like what is imagination and what role does it play in the human experience, in the experience of any agent?"}, {"time": 9224, "text": "Yes, I love imagination."}, {"time": 9226, "text": "I think it's like the most amazing thing we do."}, {"time": 9229, "text": "But I guess one way I would think about it is, we talked about the transition to life being the universe acquiring memory, and life does something really interesting."}, {"time": 9236, "text": "You just think about biology generally."}, {"time": 9238, "text": "It remembers states of the past to adapt to things that happen in the future."}, {"time": 9241, "text": "So the longer life has evolved on this planet, the deeper that past is, the more memory we have, the more kinds of organisms and things."}, {"time": 9248, "text": "But what human level intelligence has done is quite different."}, {"time": 9252, "text": "It's not just that we remember states that the universe has existed in before, it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed, and we can actually make them come into existence."}, {"time": 9262, "text": "And I think that's the most unique feature about the transition to whatever we are from what life on this planet has been doing for the last four billion years."}, {"time": 9272, "text": "And I think it's deeply related to the phenomenon we call consciousness."}, {"time": 9274, "text": "Yeah, I was gonna, I mean, just agree with that."}, {"time": 9276, "text": "I think that consciousness is the ability to generate those counterfactuals."}, {"time": 9280, "text": "Now, whether you can say, you know, are there degrees of consciousness?"}, {"time": 9283, "text": "I mean, I'm sorry, panpsychist, but electrons don't have counterfactuals, although they do have some kind of, they are able to search a space and pathways."}, {"time": 9293, "text": "But I think that there is a very concrete, or concrete, there's a very specific property that humans have, and I don't know if it's unique to humans."}, {"time": 9305, "text": "I mean, maybe dogs can do it, and birds can do it, right?"}, {"time": 9309, "text": "And where they are basically solving a problem, because consciousness was invented, or this abstraction was invented by evolution for a specific reason."}, {"time": 9319, "text": "And so look, one of the reasons why I came to the conclusion that time was fundamental was actually because Sarah and I had a completely different."}, {"time": 9330, "text": "The most heated debate on Skype chat ever."}, {"time": 9332, "text": "No, no, no, we had to, I was like."}, {"time": 9334, "text": "Stop it."}, {"time": 9335, "text": "No, no, it goes back to the free will thing."}, {"time": 9337, "text": "So I think that, although I've changed my view a bit, because there's some really interesting physicists out there who talks about how the measurement problem in Newtonian space, but I don't want to go there just now, because I think I'll mess it up."}, {"time": 9350, "text": "But briefly, I could not see how the universe, how we can have free will."}, {"time": 9356, "text": "And I mean, this is really boring, because this is like, this is a well trodden path, but I mean, not so boring."}, {"time": 9361, "text": "I suppose it's kind of, we just want to be precise."}, {"time": 9364, "text": "If the universe is deterministic, how can we have free will, right?"}, {"time": 9367, "text": "So Sarah's a physicist."}, {"time": 9371, "text": "I think she, not believe, can show that most of the laws we have are deterministic to some degree."}, {"time": 9377, "text": "Quantum mechanics onto Newtonian stuff."}, {"time": 9380, "text": "And yet there's Sarah telling me she believes in free will."}, {"time": 9382, "text": "And I'm like, your belief system's broken here, right?"}, {"time": 9386, "text": "Because you're demanding free will in a deterministic universe."}, {"time": 9392, "text": "And then I realized that I agreed with her that I do think that free will is a thing because we are able to search for novelty."}, {"time": 9401, "text": "And then that's where I came to the conclusion that time, the universe is expanding in terms of novelty."}, {"time": 9406, "text": "And it goes back to that Dan Dennett essay that we're talking about, the free will inflation."},

you are the, there was no past."}, {"time": 9421, "text": "There is only present."}, {"time": 9423, "text": "So that means you are the sum total."}, {"time": 9425, "text": "Everything that's occurs in the past is manifestly here in the present."}, {"time": 9429, "text": "And then you have this little echo state in your consciousness because you're able to, you're able to imagine something without actualization."}, {"time": 9438, "text": "But the fact you imagine it, that occurs in electrons and potassium ion flows in your neural network in your brain."}, {"time": 9444, "text": "Maybe consciousness is just the present."}, {"time": 9447, "text": "So somehow you imagine that, and then by imagining, oh, that's good, yeah."}, {"time": 9453, "text": "I'm gonna make a robot to do this thing and program it."}, {"time": 9456, "text": "And then you physically then go and do it."}, {"time": 9459, "text": "So that then changes the future, sorry."}, {"time": 9462, "text": "What's imagination?"}, {"time": 9464, "text": "Does it require the past?"}, {"time": 9466, "text": "Does it require the future?"}, {"time": 9467, "text": "Does it require memory?"}, {"time": 9468, "text": "Does it?"}, {"time": 9469, "text": "It's imagination."}, {"time": 9471, "text": "Does it only exist in the moment?"}, {"time": 9473, "text": "So imagination is, well, yeah, probably it's an instantaneous readout of what's going on."}, {"time": 9479, "text": "You can maybe, your subconscious brain has been generating all the bits for it, but no, imagination occurs when you, in your game engine, you remember the past and you integrate sensory to the present and you try and work out what you want to do in the future."}, {"time": 9494, "text": "And then you go and make that happen."}, {"time": 9496, "text": "So the imagination is this, it's like, imagine, asking what imagination is about, asking what surfing is."}, {"time": 9502, "text": "You can see, you can surfboard, surfer, wave coming in."}, {"time": 9506, "text": "When you're on that wave and you're surfing, that's where the imagination is."}, {"time": 9511, "text": "I think imagination is just accessing things that aren't the present moment in the present moment."}, {"time": 9516, "text": "So like I'm sitting here and I'm looking at the table and I can imagine the river and things or whatever it was."}, {"time": 9523, "text": "And so it seems to be that it's like, it's our ability to access things that aren't present."}, {"time": 9530, "text": "So conjure up worlds, some of them might be akin to something that happened to you recently."}, {"time": 9537, "text": "Right, but they don't have to be things that actually happened in your past."}, {"time": 9540, "text": "And I think this gets back to assembly theory."}, {"time": 9542, "text": "Like the way I would think about imagination from an assembly theoretic standpoint is I'm a giant causal graph and I exist in a present moment as a particular configuration of Sarah."}, {"time": 9555, "text": "But there's a lot of, I carry a lot of evolutionary baggage."}, {"time": 9558, "text": "I have that whole causal history and I can access parts of it."}, {"time": 9590, "text": "This goes back to your point that we actually have to explain why things actually even look like objects and aren't just a smear of mass."}, {"time": 9600, "text": "And just on the free will and physics thing, when you were talking, I was, I just wanna bring this up because I think it's a really interesting viewpoint that Nicholas Jisen has that, you know, like we wanna use the laws of physics and then say you can't have free will."}, {"time": 9612, "text": "And his point is you have to have free will in order to even choose to set up an experiment to test the laws of physics."}, {"time": 9618, "text": "So in some sense, free will should be more fundamental than physics is because to even do science, there's some assumption that the agents have free will."}, {"time": 9649, "text": "So this kind of dream of physics that you can do multiple experiments, different locations and then validate each other, you're saying that's an illusion?"}, {"time": 9659, "text": "No, I'm saying that requires decision making and free will to be a real thing, I think."}, {"time": 9664, "text": "Like I think the fact that we can do science is not arbitrary."}, {"time": 9668, "text": "And I think people, you know, the standard canon in physics would be, well, you could trace all of that back to the initial condition of the universe, but the whole point of science is I can imagine doing the experiment and I can do it and then I can do it again and again and again all over the planet."}, {"time": 9680, "text": "To you, imagination is somehow fundamentally generative of novelty."}, {"time": 9685, "text": "So it's not like the universe could have predicted the things you imagined."}, {"time": 9688, "text": "Imagination, so coming back to novelty, I think novelty can exist outside of imagination, but it supercharges it, it's another transition, I think."}, {"time": 9696, "text": "I mean, I would say, I mean, this may be a boring statement, but I would say the fact that, sorry?"}, {"time": 9700, "text": "I'm not sure, these are hard questions."}, {"time": 9702, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that objects exist is yet another proof that time is fundamental and novelty exists, right?"}, {"time": 9710, "text": "Because I think, again, if you ask a physicist to write down in their infinite Bible of the universe, let's call it the Bible, the Mac, you know."}, {"time": 9719, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, the mathematical universe, whether you're Max Tegmark or Sean Carroll or Frank Wilczek."}, {"time": 9728, "text":

"text": "It's really interesting that they cope with the enormity of the universe by saying, well, it's all there, mathematics, it all exists, right?"}, {"time": 9742, "text": "And I would say that that's why I'm excited about the future of the universe because although it is somehow dependent upon the past, it is not constrained just by the past, which is kind of mad."}, {"time": 9758, "text":

just dependent, this moment is the past, and yet it has the capacity to generate a totally unpredictable future."}, {"time": 9772, "text": "I mean, the other thing I would say that's super important for human beings, right?"}, {"time": 9776, "text": "Human beings have actually very little causal control in the future."}, {"time": 9780, "text": "I realized this the other week."}, {"time": 9782, "text": "Oh, the immediate future immediately."}, {"time": 9783, "text": "Yeah, yeah, so what happened, so this is what I think it is."}, {"time": 9786, "text": "The way, by reinterpreting your past, I mean, talk about from a kind of cognitive, psychological cognitive point of view, by reinterpreting your past in your current mind, you could actually help you shape your future again."}, {"time": 9801, "text": "So you have much more freedom to interpret your past, to act in the present, to change your future, than you do to change your future."}, {"time": 9809, "text": "It may sound weird, so I'm saying to everybody, imagine your past, think about your past, reinterpret your past in the nicest way you can, then imagine what you can do next, or imagine your past in a more negative way and what you do next, and look at those two counterfactuals, they're different."}, {"time": 9826, "text": "I mean, Daniel Kahneman talks about this that most of our life is lived in our memories."},

"text": "Choices are made in your imagination, and that results in you basically able to control how the future unrolls, because you're like, imagining, like reinterpreting constantly the things that happen to you."}, {"time": 9851, "text": "Exactly, so if you want to increase your amount of free will, those people that have, I don't think everyone has equal amounts of agency, because of our sad constraints, where they're happenstance, health, economic, born in a certain place, right?"}, {"time": 9869, "text": "But those of us that have the ability to go back and reinterpret our past and use that to change the future are the ones that exert most agency in the present, and I want to achieve higher degrees of agency and enable everyone else to do that as well, to have more fun in the universe."}, {"time": 9891, "text": "Then we'll hit that peak, the maximum fun point."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "I don't think there's ever gonna be a maximum, I think the wonderful thing about the future is there's always gonna be more fun."}, {"time": 9927, "text": "Anyway, speaking of fun, let me ask you about alien sightings."}, {"time": 9932, "text": "So there's been quite a bit of UFO

something."}, {"time": 10025, "text": "And now it's like, you know, our technology picks up an anomaly or someone sees something, we say it's aliens."}, {"time": 10031, "text": "And I think the real

think I've got to get around your argument."}, {"time": 10286, "text": "Yeah, let's say that on this planet, there's just like, there's lots of available chemistry and one life form gets some emerges

theories of quantum mechanics and gravity and they're supposed to be like our most fundamental theories right now."}, {"time": 13029, "text": "And they describe things like the interaction of massive

was quite hilarious actually, because it's like, I have no idea what you're talking about, but I think it sounds right."}, {"time": 13120, "text": "So for me, the most beautiful thing about assembly theory is I realized the assembly theory explains why the universe, why life is the universe developing a memory, but not only that poetically, I could actually go and measure it."}, {"time": 13133,

can then start to quantify the causal consequences."}, {"time": 13148, "text": "Because, I mean, I think as a kind of inventing this together with Sarah and her team, I thought there was a quite a high chance that, we're doing science, there's such a high probability we're wrong on this."}, {"time": 13165, "text": "And I remember kind of trying to go to hard physicists, mathematicians, complexity theorists, and everyone just kind of giving me such a hard time about it."}, {"time": 13178, "text": "And so, this is kind of, you've just done this, you've just done that, you've just recapitulated an old theory."}, {"time": 13185, "text": "And I was unable, I lacked the language to really explain, and I had to, it was a real struggle."}, {"time": 13192, "text": "So this realization that life, what life does that physics cannot understand, or chemistry, is the universe develops a memory that's causally actionable, and then we can measure it, but it isn't just a one thing, there is this intrinsic property of all the objects in the universe."}, {"time": 13209, "text": "Like I've said before, but me holding up this water bottle, it isn't any other water bottle, but

just once or an original idea."}, {"time": 13285, "text": "I mean, it was like, you know, so I think that was cool that we had this idea and we were playing with it."}, {"time": 13291, "text": "And I think also that I kind of, I mean, it took me ages to realize that Sarah had also had the same kind of form, coming towards the same formulation just from a completely different point because I, but

tell people that they should do the thing they're most passionate about."}, {"time": 14083, "text": "But I think a flip side of that is, that's when you become in some way, like not to sound cheesy,

that's like, if I become something, am I finding myself or am I creating myself?"}, {"time": 14154, "text": "And I think those are somehow the same kind of thing."}, {"time": 14158, "text": "I do feel

14286, "text": "Both human beings and the technology we create has the capacity for evil and the capacity for good."}, {"time": 14290, "text": "Yeah, and we can't all be good all the time."}, {"time":

impossible."}, {"time": 14301, "text": "Like you can't get a group of people in a room and have everyone like each other all the time."}, {"time": 14305, "text": "So I think that kind of tension is
