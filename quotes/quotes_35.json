only source of knowledge."}, {"time": 363, "text": "There's no other source of knowledge."}, {"time": 365, "text": "We don't know anything that does not come from our senses and our mind, the integration of the evidence of our senses."}, {"time": 375, "text": "Now we know stuff about ourselves and I think it's important to know oneself through introspection."}, {"time": 379, "text": "And I consider that part of reasoning is to introspect."}, {"time": 385, "text": "But I think reason is undervalued, which is funny to say, because it's our means of survival."}, {"time": 391, "text": "It's how human beings survive."}, {"time": 393, "text": "We cannot, see, this is why I disagree with so many scientists and people like Sam Harris."}, {"time": 398, "text": "You mentioned Sam Harris before the show."}, {"time": 402, "text": "We're not programmed to know how to hunt."}, {"time": 407, "text": "We're not programmed to do agriculture."}, {"time": 409, "text": "We're not programmed to build computers and build networks on which we can podcast and do our shows."}, {"time": 415, "text": "All of that requires effort."}, {"time": 418, "text": "It requires focus."}, {"time": 419, "text": "It requires energy and it requires will."}, {"time": 423, "text": "It requires somebody to will it."}, {"time": 425, "text": "It requires somebody to choose it."}, {"time": 428, "text": "And once you make that choice, you have to engage that choice means that you're choosing to engage your reason in discovery, in integration, and then in work to change the world in which we live."}, {"time": 443, "text": "And human beings have to discover, figure out, solve the problem of hunting."}, {"time": 449, "text": "Hunting, everybody thinks, oh, that's easy."}, {"time": 451, "text": "I've seen the movie."}, {"time": 452, "text": "But human beings had to figure out how to do it, right?"}, {"time": 456, "text": "You can't run down a bison and bite into it, right?"}, {"time": 460, "text": "You're not gonna catch it."}, {"time": 461, "text": "You're not gonna, you have no fangs to bite into it."}, {"time": 464, "text": "You have to build weapons."}, {"time": 465, "text": "You have to build tools."}, {"time": 466, "text": "You have to create traps."}, {"time": 467, "text": "You have to have a strategy."}, {"time": 469, "text": "All of that requires reason."}, {"time": 472, "text": "So the most important thing that allows human beings to survive and to thrive in every value from the most simple to the most sophisticated, from the most material to, I believe, the most spiritual, requires thinking."}, {"time": 486, "text": "So stopping and appreciating the moment is something that I think is relatively easy once you have a plan, once you've thought it through, once you know what your values are."}, {"time": 500, "text": "There is a mistake people make."}, {"time": 501, "text": "They attain their values and they don't take a moment to savor that and to appreciate that and to even pat themselves on the back that they did it."}, {"time": 511, "text": "But that's not what's screwing up the world."}, {"time": 513, "text": "What's screwing up the world is that people have the wrong values and they don't think about them and they don't really focus on them and they don't have a plan for their own life and how to live it."}, {"time": 522, "text": "If we look at human nature, you're saying the fundamental big thing that we need to consider is our capacity, like a capability to reason."}, {"time": 531, "text": "So to me, reason is this massive evolutionary achievement in quotes."}, {"time": 538, "text": "If you think about any other sophisticated animal, everything has to be coded."}, {"time": 544, "text": "Everything has to be written in the hard way."}, {"time": 547, "text": "It has to be there."}, {"time": 548, "text": "And they have to have a solution for every outcome."}, {"time": 551, "text": "And if there's no solution, the animal dies typically, or the animal suffers in some way."}, {"time": 555, "text": "Human beings have this capacity to self program."}, {"time": 558, "text": "They have this capacity."}, {"time": 560, "text": "It's not a tabula rasa in the sense that there's nothing there."}, {"time": 565, "text": "Obviously, we have a nature."}, {"time": 566, "text": "Obviously, our minds, our brains are structured in a particular way."}, {"time": 571, "text": "But given that, we have the ability to turn it on or turn it off."}, {"time": 577, "text": "We have the ability to commit suicide, to reject our nature, to work against our interests, not to use the tool that evolution has provided us, which is this mind, which is reason."}, {"time": 590, "text": "So that choice, that fundamental choice, you know, Hamlet says it, right, to be or not to be."}, {"time": 598, "text": "But to be or not to be is to think or not to think, to engage or not to engage, to focus or not to focus."}, {"time": 605, "text": "You know, in the morning when you get up, you kind of, you know, you're not really completely there."}, {"time": 610, "text": "You're kind of out of focus and stuff."}, {"time": 612, "text": "It requires an act of will to say, okay, I'm awake, I've got stuff to do."}, {"time": 617, "text": "Some people never do that."}, {"time": 619, "text": "Some people live in that haze, and they never engage that mind."}, {"time": 623, "text": "And when you're sitting and try to solve a complex computer problem or math problem, you have to turn something on."}, {"time": 631, "text": "You have to, in a sense, exert certain energy to focus on the problem to do it."}, {"time": 638, "text": "And that is not determined in a sense that you have to focus."}, {"time": 643, "text": "You choose to focus, and you could choose not to focus."}, {"time": 646, "text": "And that choice is more powerful than any other, like, parts of our brain that we've borrowed from fish and from our evolutionary origins."}, {"time": 654, "text": "Like this, whatever this crazy little leap in evolution is that allowed us to think is more powerful than anything else."}, {"time": 660, "text": "So I think neuroscientists pretend they know a lot more about the brain than they really do."}, {"time": 669, "text": "And that we know."}, {"time": 672, "text": "And we don't know that much yet about how the brain functions and what's a fish and what, you know, all this stuff."}, {"time": 678, "text": "So I think what exists there is a lot of potentialities."}, {"time": 684, "text": "But the beauty of the human brain is it's potentialities that we have to manifest through our choices."}, {"time": 692, "text": "It's sitting there."}, {"time": 694, "text": "And, yes, there's certain things that are going to evoke certain senses, certain feelings."}, {"time": 702, "text": "I'm not even saying emotions because I think emotions are too complex to have been programmed into our mind."}, {"time": 709, "text": "You know, there's this big issue of evolutionary psychology is huge right now and it's a big issue."}, {"time": 715, "text": "You know, I find it to a large extent as way too early and in storytelling about expo storytelling about stuff."}, {"time": 728, "text": "We still don't, you know, so for example, I would like to see if evolutionary psychology differentiate between things like inclinations, feelings, emotions, sensations, thoughts, concepts, ideas."}, {"time": 743, "text": "What of those are programmed and what of those are developed and chosen and a product of reason?"}, {"time": 749, "text": "I think anything from emotion to abstract ideas is all chosen, is all a product of reason."}, {"time": 756, "text": "And everything before that, we might have been programmed for."}, {"time": 762, "text": "But the fact is so clearly a sensation is not a product of, you know, is something that we feel because that's how our biology works."}, {"time": 770, "text": "So until we have these categories and until we can clearly specify what is what and where do they come from, the whole discussion in evolutionary psychology seems to be rambling."}, {"time": 784, "text": "It doesn't seem to be scientific."}, {"time": 786, "text": "So we have to define our terms, you know, which is the basis of science."}, {"time": 790, "text": "You have to have some clear definitions about what we're talking about."}, {"time": 794, "text": "When you ask them these questions, there's never really a coherent answer about what is it exactly."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And everybody is afraid of the issue of free will."}, {"time": 802, "text": "And I think to some extent, I mean, Harris has this, and I don't want to misrepresent anything Harris has because, you know, I'm a fan and I like a lot of his stuff."}, {"time": 813, "text": "But on the one hand, he is obviously intellectually active and wants to change our minds."}, {"time": 818, "text": "So he believes that we have some capacity to choose."}, {"time": 821, "text": "On the other hand, he's undermining that capacity to choose by saying it's just determines you're gonna choose what you choose."}, {"time": 827, "text": "You have no say in it, there's actually no you."}, {"time": 831, "text": "So it's, you know, and that's to me completely unscientific."}, {"time": 835, "text": "That's completely him, you know, pulling it out of nowhere."}, {"time": 840, "text": "We all experienced the fact that we have an eye."}, {"time": 843, "text": "That kind of certainty saying that we do not have that fundamental choice that reason provides is unfounded currently."}, {"time": 852, "text": "Look, there's a sense in which it can never be contradicted because it's a product of your experience."}, {"time": 860, "text": "It's not a product of your experience."}, {"time": 861, "text": "You can experience it directly."}, {"time": 864, "text": "So no science will ever prove that this table isn't here."}, {"time": 869, "text": "I can see it, it's here, right?"}, {"time": 871, "text": "I can feel it."}, {"time": 873, "text": "I know I have free will because I can introspect it."}, {"time": 876, "text": "In a sense, I can see it."}, {"time": 877, "text": "I can see myself engaging it and that is as valid as the evidence of my senses."}, {"time": 887, "text": "Now I can't point at it so that you can see the same thing I'm seeing, but you can do the same thing in your own consciousness and you can identify the same thing."}, {"time": 895, "text": "And to deny that in the name of science is to get things upside down."}, {"time": 900, "text": "You start with that and that's the beginning of science."}, {"time": 904, "text": "The beginning of science is the identification that I choose and that I can reason and now I need to figure out the mechanism, the rules of reasoning, the rules of logic."}, {"time": 916, "text": "How does this work?"}, {"time": 917, "text": "And that's where science comes from."}, {"time": 919, "text": "Of course, it's possible that science, like from my place of AI would be able to, if we were able to engineer consciousness or understand, I mean, it's very difficult because we're so far away from it now, but understand how the actual mechanism that consciousness emerges."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And in fact, this table is not real, that we can determine that it, exactly how our mind constructs the reality that we perceive, then you can start to make interesting."}, {"time": 951, "text": "But our mind doesn't construct the reality that we perceive."}, {"time": 954, "text": "The reality we perceive is there."}, {"time": 956, "text": "We perceive a reality that exists."}, {"time": 959, "text": "Now, we perceive it in particular ways given the nature of our senses, right?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "A bat perceives this table differently, but it's still the same table with the same characteristics and the same identity."}, {"time": 972, "text": "It's just a matter of, we use eyes, they use a radar system to, they use sound waves to perceive it, but it's still there."}, {"time": 980, "text": "Existence exists whether we exist or not."}, {"time": 982, "text": "And so you could create, I mean, I don't know how, and I don't know if it's possible, but let's say you could create a consciousness, right?"}, {"time": 991, "text": "And I suspect that to do that, you would have to use biology, not just electronics, but way outside my expertise."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "Because consciousness, as far as we know, is a phenomenon of life, and you would have to figure out how to create life before you created consciousness, I think."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "But if you did that, then that wouldn't change anything."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "All it would say is we have another conscious being."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "Cool, that's great."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "But it wouldn't change the nature of our consciousness."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "Our consciousness is what it is in respect."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "So that's very interesting, I think this is a good way to set the table for discussion of objectivism is, let me at least challenge a thought experiment, which is, I don't know if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman's work about reality."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "So his idea is that we're just, our perception is just an interface to reality."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "So Donald Hoffman is the guy you see on Vine?"}, {"time": 1047, "text": "Yes, I've met Donald and I've seen his video."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "And look, Donald has not invented anything new."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "This goes back to ancient philosophy."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Let me just state it in case people aren't familiar."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "I mean, it's a fascinating thought experiment to me, like of out of the box thinking, perhaps literally, is that there's a gap between the world as we perceive it and the world as it actually exists."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "And I think that's, for the philosophy, objectivism is a really important gap to close."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So can you maybe at least try to entertain the idea that there is more to reality than our minds can perceive?"}, {"time": 1089, "text": "Well, I don't understand what more means, right?"}, {"time": 1093, "text": "Of course there's more to reality than what our senses perceive."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "That is, for example, I don't know, certain elements have radiation, right?"}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Uranium has radiation."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "I can't perceive radiation."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "The beauty of human reason is I can, through experimentation, discover the phenomena of radiation, then actually measure radiation."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "And I don't worry about it."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "I can't perceive the world the way a bat perceives the world."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And I might not be able to see certain things, but I can, we've created radar, so A, we understand how a bat perceives the world, and I can mimic it through a radar screen and create images like the bat, its consciousness somehow perceives it, right?"}, {"time": 1135, "text": "So the beauty of human reason is our capacity to understand the world beyond what our senses give us directly."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "At the end, everything comes in through our senses, but we can understand things that our senses don't provide us."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "But what he's doing is he's doing something very different."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "He is saying what our senses provides us might have nothing to do with the reality out there."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "That is just a random, arbitrary, nonsensical statement."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And he actually has a whole evolutionary explanation for it."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "He runs some simulations."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "The simulations seem, I mean, I'm not an expert on this field, but they seem silly to me."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "They don't seem to reflect."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "And look, all he's doing is taking Immanuel Kant's philosophy, which articulate exactly the same cause, and he's giving it a veneer of evolutionary ideas."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "I'm not an expert on evolution, and I'm not an expert on epistemology, which is what this is."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "So to me, as a semi layman, it doesn't make any sense."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "And, you know, I'm actually, you know, I have this Yaron Book Show."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "I don't know if I'm allowed to pitch it, but I've got this Yaron Book Show on YouTube."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "I'm a huge fan of the Yaron Book Show."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "I listen to it very often."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "As a small aside, the cool thing about reason, which you practice, is you have a systematic way of thinking through basically anything."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "And that's so fun to listen to."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "I mean, it's rare that I think there's flaws in your logic, but even then it's fun, because I'm like disagreeing with the screen."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And it's great when somebody disagrees with me and they give good arguments, because that makes it challenging."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "You know, so one of the shows I want to do in the next few weeks is one of my philosophy, bring one of my philosophy friends to discuss the video that Hoffman, where he presents his theory, because it surprises me how seductive it is."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And it seems to be so, first of all, completely counterintuitive, but because, you know, somehow we managed to cross the road and not get hit by the car."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "And if our senses did not provide us any information about what's actually going on in reality, how do we do that?"}, {"time": 1273, "text": "And not to mention build computers, not to mention fly to the moon and actually land on the moon."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "And if reality is not giving us information about the moon, if our senses are not giving us information about the moon, how did we get there?"}, {"time": 1285, "text": "You know, and where did we go?"}, {"time": 1287, "text": "Maybe we didn't go anywhere."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "It's just, it's nonsensical to me."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "And it's a very bad place philosophically, because it basically says there is no objective standard for anything."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "There is no objective reality."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "You can come up with anything."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "You could argue anything."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "And there's no methodology, right?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "My, I believe that at the end of the day, what reason allows us to do is provides us with a methodology for truth."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "And at the end of the day, for every claim that I make, I should be able to boil it down to see, yeah, look, the evidence of the census is right then."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "Once you take that away, knowledge is gone and truth is gone."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "And that opens it up to, you know, complete disaster."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "So, you know, to me why it's compelling to at least entertain this idea, first of all, it shakes up the mind a little bit to force you to go back to first principles and, you know, ask the question, what do I really know?"}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And the second part of that that I really enjoy is it's a reminder that we know very little to be a little bit more humble."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "So if reality doesn't exist at all, before you start thinking about it, I think it's a really nice wake up call to think, wait a minute, I don't really know much about this universe, that humbleness."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "I think something I'd like to ask you about in terms of reason, when you, you can become very confident in your ability to understand the world if you practice reason often."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "And I feel like it can lead you astray because you can start to think, it's, so I love psychology and psychologists have the certainty about understanding the human condition, which is undeserved."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "You know, you run a study with 50 people and you think you can understand the source of all these psychiatric disorders, all these kinds of things."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "That's similar kind of trouble I feel like you can get into when you overreach with reason."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "So I don't think there is such a thing as overreaching with reason, but there are bad applications of reason."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "There are bad uses of reason or the pretense of using reason."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "I think a lot of these psychological studies are pretense of using reason."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "And the psychologists have never really taken a serious stat class or a serious econometrics class."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "So they use statistics in weird ways that just don't make any sense."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "And that's a miss, that's not reason, right?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "That's just bad thinking, right?"}, {"time": 1441, "text": "So I don't think you can do too much good thinking."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "And that's what reason is."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "It's good thinking."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "Now, the fact that you try to use reason does not guarantee you won't make mistakes."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "It doesn't guarantee you won't be wrong."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "It doesn't guarantee you won't go down a rabbit hole and completely get it wrong."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "But it does give you the only existing mechanism to fix it."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "Which is going back to reality, going back to facts, going back to reason."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "And getting out of the rabbit hole and getting back to reality."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "So I agree with you that it's interesting to think about these, what I consider crazy ideas because it, oh wait, what is my argument about them?"}, {"time": 1487, "text": "If I don't really have a good argument about them, then do I know what I know?"}, {"time": 1491, "text": "So in that sense, it's always nice to be challenged and pushed and oriented."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "You know, the nice thing about objectivism is everybody's doing that to me all the time, right?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "Because nobody agrees with me on anything."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "So I'm constantly being challenged, whether it's in, by Hoffman on metaphysics and epistemology, right?"}, {"time": 1508, "text": "On the very foundations of analogy and ethics, everybody constantly, and in politics all the time."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "So I find that it's part of, you know, I prefer that everybody, there's a sense in which I prefer that everybody agreed with me, right?"}, {"time": 1522, "text": "Because I think we'd live in a better world."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "But there's a sense in which that disagreement makes it, at least up to a point, makes it interesting and challenging and forces you to be able to rethink or to confirm your own thinking and to challenge that thinking."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "Can you try to do the impossible task and give a whirlwind introduction to Ayn Rand, the many sides of Ayn Rand?"}, {"time": 1549, "text": "So Ayn Rand the human being, Ayn Rand the novelist, and Ayn Rand the philosopher."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "So who was Ayn Rand?"}, {"time": 1557, "text": "Sure, so her life story is one that I think is fascinating but it also lends itself to this integration of all of these things."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "She was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905 to kind of a middle class family, Jewish family."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "They owned a pharmacy, her father owned a pharmacy."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "And, you know, she grew up, she grew up, she was a very, she knew what she wanted to do and what she wanted to be from a very young age."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "I think from the age of nine, she knew she wanted to be a writer."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "She wanted to write stories."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "That was the thing she wanted to do."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "And, you know, she focused her life after that on this goal of I wanna be a novelist, I wanna write."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "And the philosophy was incidental to that in a sense, at least until some point in her life."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "She witnessed the Russian Revolution, literally it happened outside."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "They lived in St. Petersburg where the first kind of demonstrations and of the revolution happened."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "So she witnessed it."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "She lived through it as a teenager, went to school under the Soviets."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "For a while, they were under kind of on the Black Sea where the opposition government was ruling and then they would go back and forth between the commies and the whites."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "But she experienced what communism was like."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "She saw the pharmacy being taken away from a family."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "She saw their apartment being taken away or other families being brought into the apartment they already lived in."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "And it was very clear given her nature, given her views, even at a very young age that she would not survive the system."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "So a lot of effort was put into how did she get out?"}, {"time": 1668, "text": "And her family was really helpful in this."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "And she had a cousin in Chicago and she had been studying kind of film at the university and..."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "This is in her 20s?"}, {"time": 1680, "text": "This is in her 20s, early 20s."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "And Lenin, there was a small window
