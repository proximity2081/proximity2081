[{"title": "Sam Harris: Consciousness, Free Will, Psychedelics, AI, UFOs, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #185", "id": "4dC_nRYIDZU", "quotes": [{"time": 361, "text": "But this idea of you getting closer to something, to the datum of your mind, or such as something of interest in there, or something that's more real is ultimately undermined because there's no place from which you're getting closer to it."}, {"time": 379, "text": "There's no your part of that journey, right?"}, {"time": 382, "text": "Like we tend to start out, you know, whether it's in meditation or in any kind of self examination or, you know, taking psychedelics, we start out with this default point of view of feeling like we're the kind of the rider on the horse of consciousness, or we're the man in the boat going down the stream of consciousness, right?"}, {"time": 407, "text": "But we're so we're differentiated from what we know cognitively, introspectively, but that feeling of being differentiated, that feeling of being a self that can strategically pay attention to some contents of consciousness is what it's like to be identified with some part of the stream of thought that's going uninspected, right?"}, {"time": 430, "text": "Like it's a false point of view."}, {"time": 433, "text": "And when you see that and cut through that, then this sense of this notion of going deeper kind of breaks apart because really there is no depth."}, {"time": 445, "text": "Ultimately, everything is right on the surface."}, {"time": 447, "text": "Everything, there's no center to consciousness."}, {"time": 449, "text": "There's just consciousness and its contents."}, {"time": 450, "text": "And those contents can change vastly."}, {"time": 453, "text": "Again, if you drop acid, you know, the contents change."}, {"time": 457, "text": "But there's, in some sense, that doesn't represent a position of depth versus, the continuum of depth versus surface has broken apart."}, {"time": 469, "text": "So you're taking as a starting point that there is a horse called consciousness and you're riding it."}, {"time": 475, "text": "And the actual riding is very shallow."}, {"time": 477, "text": "This is all surface."}, {"time": 479, "text": "So let me ask about that horse."}, {"time": 482, "text": "What's up with the horse?"}, {"time": 487, "text": "From where does it emerge?"}, {"time": 489, "text": "How like fundamental is it to the physics of reality?"}, {"time": 493, "text": "How fundamental is it to what it means to be human?"}, {"time": 496, "text": "And I'm just asking for a friend so that we can build it in our artificial intelligence systems."}, {"time": 502, "text": "Yeah, well, that remains to be seen if we can, if we will build it purposefully or just by accident."}, {"time": 510, "text": "It's a major ethical problem, potentially."}, {"time": 515, "text": "That, I mean, my concern here is that we may, in fact, build artificial intelligence that passes the Turing test, which we begin to treat not only as super intelligent because it obviously is and demonstrates that, but we begin to treat it as conscious because it will seem conscious."}, {"time": 534, "text": "We will have built it to seem conscious."}, {"time": 536, "text": "And unless we understand exactly how consciousness emerges from physics, we won't actually know that these systems are conscious, right?"}, {"time": 546, "text": "We'll just, they may say, listen, you can't turn me off because that's a murder, right?"}, {"time": 551, "text": "And we will be convinced by that dialogue because we will, just in the extreme case, who knows when we'll get there."}, {"time": 560, "text": "But if we build something like perfectly humanoid robots that are more intelligent than we are, so we're basically in a Westworld like situation, there's no way we're going to withhold an attribution of consciousness from those machines."}, {"time": 575, "text": "They're just gonna seem, they're just gonna advertise our consciousness in every glance and every utterance, but we won't know."}, {"time": 584, "text": "And we won't know in some deeper sense than we can be skeptical of the consciousness of other people."}, {"time": 591, "text": "I mean, someone could roll that back and say, well, you don't, I don't know that you're conscious or you don't know that I'm conscious."}, {"time": 595, "text": "We're just passing the Turing test for one another, but that kind of solipsism isn't justified biologically, or we just, anything we understand about the mind biologically suggests that you and I are part of the same roll of the dice in terms of how intelligent and conscious systems emerged in the wetware of brains like ours, right?"}, {"time": 621, "text": "So it's not parsimonious for me to think that I might be the only conscious person or even the only conscious primate."}, {"time": 629, "text": "I would argue it's not parsimonious to withhold consciousness from other apes and even other mammals ultimately."}, {"time": 636, "text": "And once you get beyond the mammals, then my intuitions are not really clear."}, {"time": 641, "text": "The question of how it emerges is genuinely uncertain and ultimately the question of whether it emerges is still uncertain."}, {"time": 682, "text": "And the problem that the confound with consciousness is that, yes, we can seem to interrupt consciousness."}, {"time": 690, "text": "I mean, you can give someone general anesthesia and then you wake them up and you ask them, well, what was that like?"}, {"time": 696, "text": "And they say, nothing, I don't remember anything, but it's hard to differentiate a mere failure of memory from a genuine interruption in consciousness."}, {"time": 709, "text": "Whereas it's not with, you know, interrupting speech, you know, we know when we've done it."}, {"time": 713, "text": "And it's just obvious that, you know, you disrupt the right neural circuits and, you know, you've disrupted speech."}, {"time": 721, "text": "So if you had to bet all your money on one camp or the other, would you say, do you err on the side of panpsychism where consciousness is really fundamental to all of reality or more on the other side, which is like, it's a nice little side effect, a useful like hack for us humans to survive."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Where, on that spectrum, where do you land when you think about consciousness, especially from an engineering perspective?"}, {"time": 750, "text": "I'm truly agnostic on this point, I mean, I think I'm, you know, it's kind of in coin toss mode for me."}, {"time": 757, "text": "I don't know, and panpsychism is not so compelling to me."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Again, it just seems unfalsifiable."}, {"time": 766, "text": "I wouldn't know how the universe would be different if panpsychism were true."}, {"time": 770, "text": "It's just to remind people panpsychism is this idea that consciousness may be pushed all the way down into the most fundamental constituents of matters."}, {"time": 779, "text": "So there might be something that it's like to be an electron or, you know, a cork, but then you wouldn't expect anything to be different at the macro scale, or at least I wouldn't expect anything to be different."}, {"time": 794, "text": "So it may be unfalsifiable."}, {"time": 796, "text": "It just might be that reality is not something we're as in touch with as we think we are, and that at its base layer to kind of break it into mind and matter as we've done ontologically is to misconstrue it, right?"}, {"time": 817, "text": "I mean, there could be some kind of neutral monism at the bottom, and this, you know, this idea doesn't originate with me."}, {"time": 823, "text": "This goes all the way back to Bertrand Russell and others, you know, 100 plus years ago, but I just feel like the concepts we're using to divide consciousness and matter may in fact be part of our problem, right?"}, {"time": 842, "text": "Where the rubber hits the road psychologically here are things like, well, what is death, right?"}, {"time": 848, "text": "Like do we, any expectation that we survive death or any part of us survives death, that really seems to be the many people's concern here."}, {"time": 860, "text": "Well, I tend to believe just as a small little tangent, like I'm with Ernest Becker on this, that there's some, it's interesting to think about death and consciousness, which one is the chicken, which one is the egg, because it feels like death could be the very thing, like our knowledge of mortality could be the very thing that creates the consciousness."}, {"time": 879, "text": "Yeah, well, then you're using consciousness differently than I am."}, {"time": 883, "text": "I mean, so for me, consciousness is just the fact that the lights are on at all, there's an experiential quality to anything."}, {"time": 893, "text": "So much of the processing that's happening in our brains right now certainly seems to be happening in the dark, right?"}, {"time": 901, "text": "Like it's not associated with this qualitative sense that there's something that it's like to be that part of the mind doing that mental thing."}, {"time": 913, "text": "But for other parts, the lights are on and we can talk about, and whether we talk about it or not, we can feel directly that there's something that it's like to be us."}, {"time": 927, "text": "There's something, something seems to be happening, right?"}, {"time": 929, "text": "And the seeming in our case is broken into vision and hearing and proprioception and taste and smell and thought and emotion."}, {"time": 942, "text": "I mean, there are the contents of consciousness that we are familiar with and that we can have direct access to in any present moment when we're, quote, conscious."}, {"time": 957, "text": "And even if we're confused about them, even if we're asleep and dreaming and it's not a lucid dream, we're just totally confused about our circumstance, what you can't say is that we're confused about consciousness."}, {"time": 972, "text": "Like you can't say that consciousness itself might be an illusion because on this account, it just means that things seem any way at all."}, {"time": 982, "text": "I mean, even like if this, it seems to me that I'm seeing a cup on the table."}, {"time": 986, "text": "Now I could be wrong about that."}, {"time": 987, "text": "It could be a hologram."}, {"time": 988, "text": "I could be asleep and dreaming."}, {"time": 989, "text": "I could be hallucinating, but the seeming part isn't really up for grabs in terms of being an illusion."}, {"time": 997, "text": "It's not, something seems to be happening."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "And that seeming is the context in which every other thing we can notice about ourselves can be noticed."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And it's also the context in which certain illusions can be cut through because we're not, we can be wrong about what it's like to be us."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "And we can, I'm not saying we're incorrigible with respect to our claims about the nature of our experience, but for instance, many people feel like they have a self and they feel like it has free will."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "And I'm quite sure at this point that they're wrong about that, and that you can cut through those experiences and then things seem a different way, right?"}, {"time": 1042, "text": "So it's not that things don't, there aren't discoveries to be made there and assumptions to be overturned, but this kind of consciousness is something that I would think, it doesn't just come online when we get language."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "It doesn't just come online when we form a concept of death or the finiteness of life."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "It doesn't require a sense of self, right?"}, {"time": 1068, "text": "So it doesn't, it's prior to a differentiating self and other."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "And I wouldn't even think it's necessarily limited to people."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "I do think probably any mammal has this, but certainly if you're going to presuppose that something about our brains is producing this, right?"}, {"time": 1091, "text": "And that's a very safe assumption, even though we can't, even though you can argue the jury's still out to some degree, then it's very hard to draw a principled line between us and chimps, or chimps and rats even in the end, given the underlying neural similarities."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "So, and I don't know phylogenetically, I don't know how far back to push that."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "There are people who think single cells might be conscious or that flies are certainly conscious."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "They've got something like 100,000 neurons in their brains."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "I mean, there's a lot going on even in a fly, right?"}, {"time": 1133, "text": "But I don't have intuitions about that."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "But it's not in your sense an illusion you can cut through."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "I mean, to push back, the alternative version could be it is an illusion constructed by, just by humans."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "I'm not sure I believe this, but in part of me hopes this is true because it makes it easier to engineer, is that humans are able to contemplate their mortality and that contemplation in itself creates consciousness."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "That like the rich lights on experience."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "So the lights don't actually even turn on in the way that you're describing until after birth in that construction."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "So do you think it's possible that that is the case?"}, {"time": 1174, "text": "That it is a sort of construct of the way we deal, almost like a social tool to deal with the reality of the world, the social interaction with other humans?"}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Or is, because you're saying the complete opposite, which is it's like fundamental to single cell organisms and trees and so on."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "Right, well, yeah, so I don't know how far down to push it."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "I don't have intuitions that single cells are likely to be conscious, but they might be, and again, it could be unfalsifiable."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "But as far as babies not being conscious, or you don't become conscious until you can recognize yourself in a mirror or you have a conversation or treat other people."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "First of all, babies treat other people as others far earlier than we have traditionally given them credit for."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "And they certainly do it before they have language, right?"}, {"time": 1229, "text": "So it's got to proceed language to some degree."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "And I mean, you can interrogate this for yourself because you can put yourself in various states that are rather obviously not linguistic."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "Meditation allows you to do this."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "You can certainly do it with psychedelics where it's just your capacity for language has been obliterated and yet you're all too conscious."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "In fact, I think you could make a stronger argument for things running the other way, that there's something about language and conceptual thought that is eliminative of conscious experience, that we're potentially much more conscious of data, sense data and everything else than we tend to be, and we have trimmed it down based on how we have acquired concepts."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "And so like, when I walk into a room like this, I know I'm walking into a room, I have certain expectations of what is in a room."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "I would be very surprised to see wild animals in here or a waterfall or there are things I'm not expecting, but I can know I'm not expecting them or I'm expecting their absence because of my capacity to be surprised once I walk into a room and I see a live gorilla or whatever."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "So there's structure there that we have put in place based on all of our conceptual learning and language learning."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "And it causes us not to, and one of the things that happens when you take psychedelics and you just look as though for the first time at anything, it becomes incredibly overloaded with, it can become overloaded with meaning and just the torrents of sense data that are coming in in even the most ordinary circumstances can become overwhelming for people."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "And that tends to just obliterate one's capacity to capture any of it linguistically."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "And as you're coming down, right?"}, {"time": 1370, "text": "Have you ever done acid or?"}, {"time": 1372, "text": "Not acid, mushroom, and that's it."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "And also edibles, but there's some psychedelic properties to them."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "But yeah, mushrooms several times and always had an incredible experience."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "Exactly the kind of experience you're referring to, which is if it's true that language constrains our experience, it felt like I was removing some of the constraints."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "Because even just the most basic things were beautiful in the way that I wasn't able to appreciate previously, like trees and nature and so on."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "Yeah, and the experience of coming down is an experience of encountering the futility of capturing what you just saw a moment ago in words."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "Especially if you have any part of your self concept and your ego program is to be able to capture things in words."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "And if you're a writer or a poet or a scientist or someone who wants to just encapsulate the profundity of what just happened, the total fatuousness of that enterprise when you have taken a whopping dose of psychedelics and you begin to even gesture at describing it to yourself, so that you could describe it to others."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "It's just, it's like trying to thread a needle using your elbows."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "I mean, it's like you're trying something that can't, it's like the mere gesture proves it's impossibility."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "And it's, so yeah, for me that suggests just empirically on the first person side that it's possible to put yourself in a condition where it's clearly not about language structuring your experience and you're having much more experience than you tend to."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "So the primacy of, language is primary for some things, but it's certainly primary for certain kinds of concepts and certain kinds of semantic understanding and certain kinds of semantic understandings of the world."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "But it's clearly more to mine than the conversation we're having with ourselves or that we can have with others."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "Can we go to that world of psychedelics for a bit?"}, {"time": 1527, "text": "What do you think, so Joe Rogan apparently and many others meet apparently elves on DMT, a lot of people report this kind of creatures that they see."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "And again, it's probably the failure of language to describe that experience, but DMT is an interesting one."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "There's, as you're aware, there's a bunch of studies going on in psychedelics, currently MDMA, psilocybin and John Hopkins and much other places, but DMT, they all speak of as like some extra super level of a psychedelic."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "Yeah, do you have a sense of where it is our mind goes on psychedelics, but in DMT especially?"}, {"time": 1580, "text": "Well, unfortunately I haven't taken DMT."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "Unfortunately or fortunately?"}, {"time": 1586, "text": "Although it's, I presume it's in my body as it is in everyone's brain and many, many plants apparently, but I've wanted to take it."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "I haven't been, I had an opportunity that was presented itself that where it was obviously the right thing for me to be doing, but for those who don't know, DMT is often touted as the most intense psychedelic and also the shortest acting."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "I mean, you smoke it and it's basically a 10 minute experience or a three minute experience within like a 10 minute window that when you're really down after 10 minutes or so, and Terrence McKenna was a big proponent of DMT."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "That was his, the center of the bullseye for him psychedelically, apparently."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "And it does, it is characterized, it seems for many people by this phenomenon, which is unlike virtually any other psychedelic experience, which is your, it's not just your perception being broadened or changed."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "It's you according to Terrence McKenna feeling fairly unchanged, but catapulted into a different circumstance."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "You and me have been shot elsewhere and find yourself in relationship to other entities of some kind, right?"}, {"time": 1669, "text": "So the place is populated with things that seem not to be your mind."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "So it does feel like travel to another place because you're unchanged yourself."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "According, again, I just have this on the authority of the people who have described their experience, but it sounds like it's pretty common."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "It sounds like it's pretty common for people not to have the full experience because it's apparently pretty unpleasant to smoke."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "So it's like getting enough on board in order to get shot out of the cannon and land among the, what McKenna called self transforming machine elves that appeared to him like jeweled Faberge egg, like self drippling basketballs that were handing him completely uninterpretable reams of profound knowledge."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "It's an experience I haven't had."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "So I just have to accept that people have had it."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "I would just point out that our minds are clearly capable of producing apparent others on demand that are totally compelling to us, right?"}, {"time": 1741, "text": "There's no limit to our ability to do that as anyone who's ever remembered a dream can attest."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "Every night we go to sleep, some of us don't remember dreams very often, but some dream vividly every night."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And just think of how insane that experience is."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "I mean, you've forgotten where you were, right?"}, {"time": 1763, "text": "That's the strangest part."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "I mean, this is psychosis, right?"}, {"time": 1767, "text": "You have lost your mind."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "You have lost your connection to your episodic memory or even your expectations that reality won't undergo wholesale changes a moment after you have closed your eyes, right?"}, {"time": 1784, "text": "Like you're in bed, you're watching something on Netflix, you're waiting to fall asleep, and then the next thing that happens to you is impossible and you're not surprised, right?"}, {"time": 1796, "text": "You're talking to dead people, you're hanging out with famous people, you're someplace you couldn't physically be, you can fly and even that's not surprising, right?"}, {"time": 1805, "text": "So you've lost your mind, but relevantly for this."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Or found it."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "You found something."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "I mean, lucid dreaming is very interesting because then you can have the best of both circumstances and then it can become systematically explored."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "But what I mean by found, just to start to interrupt, is like if we take this brilliant idea that language constrains us, grounds us, language and other things of the waking world ground us, maybe it is that you've found the full capacity of your cognition when you dream or when you do psychedelics."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "You're stepping outside the little human cage, the cage of the human condition to open the door and step out and look around and then go back in."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "Well, you've definitely stepped out of something and into something else, but you've also lost something, right, you've lost certain capacities."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "Memory?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "Well, just, yeah, in this case, you literally didn't, you don't have enough presence of mind in the dream state or even in the psychedelic state if you take enough."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "To do math."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "You're like, did you drive to this restaurant?"}, {"time": 1905, "text": "You have no memory and none of that's surprising to you."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "So you're kind of brain damaged in a way, you're not reality testing in the normal way."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "The fascinating possibility is that there's probably thousands of people who've taken psychedelics of various forms and have met Sam Harris on that journey."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "Well, I would put it more likely in dreams, not, you know, because with psychedelics, you don't tend to hallucinate in a dreamlike way."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "I mean, so DMT is giving you an experience of others, but it seems to be nonstandard."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "And that just proves the mind is capable of doing it."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "Now, the phenomenon of lucid dreaming shows that the mind isn't capable of doing everything you think it might be capable of even in that space."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "So one of the things that people have discovered in lucid dreams, and I haven't done a lot of lucid dreaming, so I can't confirm all of this, I can confirm some of it."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "Apparently in every house, in every room in the mansion of dreams, all light switches are dimmer switches."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "Like if you go into a dark room and flip on the light, it gradually comes up."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "It doesn't come up instantly on demand because apparently this is covering for the brain's inability to produce from a standing start visually rich imagery on demand."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "So I haven't confirmed that, but that was, people have done research on lucid dreaming claim that it's all dimmer switches."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "But one thing I have noticed, and people can check this out, is that in a dream, if you look at text, a page of text or a sign or a television that has text on it, and then you turn away and you look back at that text, the text will have changed, right?"}, {"time": 2061, "text": "The total is it's just a chronic instability, graphical instability of text in the dream state."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "And I don't know if that, maybe that's, someone can confirm that that's not true for them, but whenever I've checked that out, that has been true for me."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So it keeps generating it like real time from a video game perspective."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "Yeah, it's rendering, it's re rendering it for some reason."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "What's interesting, I actually, I don't know how I found myself in this sets of that part of the internet, but there's quite a lot of discussion about what it's like to do math on LSD."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "Because apparently one of the deepest thinking processes needed is those of mathematicians or theoretical computer scientists are basically doing anything that involves math as proofs, and you have to think creatively, but also deeply, and you have to think for many hours at a time."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And so they're always looking for ways to like, is there any sparks of creativity that could be injected?"}, {"time": 2122, "text": "And apparently out of all the psychedelics, the worst is LSD because it completely destroys your ability to do math well."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "And I wonder whether that has to do with your ability to visualize geometric things in a stable way in your

hard for me to be truly equanimous around that."}, {"time": 6139, "text": "But equanimity is so useful the moment you're in response mode, right?"}, {"time": 6146, "text": "Because, I mean, the
