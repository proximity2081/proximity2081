294, "text": "Is there anything in mathematics or numbers that you find beautiful?"}, {"time": 298, "text": "Oh, well, there's lots of things in math that's really beautiful."}, {"time": 303, "text": "I used to consider myself really good at math and these days I consider myself really bad at math."}, {"time": 311, "text": "I never really had a thing for the square root of two, but when I was a teenager, there was this book called The Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers, which for some reason I read through and damn near memorized the whole thing."}, {"time": 333, "text": "And I started this weird habit of when I was like filling out checks or paying for things with credit cards, I would want to make the receipt add up to a new number."}, {"time": 349, "text": "Is there some numbers that stuck with you that just kind of make you feel good?"}, {"time": 354, "text": "They all have a story and fortunately, I've actually mostly forgotten all of them."}, {"time": 362, "text": "Are they, uh, so like 42, uh, well, yeah, I mean, that one 42 is pretty magical."}, {"time": 368, "text": "And then the irrationals, I mean, but is there a square root of two story in there somewhere, how did that come about?"}, {"time": 374, "text": "It's, it's like the only number that has destroyed a religion in which way, well, the, the pathogorians, they, they believed that all numbers were perfect and you could re represent anything as, as a, as a rational number."}, {"time": 393, "text": "And, um, in that, in that time period, um, the, this proof came out that there was no, you know, rational fraction whose value was equal to the square root of two."}, {"time": 410, "text": "And that, that means nothing in this world, right?"}, {"time": 414, "text": "So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, in this world is perfect, not even mathematics."}, {"time": 425, "text": "Well, it means that your definition of perfect was imperfect."}, {"time": 431, "text": "Well then, then there's the Gaitl incompleteness theorems and the 20th century that ruined it once again for everybody."}, {"time": 437, "text": "Although, although, although Goerl's theorem, um, you know, the lesson I take from Goerl's theorem is not that, you know, there are things you can't know, which is fundamentally what it says."}, {"time": 455, "text": "But people want black and white answers."}, {"time": 459, "text": "They want true or false."}, {"time": 463, "text": "But if you allow a three state logic that is true, false, or maybe, then life's good."}, {"time": 475, "text": "I feel like there's a parallel to modern political discourse in there somewhere, but let me ask."}, {"time": 484, "text": "So with your kind of early love or appreciation of the beauty of mathematics, do you see a parallel between that world and the world of programming?"}, {"time": 497, "text": "Programming is all about logical structure, understanding the patterns that come out of computation, understanding sort of, I mean, it's often like the path through the graph of possibilities to find a short route."}, {"time": 525, "text": "Meaning like find a short program that gets the job done kind of thing."}, {"time": 530, "text": "But so then on the topic of irrational numbers, do you see programming?"}, {"time": 538, "text": "You just painted it so cleanly."}, {"time": 541, "text": "It's a little of this trajectory to find like a nice little program, but do you see it as fundamentally messy?"}, {"time": 548, "text": "Maybe unlike mathematics?"}, {"time": 550, "text": "I don't think of it as, I mean, you know, you watch somebody who's good at math do math and you know, often it's fairly messy."}, {"time": 562, "text": "Sometimes it's kind of magical."}, {"time": 567, "text": "When I was a grad student, one of the students, his name was Jim Sachs, was he had this reputation of being sort of a walking, talking human theorem proving machine."}, {"time": 589, "text": "And if you were having a hard problem with something, you could just like accost him in the hall and say, Jim, and he would do this funny thing where he would stand up straight."}, {"time": 601, "text": "His eyes would kind of defocus."}, {"time": 603, "text": "He'd go, you know, just like something in today's movies."}, {"time": 610, "text": "And then he'd straighten up and say n log n and walk away."}, {"time": 615, "text": "And you'd go, well, okay, so n log n is the answer."}, {"time": 620, "text": "How did he get there?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "By which time he's, you know, down the hallway somewhere."}, {"time": 627, "text": "Yeah, he's just the oracle, the black box that just gives you the answer."}, {"time": 631, "text": "Yeah, and then you have to figure out the path from the question to the answer."}, {"time": 636, "text": "I think in one of the videos I watched, you mentioned Don Knuth, well, at least recommending his, you know, his book is something people should read."}, {"time": 648, "text": "But in terms of, you know, theoretical computer science, do you see something beautiful that has been inspiring to you, speaking of n log n, in your work on programming languages, that's in that whole world of algorithms and complexity and, you know, these kinds of more formal mathematical things?"}, {"time": 673, "text": "Or did that not really stick with you in your programming life?"}, {"time": 680, "text": "It did stick pretty clearly for me, because one of the things that I care about is being able to sort of look at a piece of code and be able to prove to myself that it works."}, {"time": 701, "text": "And, you know, so for example, I find that I'm at odds with many of the people around me over issues about like how you lay out a piece of software, right?"}, {"time": 723, "text": "You know, so software engineers get really cranky about how they format the documents that are the programs, you know, where they put new lines and where they put, you know."}, {"time": 735, "text": "The braces."}, {"time": 735, "text": "The braces and all the rest of that, right."}, {"time": 738, "text": "And I tend to go for a style that's very dense."}, {"time": 747, "text": "Minimize the white space."}, {"time": 750, "text": "Yeah, well, to maximize the amount that I can see at once, right?"}, {"time": 757, "text": "So I like to be able to see a whole function and to understand what it does, rather than have to go scroll, scroll, scroll and remember, right?"}, {"time": 766, "text": "Yeah, I'm with you on that."}, {"time": 767, "text": "Yeah, that's."}, {"time": 768, "text": "And people don't like that."}, {"time": 772, "text": "Yeah, I've had, you know, multiple times when engineering teams have staged what was effectively an intervention."}, {"time": 787, "text": "You know, where they invite me to a meeting and everybody's arrived before me and they all look at me and say, James, about your coding style, I'm sort of an odd person to be programming because I don't think very well verbally."}, {"time": 811, "text": "I am just naturally a slow reader."}, {"time": 817, "text": "I'm what most people would call a visual thinker."}, {"time": 822, "text": "So when you think about a program, what do you see?"}, {"time": 825, "text": "I see pictures, right?"}, {"time": 827, "text": "So when I look at a piece of code on a piece of paper, it very quickly gets transformed into a picture."}, {"time": 838, "text": "And, you know, it's almost like a piece of machinery with, you know, this connected to that and."}, {"time": 845, "text": "Like these gears and different sizes."}, {"time": 847, "text": "Yeah, yeah, I see them more like that than I see the sort of verbal structure or the lexical structure of letters."}, {"time": 858, "text": "So then when you look at the program, that's why you want to see it all in the same place, then you can just map it to something visual."}, {"time": 864, "text": "Yeah, and it just kind of like, like it leaps off the page at me and."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Yeah, what are the inputs, what are the outputs?"}, {"time": 870, "text": "What the heck is this thing doing?"}, {"time": 873, "text": "Getting a whole vision of it."}, {"time": 875, "text": "Can we go back into your memory?"}, {"time": 879, "text": "Memory, long term memory access."}, {"time": 882, "text": "What's the first program you've ever written?"}, {"time": 887, "text": "Oh, I have no idea what the first one was."}, {"time": 892, "text": "I mean, I know the first machine that I learned to program on."}, {"time": 899, "text": "Was a PDP eight at the University of Calgary."}, {"time": 906, "text": "Do you remember the specs?"}, {"time": 908, "text": "Oh yeah, so the thing had 4K of RAM."}, {"time": 913, "text": "12 bit words."}, {"time": 916, "text": "The clock rate was, it was about a third of a megahertz."}, {"time": 926, "text": "Oh, so you didn't even get to the M, okay."}, {"time": 929, "text": "Yeah, yeah, so we're like 10,000 times faster these days."}, {"time": 934, "text": "10,000 times faster these days."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And was this kind of like a super computer, like a serious computer for."}, {"time": 942, "text": "No, the PDP eight I was the first thing that people were calling like mini computer."}, {"time": 950, "text": "They were sort of inexpensive enough that a university lab could maybe afford to buy one."}, {"time": 959, "text": "And was there time sharing, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 962, "text": "There actually was a time sharing OS for that, but it wasn't used really widely."}, {"time": 970, "text": "The machine that I learned on was one that was kind of hidden in the back corner of the computer center."}, {"time": 982, "text": "And it was bought as part of a project to do computer networking, but they didn't actually use it very much."}, {"time": 998, "text": "It was mostly just kind of sitting there and it was kind of sitting there and I noticed it was just kind of sitting there."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "And so I started fooling around with it and nobody seemed to mind."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "So I just kept doing that and."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "And it had a keyboard and like a monitor, are we?"}, {"time": 1018, "text": "Oh, this is way before monitors were common."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "So it was literally a model 33 teletype with a paper tape reader."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "Okay, so the user interface wasn't very good."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Yeah, it was the first computer ever built with integrated circuits, but by integrated circuits, I mean that they would have like 10 or 12 transistors on one piece of silicon, not the 10 or 12 billion that the machines have today."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "So what did that, I mean, feel like if you remember those?"}, {"time": 1063, "text": "I mean, did you have kind of inklings of the magic of exponential kind of improvement of Moore's law of the potential of the future that, was that your fingertips kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1077, "text": "Or was it just a cool?"}, {"time": 1078, "text": "Yeah, it was just a toy."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "I had always liked building stuff, but one of the problems with building stuff is that you need to have parts."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "You need to have pieces of wood or wire or switches or stuff like that."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "And those all cost money."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "And here you could build."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "You could build arbitrarily complicated things and I didn't need any physical materials."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "It required no money."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "That's a good way to put programming."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "You're right, it's, if you love building things, completely accessible, you don't need anything."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "Anybody from anywhere could just build something really cool."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "If you've got access to a computer, you can build all kinds of crazy stuff."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "And when you were somebody like me who had like really no money, and I mean, I remember just lusting after being able to buy like a transistor."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "And when I would do sort of electronics kind of projects, they were mostly made, done by like dumpster diving for trash."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "And one of my big hauls was discarded relay racks from the back of the phone company switching center."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "That was the big memorable treasure."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "Yeah, that was a really."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "What do you use that for?"}, {"time": 1185, "text": "I built a machine that played tic tac toe."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Out of relays."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "Of course, the thing that was really hard was that all the relays required a specific voltage."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "But getting a power supply that would do that voltage was pretty hard."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "And since I had a bunch of trashed television sets, I had to sort of cobble together something that was wrong but worked."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "So I was actually running these relays at 300 volts."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "And none of the electrical connections were like properly sealed off."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Surprised you survived that period of your life."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Oh, for so many reasons."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "For so many reasons."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "I mean, it's pretty common for teenage geeks to discover, oh, thermite."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "That's real easy to make."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "Well, I'm glad you did."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "But do you remember what program in Calgary that you wrote, anything that stands out?"}, {"time": 1261, "text": "And what language?"}, {"time": 1263, "text": "Well, so mostly anything of any size was assembly code."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "And actually, before I learned assembly code, there was this programming language on the PDP 8 called Focal 5."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "And Focal 5 was kind of like a really stripped down Fortran."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "And I remember building programs that did things like play blackjack or solitaire."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "Or for some reason or other, the things that I really liked were ones where they were just like plotting graphs."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "So something with like a function or data, and then you plot it."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "Yeah, I did a bunches of those things and went, ooh, pretty pictures."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And so this would like print out, again, no monitors."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "Right, so it was like on a teletype."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "So it's using something that's kind of like a typewriter."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "And then using those to plot functions."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "So when, I apologize to romanticize things, but when did you first fall in love with programming?"}, {"time": 1352, "text": "What was the first programming language?"}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Like as a serious, maybe, software engineer, where you thought this is a beautiful thing?"}, {"time": 1360, "text": "I guess I never really thought of any particular language as being beautiful, because it was never really about the language for me."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "It was about what you could do with it."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "And even today, people try to get me into arguments about particular forms of syntax for this or that."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "And I'm like, who cares?"}, {"time": 1383, "text": "It's about what you can do, not how you spell the word."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And so back in those days, I learned like PL1 and Fortran and COBOL, and by the time that people were willing to hire me to do stuff, it was mostly assembly code and PDP assembly code and Fortran code and control data assembly code for the CDC 6400, which was an early, I guess, supercomputer."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "Even though that supercomputer has less compute power than my phone by a lot."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "And that was mostly, like you said, Fortran world."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "That said, you've also showed appreciation for the greatest language ever that I think everyone agrees is Lisp."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "Well, Lisp is definitely on my list of the greatest ones that have existed."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "Is it at number one?"}, {"time": 1452, "text": "Or I mean, are you, I mean?"}, {"time": 1456, "text": "You know, the thing is that it's, you know, I wouldn't put it number one, no."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "What do you not love about Lisp?"}, {"time": 1474, "text": "Well, I guess the number one thing to not love about it is so freaking many parentheses."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "On the love thing is, you know, out of those tons of parentheses, you actually get an interesting language structure."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "And I've always thought that there was a friendlier version of Lisp hiding out there somewhere."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "But I've never really spent much time thinking about it."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "But, you know, so like up the food chain for me from Lisp is Simula, which a very small number of people have ever used."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "But a lot of people, I think you had a huge influence, right, on the programming."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "But in the Simula, I apologize if I'm wrong on this, but is that one of the first functional languages?"}, {"time": 1528, "text": "No, it was the first object oriented programming language."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "It's really where object oriented and languages sort of came together."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "And it was also the language where coroutines first showed up as a part of the language."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "So you could have a programming style that was, you could think of it as sort of multi threaded with a lot of parallelism."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "There's ideas of parallelism in there?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Yeah, so that was back, you know, so the first Simula spec was Simula 67."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "Like 1967?"}, {"time": 1576, "text": "So it had coroutines, which are almost threads."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "The thing about coroutines is that they don't have true concurrency."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "So you can get away without really complex locking."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "You can't useably do coroutines on the multi core machine."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "Or if you try to do coroutines on the multi core machine, you don't actually get to use the multiple cores."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "Either that or you, because you start then having to get into the universe of semaphores and locks and things like that."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "But in terms of the style of programming, you could write code and think of it as being multi threaded."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "The mental model was very much a multi threaded one."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "And all kinds of problems you could approach very differently."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "To return to the world of Lisp for a brief moment, at CMU you wrote a version of Emacs that I think was very impactful on the history of Emacs."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "What was your motivation for doing so?"}, {"time": 1662, "text": "At that time, so that was in like 85 or 86."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "I had been using Unix for a few years."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "And most of the editing was this tool called ED, which was sort of an ancestor of VI."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "Is it a pretty good editor, not a good editor?"}, {"time": 1694, "text": "Well, if what you're using, if your input device is a teletype, it's pretty good."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "It's certainly more humane than TECO, which was kind of the common thing in a lot of the DEC universe at the time."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "TECO is spelled TK, is that the?"}, {"time": 1715, "text": "No, TECO, T E C O, the text editor and corrector."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "Corrector, wow, so many features."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "And the original Emacs came out as, so Emacs stands for editor macros."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "And TECO had a way of writing macros."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "And so the original Emacs from MIT started out as a collection of macros for TECO."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "But then the Emacs style got popular originally at MIT."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And then people did a few other implementations of Emacs that were, the code base was entirely different, but it was sort of the philosophical style of the original Emacs."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "What was the philosophy of Emacs?"}, {"time": 1773, "text": "And by the way, were all the implementations always in C?"}, {"time": 1776, "text": "And then how does Lisp fit into the picture?"}, {"time": 1779, "text": "No, so the very first Emacs was written as a bunch of macros for the TECO text editor."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "Wow, that's so interesting."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "And the macro language for TECO was probably the most ridiculously obscure format."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "If you just look at a TECO program on a page, you think it was just random characters."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "It really looks like just line noise."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "So it's kind of like LaTeX or something."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "Oh, way worse than LaTeX."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Way, way worse than LaTeX."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "But if you use TECO a lot, which I did, TECO was completely optimized for touch typing at high speed."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "So there were no two character commands."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "Well, there were a few, but mostly they were just one character."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "So every character on the keyboard was a separate command."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "And actually, every character on the keyboard was usually two or three commands because you could hit Shift and Control and all of those things."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "It's just a way of very tightly encoding it."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "And mostly what Emacs did was it made that visual."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "So one way to think of TECO is use Emacs with your eyes closed, where you have to maintain a mental model of a mental image of your document."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "You have to go, OK, so the cursor is between the A and the E. And I want to exchange those, so I do these things."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "So it is almost exactly the Emacs command set."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "Well, it's roughly the same as Emacs command set, but using Emacs with your eyes closed."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "So part of what Emacs added to the whole thing was being able to visually see what you were editing in a form that matched your document."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "And a lot of things changed in the command set because it was programmable."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "It was really flexible."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "You could add new commands for all kinds of things."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "And then people rewrote Emacs multiple times in Lisp."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "There was one done at MIT for the Lisp machine."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "There was one done for Multics."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "And one summer, I got a summer job to work on the Pascal compiler for Multics."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "And that was actually the first time I used Emacs."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "To write the compilers."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "You've worked on compilers, too."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "Yeah, so I did a lot of work."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "I spent a really intense three months working on this Pascal compiler, basically living in Emacs."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And it was the one written in Mac Lisp by Bernie Greenberg."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "And I thought, wow, this is just a way better way to do editing."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "And then I got back to CMU, where we had one of everything and two of a bunch of things and four of a few things."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "And since I mostly worked in the Unix universe, and Unix didn't have an Emacs, I decided that I needed to fix that problem."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "So I wrote this implementation of Emacs in C, because at the time, C was really the only language that worked on Unix."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "And you were comfortable with C as well at that point?"}, {"time": 2038, "text": "Yeah, at that time, I had done a lot of C coding."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "This was in, like, 86."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "And it was running well enough for me to use it to edit itself within a month or two."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "And then it kind of took over the university."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "And it spread outside."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "Yeah, and then it went outside."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "And largely because Unix kind of took over the research community on the ARPANET, and Emacs was kind of

thing I maybe want to ask on that is maybe to push back a little bit."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "So there's the jerk side."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "But there's also, if I were to criticize what I've

4025, "text": "I am not wildly rich."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "I do OK."}, {"time": 4034, "text": "But I do actually, I can feed my children."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "Yeah, I totally agree with you."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "It does just make me sad that sometimes the closing of the source, for some reason that people that, like a bureaucracy begins to build, and sometimes it doesn't, it hurts the product."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "It's always sad."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "And there is a balance in there."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "There's a balance."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "And it's not hard over rapacious capitalism."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "And it's not hard over in the other direction."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "And a lot of the open source movement, they have been managing to find the path to actually making money."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "So doing things like service and support works for a lot of people."}, {"time": 4100, "text": "And there are some ways where it's kind of, some of them are a little perverse."}, {"time": 4129, "text": "And this is kind of a worldwide thing."}, {"time": 4131, "text": "But if you've got a corporation that is depending on some piece of software, often various accounting and reporting standards say if you don't have a support contract on this thing that your business is depending on, then that's bad."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "So if you've got a database, you need to pay for support."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "But there's a difference between the sort of support contracts that the average open source database producer charges and what somebody who is truly rapacious like Oracle charges."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "Yeah, so it's a balance, like you said."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "It is absolutely a balance."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "And there are a lot of different ways to make the math work out for everybody."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "And the very unbalanced sort of like the winner takes all thing that happens in so much of modern commerce, that just doesn't work for me either."}, {"time": 4226, "text": "I know you've talked about this in quite a few places, but you have created one of the most popular programming languages in the world."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "This is a programming language that I first learned about object oriented programming with."}, {"time": 4246, "text": "I think it's a programming language that a lot of people use in a lot of different places and millions of devices today, Java."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "So the absurd question, but can you tell the origin story of Java?"}, {"time": 4263, "text": "So a long time ago at Sun in about 1990, there was a group of us who were kind of worried that there was stuff going on in the universe of computing that the computing industry was missing out on."}, {"time": 4281, "text": "And so a few of us started this project at Sun that really got going."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "I mean, we started talking about it in 1990, and it really got going in 91."}, {"time": 4299, "text": "And it was all about what was happening in terms of computing hardware processors and networking and all of that that was outside of the computer industry."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "And that was everything from the sort of early glimmers of cell phones that were happening then to you look at elevators and locomotives and process control systems in factories and all kinds of audio equipment and video equipment."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "They all had processors in them, and they were all doing stuff with them."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "And it sort of felt like there was something going on there that we needed to understand."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "And So C and C++ was in the air already."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "Oh, no, C and C++ absolutely owned the universe at that time."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "Everything was written in C and C++."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "So where was the hunch that there was a need for a revolution?"}, {"time": 4368, "text": "Well, so the need for a revolution was not about a language."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "It was just as simple and vague as there are things happening out there."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "We need to understand them."}, {"time": 4388, "text": "And so a few of us went on several somewhat epic road trips."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "Literal road trips?"}, {"time": 4400, "text": "Literal road trips."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "It's like get on an airplane, go to Japan, visit Toshiba and Sharp and Mitsubishi and Sony and all of these folks."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "And because we worked for Sun, we had folks who were willing to give us introductions."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "We visited Samsung and a bunch of Korean companies."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "And we went all over Europe."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "We went to places like Philips and Siemens and Thomson."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "And what did you see there?"}, {"time": 4440, "text": "For me, one of the things that sort of leapt out was that they were doing all the usual computer things that people had been doing like 20 years before."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "The thing that really leapt out to me was that they were sort of reinventing computer networking."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "And they were making all the mistakes that people in the computer industry had made."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "And since I had been doing a lot of work in the networking area, we'd go and visit Company X."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "They'd describe this networking thing that they were doing."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "And just without any thought, I could tell them like the 25 things that were going to be complete disasters with that thing that they were doing."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And I don't know whether that had any impact on any of them."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "But that particular story of repeating the disasters of the computer science industry was there."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "And one of the things we thought was, well, maybe we could do something useful here with bringing them forward somewhat."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "But also, at the same time, we learned a bunch of things from these mostly consumer electronics companies."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "And high on the list was that they viewed their relationship with the customer as sacred."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "They were never, ever willing to make tradeoffs between for safety."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "So one of the things that had always made me nervous in the computer industry was that people were willing to make tradeoffs in reliability to get performance."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "They want faster, faster."}, {"time": 4578, "text": "It breaks a little more often because it's fast."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "Maybe you run it a little hotter than you should."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "Or the one that always blew my mind was the way that the folks at Cray Supercomputers got their division to be really fast was that they did Newton Raphson approximations."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "And so the bottom several bits of A over B were essentially random numbers."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "What could go wrong?"}, {"time": 4619, "text": "And just figuring out how to nail the bottom bit, how to make sure that if you put a piece of toast in a toaster, it's not going to kill the customer."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "It's not going to burst into flames and burn the house down."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "So I guess those are the principles that were inspiring."}, {"time": 4646, "text": "But how did, from the days of Java's called oak, because of a tree outside the window story that a lot of people know, how did it become this incredible, powerful language?"}, {"time": 4663, "text": "Well, so it was a bunch of things."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "So after all that, the way that we decided that we could understand things better was by building a demo, building a prototype of something."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "So because it was easy and fun, we decided to build a control system for some home electronics, TV, VCR, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "And as we were building it, we discovered that there were some things about standard practice in C programming that were really getting in the way."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "And it wasn't exactly because we were writing all this C code and C++ code that we couldn't write it to do the right thing."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "But one of the things that was weird in the group was that we had a guy whose top level job was he was a business guy."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "He was an MBA kind of person, think about business plans and all of that."}, {"time": 4738, "text": "And there were a bunch of things that were kind of, and we would talk about things that were going wrong and things that were going wrong, things that were going right."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "And as we thought about things like the requirements for security and safety, some low level details and see like naked pointers."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "And so back in the early 90s, it was well understood that the number one source of security vulnerabilities."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "Was pointers."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "Was just pointers, was just bugs."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "And it was like 50%, 60%, 70% of all security vulnerabilities were bugs."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "And the vast majority of them were like buffer overflows."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "So you're like, we have to fix this."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "We have to make sure that this cannot happen."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "And that was kind of the original thing for me was this cannot continue."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "And one of the things I find really entertaining this year was, I forget which Rag published it, but there was this article that came out that was sort of the result of an examination of all the security vulnerabilities in Chrome."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "And Chrome is like a giant piece of C++ code."}, {"time": 4839, "text": "And 60% or 70% of all the security vulnerabilities were stupid pointer tricks."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "And I thought, it's 30 years later and we're still there."}, {"time": 4854, "text": "Still there."}, {"time": 4854, "text": "And we're still there."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "And that's one of those slap your forehead and just want to cry moments."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "Would you attribute, or is that too much of a simplification, but would you attribute the creation of Java to C pointers?"}, {"time": 4875, "text": "Obvious problem."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "Well, I mean, that was one of the trigger points."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "Concurrency you've mentioned."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "Concurrency was a big deal."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "Because when you're interacting with people, the last thing you ever want to see is the thing like waiting and issues about the software development process."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "When faults happen, can you recover from them?"}, {"time": 4905, "text": "What can you do to make it easier to create and eliminate complex data structures?"}, {"time": 4914, "text": "What can you do to fix one of the most common C problems, which is storage leaks?"}, {"time": 4923, "text": "And it's evil twin, the freed but still being used piece of memory."}, {"time": 4934, "text": "You free something and then you keep using it."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "So when I was originally thinking about that, I was thinking about it in terms of safety and security issues."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "And one of the things I came to understand was that it wasn't just about safety and security, but it was about developer velocity."}, {"time": 4959, "text": "So and I got really religious about this because at that point, I had spent an ungodly amount of my life hunting down mystery pointer bugs."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "And two thirds of my time as a software developer was because the mystery pointer bugs tend to be the hardest to find because they tend to be very, very statistical."}, {"time": 4991, "text": "The ones that hurt, they're like a one in a million chance."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "But nevertheless, create an infinite amount of suffering."}, {"time": 5004, "text": "Because when you're doing a billion operations a second, one in a million chance means it's going to happen."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "And so I got really religious about this thing, about making it so that if something fails, it fails immediately and visibly."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "And one of the things that was a real attraction of Java to lots of development shops was that we get our code up and running twice as fast."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "You mean like the entirety of the development process, debugging, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 5044, "text": "Yeah, so if you measure time from you first touch fingers to keyboard until you get your first demo out, not much different."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "But if you look from fingers touching keyboard to solid piece of software that you could release in production, it would be way faster."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "And I think what people don't often realize is, yeah, there's things that really slow you down, like the hard to catch bugs probably is the thing that really slows down the entire time."}, {"time": 5083, "text": "It really slows things down."}, {"time": 5085, "text": "But also, one of the things that you get out of object oriented programming is a strict methodology about what are the interfaces between things and being really clear about how parts relate to each other."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "And what that helps with is so many times what people do is they kind of like sneak around the side."}, {"time": 5112, "text": "So if you've built something and people are using it and you say, well, OK, I built this thing."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "You use it this way."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "And then you change it in such a way that it still does what you said it does."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "It just does it a little bit different."}, {"time": 5130, "text": "Then you find out that somebody out there was sneaking around the side."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "They sort of tunneled in a back door."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And this person, their code broke."}, {"time": 5141, "text": "And because they were sneaking through a side door."}, {"time": 5147, "text": "And normally, the attitude is, dummy."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "But a lot of times, you can't just slap their hand and tell them to not do that."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "Because it's some bank's account reconciliation system that some developer decided, oh, I'm lazy."}, {"time": 5182, "text": "I'll just sneak through the back door."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "Because the language allows it."}, {"time": 5186, "text": "I mean, you can't even mad at them."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "And so one of the things I did that, on the one hand, upset a bunch of people was I made it so that you really couldn't go through back doors."}, {"time": 5198, "text": "So the whole point of that was to say, if the interface here isn't right, the wrong way to deal with that is to go through a back door."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "The right way to deal with it is to walk up to the developer of this thing and say, fix it."}, {"time": 5218, "text": "And so it was kind of like a social engineering thing."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "And people ended up discovering that that really made a difference in terms of."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "And a bunch of this stuff, if you're just screwing around writing your own class project scale stuff, a lot of this stuff isn't quite so important because you're both sides of the interface."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "But when you're building larger, more complex pieces of software that have a lot of people working on them, and especially when they span organizations, having clarity about how that stuff gets structured saves your life."}, {"time": 5276, "text": "And especially, there's so much software that is fundamentally untestable until you do the real thing."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "It's better to write good code in the beginning as opposed to writing crappy code and then trying to fix it and trying to scramble and figure out, and through testing, figure out where the bugs are."}, {"time": 5300, "text": "Yeah, it's like, which shortcut caused that rocket to not get where it was needed to go?"}, {"time": 5311, "text": "So I think one of the most beautiful ideas philosophically and technically is of a virtual machine, a Java virtual machine."}, {"time": 5325, "text": "Again, I apologize to romanticize things, but how did the idea of the JVM come to be?"}, {"time": 5333, "text": "How to you radical of an idea it is?"}, {"time": 5336, "text": "Because it seems to me to be just a really interesting idea in the history of programming."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "So the Java virtual machine, you can think of it in different ways because it was carefully designed to have different ways of viewing it."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "So one view of it that most people don't really realize is there is that you can view it as sort of an encoding of the abstract syntax tree in reverse Polish notation."}, {"time": 5379, "text": "I don't know if that makes any sense at all."}, {"time": 5381, "text": "I could explain it, and that would blow all of our time."}, {"time": 5384, "text": "But the other way to think of it and the way that it ends up being explained is that it's like the instruction set of an abstract machine that's designed such that you can translate that abstract machine to a physical machine."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "And the reason that that's important, so if you wind back to the early 90s when we were talking to all of these companies doing consumer electronics, and you talk to the purchasing people, there were interesting conversations with purchasing."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "So if you look at how these devices come together, they're sheet metal and gears and circuit boards and capacitors and resistors and stuff."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "And everything you buy has multiple sources."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "So you can buy a capacitor from here."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "You can buy a capacitor from there."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "And you've got kind of a market so that you can actually get a decent price for a capacitor."}, {"time": 5463, "text": "But CPUs, and particularly in the early 90s, CPUs were all different and all proprietary."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "So if you use the chip from Intel, you had to be an Intel customer till the end of time."}, {"time": 5488, "text": "Because if you wrote a bunch of software, when you wrote software using whatever technique you wanted, and C was particularly bad about this because there was a lot of properties of the underlying machine that came through."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So you were stuck."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "So the code you wrote, you were stuck to that particular machine."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "You were stuck to that particular machine, which meant that they couldn't decide, you know, Intel is screwing us."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "I'll start buying chips from Bob's Better Chips."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "This drove the purchasing people absolutely insane that they were welded into this decision."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "And they would have to make this decision before the first line of software was written."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "That's funny that you're talking about the purchasing people."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "So there's one perspective, right?"}, {"time": 5551, "text": "There's a lot of other perspectives that all probably hated this idea."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "But from a technical aspect, just like the creation of an abstraction layer that's agnostic to the underlying machine from the perspective of the developer, I mean, that's brilliant."}, {"time": 5570, "text": "Well, and so that's like across the spectrum of providers of chips."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "But then there's also the time thing because, you know, as you went from one generation to the next generation to the next generation, they were all different."}, {"time": 5587, "text": "And you would often have to rewrite your software."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "Oh, you mean generations of machines of different kinds?"}, {"time": 5595, "text": "So like one of the things that sucked about a year out of my life was when Sun went from the Motorola 68010 processor to the 68020 processor."}, {"time": 5611, "text": "Then they had a number of differences."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "And one of them hit us really hard."}, {"time": 5616, "text": "And I ended up being the point guy on the worst case of where the new instruction cache architecture hurt us."}, {"time": 5629, "text": "Well, OK, so I mean, so one of this idea, I mean, OK."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "So yeah, you articulate a really clear fundamental problem in all of computing."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "But where do you get the guts to think we can actually solve this?"}, {"time": 5645, "text": "You know, in our conversations with all of these vendors, these problems started to show up."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "And I kind of had this epiphany because it reminded me of a summer job that I had had in grad school."}, {"time": 5671, "text": "So back in grad school, my thesis advisor, well, I had two thesis advisors for bizarre reasons."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "One of them was a guy named Raj Reddy."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "The other one was Bob Sproul."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "And Raj, I love Raj."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "I really love both of them."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "So the department had bought a bunch of early workstations from a company called Three Rivers Computer Company."}, {"time": 5711, "text": "And Three Rivers Computer Company was a bunch of electrical engineers who wanted to do as little software as possible."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "So they knew that they'd need to have compilers and an OS and stuff like that."}, {"time": 5724, "text": "And they didn't want to do any of that."}, {"time": 5726, "text": "And they wanted to do that for as close to zero money as possible."}, {"time": 5731, "text": "So what they did was they built a machine whose instruction set was literally the byte code for UCSD Pascal, the P code."}, {"time": 5750, "text": "And so we had a bunch of software that was written for this machine."}, {"time": 5762, "text": "And for various reasons, the company wasn't doing terrifically well."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "We had all this software on these machines."}, {"time": 5770, "text": "And we wanted it to run on other machines, principally the VAX."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "And so Raj asked me if I could come up with a way to port all of this software from the PERC machines to VAXs."}, {"time": 5795, "text": "And I think what he had in mind was something that would translate from Pascal to C or Pascal to, actually, at those times, pretty much it was you could translate to C or C. And if you didn't like translate to C, you could translate to C. There was, it's like the Henry Ford, any color you want, just as long as it's black."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "And I went, that's really hard."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "That's a."}, {"time": 5836, "text": "And I noticed that, and I was looking at stuff."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "And I went, oh, I bet I could rewrite the P code into VAX assembly code."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "And then I started to realize that there were some properties of P code that made that really easy, some properties that made it really hard."}, {"time": 5860, "text": "So I ended up writing this thing that translated from P code on the Three Rivers PERCs into assembly code on the VAX."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "And I actually got higher quality code than the C compiler."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "And so everything just got really fast."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "It was really easy."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "It was like, wow, I thought that was a sleazy hack because I was lazy."}, {"time": 5890, "text": "And in actual fact, it worked really well."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "And I tried to convince people that that was maybe a good thesis topic."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "And nobody was, it was like, nah."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "That's, I mean, it's kind of a brilliant idea, right?"}, {"time": 5909, "text": "Or maybe you didn't have the, you weren't able to articulate the big picture of it."}, {"time": 5914, "text": "And I think that was a key part."}, {"time": 5919, "text": "But so then clock comes forward a few years."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "And it's like, we've got to be able to, if they want to be able to switch from this weird microprocessor to that weird and totally different microprocessor, how do you do that?"}, {"time": 5938, "text": "And I kind of went, oh, maybe by doing something kind of in the space of Pascal P code, I could do multiple translations to multiple translators."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "And I spent some time thinking about that and thinking about what worked and what didn't work when I did the P code to Vax translator."}, {"time": 5965, "text": "And I talked to some of the folks who were involved in Smalltalk because Smalltalk also did a bytecode."}, {"time": 5974, "text": "And then I kind of went, yeah, I want to do that."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "Because that actually, and it had the other advantage that you could either interpret it or compile it."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "And interpreters are usually easier to do, but not as fast as a compiler."}, {"time": 6000, "text": "So I figured, good, I can be lazy again."}, {"time": 6006, "text": "Sometimes I think that most of my good ideas are driven by laziness."}, {"time": 6012, "text": "And often I find that some of people's stupidest ideas are because they're insufficiently lazy."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "They just want to build something really complicated."}, {"time": 6023, "text": "And it's like, it doesn't need to be that complicated."}, {"time": 6026, "text": "Yeah, and so that's how that came out."}, {"time": 6030, "text": "But that also turned into almost a religious position on my part, which got me in several other fights."}, {"time": 6044, "text": "So one of the things that was a real difference was the way that arithmetic worked."}, {"time": 6051, "text": "And once upon a time, it wasn't always just two's complement arithmetic."}, {"time": 6061, "text": "There were some machines that had one's complement arithmetic, which was like almost anything built by CDC."}, {"time": 6068, "text": "And occasionally, there were machines that were decimal arithmetic."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "And I was like, this is crazy."}, {"time": 6077, "text": "Pretty much two's complement integer arithmetic has one."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "So just do that."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "One of the other places where there was a lot of variability was in the way that floating point behaved."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "And that was causing people throughout the software industry much pain because you couldn't do a numerical computing library that would work on CDC and then have it work on an IBM machine and work on a DEC machine."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "And as a part of that whole struggle, there had been this big body of work on floating point standards."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "And this thing emerged that came to be called IEEE 754, which is the floating point standard that pretty much has taken over the entire universe."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "And at the time I was doing Java, it had pretty much completed taking over the universe."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "There were still a few pockets of holdouts, but I was like, it's important to be able to say what two plus two means."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "And so I went that."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "And one of the ways that I got into fights with people was that there were a few machines that did not implement IEEE 754 correctly."}, {"time": 6175, "text": "Well, of course, that's all short term kind of fights."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "I think in the long term, I think this vision is one out."}, {"time": 6183, "text": "Yeah, and I think it's worked out over time."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "I mean, the biggest fights were with Intel because they had done some strange things with rounding."}, {"time": 6195, "text": "They'd done some strange things with their transcendental functions, which turned into a mushroom cloud of weirdness."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "And in the name of optimization, but from the perspective of the developer, that's not good."}, {"time": 6212, "text": "Well, their issues with transcendental functions were just stupid."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "OK, so that's not even a trade off."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "That's just absolutely."}, {"time": 6220, "text": "Yeah, they were doing range reduction for sine and cosine using a slightly wrong value for pi."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "We've got 10 minutes."}, {"time": 6230, "text": "So in the interest of time, two questions."}, {"time": 6233, "text": "So one about Android and one about life."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "So one, I mean, we could talk for many more hours."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "I hope eventually we might talk again."}, {"time": 6245, "text": "But I got to ask you about Android and the use of Java there because it's one of the many places where Java just has a huge impact on this world."}, {"time": 6256, "text": "Just on your opinion, is there things that make you happy about the way Java is used in the Android world?"}, {"time": 6265, "text": "And are there things that you wish were different?"}, {"time": 6269, "text": "I don't know how to do a short answer to that."}, {"time": 6272, "text": "But I have to do a short answer to that."}, {"time": 6274, "text": "So I'm happy that they did it."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "Java had been running on cell phones at that time for quite a few years."}, {"time": 6282, "text": "And it worked really, really well."}, {"time": 6286, "text": "There were things about how they did it."}, {"time": 6289, "text": "And in particular, various ways that they kind of violated all kinds of contracts."}, {"time": 6300, "text": "The guy who led it, Andy Rubin, he crossed a lot of lines."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "There's some lines crossed."}, {"time": 6307, "text": "Yeah, lines were crossed that have since mushroomed into giant court cases."}, {"time": 6316, "text": "And they didn't need to do that."}, {"time": 6319, "text": "And in fact, it would have been so much cheaper for them to not cross lines."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "I mean, I suppose they didn't anticipate the success of this whole endeavor."}, {"time": 6334, "text": "Or do you think at that time it was already clear that this is going to blow up?"}, {"time": 6338, "text": "I guess I sort of came to believe that it didn't matter what Andy did, it was going to blow up."}, {"time": 6350, "text": "I kind of started to think of him as a manufacturer of bombs."}, {"time": 6358, "text": "Yeah, some of the best things in this world come about through a little bit of explosive."}, {"time": 6365, "text": "Well, and some of the worst."}, {"time": 6367, "text": "And some of the worst, beautifully put."}, {"time": 6371, "text": "And like you said, I mean, does that make you proud that Java is in millions?"}, {"time": 6379, "text": "I mean, it could be billions of devices."}, {"time": 6381, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, it was in billions of phones before Android came along."}, {"time": 6386, "text": "And I'm just as proud of the way that the smart card standards adopted Java."}, {"time": 6399, "text": "And everybody involved in that did a really good job."}]}]
