true."}, {"time": 363, "text": "If you just look at the range of creatures who've gone extinct."}, {"time": 366, "text": "I mean, if you look at the range of creatures that are on the Earth now, it's incredible."}, {"time": 373, "text": "And it's sort of tried to say that, but it actually is really incredible."}, {"time": 378, "text": "Particularly, I don't know, I mean, animals, there are animals that seem really ordinary until you watch them closely and then they become miraculous, like certain types of birds, which do very miraculous things, build bowers and do dances and all these really funky things that are hard to explain with a standard evolutionary story, although people have them."}, {"time": 403, "text": "Yeah, the birds are weird."}, {"time": 404, "text": "They do a lot for mating purposes."}, {"time": 407, "text": "They have a concept of beauty that I haven't quite, maybe you know much better, but it doesn't seem to fit evolutionary arguments well."}, {"time": 415, "text": "It does fit."}, {"time": 416, "text": "Well, it depends, right?"}, {"time": 417, "text": "So I think you're talking about the evolution of beauty, the book that was written recently by, was it Frum, was that his name?"}, {"time": 426, "text": "Richard Frum, I think, at Yale."}, {"time": 427, "text": "Oh, I'm sorry, no, I didn't know."}, {"time": 429, "text": "Oh, it's a great book."}, {"time": 429, "text": "It's very controversial, though, because he's making the argument that the question about birds and some other animals is why would they engage in such metabolically costly displays when it doesn't improve their fitness at all?"}, {"time": 447, "text": "And the answer that he gives is the answer that Darwin gave, which is sexual selection, not natural selection."}, {"time": 455, "text": "But selection can occur for all kinds of reasons."}, {"time": 457, "text": "There could be artificial selection, which is when we breed animals, right?"}, {"time": 461, "text": "Which is actually how Darwin, that observation helped Darwin come to the idea of natural selection."}, {"time": 469, "text": "And then there's sexual selection, meaning, and the argument that, I think his name is Frum, makes is that it's the pleasure, the selection pressure is the pleasure of female birds."}, {"time": 483, "text": "Which, as a woman, and as someone who studies affect, that's a great answer."}, {"time": 489, "text": "I actually think there probably is natural, I think there is an aspect of natural selection to it, which he maybe hasn't considered."}, {"time": 495, "text": "But you were saying the reason we brought up birds is the life we've got now seems to be quite incredible."}, {"time": 500, "text": "Yeah, so he brought up birds, now seems to be quite incredible."}, {"time": 505, "text": "Yeah, so you peek into the ocean, peek into the sky, there are miraculous creatures."}, {"time": 509, "text": "Look at creatures who've gone extinct."}, {"time": 511, "text": "And in science fiction stories, you couldn't dream up something as interesting."}, {"time": 517, "text": "So my guess is that intelligent life evolves in many different ways, even on this planet."}, {"time": 527, "text": "There isn't one form of intelligence."}, {"time": 528, "text": "There's not one brain that gives you intelligence."}, {"time": 531, "text": "There are lots of different brain structures that can give you intelligence."}, {"time": 534, "text": "So my guess is that the menagerie might not look exactly the way that it looks now, but it would certainly be as interesting."}, {"time": 544, "text": "But if we look at the human brain versus the brains, or whatever you call them, the mechanisms of intelligence in our ancestors, even early ancestors, that you write about, for example, in your new book, what's the difference between the fanciest brain we got, which is the human brain, and the ancestor brains that it came from?"}, {"time": 571, "text": "Yeah, I think it depends on how far back you want to go."}, {"time": 574, "text": "You go all the way back, right, in your book."}, {"time": 578, "text": "So what's the interesting comparison, would you say?"}, {"time": 581, "text": "Well, first of all, I wouldn't say that the human brain is the fanciest brain we've got."}, {"time": 585, "text": "I mean, an octopus brain is pretty different and pretty fancy, and they can do some pretty amazing things that we cannot do."}, {"time": 592, "text": "You know, we can't grow back limbs, we can't change color and texture, we can't comport ourselves and squeeze ourselves into a little crevice."}, {"time": 601, "text": "I mean, these are things that we invent, these are like superhero abilities that we invent in stories, right?"}, {"time": 606, "text": "We can't do any of those things."}, {"time": 608, "text": "And so the human brain is certainly, we can certainly do some things that other animals can't do."}, {"time": 615, "text": "That seemed pretty impressive to us."}, {"time": 616, "text": "But I would say that there are a number of animal brains which seem pretty impressive to me that can do interesting things and really impressive things that we can't do."}, {"time": 628, "text": "I mean, with your work on how emotions are made and so on, you kind of repaint the view of the brain as less glamorous, I suppose, than you would otherwise think."}, {"time": 641, "text": "Or like, I guess you draw a thread that connects all brains together in terms of homeostasis and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 650, "text": "Yeah, I wouldn't say that the human brain is any less miraculous than anybody else would say."}, {"time": 657, "text": "I just think that there are other brain structures which are also miraculous."}, {"time": 662, "text": "And I also think that there are a number of things about the human brain which we share with other vertebrates, other animals with backbones."}, {"time": 671, "text": "But that we share these miraculous things."}, {"time": 676, "text": "But we can do some things in abundance."}, {"time": 679, "text": "And we can also do some things with our brains together, working together that other animals can't do."}, {"time": 687, "text": "Or at least we haven't discovered their ability to do it."}, {"time": 691, "text": "Yeah, this social thing."}, {"time": 693, "text": "That's one of the things you write about."}, {"time": 697, "text": "How do you make sense of the fact, like the book Sapiens, and the fact that we're able to kind of connect, like network our brains together like you write about?"}, {"time": 708, "text": "I'll try to stop saying that."}, {"time": 713, "text": "Is that like some kind of feature that's built into there?"}, {"time": 718, "text": "Is that unique to our human brains?"}, {"time": 720, "text": "Like how do you make sense of that?"}, {"time": 722, "text": "What I would say is that our ability to coordinate with each other is not unique to humans."}, {"time": 729, "text": "There are lots of animals who can do that."}, {"time": 734, "text": "But what we do with that coordination is unique because of some of the structural features in our brains."}, {"time": 745, "text": "And it's not that other animals don't have those structural features."}, {"time": 750, "text": "It's we have them in abundance."}, {"time": 753, "text": "So the human brain is not larger than you would expect it to be for a primate of our size."}, {"time": 762, "text": "If you took a chimpanzee and you grew it to the size of a human, that chimpanzee would have a brain that was the size of a human brain."}, {"time": 773, "text": "So there's nothing special about our brain in terms of its size."}, {"time": 777, "text": "There's nothing special about our brain in terms of the basic blueprint that builds our brain from an embryo is the basic blueprint that builds all mammalian brains and maybe even all vertebrate brains."}, {"time": 794, "text": "It's just that because of its size and particularly because of the size of the cerebral cortex, which is a part that people mistakenly attribute to rationality."}, {"time": 807, "text": "Why mistakenly?"}, {"time": 809, "text": "Is that where all the clever stuff happens?"}, {"time": 811, "text": "Well, no, it really isn't."}, {"time": 813, "text": "And I will also say that lots of clever stuff happens in animals who don't have a cerebral cortex."}, {"time": 818, "text": "But because of the size of the cerebral cortex and because of some of the features that are enhanced by that size, that gives us the capacity to do things like build civilizations and coordinate with each other, not just to manipulate the physical world, but to add to it in very profound ways."}, {"time": 845, "text": "Like, other animals can cooperate with each other and use tools."}, {"time": 851, "text": "We draw a line in the sand and we make countries and then we create citizens and immigrants."}, {"time": 860, "text": "But also ideas."}, {"time": 861, "text": "I mean, the countries are centered around the concept of like ideas."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Well, what do you think a citizen is and an immigrant?"}, {"time": 868, "text": "Those are ideas."}, {"time": 870, "text": "Those are ideas that we impose on reality and make them real."}, {"time": 874, "text": "And then they have very, very serious and real effects, physical effects on people."}, {"time": 880, "text": "What do you think about the idea that a bunch of people have written about, Dawkins with memes, which is like ideas are breeding."}, {"time": 888, "text": "Like, we're just like the canvas for ideas to breed in our brains."}, {"time": 894, "text": "So this kind of network that you talk about of brains is just a little canvas for ideas to then compete against each other and so on."}, {"time": 902, "text": "I think as a rhetorical tool, it's cool to think that way."}, {"time": 908, "text": "So I think it was Michael Pollan."}, {"time": 910, "text": "I don't remember if it was in the Botany of Desire, but it was in one of his early books on botany and gardening where he wrote about plants and he wrote about plants utilizing humans for their own evolutionary purposes."}, {"time": 932, "text": "Which is kind of interesting."}, {"time": 933, "text": "You can think about a human gut in a sense as a propagation device for the seeds of tomatoes and what have you."}, {"time": 943, "text": "So it's kind of cool."}, {"time": 945, "text": "So I think rhetorically it's an interesting device, but ideas are, as far as I know, invented by humans, propagated by humans."}, {"time": 958, "text": "So I don't think they're separate from human brains in any way, although it is interesting to think about it that way."}, {"time": 966, "text": "Well, of course, the ideas that are using your brain to communicate and write excellent books."}, {"time": 973, "text": "And they basically picked you, Lisa, as an effective communicator and thereby are winning."}, {"time": 981, "text": "So that's an interesting worldview to think that there's particular aspects of your brain that are conducive to certain sets of ideas and maybe those ideas will win out."}, {"time": 993, "text": "Yeah, I think the way that I would say it really though is that there are many species of animals that influence each other's nervous systems, that regulate each other's nervous systems, and they mainly do it by physical means."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "They do it by chemicals, scent."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "They do it by, so termites and ants and bees, for example, use chemical scents."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "Mammals like rodents use scent and they also use hearing, audition, and that little bit of vision."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "Primates, nonhuman primates add vision, right?"}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And I think everybody uses touch."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "Humans, as far as I know, are the only species that use ideas and words to regulate each other, right?"}, {"time": 1040, "text": "I can text something to someone halfway around the world."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "They don't have to hear my voice."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "They don't have to see my face and I can have an effect on their nervous system."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "And ideas, the ideas that we communicate with words, I mean, words are in a sense a way for us to do mental telepathy with each other, right?"}, {"time": 1059, "text": "I mean, I'm not the first person to say that obviously, but how do I control your heart rate?"}, {"time": 1065, "text": "How do I control your breathing?"}, {"time": 1066, "text": "How do I control your actions with words?"}, {"time": 1069, "text": "It's because those words are communicating ideas."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "So you also write, I think, let's go back to the brain."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "You write that Plato gave us the idea that the human brain has three brains in it, three forces, which is kind of a compelling notion."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "You disagree."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "First of all, what are the three parts of the brain and why do you disagree?"}, {"time": 1096, "text": "So Plato's description of the psyche, which for the moment we'll just assume is the same as a mind."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "There are some scholars who would say a soul, a psyche, a mind, those aren't actually all the same thing in ancient Greece, but we'll just for now gloss over that."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "So Plato's idea was that, and it was a description of really about moral behavior and moral responsibility in humans."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So the idea was that the human psyche can be described with a metaphor of two horses and a charioteer."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "So one horse for instincts, like feeding and fighting and fleeing and reproduction."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "I'm trying to control my salty language, which apparently they print in England."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "Like I actually tossed off a fairly."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "F, S?"}, {"time": 1155, "text": "Yeah, F, F, yeah."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "I was like, you printed that?"}, {"time": 1159, "text": "I couldn't believe you printed that."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "Without like the stars or whatever?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "No, no, no, it was full print."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "They also printed a B word and it was really, yeah."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Well, we should learn something from England."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Indeed, anyways, but instincts."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And then the other horse represents emotions."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "And then the charioteer represents rationality, which controls the two beasts, right?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And fast forward a couple of centuries and in the middle of the 20th century, there was a very popular view of brain evolution, which suggested that you have this reptilian core, like an inner lizard brain for instincts."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "And then wrapped around that evolved, layer on top of that evolved a limbic system in mammals."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "So the novelty was in a mammalian brain, which bestowed mammals with, gave them emotions, the capacity for emotions."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "And then on top of that evolved a cerebral cortex, which in largely in primates, but very large in humans."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "And it's not that I personally disagree."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "It's that as far back as the 1960s, but really by the 1970s, it was shown pretty clearly with evidence from molecular genetics."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "So peering into cells in the brain to look at the molecular makeup of genes that the brain did not evolve that way."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "And the irony is that the idea of the three layered brain with an inner lizard that hijacks your behavior and causes you to do and say things that you would otherwise not, or maybe that you will regret later."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "That idea became very popular, was popularized by Carl Sagan in The Dragons of Eden, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977, when it was already known pretty much in evolutionary neuroscience that the whole narrative was a myth."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "So what the narrative is on the way it evolved, but do you, I mean, again, it's that problem of it being a useful tool of conversation to say like there's a lizard brain and there's a, like if I get overly emotional on Twitter, that was the lizard brain and so on."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "But do you?"}, {"time": 1330, "text": "No, I don't think it's useful."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "I think it's, I think that."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "Is it useful, is it accurate?"}, {"time": 1336, "text": "I don't think it's accurate, and therefore I don't think it's useful."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So here's what I would say."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "I think that the way I think about philosophy and science is that they are useful tools for living."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "And in order to be useful tools for living, they have to help you make good decisions."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "The triune brain, as it's called, this three layer brain, the idea that your brain is like an already baked cake and the cortex, cerebral cortex, just layered on top like icing."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "The idea, that idea is the foundation of the law in most Western countries."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "It's the foundation of economic theory and it's a great narrative."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "It sort of fits in with what I've been saying fits our intuitions about how we work."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "But it also, in addition to being wrong, it lets people off the hook for nasty behavior."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "And it also suggests that emotions can't be a source of wisdom, which they often are."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "In fact, you would not wanna be around someone who didn't have emotions."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "That would be, that's a psychopath."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "I mean, that's not someone you wanna really have that person deciding your outcome."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So I guess my, and I could sort of go on and on and on, but my point is that I don't think, I don't think it's a useful narrative in the end."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "What's the more accurate view of the brain that we should use when we're thinking about it?"}, {"time": 1448, "text": "I'll answer that in a second, but I'll say that even our notion of what an instinct is or what a reflex is, it's not quite right, right?"}, {"time": 1456, "text": "So if you look at evidence from ecology, for example, and you look at animals in their ecological context, what you can see is that even things which are reflexes are very context sensitive."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "The brains of those animals are executing so called instinctual actions in a very, very context sensitive way."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "And so even when a physician takes the, it's like the idea of your patellar reflex where they hit your patellar tendon on your knee and you kick, the force with which you kick and so on is influenced by all kinds of things."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "A reflex isn't like a robotic response."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And so I think a better way is a way that, to think about how brains work, is the way that matches our best understanding, our best scientific understanding, which I think is really cool because it's really counterintuitive."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "So how I came to this view, and I'm certainly not the only one who holds this view."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "I was reading work on neuroanatomy and the view that I'm about to tell you was strongly suggested by that."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And then I was reading work in signal processing, like by electrical engineering."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "And similarly, the work suggested that, the research suggested that the brain worked this way."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "And I'll just say that I was reading across multiple literatures and they were who don't speak to each other and they were all pointing in this direction."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "And so far, although some of the details are still up for grabs, the general gist I think is I've not come across anything yet which really violates, and I'm looking."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "And so the idea is something like this."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "It's very counterintuitive."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "So the way to describe it is to say that your brain doesn't react to things in the world."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "It's not, to us it feels like our eyes are windows on the world."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "We see things, we hear things, we react to them."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "In psychology, we call this stimulus response."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "So your face, your voice is a stimulus to me."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "I receive input and then I react to it."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "And I might react very automatically, system one."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "But I also might execute some control where I maybe stop myself from saying something or doing something and in a more reflective way execute a different action, right?"}, {"time": 1624, "text": "That's system two."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "The way the brain works though, is it's predicting all the time."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "It's constantly talking to itself, constantly talking to your body, and it's constantly predicting what's going on in the body and what's going on in the world and making predictions and the information from your body and from the world really confirm or correct those predictions."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "So fundamentally the thing that the brain does most of the time is just like talking to itself and predicting stuff about the world, not like this dumb thing that just senses and responds, senses and responds."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Yeah, so the way to think about it is like this."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "You know, your brain is trapped in a dark silent box."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Yeah, that's very romantic of you."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "Which is your skull."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "And the only information that it receives from your body and from the world, right, is through the senses, through the sense organs, your eyes, your ears, and you have sensory data that comes from your body that you're largely unaware of to your brain, which we call interoceptive, as opposed to exteroceptive, which is the world around you."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "But your brain is receiving sense data continuously, which are the effect of some set of causes."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "Your brain doesn't know the cause of these sense data."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "It's only receiving the effects of those causes, which are the data themselves."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "And so your brain has to solve what philosophers call an inverse inference problem."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "How do you know, when you only receive the effects of something, how do you know what caused those effects?"}, {"time": 1736, "text": "So when there's a flash of light or a change in air pressure or a tug somewhere in your body, how does your brain know what caused those events so that it knows what to do next to keep you alive and well?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And the answer is that your brain has one other source of information available to it, which is your past experience."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "It can reconstitute in its wiring past experiences, and it can combine those past experiences in novel ways."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "And so we have lots of names for this in psychology."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "We call it memory."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "We call it perceptual inference."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "We call it simulation."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "It's also, we call it concepts or conceptual knowledge."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "We call it prediction."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "Basically, if we were to stop the world right now, stop time, your brain is in a state, and it's representing what it believes is going on in your body and in the world."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "And it's predicting what will happen next based on past experience, right?"}, {"time": 1813, "text": "Probabilistically, what's most likely to happen."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And it begins to prepare your action, and it begins to prepare your experience based, so it's anticipating the sense data it's going to receive."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And then when those data come in, they either confirm that prediction and your action executes because the plan's already been made, or there's some sense data that your brain didn't predict that's unexpected, and your brain takes it in."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "We say encodes it."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "We have a fancy name for that."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "We call it learning."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "Your brain learns, and it updates its storehouse of knowledge, which we call an internal model so that you can predict better next time."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And it turns out that predicting and correcting, predicting and correcting is a much more metabolically efficient way to run a system than constantly reacting all the time."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "Because if you're constantly reacting, it means you can't anticipate in any way what's going to happen."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And so the amount of uncertainty that you have to deal with is overwhelming to a nervous system."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "Metabolically costly."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "And so what is a reflex?"}, {"time": 1894, "text": "A reflex is when your brain doesn't check against the sense data."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "That the potential cost to you is so great, maybe because your life is threatened, that your brain makes the prediction and executes the action without checking."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "Yeah, so but prediction is still at the core."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "That's a beautiful vision of the brain."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "I wonder, from almost an AI perspective, but just computationally, is the brain just mostly a prediction machine then?"}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Like is the perception just the nice little feature added on top?"}, {"time": 1932, "text": "Like the, both the integration of new perceptual information."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "I wonder how big of an impressive system is that relative to just the big predictor, model constructor."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "Well, I think that we can

very limited sense of touch."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "It had an eye spot for, not for seeing, but just for entraining to circadian rhythm, to light and dark."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "And it had no hearing."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "It had a vestibular cell so that it could keep upright in the water."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "So at the time, we're talking evolutionary scale here, so give or take some 100 million years or something, but at the time, what are the vertebrate, like when a backbone evolved and a brain evolved, a full brain, that was when a head evolved with sense organs and when that's when your viscera, like internal systems involved."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "So the answer I would say is that senses, motor neuroscientists, people who study the control of motor behavior believe that senses evolved in the service of motor action."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "So the idea is that, like what triggered, what was the big evolutionary change?"}, {"time": 2089,

commonly entertained right now is that it was predation, that when at some point an animal evolved that deliberately ate another animal and this launched an arms race between predators and prey and it became very useful to have senses, right?"}, {"time": 2124, "text": "So these little amphioxies don't really have, they're not aware of their environment very much, really."}, {"time": 2136, "text":

you do, you can cultivate new experiences for yourself."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "And those new experiences can change your internal model."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And you can actually practice

free will."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "Even if it's all deterministic, that might as well be just the number of choices that are possible and the fact that you just make one trajectory to those set of choices seems to be like something like they'll be called free will."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "But it's still kind of sad to think like there doesn't seem to be a place where there's magic in there, where it is all just the computer."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "Well, there's lots of magic, I would say, so far, because we don't really understand how all of this is exactly played out at a, I mean,

there's also stochastic firing of, neurons don't, they're not purely digital in the sense that there is, there's also analog communication between neurons, not just digital."}, {"time": 2688, "text":

is there for a really good reason."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "And that is the more variability there is, the more potential there is for your brain to be able to be information bearing."}, {"time":

very poetic."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "Yes, you are continually cultivating your past as a means of controlling your future."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "So you think, yeah, I guess the construction of

random stuff."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "There's a structure to it."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "There's a spatial structure and a temporal structure."}, {"time": 2885, "text": "And that spatial and

of instructions."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "So scientists call it expectable input."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "The brain needs some input in order to develop normally."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "And

body."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "And what's really interesting about humans and some other animals too, but really seriously in humans, is the input that we need is not just physical."}, {"time":

certain types of smells."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "It needs to be cuddled."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "It needs, right?"}, {"time": 3025, "text": "So without social input, that infant's brain will not wire itself in a neurotypical way."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "And again, I would say there are lots of cultural patterns of caring for an infant."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "It's not like the infant

impaired human."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "Yeah, but nevertheless, you're kind of saying that the physical reality has a consistent thing throughout that keeps feeding these set of sensory information that our brains are constructed for."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "Yeah, the cool thing though, is that if you change the consistency, if you change the statistical regularities, so prediction error, your brain can learn it."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "It's expensive for your brain to learn it."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "And it takes a while for the brain to get really automated with it."},

specify your question, right?"}, {"time": 3180, "text": "Like one way to specify it would be the way that David phrases it, which is can we create a new sense?"}, {"time": 3189, "text": "Like can we create a new sensory modality?"}, {"time": 3194, "text": "How hard would that be?"}, {"time": 3195, "text": "What are the limits in doing that?"}, {"time": 3199, "text": "But another way to say it is what happens to a brain when you remove some of those statistical regularities, right?"}, {"time": 3208, "text": "Like what happens to an adult brain when you remove some of the statistical patterns

feathers and not all instances of birds fly."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "And so the idea was that you don't have a single representation of necessary insufficient features stored in your brain somewhere."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "Instead, what you have is a prototype, a prototype meaning you still have a single representation for the category, one, but the features are like of the most

the prototype."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "And then, you know, what I'm gonna like incredibly simplify now, a lot of work to say that then a series of experiments were done to show that in fact, what your brain seems to be doing is coming up with a single exemplar or instance of the category and reading off the features when I ask you for the concept."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "So if we were in a pet store and I asked you what are the features of a bird, tell me the concept of bird, you would be more likely to give me features of a good pet."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "And if we were in a

and can exist is because there is variation in a species."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "And in dogs, we talk about that variation in terms of the size of the dog and the amount of fur the dog has and the color and how long is the tail and how long is the snout."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "In humans, we talk about that variation in all kinds of ways, right, including in cultural ways."}, {"time": 4943,

look at modern debates about what is a species, you can't find anybody agreeing on what the criteria are for a species, because they don't all share the same genome."}, {"time": 4966, "text": "We

the function."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "Yeah, what I'm saying is that what Darwin, Darwin really talked about variation in, so if you read, for example, the biologist Ernst Mayr, who was an

all add up to a perfect storm."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "That's just how most things work."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "And so the fact that machine learning algorithms are serving people up

are just brilliant, so the experiential blindness but also from my perspective, like I preach and I try to practice empathy a lot and something about the way you've explained it makes me almost see it as a kind of exercise that we should all do, like to train, like to add experiences to the brain to expand this capacity to predict more effectively."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "So like what I do is kind of like a method acting thing which is I imagine what the life of a person is like."}, {"time": 6352, "text": "Just think, I mean, this is something you see with Black Lives Matter and police

even more to be said there."}, {"time": 6401, "text": "I mean, like from a predicting brain standpoint, there's even more that can be said there."}, {"time": 6407, "text": "So I don't know if you wanna go down that path or you wanna stick on empathy, but I will also say that one of the things that I was most gratified by, I still am receiving, it's been more than three and a half years since

really difficult situation that I think both they and the people who are harmed don't realize, like the way that these situations are constructed, I think it's just, there's a lot to be said there I guess is what I want to say."}, {"time": 6542, "text": "Yeah, is there something we can try to say in a sense, like what I'm, from the perspective of the predictive brain which is a fascinating perspective to take on this, you know, all the protests that are going on, there seems to be a concept of a police officer being built."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "No, I think that concept is there."},

what I said."}, {"time": 6639, "text": "The brain makes predictions about internal changes in the body first and then it starts to prepare motor action and then it makes a prediction about what you
