C has a methyl form, which is sometimes referred to as the fifth base."}, {"time": 545, "text": "So methyl C takes a different meaning."}, {"time": 551, "text": "So in the same way that you have annotations in a orchestra score that basically say whether you should play something softly or loudly or space it out or interpret basically the score, the human epigenome allows you to modify that primary score."}, {"time": 565, "text": "So a modified C basically says, play this one softly."}, {"time": 572, "text": "It's basically a sign of repression in a gene regulatory region."}, {"time": 578, "text": "I love how you're talking about the function that emerges from the epigenome as a musical score."}, {"time": 586, "text": "It is in many ways."}, {"time": 586, "text": "And every single cell plays a different part of that score."}, {"time": 593, "text": "It's like having all of human knowledge in 23 volumes, like 23 giant books, which are your chromosomes."}, {"time": 598, "text": "And every single cell has a different profession, a different role."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Some cells play the piano and they're looking at chapter seven from chromosome 23 and chapter four from chromosome two and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 609, "text": "And each of those pieces are all encoded in the same DNA."}, {"time": 609, "text": "But what the epigenome allows you to do is effectively conduct the orchestra and sort of coordinate the pieces so that every instrument plays only the things that it needs to play."}, {"time": 624, "text": "One thing that kind of blows my mind, maybe you can tell me your thoughts about it, is the way evolution works with natural selection is based on the final sort of the entirety of the orchestra musical performance, right?"}, {"time": 644, "text": "But there's these incredibly rich structural things, like each one of them doing their own little job that somehow work together."}, {"time": 653, "text": "The evolution selects based on the final result and yet all the individual pieces are doing like infinitely minuscule specific things."}, {"time": 665, "text": "How the heck does that work?"}, {"time": 665, "text": "It's a very good insight."}, {"time": 665, "text": "And you can even go beyond that and basically say evolution doesn't select at the level of an organism."}, {"time": 670, "text": "It actually selects at the level of whole environments, whole ecosystems."}, {"time": 675, "text": "So let me break this down."}, {"time": 675, "text": "So you basically have at the very bottom every single nucleotide being selected."}, {"time": 682, "text": "But then that nucleotide function is selected at the level of each gene and every, not even each gene, each gene regulatory control element."}, {"time": 697, "text": "And then those control elements are basically converging onto the function of the gene and many genes are converging onto the function of one cell and many cells are converging into the function of one tissue or organ."}, {"time": 707, "text": "And all of these organs are converging onto the level of an organism."}, {"time": 714, "text": "But now that organism is not in isolation."}, {"time": 714, "text": "So if you basically think about why is altruism, for example, a thing, why are people being nice to each other?"}, {"time": 720, "text": "It was probably selected and it was probably selected because those species that were just nasty to each other didn't survive as a species."}, {"time": 733, "text": "And now if you think about symbiosis of, you know, there's plants, for example, that love CO2 and there's humans that love O2 and we're sort of, you know, trading different types of gases to each other."}, {"time": 752, "text": "If you look at ecosystems where one organism was just really nasty, that organism actually died because everyone they were being nasty to was killed off."}, {"time": 762, "text": "And then that kind of, you know, universe of life is gone."}, {"time": 768, "text": "So basically what emerges is selection at so many different layers of benefit, including, you know, all of these nucleotides within a body interacting for the emergent functions at the body level."}, {"time": 785, "text": "I wonder if it's possible to break it down into levels that's selection even beyond humans."}, {"time": 792, "text": "Like you said, environment, but there's environments at all different levels too, right?"}, {"time": 798, "text": "At the minuscule, at the organ level, at the tissue level, like you said, maybe at the microscopic level."}, {"time": 803, "text": "It would be fascinating if like there's a kind of selection going on, like both the quantum level and like the, the galaxy level."}, {"time": 816, "text": "So, so yeah, let's again, sort of break down these different layers."}, {"time": 816, "text": "So basically if you think about the environment in which a gene operates, that gene, of course, the first definition of environment that we think of is pollution or sunlight or heat or cold and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 827, "text": "That's the external environment."}, {"time": 833, "text": "But every gene also operates at the level of the internal cellular environment that it's in."}, {"time": 838, "text": "If I take a gene from say an African individual and I put it in a European context, will it perform the same way?"}, {"time": 845, "text": "Probably not because there's a cellular context of thousands of other genes that that gene has co evolved with, you know, in the out of Africa event and, you know, all of this sort of human history of evolution."}, {"time": 858, "text": "So basically if you look at Neanderthal genes, for example, which again happened long after that out of Africa event, there's incompatibilities between Neanderthal genes and modern human genes that can lead to diseases."}, {"time": 872, "text": "So in the context of the Neanderthal genome, that gene version, that allele was fine, but in the context of the modern human genome, that Neanderthal gene version is actually detrimental."}, {"time": 883, "text": "So it's, it's, you know, that cellular environment constitutes the genetics of that gene, but also of course, all of the epigenomics of that gene."}, {"time": 894, "text": "It's fascinating that the gene has a history."}, {"time": 900, "text": "I mean, we talked about this a little bit last time, but just, and then some of your research goes into that, but the genes as they are today have, have a story from the beginning of time."}, {"time": 914, "text": "And then some, sometimes their story was like their path was useful for survival for the particular organisms and sometimes not."}, {"time": 920, "text": "Let me ask as a tangent."}, {"time": 920, "text": "We kind of started talking offline about Neanderthals."}, {"time": 927, "text": "Do you have something interesting genetically, biologically in terms of difference between Neanderthal and like the different branches of human evolution that you find fascinating?"}, {"time": 938, "text": "Neanderthals are only one of about five branches that we are pretty confident about."}, {"time": 946, "text": "Branches of?"}, {"time": 946, "text": "Of out of Africa events."}, {"time": 946, "text": "So basically there's Neanderthals, there's Denisovans."}, {"time": 953, "text": "What is the evidence for Denisovans?"}, {"time": 953, "text": "One tiny little fragment of one pinky from one cave in Siberia."}, {"time": 960, "text": "Recent, relatively recently discovered, right?"}, {"time": 960, "text": "Less than 10 years ago."}, {"time": 968, "text": "And those are like little folks, right?"}, {"time": 968, "text": "That's yet another one though."}, {"time": 972, "text": "Homo florensis."}, {"time": 972, "text": "It had the little folks instead of Indonesia."}, {"time": 972, "text": "But then the Denisovans are basically another branch that we only know about genetically from that one bone."}, {"time": 984, "text": "And eventually we realized that it's one of the three major branches along with Neanderthal, modern human and Denisovan."}, {"time": 988, "text": "And then that one branch has now resurfaced in many different areas."}, {"time": 994, "text": "And we kind of know about the gene flow that happened in between them."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So when I was reading my Greek mythology, it was talking about the age of the heroes, these eras of human like, you know, precursors that were wiped out by Zeus or by all kinds of wars and so on and so forth, like the Titans and the, you know, it's ridiculous to sort of read these stories as a kid because you're like, oh yeah, whatever."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "And then you're growing up and you're like, whoa, layers and layers of human like ancestors."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "And who knows if those stories were inspired by bones that they found that kind of looked human like, but were not quite human like."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "Who knows if stories of dragons were inspired by bones of dinosaurs."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "And basically this archeological evidence has been there and has probably entered the folk imagination, migrated into those stories, but it's not that far removed from what actually happened of massive wars of wiping out Neanderthals as humans are, modern humans are populating, you know, Europe."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Do you think, do you think what killed the Neanderthals and all those other branches is human conflict or is it genetic conflict?"}, {"time": 1059, "text": "So is it us humans being the opposite of altruistic towards each other?"}, {"time": 1068, "text": "Or is it some other competition at some other level, like as we're discussing?"}, {"time": 1076, "text": "So if you look at a lot of human traits today, they're probably not that far removed from the human traits that got us where we are now."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "So, you know, this whole tribalism, you know, you're my sports team or you're my, you know, political party or you're my, you know, tiny little village."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "And therefore, you know, if you're from that other village, I hate you."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "But as soon as we're both in the major city, I can't believe we're from the same region, my friend, my family and like two neighboring countries fighting."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "And as soon as they're off in another country, you're like, oh, I can't believe that."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "So it's, it's kind of funny, like this tribalism is nonsensical in many ways."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "It's like cognitive incongruent that basically we like kin and selection for, for sort of liking kin is hugely advantageous genetically."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "Probably across all kinds of organisms, across all kinds of life."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "So, so basically if you now transport that to the sort of humans arriving in Europe and Neanderthals are everywhere, what are you going to do?"}, {"time": 1142, "text": "You're going to kill them off."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "You know, there's this battle for territory and this battle for, they're not like us."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "We have to get rid of them."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "So basically there's a, you know, very interesting mix there, but, and yet, and yet when you look at the genetics, there's tons of gene flow between them."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "So basically, you know, love romance between, you know, tribes, but love spans the gap between the different tribes."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "It's Romeo and Juliet across species boundaries."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Sneaks away from the village."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Even before the out of Africa, there's, you know, within Africa selection, which was probably massive battles of larger and larger tribes selecting for our social networking and savviness and, you know, probably all our conspiracy theory genes are, you know, dating back from then."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "And, you know, so there's a lot of this mischievousness in the history of human evolution that unfortunately is still present in, you know, many ugly forms today, but probably contributed to our success as a species in wiping out other species."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "It just sucks that we don't have neighboring species that are, you know, intelligent like us that, but yet very different than us."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "So we have like, you know, dogs or wolves, I guess, co evolved."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "They, they figured out how to neighbor up with humans in a friendly way and collaborate and develop in time."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "You're describing this as if the wolves made a choice."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "It's possible that the wolves never had a say, that basically humans were just so overpowering that they had captive wolves."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And then at every generation killed off eight of the nine pups and only kept the one that was milder."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And it only takes a few generations to then sort of have pups that are really mild."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And so the Neanderthals weren't useful in the same way that wolves were."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "I don't know if it's a question of useful."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "They were probably super useful."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "My thinking is that they were scary, that basically something that almost resembles you is something that you try to eliminate first."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "It's too close."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "And speaking of, you know, species that are intelligent and sort of what's left of evolution, it is a shame, exactly like you say, that so many different, amazing life forms were extinct and the kind of boring ones remained."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "So if you look at the dinosaurs, I mean, the diversity that they had, if you look at sub, you know, like there's just so many different lineages of life that were just abruptly killed."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "And yet out of that death emerged, you know, many new kinds of really awesome lineages."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "Do you think there was in the history of life on earth species that may be still alive today that are more intelligent than humans?"}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And we just don't know."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "So there's a case to be made for dolphins."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "Like if you look at their brains, if you look at the way that they play, if you look at the way that they learn, you know, I mean, they don't have opposable thumbs and we do."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "So, you know, that probably made a big difference."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "It's terrifying to think that like, not terrifying, I don't know how to feel about it, that they're more intelligent than us."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "It's like the hitchhiker's guide."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "But how do you define intelligence?"}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Basically, like I was saying last time, you know, stupid is a stupid does and smart is a smart does."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "So if the dolphins are basically super smart, figured out the meaning of life and just go around playing with water all day, which is probably the meaning of life, then we wouldn't know because all they're doing is kicking water just like sharks are and sharks are probably pretty stupid."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "So basically it's very difficult to sort of judge a species intelligence unless they kind of go out of their way to demonstrate it."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "Yeah, and that's instructive for our understanding of any kind of life form."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "You know, I recently talked to Sara Seager looking for life out there on other planets."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "It'd be fascinating to think if we discover a habitable planet outside of Earth in one day, maybe many centuries away, or be able to travel with like a robot there, how would we actually know that this species would probably be able to detect that it's a living being?"}, {"time": 1404, "text": "But how would we know if it's an intelligent being?"}, {"time": 1412, "text": "I mean, it's both exciting and terrifying to sort of come face to face with a life form that's of another world."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "Like something that clearly is moving in a, how would you say, like a deliberate way, and to then like ask, well, how do I ask that thing, whether it's intelligent?"}, {"time": 1438, "text": "No, but the question that you're asking is applicable to every species on the Earth now."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "On Earth now, yeah."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "So basically, you know, dolphins are a great example."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "We know that they're, you know, clearly capable hardware wise and behavior wise of intelligence."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "You know, how do we communicate?"}, {"time": 1454, "text": "So basically, if your question is about crossing species boundaries of communication, the way that I want to put it is that humans have achieved a level of sophistication in our behaviors, in our communication, in our language, in our ways of expressing ourselves, that I have no doubt that if we encountered a human like form of intelligence, we'd figure out their language in a few weeks."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "Like, it'd be just fine."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "As long as, you know, of course, they're both trusting each other, not annihilating each other, and not sort of fearing each other and attacking each other."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "What about, let me ask, just out of curiosity into science fiction land a little bit."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "So clearly, you're one of the top scientists in the world."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "So if we were to discover, an alien life form, you would be brought in to study its genetics."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "Do you think the epigenome that we talked about, the genome, the code, the digital code that underlies that alien life form would be similar to ours?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "Like the, in fundamental ways, maybe not exactly, but in fundamental ways, of how it's structured?"}, {"time": 1528, "text": "So you're getting to the very definition of what we're talking about."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "Of how it's structured."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "So you're getting to the very definition of life."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "You're getting to the very definition of what makes life, life, and how do we decode that life?"}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And it's so easy to think that every life form would basically have to, you know, like oxygen, have to like heat from the sun and rely on sort of being in the habitable zone of, you know, its solar system and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "But I think we have to sort of go beyond this sort of, oh, life on another planet must be exactly like life is on earth."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "Because of course, life on earth happens to rely on the proximity to the sun and benefit from that amount of energy."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "But we're talking at timescales of human life, where we kind of live, I don't know, between, and I'm going to be super wide here."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "We're going to live between six earth months and, you know, 200 earth months or 200 earth years."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So basically, if you look at the timescale that we inhabit on earth, it is very much dictated by the amount of energy that we receive from the sun."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "If you look at, I don't know, Europa, you know, the smallest, the fourth smallest moon of Jupiter, the smallest of the Galilean moons, and also the smallest in its distance from Jupiter."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "It has an iron core, it has a rock exterior, it has ice all around it, and it has probably massive liquid oceans underneath."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "And the gravitational pull of Jupiter is probably creating all kinds of movement under that ice."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "How did life evolve on earth?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "Life now, most of life that we above the surface look at, has to do with exploiting the solar energy for, you know, our daily behavior."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "But that's not the case everywhere on the planet."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "If you look at the bottom of the ocean, there are hydrothermal vents."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "There's both black smokers and white smokers, and they are near these volcanic, you know, ducts that basically emanate a massive amount of energy from the core of our planet."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "What does life need?"}, {"time": 1673, "text": "It needs energy."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "Does it need energy from the sun?"}, {"time": 1673, "text": "It couldn't care less."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "Does it need energy from, you know, the earth itself?"}, {"time": 1680, "text": "Yeah, possibly."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "It could use that."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "And if you look at how did life evolve on, you know, on earth, there are many theories."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "I mean, a kind of silly theory is that it came from outer space, that basically there's a meteorite out there that sort of landed on earth and brought with it DNA material."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "I think it's a little silly because it kind of pushes the buck down the road."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Basically the next question is how did it evolve over there?"}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Whereas our planet has basically all of the right ingredients, why wouldn't evolve here?"}, {"time": 1706, "text": "So basically let's kind of ignore that one."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "And now the two other competing hypotheses are from the outside in or from the inside out."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "From the outside in means from the surface to the bottom of the ocean."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "From the inside out means from the bottom of the ocean to the surface."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "So life on the surface is pretty brutal."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "Life obviously evolved in the water and then there was an out of water event."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "But basically before it exited, it was clearly in the water, which is a much nicer and shielded environment."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "So just to be clear, on the surface, are you referring to the surface of the sea or the bottom of the sea?"}, {"time": 1751, "text": "Versus the bottom of the sea."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And you're saying life on the surface is harsh."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Life outside the water is horrible."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "It takes huge amounts of evolutionary innovations to sustain living outside the water."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "So it's easier to, life is easier in the water."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "Maybe, see, I'm telling dolphins are onto something."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "We are 70% water."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "No, dolphins went back into the water."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "Oh, because dolphins are mammals."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "Well, again, they might be smarter."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "They went back."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "They're like, screw this."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "So if you basically think about the fact that we are 70%

under the sea, I mean, I don't know if you're a diver, but when you go diving, your brain explodes."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "Again, when I say the boring life forms is what we see all the time, like tetrapods."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "I mean, what a stupid boring body plan."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "Just go dive and you'll see that a tiny little minority of the stuff under the sea, under the surface of the sea is actually tetrapods."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "It's like snails with all kinds of crazy appendages and colors and round things and five way symmetric things and eight way symmetric things, all kinds of crazy body plans."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "And only the tetrapod fish managed to get out."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "And then they gave rise to all the boring plans we kind of see today of basically, you know, humans with four limbs, birds with four limbs, lizards with four limbs, and you know, right?"}, {"time": 1856, "text": "It's kind of boring."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "If you look at, by comparison, life underwater is teeming with diversity."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "So now let's roll back the clock and basically say, where did life in the ocean come from, from the surface or from the bottom?"}, {"time": 1873, "text": "Those two options that you were mentioning."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "So basically life on the surface is one option."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "And then the idea there is that there's tides with the moon and the sun sort of causing all this movement."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "And this movement is basically causing nutrients to sort of, you know, coalesce and, you know, bounce around, et cetera."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "The second option, massive amount of energy from the core of our the core of our planet basically exploited, leading to these basic ingredients of life forms."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "And what are these basic ingredients?"}, {"time": 1907, "text": "Metabolism, being able to take energy from the environment and put it as part of yourself."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "Metabolism, it basically means transformation."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "Again, in the Greek, it basically means taking stuff from, you know, like nutrients or energy source or anything, and then making it your own."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "The second one is compartmentalization."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "If there's no notion of self, there can't be evolution."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "You have to know where your own boundaries end and where the non self boundaries begin."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "And that's basically the lipid bilayer nowadays, which is extremely simple to form."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "It's basically just a bunch of lipids and then they eventually just self organize into a membrane."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "So that's a very natural way of forming a self."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "And then the third component is replication."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "Replication doesn't need to be self replication."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "It could be A helps make more of B, B helps make more of C and C helps make more of A."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "Any kind of self reinforcement is what you need to ignite the process of evolution."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "After you've ignited that process, you know, I don't want to say all hell breaks loose, but all paradise breaks loose."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "So basically you then boom, you know, have life going."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "And the moment you have A, B, C, some kind of thing looping back onto A, you can make modifications and you can improve."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "And then you let natural selection work."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "Is there some element of that that's like some state representation that stores information?"}, {"time": 1998, "text": "Like maybe I should say information."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "We like to think of life as the information propagation, which is DNA, the messenger, which is RNA, and then the action, which is protein."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "So basically DNA, we think is an essential part of life."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "That's where the storage is."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "And therefore that early life forms must have had some kind of storage medium DNA."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "If you look at how life actually evolved, DNA was invented much later."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "Proteins were invented later."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "And RNA was fine by itself, thank you very much, in an RNA world."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "So the early version of life as we know it today was in fact RNA molecules performing all of the functions."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "The RNA molecule itself was the protein actuator here by creating three dimensional folds through self hybridization."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "Self what?"}, {"time": 2062, "text": "Self hybridization."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "So basically the same way that DNA molecules can hybridize with themselves and basically form this double helix."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "The single stranded RNA molecule can form partial double helices in various places, creating structure as if you had a long string with complimentary parts, and you could then sort of design kind of like origami like structures that will fold onto themselves."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "And then you can make any shape from that."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "That early RNA world eventually got to replication, where enzymes encoded in RNA would replicate RNA itself."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "And then that process basically kicked off evolution."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "And that process of evolution then led to major innovations."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "The first innovation was translation."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "So you start with an RNA molecule and you translate it into another kind of form."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "And that's the first kind of encoding."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "You're like, well, do you need some kind of code?"}, {"time": 2127, "text": "Yeah, but the code was in fact one thing."}, {"time": 2127, "text": "It was conflated with the actuators."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "The actuators were separated from the code only later on."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "So you first had the self replicating code, which was also the actuator."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "And then you kind of have a functionalization, partitioning of the functionalization, a sub functionalization of the proteins that are now going to be the workhorse of life, but they're not self replicating."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "The code remains the RNA."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "So the most beautiful and most complex RNA machine known to man is the ribosome."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "The ribosome is this massive factory that is able to translate RNA into protein."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "The ribosome, I mean, if you want, I don't know, divine intervention in the history of life, the ribosome is it."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "That's one of the great invention in the history of life."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "But again, you can't think of great inventions as one time steps."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "They're basically, you know, the culmination of probably many competing software infrastructures for life preservation that won out."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "And then when the ribosome was so efficient at making proteins, all the other ones basically died out."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "And then the life forms that were using the modern ribosome were basically the more successful ones because it could make proteins."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "And now those proteins are much more versatile because RNA only has four bases."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "Proteins eventually have 20 amino acids, not initially, but eventually."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "And then they can form in much more complex shapes and they can create all kinds of additional machines."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "One of which is reverse transcriptase."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "So you basically now have RNA."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "Again, we like to think of transcription as the normal, reverse transcription as the oddball."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "Well, RNA preceded DNA."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "So reverse transcription actually was the first invention before transcription itself."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "So basically RNA invents proteins, RNA and proteins together invent DNA."}, {"time": 2249, "text": "So you now have a more stable medium and more stable backbone with two helices instead of one, two strands instead of one, the double helix."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "And RNA basically says, listen, I'm tired."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "I'm going to delegate all information storage to DNA and I'm going to delegate most actuation to proteins."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "But that's to you is not like a, that's just an efficiency thing."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "It's not a fundamentally new innovation."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "That's why when you're asking is a separate information storage medium a definition of life?"}, {"time": 2287, "text": "I'm like, no, any kind of self preservation, self reinforcement."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "And it didn't need to be RNA based initially."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "It didn't need to be self replication initially."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "You just need to have enough RNA molecules randomly arising that reinforce each other that ultimately lead to the, you know, the closing of that loop and the ignition of the evolutionary process."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "Can we just rewind a little bit?"}, {"time": 2313, "text": "Like if you were to bet all your money on the two options in terms of where life started at the bottom of the ocean."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "I don't know if this is answerable, but how hard is the first step or if there's something interesting you can say

the ingredients."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "It has, you know, the core that can emit energy."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "It has the shielding through the ice sheet, protecting it just like an atmosphere would."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "It even has a layer of oxygen, probably sufficiently dense to sustain life."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "So my guess is that there's probably independently a reason life form already teeming in Europa because as soon as it today."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "Is that exciting or terrifying to you?"}, {"time": 2390, "text": "It's, I mean, as a scientist, I can't wait to see non DNA based life forms."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "I can't wait because we are so born in, you know, sort of, as I would say in French, but basically we're sort of, you know, we

into another science fiction scenario."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "So on that point, if we discovered life on Europa and you were brought in, you seem very excited, but how would you start looking at that life in a way that's useful to you as a scientist, but also not going to kill all of us?"}, {"time": 2446, "text": "So like to me, it's a little bit scary because not, not because it's a malevolent life."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "Like it's a dictator petting like a cat, it's evil, but just the way life is, it seems to be very good at conquering other life."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "So there's a lot of science fiction movies based on that principle."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "And that's sort of what causes the public to be so scared."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "But if you think about sort of, would Europa life be scared of humans coming over and taking over?"}, {"time": 2472, "text": "Chances are no, not even like earth bacteria because earth bacteria would be wiped out in an instant in this foreign world because they don't know how to metabolize energy that doesn't come from the types of energy sources that are here."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "The levels of acidity may just kill us all off."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "And at the same way, in the converse way, if you bring life from Europa on earth, it'll die instantly because it's too hot or because it doesn't need to know how to cope with, I don't know, the sun's radiation so close to these completely inhabitable zone by their standards."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "So what we call the habitable zone might actually be the inhabitable zone."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "Inhabitable for them."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "So the difference, if the environments are sufficiently different, you think we'll just not be able to even attack each other and the basic."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "It'll take massive amounts of engineering to create machines that will go there and sample the oceans, basically drill

about that."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "Will it taste fine?"}, {"time": 2568, "text": "So the other question is, do we have taste receptors for this?"}, {"time": 2573, "text": "So where does our taste

about."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "So we won't be able to know that this chemical tastes funny."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "But you think it won't be, it's likely not to be dangerous."}, {"time": 2589,

sort of keeping things inside that are self."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "And there's a whole signature that you can see from that."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "So when I was organizing my meaning of life symposium, my friend who's an astrophysicist, basically we were deciding on what would be the themes for the symposium."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "And then I said, well, we're going to have biology,

basically look for this fight against physics for anything that sort of signatures of not just entropy at work, not just things diffusing away, not just gravitational pools, but clear signatures of,

against physics."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "But that's the first transformation."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "If you look at humans, we're way past that."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "What do you mean by transformation?"}, {"time": 2752, "text": "So basically there's layers."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "I sort of see life, you know, when we talk about the meaning of life, life can be construed at many levels."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "We talked about life in the simplest form of sort of the ignition of evolution."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "And that's sort of the basic definition that you can check

brain."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "And this massive brain is basically something that arises much, much later on."}, {"time": 3045, "text": "Basically, you know, notochords, like having the first

those transitions, I was just a kid being a kid."}, {"time": 6801, "text": "And maybe the time that I started seeing it that way was maybe when I decided to stay at MIT as a professor after having been there as a student."}, {"time": 6817, "text": "And I kind of saw the struggle of getting professors to not see you as a kid when they're your peers."}, {"time": 6825, "text": "And I was very flattered when one of my friends basically told me, oh, I remember you in recitation when you first asked me a question."}, {"time": 6831, "text": "I said, wow, this kid."}, {"time": 6831, "text": "I'll pay attention."}, {"time": 6838, "text": "One day I'll be a peer."}, {"time": 6840, "text": "So it's, you know, certainly my perception was that many of them could not see me as anything but a kid."}, {"time": 6845, "text": "But it turns out that some of them saw me as something different than a kid even before I was actually their colleague."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "So it's kind of an interesting place because what I like to say about MIT is that people treat you as equal no matter what stage."}, {"time": 6860, "text": "And they respect you for what you say, not for who you are

I'm a human first and a professor second."}, {"time": 7370, "text": "And I think this passion for life, this passion for, you know, everything around us."}, {"time": 7378, "text": "I mean, the only way to describe that is love."}, {"time": 7384, "text": "It's basically, you know, embracing your, you know, emotional self, embracing the, you know, the non brainiac in you, embracing the sort of intangible, the not very well defined."}, {"time": 7408, "text": "And even in my own research, I'm just very passionate about everything I do."}, {"time": 7414, "text": "You know, there's a certain passion that comes through."}, {"time": 7414, "text": "And what, I'm sorry, again, being Greek, the etymology of the word passion."}, {"time": 7419, "text": "What was passion?"}, {"time": 7419, "text": "Passion is suffering."}, {"time": 7426, "text": "The etymology, when we talk about the passion of the Christ, it's a suffering."}, {"time": 7430, "text": "And in the Greek version of that word, pathos, like pathology, pathos is deep suffering."}, {"time": 7430, "text": "It's the concept of someone who's sympathetic."}, {"time": 7439, "text": "Sympathetic means suffering together, experiencing emotions together."}, {"time": 7444, "text": "So it's funny that you ask me about love and I respond with passion, passion for life, passion for research, passion for my family, for my children, for, you know."}, {"time": 7454, "text": "So there's a certain passion that defines me and everything else follows rather than the other way around."}, {"time": 7465, "text": "I'm not first

kind of connects it to the suffering."}, {"time": 7481, "text": "So if you could remove the suffering."}, {"time": 7486, "text": "When I say suffering, I don't mean suffering as in being miserable."}, {"time": 7486, "text": "I mean suffering as in being emotionally invested in something."}, {"time": 7492, "text": "Remember, I mean, again, if you look at this poem, what is it saying?"}, {"time":
