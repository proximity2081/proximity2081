kind of simplified picture of colors and shapes existing in space and so on."}, {"time": 304, "text": "We know there's a, that's what the philosopher Wilfred Sellers called the manifest image."}, {"time": 309, "text": "The world as it seems to us, we already know underneath all that is a very different scientific image with atoms or quantum wave functions or super strings or whatever the latest thing is."}, {"time": 322, "text": "And that's the ultimate scientific reality."}, {"time": 324, "text": "So I think of the simulation idea as basically another hypothesis about what the ultimate say quasi scientific or metaphysical reality is going on underneath the world of the manifest image."}, {"time": 337, "text": "The world of the manifest image is this very simple thing that we interact with that's neutral on the underlying stuff of reality."}, {"time": 346, "text": "Science can help tell us about that."}, {"time": 348, "text": "Maybe philosophy can help tell us about that too."}, {"time": 351, "text": "And if we eventually take the red pill and find out we're in a simulation, my view is that's just another view about what reality is made of."}, {"time": 358, "text": "The philosopher Immanuel Kant said, what is the nature of the thing in itself?"}, {"time": 362, "text": "I've got a glass here and it's got all these, it appears to me a certain way, a certain shape, it's liquid, it's clear."}, {"time": 370, "text": "And he said, what is the nature of the thing in itself?"}, {"time": 374, "text": "Well, I think of the simulation idea, it's a hypothesis about the nature of the thing in itself."}, {"time": 378, "text": "It turns out if we're in a simulation, the thing in itself nature of this glass, it's okay, it's actually a bunch of data structures running on a computer in the next universe up."}, {"time": 388, "text": "Yeah, that's what people tend to do when they think about simulation."}, {"time": 391, "text": "They think about our modern computers and somehow trivially crudely just scaled up in some sense."}, {"time": 399, "text": "But do you think the simulation, I mean, in order to actually simulate something as complicated as our universe that's made up of molecules and atoms and particles and quarks and maybe even strings, all of that would require something just infinitely many orders of magnitude more of scale and complexity."}, {"time": 426, "text": "Do you think we're even able to even like conceptualize what it would take to simulate our universe?"}, {"time": 436, "text": "Or does it just slip into this idea that you basically have to build a universe, something so big to simulate it?"}, {"time": 444, "text": "Does it get this into this fuzzy area that's not useful at all?"}, {"time": 448, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, our universe is obviously incredibly complicated."}, {"time": 453, "text": "And for us within our universe to build a simulation of a universe as complicated as ours is gonna have obvious problems here."}, {"time": 462, "text": "If the universe is finite, there's just no way that's gonna work."}, {"time": 465, "text": "Maybe there's some cute way to make it work if the universe is infinite, maybe an infinite universe could somehow simulate a copy of itself, but that's gonna be hard."}, {"time": 477, "text": "Nonetheless, just that we are in a simulation, I think there's no particular reason why we have to think the simulating universe has to be anything like ours."}, {"time": 486, "text": "You've said before that it might be, so you could think of it in turtles all the way down."}, {"time": 492, "text": "You could think of the simulating universe different than ours, but we ourselves could also create another simulating universe."}, {"time": 500, "text": "So you said that there could be these kind of levels of universes."}, {"time": 504, "text": "And you've also mentioned this hilarious idea, maybe tongue in cheek, maybe not, that there may be simulations within simulations, arbitrarily stacked levels, and that there may be, that we may be in level 42."}, {"time": 518, "text": "Along those stacks, referencing Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe."}, {"time": 521, "text": "If we're indeed in a simulation within a simulation at level 42, what do you think level zero looks like?"}, {"time": 531, "text": "The originating universe."}, {"time": 532, "text": "I would expect that level zero is truly enormous."}, {"time": 535, "text": "I mean, not just, if it's finite, at some extraordinarily large finite capacity, much more likely it's infinite."}, {"time": 543, "text": "Maybe it's got some very high cardinality that enables it to support just any number of simulations."}, {"time": 551, "text": "So high degree of infinity at level zero, slightly smaller degree of infinity at level one."}, {"time": 558, "text": "So by the time you get down to us at level 42, maybe there's plenty of room for lots of simulations of finite capacity."}, {"time": 569, "text": "If the top universe is only a small finite capacity, then obviously that's gonna put very, very serious limits on how many simulations you're gonna be able to get running."}, {"time": 580, "text": "So I think we can certainly confidently say that if we're at level 42, then the top level's pretty damn big."}, {"time": 587, "text": "So it gets more and more constrained as we get down levels, more and more simplified and constrained and limited in resources."}, {"time": 594, "text": "Yeah, we still have plenty of capacity here."}, {"time": 596, "text": "What was it Feynman said?"}, {"time": 598, "text": "He said there's plenty of room at the bottom."}, {"time": 601, "text": "We're still a number of levels above the degree where there's room for fundamental computing, physical computing capacity, quantum computing capacity at the bottom level."}, {"time": 638, "text": "Do you think the human mind, us people, in terms of the complexity of simulation is at the height of what the simulation might be able to achieve?"}, {"time": 648, "text": "Like if you look at incredible entities that could be created in this universe of ours, do you have an intuition about how incredible human beings are on that scale?"}, {"time": 660, "text": "I think we're pretty impressive, but we're not that impressive."}, {"time": 663, "text": "Are we above average?"}, {"time": 666, "text": "I mean, I think human beings are at a certain point in the scale of intelligence, which made many things possible."}, {"time": 674, "text": "You get through evolution, through single cell organisms, through fish and mammals and primates, and something happens."}, {"time": 684, "text": "Once you get to human beings, we've just reached that level where we get to develop language, we get to develop certain kinds of culture, and we get to develop certain kinds of collective thinking that has enabled all this amazing stuff to happen, science and literature and engineering and culture and so on."}, {"time": 703, "text": "So we had just at the beginning of that on the evolutionary threshold, it's kind of like we just got there, who knows, a few thousand or tens of thousands of years ago."}, {"time": 714, "text": "So we're probably just at the very beginning for what's possible there."}, {"time": 717, "text": "So I'm inclined to think among the scale of intelligent beings, we're somewhere very near the bottom."}, {"time": 725, "text": "I would expect that, for example, if we're in a simulation, then the simulators who created us have got the capacity to be far more sophisticated."}, {"time": 734, "text": "If we're at level 42, who knows what the ones at level zero are like."}, {"time": 739, "text": "It's also possible that this is the epitome of what is possible to achieve."}, {"time": 744, "text": "So we as human beings see ourselves maybe as flawed, see all the constraints, all the limitations, but maybe that's the magical, the beautiful thing."}, {"time": 752, "text": "Maybe those limitations are the essential elements for an interesting sort of that edge of chaos, that interesting existence, that if you make us much more intelligent, if you make us much more powerful in any kind of dimension of performance, maybe you lose something fundamental that makes life worth living."}, {"time": 775, "text": "So you kind of have this optimistic view that we're this little baby, that then there's so much growth and potential, but this could also be it."}, {"time": 785, "text": "This is the most amazing thing is us."}, {"time": 789, "text": "Maybe what you're saying is consistent with what I'm saying."}, {"time": 792, "text": "I mean, we could still have levels of intelligence far beyond us, but maybe those levels of intelligence on your view would be kind of boring."}, {"time": 799, "text": "And we kind of get so good at everything that life suddenly becomes uni dimensional."}, {"time": 804, "text": "So we're just inhabiting this one spot of like maximal romanticism in the history of evolution."}, {"time": 810, "text": "You get to humans and it's like, yeah, and then years to come, our super intelligent descendants are gonna look back at us and say, those were the days when they just hit the point of inflection and life was interesting."}, {"time": 822, "text": "I am an optimist."}, {"time": 823, "text": "So I'd like to think that if there is super intelligent somewhere in the future, they'll figure out how to make life super interesting and super romantic."}, {"time": 832, "text": "Well, you know what they're gonna do."}, {"time": 834, "text": "So what they're gonna do is they realize how boring life is when you're super intelligent."}, {"time": 838, "text": "So they create a new level of assimilation and sort of live through the things they've created by watching them stumble about in their flawed ways."}, {"time": 850, "text": "So maybe that's, so you create a new level of assimilation every time you get really bored with how smart and."}, {"time": 857, "text": "This would be kind of sad though, because if we showed the peak of their existence would be like watching simulations for entertainment."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Not like saying the peak of our existence now is Netflix."}, {"time": 866, "text": "No, it's all right."}, {"time": 867, "text": "A flip side of that could be the peak of our existence for many people having children and watching them grow."}, {"time": 874, "text": "That becomes very meaningful."}, {"time": 875, "text": "Okay, you create a simulation that's like creating a family."}, {"time": 878, "text": "Creating like, well, any kind of creation is kind of a powerful act."}, {"time": 883, "text": "Do you think it's easier to simulate the mind or the universe?"}, {"time": 887, "text": "So I've heard several people, including Nick Bostrom, think about ideas of maybe you don't need to simulate the universe, you can just simulate the human mind."}, {"time": 897, "text": "Or in general, just the distinction between simulating the entirety of it, the entirety of the physical world, or just simulating the mind."}, {"time": 906, "text": "Which one do you see as more challenging?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "Well, I think in some sense, the answer is obvious."}, {"time": 912, "text": "It has to be simpler to simulate the mind than to simulate the universe, because the mind is part of the universe."}, {"time": 918, "text": "And in order to fully simulate the universe, you're gonna have to simulate the mind."}, {"time": 922, "text": "So unless we're talking about partial simulations."}, {"time": 925, "text": "And I guess the question is which comes first?"}, {"time": 927, "text": "Does the mind come before the universe or does the universe come before the mind?"}, {"time": 932, "text": "So the mind could just be an emergent phenomena in this universe."}, {"time": 937, "text": "So simulation is an interesting thing that it's not like creating a simulation perhaps requires you to program every single thing that happens in it."}, {"time": 951, "text": "It's just defining a set of initial conditions and rules based on which it behaves."}, {"time": 959, "text": "Simulating the mind requires you to have a little bit more, we're now in a little bit of a crazy land, but it requires you to understand the fundamentals of cognition, perhaps of consciousness, of perception of everything like that, that's not created through some kind of emergence from basic physics laws, but more requires you to actually understand the fundamentals of the mind."}, {"time": 989, "text": "How about if we said to simulate the brain?"}, {"time": 991, "text": "The brain."}, {"time": 992, "text": "Rather than the mind."}, {"time": 993, "text": "So the brain is just a big physical system."}, {"time": 996, "text": "The universe is a giant physical system."}, {"time": 998, "text": "To simulate the universe at the very least, you're gonna have to simulate the brains as well as all the other physical systems within it."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "And it's not obvious that the problems are any worse for the brain than for, it's a particularly complex physical system."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "But if we can simulate arbitrary physical systems, we can simulate brains."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "There is this further question of whether, when you simulate a brain, will that bring along all the features of the mind with it?"}, {"time": 1027, "text": "Like will you get consciousness?"}, {"time": 1028, "text": "Will you get thinking?"}, {"time": 1029, "text": "Will you get free will?"}, {"time": 1032, "text": "And that's something philosophers have argued over for years."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "My own view is if you simulate the brain well enough, that will also simulate the mind."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "But yeah, there's plenty of people who would say no."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "You'd merely get like a zombie system, a simulation of a brain without any true consciousness."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "But for you, you put together a brain, the consciousness comes with it, arise."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Yeah, I don't think it's obvious."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "That's your intuition."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "My view is roughly that yeah, what is responsible for consciousness, it's in the patterns of information processing and so on rather than say the biology that it's made of."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "There's certainly plenty of people out there who think consciousness has to be say biological."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "So if you merely replicate the patterns of information processing in a nonbiological substrate, you'll miss what's crucial for consciousness."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "I mean, I just don't think there's any particular reason to think that biology is special here."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "You can imagine substituting the biology for nonbiological systems, say silicon circuits that play the same role."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "The behavior will continue to be the same."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And I think just thinking about what is the true, when I think about the connection, the isomorphisms between consciousness and the brain, the deepest connections to me seem to connect consciousness to patterns of information processing, not to specific biology."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "So I at least adopted as my working hypothesis that basically it's the computation and the information that matters for consciousness."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "Same time, we don't understand consciousness, so all this could be wrong."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "So the computation, the flow, the processing, manipulation of information, the process is where the consciousness, the software is where the consciousness comes from, not the hardware."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "Roughly the software, yeah."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "The patterns of information processing at least in the hardware, which we could view as software."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "It may not be something you can just like program and load and erase and so on in the way we can with ordinary software, but it's something at the level of information processing rather than at the level of implementation."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "So on that, what do you think of the experience of self, just the experience of the world in a virtual world, in virtual reality?"}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Is it possible that we can create sort of offsprings of our consciousness by existing in a virtual world long enough?"}, {"time": 1178, "text": "So yeah, can we be conscious in the same kind of deep way that we are in this real world by hanging out in a virtual world?"}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Yeah, well, the kind of virtual worlds we have now are interesting but limited in certain ways."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "In particular, they rely on us having a brain and so on, which is outside the virtual world."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "Maybe I'll strap on my VR headset or just hang out in a virtual world on a screen, but my brain and then my physical environment might be simulated if I'm in a virtual world, but right now, there's no attempt to simulate my brain."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "There might be some non player characters in these virtual worlds that have simulated cognitive systems of certain kinds that dictate their behavior, but mostly, they're pretty simple right now."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "I mean, some people are trying to combine, put a bit of AI in their non player characters to make them smarter, but for now, inside virtual world, the actual thinking is interestingly distinct from the physics of those virtual worlds."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "In a way, actually, I like to think this is kind of reminiscent of the way that Descartes thought our physical world was."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "There's physics, and there's the mind, and they're separate."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "To linger on it a little bit, I find virtual reality really incredibly powerful, just even the crude virtual reality we have now of perhaps there's psychological effects that make some people more amenable to virtual worlds than others, but I find myself wanting to stay in virtual worlds for the most part."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "With a headset or on a desktop?"}, {"time": 1352, "text": "No, with a headset."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "Really interesting, because I am totally addicted to using the internet and things on a desktop, but when it comes to VR, with a headset, I don't typically use it for more than 10 or 20 minutes."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "There's something just slightly aversive about it, I find, so I don't, right now, even though I have Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest and HTC Vive and Samsung, this and that."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "You just don't wanna stay in that world for long."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "Not for extended periods."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "You actually find yourself hanging out in that."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Something about, it's both a combination of just imagination and considering the possibilities of where this goes in the future."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "It feels like I want to almost prepare my brain for it."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "I wanna explore sort of Disneyland when it's first being built in the early days, and it feels like I'm walking around almost imagining the possibilities, and something through that process allows my mind to really enter into that world, but you say that the brain is external to that virtual world."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "It is, strictly speaking, true, but..."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "If you're in VR and you do brain surgery on an avatar, and you're gonna open up that skull, what are you gonna find?"}, {"time": 1433, "text": "Sorry, nothing there."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "The brain is elsewhere."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "You don't think it's possible to kind of separate them, and I don't mean in a sense like Descartes, like a hard separation, but basically, do you think it's possible with the brain outside of the virtual rhythm, when you're wearing a headset, create a new consciousness for prolonged periods of time?"}, {"time": 1459, "text": "Really feel, like really, like forget that your brain is outside."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "So this is, okay, this is gonna be the case where the brain is still outside."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "It's still outside."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "But could living in the VR, I mean, we already find this, right, with video games."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "They're completely immersive, and you get taken up by living in those worlds, and it becomes your reality for a while."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "So they're not completely immersive, they're just very immersive."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "Completely immersive."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "You don't forget the external world, no."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Exactly, so that's what I'm asking."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "Do you think it's almost possible to really forget the external world?"}, {"time": 1495, "text": "Really, really immerse yourself."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "To forget completely?"}, {"time": 1499, "text": "Why would we forget?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "We got pretty good memories."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "Maybe you can stop paying attention to the external world, but this already happens a lot."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "I go to work, and maybe I'm not paying attention to my home life."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "I go to a movie, and I'm immersed in that."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "So that degree of immersion, absolutely."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "But we still have the capacity to remember it, to completely forget the external world."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "I'm thinking that would probably take some, I don't know, some pretty serious drugs or something to make your brain do that."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "Is that possible?"}, {"time": 1528, "text": "So, I mean, I guess what I'm getting at is consciousness truly a property that's tied to the physical brain?"}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Or can you create sort of different offspring, copies of consciousnesses based on the worlds that you enter?"}, {"time": 1549, "text": "Well, the way we're doing it now, at least with a standard VR, there's just one brain."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "Interacts with the physical world."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "Plays a video game, puts on a video headset, interacts with this virtual world."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And I think we'd typically say there's one consciousness here that nonetheless undergoes different environments, takes on different characters in different environments."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "This is already something that happens in the nonvirtual world."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "I might interact one way in my home life, my work life, my social life, and so on."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "So at the very least, that will happen in a virtual world very naturally."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "People sometimes adopt the character of avatars very different from themselves, maybe even a different gender, different race, different social background."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "So that much is certainly possible."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "I would see that as a single consciousness is taking on different personas."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "If you want literal splitting of consciousness into multiple copies, I think it's gonna take something more radical than that."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "Like maybe you can run different simulations of your brain in different realities and then expose them to different histories."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "And then you'd split yourself into 10 different simulated copies, which then undergo different environments and then ultimately do become 10 very different consciousnesses."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "Maybe that could happen, but now we're not talking about something that's possible in the near term."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "We're gonna have to have brain simulations and AGI for that to happen."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "So before any of that happens, it's fundamentally you see it as a singular consciousness, even though it's experiencing different environments, virtual or not, it's still connected to same set of memories, same set of experiences and therefore, one sort of joint conscious system."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "Yeah, or at least no more multiple than the kind of multiple consciousness that we get from inhabiting different environments in a non virtual world."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "So you said as a child, you were a music color synesthete."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So where songs had colors for you."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "So what songs had what colors?"}, {"time": 1679, "text": "You know, this is funny."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "I didn't pay much attention to this at the time, but I'd listen to a piece of music and I'd get some kind of imagery of a kind of color."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "The weird thing is mostly they were kind of murky, dark greens and olive browns and the colors weren't all that interesting."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "I don't know what the reason is."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "I mean, my theory is that maybe it's like different chords and tones provided different colors and they all tended to get mixed together into these somewhat uninteresting browns and greens."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "But every now and then there'd be something that had a really pure color."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "So there's just a few that I remember."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "There was a Here, There and Everywhere by the Beatles was bright red and has this very distinctive tonality and it's called structure at the beginning."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "So that was bright red."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "There was this song by the Alan Parsons Project called Ammonia Avenue that was kind of a pure, a pure blue."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Anyway, I've got no idea how this happened."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "I didn't even pay that much attention until it went away when I was about 20."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "This synesthesia often goes away."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "So is it purely just the perception of a particular color or was there a positive or negative experience?"}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Like was blue associated with a positive and red with a negative?"}, {"time": 1757, "text": "Or is it simply the perception of color associated with some characteristic of the song?"}, {"time": 1763, "text": "For me, I don't remember a lot of association with emotion or with value."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "It was just this kind of weird and interesting fact."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "I mean, at the beginning, I thought this was something that happened to everyone, songs of colors."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "Maybe I mentioned it once or twice and people said, nope."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "I thought it was kind of cool when there was one that had one of these especially pure colors, but only much later once I became a grad student thinking about the mind that I read about this phenomenon called synesthesia and I was like, hey, that's what I had."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "And now I occasionally talk about it in my classes, in intro class and it still happens sometimes."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "A student comes up and says, hey, I have that."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "I never knew about that."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "I never knew it had a name."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "You said that it went away at age 20 or so."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "And that you have a journal entry from around then saying, songs don't have colors anymore."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "Yeah, it was definitely sad that it was gone."}, {"time": 1818,

very natural to take this view that if we're in a simulation or evil demon scenario or something, then none of this is real."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "But I think it may be ultimately a philosophical

system that produces all of our behavior."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "And if that's possible, I'm sure vastly many other computational systems of equal or greater sophistication are possible with all of our cognitive functions and more."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "My inclination is to think that once you've got all these cognitive functions, perception, attention, reasoning, introspection, language, emotion, and so on, it's very likely you'll have consciousness as well."}, {"time": 5089, "text": "So at least it's very hard for me to see how you'd have a system that had all those things

role of consciousness in the physical world, what it does."}, {"time": 5114, "text": "I mean, just say it turns out consciousness does something very specific in the physical world like collapsing wave functions as on one common interpretation of quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 5124, "text": "Then ultimately we might find some place where it actually makes a difference and we could say, ah, here is where in collapsing wave functions it's driving the behavior of a system."}, {"time": 5132, "text": "And maybe it could even turn out that for AGI, you'd need something playing that."}, {"time": 5139, "text": "I mean, if you wanted to connect this to free will, some people think consciousness collapsing wave functions, that would be how the conscious mind exerts effect on the physical world and exerts its free will."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "And maybe it could turn out that any AGI that didn't utilize that mechanism would be limited in the kinds of functionality that it had."}, {"time": 5159, "text": "I don't myself find that plausible."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "I think probably that functionality could be simulated."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "But you can imagine once we had a very specific idea about the role of consciousness in the physical world, this would have some impact on the capacity of AGI's."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And if it was a role that could not be duplicated elsewhere, then we'd have to find some way to either get consciousness in the system to play that role or to simulate it."}, {"time": 5185, "text": "If we can isolate a particular role to consciousness, of course, it seems like an incredibly difficult thing."}, {"time": 5195, "text": "Do you have worries about existential threats of conscious intelligent beings that are not us?"},

kinds of existential threats here."}, {"time": 5218, "text": "One is an existential threat to consciousness generally."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "I mean, yes, I care about humans and the survival of humans and so on, but just say it turns out that eventually we're replaced by some artificial beings that aren't humans, but are somehow our successors."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "They still have good lives."}, {"time": 5236, "text": "They still do interesting and wonderful things with the universe."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "I don't think that's not so bad."}, {"time": 5243, "text": "That's just our successors."}, {"time": 5244, "text": "We were one stage in evolution."}, {"time": 5246, "text": "Something different, maybe better came next."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "If on the other hand, all of consciousness was wiped out, that would be a very serious moral disaster."}, {"time": 5256, "text": "One way that could happen is by all intelligent life being wiped out."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "And many people think that, yeah, once you get to humans and AIs and amazing sophistication where everyone has got the ability to create weapons that can destroy the whole universe just by pressing a button, then maybe it's inevitable all intelligent life will die out."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "That would certainly be a disaster."}, {"time": 5283, "text": "And we've got to think very hard about how to avoid that."}, {"time": 5286, "text": "But yeah, another interesting kind of disaster is that maybe intelligent life is not wiped out, but all consciousness is wiped out."}, {"time": 5294, "text": "So just say your thought, unlike what I was saying a moment ago, that there are two different kinds of intelligent systems, some which are conscious and some which are not."}, {"time": 5305, "text": "And just say it turns out that we create AGI with a high degree of intelligence, meaning high degree of sophistication and its behavior, but with no consciousness at all."}, {"time": 5317,

people have called this the zombie apocalypse because it's an apocalypse for consciousness."}, {"time": 5330, "text": "Consciousness is gone."}, {"time": 5331, "text": "You've merely got this super intelligent, nonconscious robots."}, {"time": 5334, "text": "And I would say that's a moral disaster in the same way, in almost the same way that the world with no intelligent life is a moral disaster."}, {"time": 5342, "text": "All value and meaning may be gone from that world."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "So these are both threats to watch out for."}, {"time": 5349, "text": "Now, my own view is if you get super intelligence, you're almost certainly gonna bring consciousness with it."}, {"time": 5353, "text": "So I hope that's not gonna happen."}, {"time": 5355, "text": "But of course, I don't understand consciousness."}, {"time": 5358, "text": "No one understands consciousness."}, {"time": 5360, "text": "This is one reason for, this is one reason at least among many for thinking very seriously about consciousness and thinking about the kind of future we want to create in a world with humans and or AIs."}, {"time": 5373, "text": "How do you feel about the possibility if consciousness so naturally does come with AGI systems that we are just a step in the evolution?"}, {"time": 5382, "text": "That we will be just something, a blimp on the record that'll be studied in books by the AGI systems centuries from now?"}, {"time": 5391, "text": "I mean, I think I'd probably be okay with that, especially if somehow humans are continuous with AGI."}, {"time": 5398,

cognitive system, point to some parts that had some roots in us and trace a continuous line there."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "That would be selfishly nice for me to think that, okay, I'm connected to

that so much worse?"}, {"time": 5465, "text": "We're still at least part of a causal chain of design."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "And yes, they're not humans, but still they're our successes."},
