[{"title": "John Carmack: Doom, Quake, VR, AGI, Programming, Video Games, and Rockets | Lex Fridman Podcast #309", "id": "I845O57ZSy4", "quotes": [{"time": 262, "text": "So print John Carmack, when is the first time, if we could talk about love, that you fell in love with programming?"}, {"time": 271, "text": "You said like, this is really something special."}, {"time": 274, "text": "It really was something that was one of those love at first sight things where just really from the time that I understood what a computer was even, I mean, I remember looking through old encyclopedias of the black and white photos of the IBM mainframes at the reel to reel tape decks."}, {"time": 290, "text": "And for people nowadays, it can be a little hard to understand what the world was like then from information gathering where I would go to the libraries and there would be a couple books on the shelf about computers and they would be very out of date even at that point, just not a lot of information, but I would grab everything that I could find and devour everything."}, {"time": 310, "text": "Whenever Time or Newsweek had some article about computers, I would like cut it out with scissors and put it somewhere."}, {"time": 316, "text": "It just, it felt like this magical thing to me, this idea that the computer would just do exactly what you told it to."}, {"time": 324, "text": "I mean, and there's a little bit of the genie monkey's paw sort of issues there where you'd better be really, really careful with what you're telling it to do, but it wasn't gonna back talk you."}, {"time": 333, "text": "It wasn't gonna have a different point of view."}, {"time": 334, "text": "It was gonna carry out what you told it to do."}, {"time": 337, "text": "And if you had the right commands, you could make it do these pretty magical things."}, {"time": 343, "text": "And so what kind of programs did you write at first?"}, {"time": 346, "text": "So beyond the print, John Carmack."}, {"time": 348, "text": "So I can remember as going through the learning process where you find at the start, you're just learning how to do the most basic possible things."}, {"time": 356, "text": "And I can remember stuff like a Superman comic that RadioShack commissioned to have, it's like Superman had lost some of his super brain and kids had to use RadioShack TRS 80 computers to do calculations for it to help him kind of complete his heroics."}, {"time": 371, "text": "And I'd find little things like that and then get a few basic books to be able to kind of work my way up."}, {"time": 380, "text": "And again, it was so precious back then."}, {"time": 382, "text": "I had a couple of books that would teach me important things about it."}, {"time": 385, "text": "I had one book that I could start to learn a little bit of assembly language from, and I'd have a few books on basic and some things that I could get from the libraries."}, {"time": 394, "text": "But my goals in the early days was almost always making games of various kinds."}, {"time": 400, "text": "I loved the arcade games and the early Atari 2600 games."}, {"time": 404, "text": "And being able to do some of those things myself on the computers was very much what I aspired to."}, {"time": 411, "text": "And it was a whole journey where if you learn normal basic, you can't do any kind of an action game."}, {"time": 416, "text": "You can write an adventure game."}, {"time": 417, "text": "You can write things where you say, what do you do here?"}, {"time": 420, "text": "I get sword attack troll, that type of thing."}, {"time": 423, "text": "And that can be done in the context of basic."}, {"time": 427, "text": "But to do things that had moving graphics, there were only the most limited things you could possibly do."}, {"time": 432, "text": "You could maybe do breakout or pong or that sort of thing in low resolution graphics."}, {"time": 436, "text": "And in fact, one of my first sort of major technical hacks that I was kind of fond of was on the Apple II computers, they had a mode called low resolution graphics where of course all graphics were low resolution back then, but regular low resolution graphics, it was a grid of 40 by 40 pixels normally, but they could have 16 different colors."}, {"time": 459, "text": "And I wanted to make a game kind of like the arcade game Vanguard, just a scrolling game."}, {"time": 464, "text": "And I wanted to just kind of have it scroll vertically up."}, {"time": 467, "text": "And I could move a little ship around."}, {"time": 469, "text": "You could manage to do that in basic, but there's no way you could redraw the whole screen."}, {"time": 473, "text": "And I remember at the time just coming up with what felt like a brainstorm to me where I knew enough about the way the hardware was controlled where the text screen and the low resolution graphics screen were basically the same thing."}, {"time": 486, "text": "And all those computers could scroll their text screen reasonably."}, {"time": 490, "text": "You could do a listing and it would scroll things up."}, {"time": 492, "text": "And I figured out that I could kind of tweak just a couple things that I barely understood to put it into a graphics mode and I could draw graphics and then I could just do a line feed at the very bottom of the screen."}, {"time": 504, "text": "And then the system would scroll it all up using an assembly language routine that I didn't know how to write back then."}, {"time": 510, "text": "So that was like this first great hack that sort of had analogs later on in my career for a lot of different things."}, {"time": 517, "text": "So I found out that I could draw a screen."}, {"time": 519, "text": "I could do a line feed at the bottom."}, {"time": 520, "text": "It would scroll it up once."}, {"time": 522, "text": "I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom."}, {"time": 524, "text": "And that was my first way to kind of scroll the screen, which was interesting in that that played a big part later on in the id Software days as well."}, {"time": 533, "text": "So do efficient drawing where you don't have to draw the whole screen, but you draw from the bottom using the thing that was designed in the hardware for text output."}, {"time": 545, "text": "Where so much of, until recently, game design was limited by what you could actually get the computer to do."}, {"time": 553, "text": "Where it's easy to say, OK, I want to scroll the screen."}, {"time": 556, "text": "You just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset."}, {"time": 559, "text": "And nowadays, that works just fine."}, {"time": 561, "text": "Computers are ludicrously fast."}, {"time": 564, "text": "But up until a decade ago or so, there were all these things everybody wanted to do."}, {"time": 570, "text": "But if they knew enough programming to be able to make it happen, it would happen too slow to be a good experience."}, {"time": 576, "text": "Either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough that it wasn't fun to experience it like that."}, {"time": 582, "text": "So much of the first couple of decades of the programming work that I did was largely figuring out how to do something that everybody knows how they want it to happen."}, {"time": 591, "text": "It just has to happen 2 to 10 times faster than the straightforward way of doing things would make it happen."}, {"time": 598, "text": "And it's different now because at this point, lots of things you can just do in the most naive possible way, and it still works out."}, {"time": 606, "text": "You don't have nearly the creative limitations or the incentives for optimizing on that level."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And there's a lot of pros and cons to that."}, {"time": 614, "text": "But I do generally, I'm not going to do the angry old man shaking my fist at the clouds bit where back in my day, programmers had to do real programming."}, {"time": 623, "text": "It's amazing that you can just pick an idea and go do it right now."}, {"time": 627, "text": "And you don't have to be some assembly language wizard or deep GPU arcanist to be able to figure out how to make your wishes happen."}, {"time": 635, "text": "Well, there's still, see, that's true."}, {"time": 638, "text": "But let me put on my old man with a fist hat and say that probably the thing that will define the future still requires you to operate at the limits of the current system."}, {"time": 649, "text": "So we'll probably talk about this."}, {"time": 651, "text": "But if you talk about building the metaverse and building a VR experience that's compelling, it probably requires you to not, to go to assembly or maybe not literally, but sort of spiritually to go to the limits of what the system is capable of."}, {"time": 668, "text": "And that really was why virtual reality was specifically interesting to me where it had all the ties to, you could say that even back in the early days, I have some old magazine articles that's talking about Doom as a virtual reality experience back when just seeing anything in 3D."}, {"time": 685, "text": "So you could say that we've been trying to build those virtual experiences from the very beginning."}, {"time": 689, "text": "And in the modern era of virtual reality, especially on the mobile side of things, when it's standalone and you're basically using a cell phone chip to be able to produce these very immersive experiences, it does require work."}, {"time": 703, "text": "It's not at the level of what an old school console game programmer would have operated at where you're looking at hardware registers and you're scheduling all the DMA accesses, but it is still definitely a different level than what a web developer or even a PC Steam game developer usually has to work at."}, {"time": 721, "text": "And again, it's great."}, {"time": 722, "text": "There's opportunities for people that wanna operate at either end of that spectrum there and still provide a lot of value to the world."}, {"time": 729, "text": "Let me ask you sort of a big question about preference."}, {"time": 735, "text": "What would you say is the best programming language?"}, {"time": 739, "text": "Your favorite, but also the best."}, {"time": 742, "text": "You've seen throughout your career, you're considered by many to be the greatest programmer ever."}, {"time": 749, "text": "I mean, it's so difficult to place that label on anyone, but if you put it on anyone, it's you."}, {"time": 754, "text": "So let me ask you these kind of ridiculous questions of what's the best band of all time, but in your case, what's the best programming language?"}, {"time": 761, "text": "Everything has all the caveats about it."}, {"time": 763, "text": "But so what I use, so nowadays I do program a reasonable amount of Python for AI, ML sorts of work."}, {"time": 772, "text": "I'm not a native Python programmer."}, {"time": 774, "text": "It's something I came to very late in my career."}, {"time": 777, "text": "I understand what it's good for."}, {"time": 778, "text": "But you don't dream in Python."}, {"time": 780, "text": "I do not."}, {"time": 780, "text": "And it has some of those things where there's some amazing stats when you say, if you just start, if you make a loop, a triply nested loop and start doing operations in Python, you can be thousands to potentially a million times slower than a proper GPU tensor operation."}, {"time": 797, "text": "And these are staggering numbers."}, {"time": 799, "text": "You can be as much slower as we've almost gotten faster in our pace of progress and all this other miraculous stuff."}, {"time": 806, "text": "So your intuitions about inefficiencies within the Python sort of..."}, {"time": 810, "text": "It keeps hitting me upside the face where it's gotten to the point now I understand."}, {"time": 814, "text": "It's like, okay, you just can't do a loop if you care about performance in Python."}, {"time": 818, "text": "You have to figure out how you can reformat this into some big vector operation or something that's going to be done completely within a C++ library."}, {"time": 827, "text": "But the other hand is it's amazingly convenient and you just see stuff that people are able to cobble together by you just import a few different things and you can do stuff that nobody on earth could do 10 years ago."}, {"time": 838, "text": "And you can do it in a little cookbook thing that you copy paste it out of a website."}, {"time": 842, "text": "So that is really great."}, {"time": 844, "text": "When I'm sitting down to do what I consider kind of serious programming, it's still in C++."}, {"time": 850, "text": "And it's really kind of a C flavored C++ at that where I'm not big into the modern template metaprogramming sorts of things."}, {"time": 858, "text": "I see a lot of train wrecks coming from some of that over abstraction."}, {"time": 863, "text": "I spent a few years really going kind of deep into the kind of the historical Lisp work and Haskell and some of the functional programming sides of things."}, {"time": 873, "text": "And there is a lot of value there in the way you think about things."}, {"time": 878, "text": "And I changed a lot of the way I write my C and C++ code based on what I learned about the value that comes out of not having this random mutable state that you kind of lose track of."}, {"time": 890, "text": "Because something that many people don't really appreciate till they've been at it for a long time is that it's not the writing of the program initially, it's the whole lifespan of the program."}, {"time": 900, "text": "And that's when it's not necessarily just how fast you wrote it or how fast it operates, but it's how can it bend and adapt as situations change."}, {"time": 909, "text": "And then the thing that I've really been learning in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work is it's also how well it hands off between the continuous kind of revolving door of programmers taking over maintenance and different things and how you get people up to speed in different areas."}, {"time": 924, "text": "And there's all these other different aspects of it."}, {"time": 927, "text": "So C++ is a good language for handover between engineers."}, {"time": 932, "text": "Probably not the best."}, {"time": 959, "text": "And if you know C, you can generally jump in someplace and not have to learn what paradigms they're using because there just aren't that many available."}, {"time": 968, "text": "I think there's some really, really well written C code."}, {"time": 972, "text": "Like I find it great that if I'm messing around with something in open BSD say, I mean, I can be walking around in the kernel and I'm like, I understand everything that's going on here."}, {"time": 982, "text": "It's not hard for me to figure out what I need to do to make whatever change that I need to while you can have more significant languages."}, {"time": 992, "text": "Like it's a downside of Lisp where I don't regret the time that I spent with Lisp."}, {"time": 997, "text": "I think that it did help my thinking about programming in some ways, but the people that are the biggest defenders of Lisp are saying how malleable of a language it is that if you write a huge Lisp program, you've basically invented your own kind of language and structure because it's not the primitives of the language you're using very much."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "It's all of the things you've built on top of that."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "And then a language like Racket, kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions, it's essentially touted as a language for building other languages."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "And I understand the value of that for a tiny little project, but the idea of that for one of these longterm supported by lots of people kind of horrifies me where all of those abstractions that you're like, okay, you can't touch this code till you educate yourself on all of these things that we've built on top of that."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "And it was interesting to see how when Google made Go, a lot of the criticisms of that are it's like, wow, this is not a state of the art language."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "This language is just so simple and almost crude."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "And you could see the programming language people just looking down at it."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "But it does seem to be quite popular as basically saying, this is the good things about C, everybody can just jump right in and use it."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "You don't need to restructure your brain to write good code in it."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So I wish that I had more opportunity for doing some work in Go."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "Rust is the other modern language that everybody talks about that I'm not fit to pass judgment on."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "I've done a little bit beyond Hello World."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "I wrote some like video decompression work in Rust just as an exercise, but that was a few years ago and I haven't really used it since."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "The best programming language is the one that works generally that you're currently using."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "Because that's another trap is in almost every case I've seen when people mixed languages on a project, that's a mistake."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "I would rather stay just in one language so that everybody can work across the entire thing."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "And we have, I get meta, we have a lot of projects that use kind of React frameworks."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "So you've got JavaScript here and then you have C++ for real work."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And then you may have Java interfacing with some other part of the Android system."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "And those are all kind of horrible things."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "And that was one thing that I remember talking with Boz at Facebook about it where like, man, I wish we could have just said, we're only hiring C++ programmers."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "And he just thought from the Facebook meta perspective, well, we just wouldn't be able to find enough."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "With the thousands of programmers they've got there, it is not necessarily a dying breed, but you can sure find a lot more Java or JavaScript programmers."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "And I kind of mentioned that to Elon one time and he was kind of flabbergasted about that."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "It's like, well, you just, you go out and you find those programmers and you don't hire the other programmers that don't do the languages that you wanna use."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "But right now, I guess, yeah, they're using JavaScript on a bunch of the SpaceX work for the UI side of things."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "When you go find UI programmers, they're JavaScript programmers."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "I wonder if that's because there's a lot of JavaScript programmers."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "Because I do think that great programmers are rare."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "That it's not, you know, if you just look at statistics of how many people are using different programming languages, that doesn't tell you the story of what the great programmers are using."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "And so you have to really look at what you were speaking to, which is the fundamentals of a language."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "What does it encourage?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "How does it encourage you to think?"}, {"time": 1203, "text": "What kind of systems does it encourage you to build?"}, {"time": 1205, "text": "There is something about C++ that has elements of creativity, but forces you to be an adult about your programming."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "It expects you to be an adult."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "It does not force you to."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "And so it brings out people that are willing to be creative in terms of building large systems and coming up with interesting solutions, but at the same time have the sort of the good software engineering practices that amend themselves to real world systems."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "Let me ask you about this other language, JavaScript."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "So if we, you know, aliens visit in thousands of years, and humans are long gone, something tells me that most of the systems they find will be run by humans."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "Will be running JavaScript."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "I kind of think that if we're living in a simulation, it's written in JavaScript."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "You know, for the longest time, even still, JavaScript didn't get any respect, and yet it runs so much of the world, and an increasing number of the world."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "Is it possible that everything will be written in JavaScript one day?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So the engineering under JavaScript is really pretty phenomenal."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "The systems that make JavaScript run as fast as it does right now are kind of miracles of modern engineering in many ways."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "It does feel like it is not an optimal language for all the things that it's being used for, or an optimal distribution system to build huge apps in something like this without type systems and so on."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "But I think for a lot of people, it does reasonably the necessary things."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "It's still a C flavored language."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "It's still a braces and semicolon language."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "It's not hard for people to be trained in JavaScript and then understand the roots of where it came from."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing for most programs to be written in."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "It's funny that I still, just this morning, I was seeing a Twitter thread of a bunch of really senior game dev people arguing about the virtues and costs of garbage collection."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "You will run into some people that are top notch programmers that just say, no, this is literally not a good thing."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "Oh, because it makes you lazy?"}, {"time": 1345, "text": "Yes, that it makes you not think about things."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And I do disagree."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "I think that there is so much objective data on the vulnerabilities that have happened in C and C++ programs, sometimes written by the best programmers in the world."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "It's like nobody is good enough to avoid ever shooting themselves in the foot with that."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "You write enough C code, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "And garbage collection is a very great thing for the vast majority of programs."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "It's only when you get into the tightest of real time things that you start saying, it's like, no, the garbage collection has more costs than it has benefits for me there, but that's not 99 plus percent of all the software in the world."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So JavaScript is not terrible in those ways."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And so much of programming is not the language itself."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "It's the infrastructure around that surrounds it."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "All the libraries that you can get and the different stuff that you can, ways you can deploy it, the portability that it gives you."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "But it's again, I have to caution myself to not be the in the good old days old man about it because clearly there's enormous value here."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "The world does run on JavaScript to a pretty good approximation there and it's not falling apart."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "There's a bunch of scary stuff where you look at console logs and you just see all of these bad things that are happening but it's still kind of limping along and nobody really notices."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "But so much of my systems design and systems analysis goes around."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "You should understand what the speed of light is, like what would be the best you could possibly do here."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "And it sounds horrible, but in a lot of cases, you can be a thousand times off your speed of light, velocity for something and it's still be okay."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And in fact, it can even sometimes still be the optimal thing in a larger system standpoint where there's a lot of things that you don't wanna have to parachute in someone like me to go in and say, make this webpage run a thousand times faster, make this web app into a hardcore native application that starts up in 37 milliseconds and everything responds in less than one frame latency."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "That's just not necessary."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "And if somebody wants to go pay me millions of dollars to do software like that, when they can take somebody right out of a bootcamp and say, spin up an application for this."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "Often being efficient is not really the best metric."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And it's like, that applies in a lot of areas where it's kind of interesting how a lot of our appliances and everything are all built around energy efficiency, sometimes at the expense of robustness in some other ways or higher costs in other ways where there's interesting things where energy or electricity could become much cheaper in a future world."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And that could change our engineering trade offs for the way we build certain things where you could throw away efficiency and actually get more benefits that actually matter."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "I mean, that's one of the directions I was considering swerving into was nuclear energy."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "When I was kind of like, what do I wanna do next?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "It was either gonna be cost effective nuclear fission or artificial general intelligence."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "And one of my pet ideas there is like, people don't understand how cheap nuclear fuel is."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And there would be ways that, you could be a quarter of the efficiency or less, but if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper, that could be a radical innovation in something like that."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "So there's like some of these thoughts around like direct fission energy conversion, fission fragment conversion, that maybe you build something that doesn't require all the steam turbines and everything, even if it winds up being less efficient."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "So that applies a lot in programming where it's always good to know what you could do."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "If you really sat down and took it far, because sometimes there's discontinuities like around user reaction times, there are some points where the difference between operating in one second and 750 milliseconds, not that huge."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "You'll see it in webpage statistics, but most of the usability stuff, not that great."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "But if you get down to 50 milliseconds, then all of a sudden this just feels amazing."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "It's just like doing your bidding instantly rather than you're giving it a command, twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "So sometimes it's important to really crunch hard to get over some threshold, but there are broad basins in the value metric for lots of work where it just doesn't pay to even go that extra mile."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "And there are craftsmen that just don't wanna buy that and more power to them."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "If somebody just wants to say, no, I'm going to be, my pride is in my work, I'm never going to do something that's not as good as I could possibly make it, I respect that and sometimes I am that person, but I try to focus more on the larger value picture and you do pick your battles and you deploy your resources in the play that's going to give you the best user value in the end."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "Well, if you look at the evolution of life on Earth as a kind of programming effort, it seems like efficiency

complex systems that are more and more intelligent, the final result is kind of pretty interesting."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "And so I think of JavaScript the same way."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "So that's a really good analogy and we can go a lot of places with that where in the earliest days of programming, when you had finite, you could count the bytes that you had to work on this, you had all the kind of hackers playing code golf to be one less instruction than the other person's multiply routine to kind of get through and it was so perfectly crafted."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "On the one hand, it's almost humbling how little programming code is in our bodies."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "We've got a couple of billion base pairs and it's like this all fits on a thumb drive for years now

millions of experiments are going on all the time but some things do kind of rise to the top and win the fitness war for whether it's mind space or programming techniques or anything."}, {"time":

"text": "It's like, you shouldn't be taking pride just in the specific thing."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "Like CodeGolf is the sort of thing, it's a fun puzzle game but that really should not be a

you actually quantify that?"}, {"time": 2091, "text": "And there can be big arguments about that but it's easy to be able to say, okay, this pissed off user there is not getting value from what you're

gonna do this because A is more important."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "But that notion of always having to really critically value what you're doing, your time, the resources you expend, even the

2232, "text": "Is it possible to measure it kind of numerically or can you do the sort of Johnny Ive, the designer route of imagining sort of somebody using a thing and imagining a smile on their face, imagining the experience of love and joy that you have when you use the thing."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "That's from a design perspective or if you're building more like a lower level thing for like Linux, you imagine a developer that might come across this and use it and become happy and better off because of it."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "So where do you land on those things?"}, {"time": 2272, "text": "Is it measurable?"}, {"time": 2273, "text": "So I imagine like Meta and Google will probably try to measure the thing."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "They'll try to, it's like you try to optimize engagement or something, let's measure engagement."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "And then I think there is a kind of, I mean, I admire the designer ethic of like, think of a future that's immeasurable and you try to make somebody in that future that's different from today happy."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "So I do usually favor, if you can get any kind of a metric that's good, by all means, listen to the data."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "But you can go too far there where we've had problems where it's like, hey, we had a performance regression because our fancy new telemetry system is doing a bazillion file writes to kind of archive this stuff because we needed to collect information to determine if we were doing, if our plans were good."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "So when

number of human beings, and you get to see sort of a lot of large numbers."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "So there's the zero to one problem of when you're doing something really new, you do kind of have to make a guess."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "But one of the points that I've been making at Meta is we have more than enough users now that anything somebody wants to try in VR, we have users that will be interested in that."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "You do not get to make a completely greenfield blue sky pitch and say, I'm going to do this because I think it might be interesting."}, {"time": 2358,

ways or playing the games."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "There are going to be probably millions of people, or at least if you pick some tiny niche that we're not in right now, there's still going to be

{"time": 2409, "text": "And companies like Meta have, they understand the trade offs where you can have a company like SpaceX or Apple in the Steve Jobs era, where you have a very powerful leading personality that can micromanage at a very low level and can say it's like, no, that handle needs to be different or that icon needs to change the tint there."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "And they clearly get a lot of value out of it."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "They also burn through a lot of employees that have horror stories to tell about working there afterwards."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "My position is that you're at your best when you've got a leader that is at their limit of what they can kind of comprehend of everything below them."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "And they can have an informed opinion about everything that's going on."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And you take somebody, you've got to believe that somebody that has 30, 40 years of experience, you would hope that

stories of him saying things that are just wrong right in front of me about technical things because he was not operating at that level."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "But when it does work and you do get that kind of passionate leader that's thinking about the entire product and just really deeply cares about not letting anything slip through the cracks, I think that's got a lot of value."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "But the other side of that is the people saying that, well, we wanna have these independent teams that are bubbling up the ideas because it's almost it's anti capitalist or anti free market to say, it's like I want my grand, my great leader to go ahead and dictate all these points there where clearly free markets bring up things that you don't expect."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "Like in VR, we saw a bunch of things like it didn't turn out at all the way the early people thought were gonna be the key applications and things that would not have been approved by the dark cabal

did make a pitch."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "It's like, hey, make me VR dictator and I'll go in and get shit done."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "I am, and that's just, it's not in the culture at Meta."},

again past midnight or two in the morning."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "And that was, when it was just me trying to make things happen and I was usually isolated off in my office, people generally

like that."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "So kids were the forcing function that got you to wake up at the same time each day."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "It's not clear to me that there was much of a difference in the productivity with that where I kind of feel, if I just get up when I feel like it, it's usually a little later each day but I just recently made the focusing decision to try to push my schedule back a little bit earlier to getting up at eight in the morning and trying to shift things around."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "Like I'm often doing experiments with myself about what should I be doing to be more productive and one of the things that I did realize was happening in recent months where I would go for a walk or a run."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "So I'm still playing with factors like this as I kind of optimize my work efforts but it's always been, it was 60 hours a week for a very long time."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "I mean, yeah, 12 hour programming, that's fine

don't really get in their gut where there are people that work on four hours of sleep and are smart and can continue to do good work but then there's a lot of people that just fall apart."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "So I do tell people that I always try to get eight hours of sleep."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "It's not this, you know, push yourself harder, get up earlier, I just do worse work where, you know, you can work a hundred hours a week and still get eight hours of sleep if you just kind of prioritize things correctly but I do believe in working hard, working a lot."}, {"time": 2865,

out of it where you're literally going backwards but it's not at eight or 10 or 12 hours."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "And the fictional example I would use was, imagine there's an asteroid coming to

about a deep dedication to a thing that kind of gets deep in you."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "So the hard work isn't just about the raw hours of productivity, it's the thing it does to you in the weeks

the more the Silicon Valley venture, you know, culture for things."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "They're different groups and they have pretty different mores and the way they think about things where,

them, the kind of big money, get billions of dollars, Silicon Valley venture backed funds are."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "Sorry, so you're saying like big companies like Google and Meta are hostile

things there."}, {"time": 3548, "text": "But in many cases, a debugger as a very powerful user interface that can stop, examine all the different things in your program, set all of these different

awakening to, the id software code bases were a couple of million lines of code."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "And at one point I had used a few of the different analysis tools, but I made a point to really go through and scrub the code base using every tool that I could find."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "And it was eyeopening where we had a reputation for having some of the most robust, strongest

those problems."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "But the long tail of all of the different little things that could go wrong there, and we had good programmers and my own code, stuff that I'd be looking at,

way."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "If something breaks, that means you gotta rethink the initial stuff."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "And it's nice for it to do that."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "Is there any

week on it."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "I used Anki to like teach myself the different little key combinations for things like that."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "And in the end, it was just like, all right, this was kind of like my civil war reenactment phase."}, {"time": 4168, "text": "It's like, I'm going out there doing it like they used to in the old days."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "And it was

better ideas are constantly being built."}, {"time": 4221, "text": "And that puts a kind of, I need to take the same kind of retreat as you're talking about, but now I'm still fighting the civil war."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "I need to kind of move into the 21st century."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "And it does seem like the world is, or a large chunk of the world is moving towards visual

really what kind of I wanted to go with."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "But when Steve Jobs left Apple and started Next, this computer did just seem like one of those amazing things from the future where

amazing graphical interface and it was great for building tools."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "And it used Objective C as kind of an interesting dead end for things like that."}, {"time": 4403, "text":

on Apple stuff now, there's still all these NS somethings, which was originally Next step objects of different kinds of things."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "But one of the aspects of those Unix systems was they had this notion of a.plan file where a.file is an invisible file."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "Usually in your home directory or something."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "And there was a trivial server running on most Unix systems at the time that when somebody ran a trivial little command called finger, you could do finger and then somebody's address, it could be anywhere on the internet if

4472, "text": "And people would use it for various purposes, but all it did was dump that file over to the terminal of whoever issued the finger command."}, {"time": 4482, "text": "And at one point I started just keeping a list of what I was doing in there, which would be what I was working on in the day."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "And I would have this little syntax."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "I kind of got to myself about, here's something that I'm working on."}, {"time": 4497, "text": "I put a star when I finish it."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "I could have a few other little bits of punctuation."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "And at the time it was, it started off as being just like my to do list."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "And it would be these trivial, obscure little things like I fixed something with collision detection code, made Fireball do something different and just little one liners that people that were following the games could kind of decipher."}, {"time": 4520,

essays."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "I would sometimes dump into the dot plan files interspersed with the work logs of things that I was doing."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "So in some ways it was like a super early proto blog where I was just kind of dumping out what I was working on."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "But it was interesting enough that there were a lot of people that were interested in this."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "So most of the people didn't have Unix workstation."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "So there were the websites back in the day that would follow the Doom and Quake

like all of the little kind of Dallas gaming diaspora of people that were at all in that orbit, there were a couple dozen plan files going on, which was, and this was some years before blogging really

kind of stuff and high level philosophical essay type of stuff that stands out?"}, {"time": 4606, "text": "Yeah, there's some good stuff on both where a lot of it was low level nitpicky details about

this money on shareware games."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "I want you to make shareware games, because he had seen some of the games that Romero had done."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "And we looked at

this game."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "And we really thought that he was full of shit, that it was a lie trying to get him into this."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "But so that was kind of going on at one level."}, {"time": 5527, "text": "And it was funny the moment when Romero realized that he had some of these letters pinned up on his wall, like all of his fans."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "And then we

checked arrays as an option there, which could avoid many of C's real hazards that happened in a security space."}, {"time": 5971, "text": "But C1, they were basically offering it about the same level of abstraction."}, {"time": 5975, "text": "It was a systems programming language, but."}, {"time": 5978, "text": "But you said Pascal had a more emphasis on data structures."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "I actually, in the tree of languages, did Pascal come before C?"}, {"time": 5988, "text": "They were pretty contemporaneous."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "So Pascal's lineage went to Modula 2 and eventually Oberon, which was another Nicholas word, kind of experimental language."}, {"time": 5998, "text": "But they were all good enough at that level."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "Now, some of the classic academic oriented Pascals were just missing fundamental things like, oh, you can't access this core system thing because we're just using it to teach students."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "But Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes to it really did make it a completely capable language."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "And it had some reasons why you could implement it as a single pass compiler so it could be way, way faster, although less scope for optimizations if you do it that way."}, {"time": 6026, "text": "And it did have some range checking options."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "It had a little bit better typing capability."}, {"time": 6030, "text": "You'd have properly typed enums, sorts of things, and other stuff that C lacked."}, {"time": 6035, "text": "But C was also clearly good enough."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "And it wound up with a huge inertia from the Unix ecosystem and everything that came with that."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "Garbage collection?"}, {"time": 6043, "text": "No, it was not garbage collected."}, {"time": 6045, "text": "It's just the same kind of thing as C. Same manual."}, {"time": 6047, "text": "So you could still have your use after freeze and all those other problems."}, {"time": 6050, "text": "But just getting rid of array overruns, at least if you were compiled with that debugging option, certainly would have avoided a lot of problems and could have a lot of benefits."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "But so anyways, that was the next thing."}, {"time": 6061, "text": "I had to learn C because C was where it seemed like most of the things were going."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "So I abandoned Pascal and I started working in C. I started hacking on these hardware things dealing with the graphics controllers and the EGA systems."}, {"time": 6076, "text": "And what we most wanted to do, so at that time we were sitting in our darkened office playing all the different console video games."}, {"time": 6084, "text": "And we were figuring out what games do we want to make for our Gamer's Edge product there."}, {"time": 6090, "text": "And so we had one of the first Super Nintendos sitting there."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "And we had an older Nintendo looking at all those games."}, {"time": 6097, "text": "And the core thing that those consoles did that you just didn't get on the PC games was this ability to have a massive scrolling world where most of the games that you would make on the PC and earlier personal computers would be a static screen."}, {"time": 6111, "text": "You move little things around on it and you interact like that."}, {"time": 6115, "text": "Maybe you go to additional screens as you move."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "But arcade games and consoles had this wonderful ability to just have a big world that you're slowly moving your window through."}, {"time": 6126, "text": "And that was for those types of games, that kind of action exploration adventure games, that was a super, super important thing."}, {"time": 6133, "text": "And PC games just didn't do that."}, {"time": 6136, "text": "And what I had come across was a couple of different techniques for implementing that on the PC."}, {"time": 6142, "text": "And they're not hard, complicated things."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "When I explain them now, they're pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 6148, "text": "But just nobody was doing it."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "You sound like Einstein describing his five papers is pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 6154, "text": "But they're nevertheless revolutionary."}, {"time": 6155, "text": "So side scrolling is a game changer."}, {"time": 6158, "text": "Yeah, and scrolling is a genius invention."}, {"time": 6160, "text": "It's either vertical."}, {"time": 6161, "text": "And some of the consoles had different limitations about you could do one but not the other."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "And there were similar things going on as advancements, even in the console space, where you'd have the original Mario game was just horizontal scrolling."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "And then later, Mario games added vertical aspects to it and different things that you were doing to explore, kind of expand the capabilities there."}, {"time": 6182, "text": "And so much of the early game design for decades was removing limitations, letting you do things that you envisioned as a designer, you wanted the player to experience, but the hardware just couldn't really or you didn't know how to make it happen."}, {"time": 6196, "text": "It felt impossible."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "You can imagine that you want to create like this big world through which you can side scroll, like through which you can walk."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "And then you ask yourself a question, how do I actually build that in a way that's like the latency is low enough, the hardware can actually deliver that in such a way that it's a compelling experience."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "Yeah, and we knew what we wanted to do because we were playing all of these console games, playing all these Nintendo games and arcade games."}, {"time": 6225, "text": "Clearly, there was a whole world of awesome things there that we just couldn't do on the PC, at least initially."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "Because every programmer can tell, it's like if you want to scroll, you can just redraw the whole screen."}, {"time": 6235, "text": "But then it turns out, well, you're going five frames per second."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "That's not an interactive fun experience."}, {"time": 6241, "text": "You want to be going 30 or 60 frames per second or something."}, {"time": 6244, "text": "And it just didn't feel like that was possible."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "It felt like the PCs had to get five times faster for you to make a playable game there."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "And interestingly, I wound up with two completely different solutions for the scrolling problem."}, {"time": 6258, "text": "And this is a theme that runs through everything, where all of these big technical advancements, it turns out there's always a couple different ways of doing them."}, {"time": 6268, "text": "And it's not like you found the one true way of doing it."}, {"time": 6271, "text": "And we'll see this as we go into 3D games and things later."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "But so the scrolling, the first set of scrolling tricks that I got was the hardware had this ability to, you could shift inside the window of memory."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "So the EGA cards at the time had 256 kilobytes of memory."}, {"time": 6291, "text": "And it was awkwardly set up in this planar format, where instead of having 256 or 24 million colors, you had 16 colors, which is four bits."}, {"time": 6303, "text": "So you had four bit planes, 64k a piece."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "Of course, 64k is a nice round number for 16 bit addressing."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "So your graphics card had a 16 bit window that you could look at."}, {"time": 6315, "text": "And you could tell it to start the video scan out anywhere inside there."}, {"time": 6319, "text": "So there were a couple games that had taken this approach of you could make a 2 by 2 screen or a 1 by 4 screen."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "And you could do scrolling really easily like that."}, {"time": 6328, "text": "You could just lay it all out and just pan around there."}, {"time": 6330, "text": "But you just couldn't make it any bigger because that's all the memory that was there."}, {"time": 6335, "text": "The first insight to the scrolling that I had was, well, if we make a screen that's just one tile larger, and we usually had tiles that were 16 pixels by 16 pixels, the little classic Mario block that you run into, lots of art gets drawn that way."}, {"time": 6350, "text": "And your screen is a certain number of tiles."}, {"time": 6352, "text": "But if you had one little buffer region outside of that, you could easily pan around inside that 16 pixel region."}, {"time": 6359, "text": "That could be perfectly smooth."}, {"time": 6361, "text": "But then what happens if you get to the edge and you want to keep going?"}, {"time": 6365, "text": "The first way we did scrolling was what I called adaptive tile refresh, which was really just a matter of you get to the edge and then you go back to the original point and then only change the tiles that have actually that are different between where it was."}, {"time": 6381, "text": "In most of the games at the time, if you think about your classic Super Mario Brothers game, you've got big fields of blue sky, long rows of the same brick texture."}, {"time": 6393, "text": "And there's a lot of commonality."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "It's like a data compression thing."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "If you take the screen and you set it down on top of each other, in general, only about 10% of the tiles were actually different there."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "So this was a way to go ahead and say, well, I'm going to move it back, and then I'm only going to change those 10%, 20%, whatever percent tiles there."}, {"time": 6414, "text": "And that meant that it was essentially five times faster than if you were redrawing all of the tiles."}, {"time": 6419, "text": "And that worked well enough for us to do a bunch of these games for Gamer's Edge."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "We had a lot of these scrolling games like Slurred Axe and Shadow Knights and things like that that we were cranking out at this high rate that had this scrolling effect on it."}, {"time": 6433, "text": "And it worked well enough."}, {"time": 6434, "text": "There were design challenges there where if you made the worst case, if you made a checkerboard over the entire screen, you scroll over one and every single tile changes and your frame rate's now five frames per second because it had to redraw everything."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "So the designers had a little bit that they had to worry about."}, {"time": 6449, "text": "They had to make these relatively plain looking levels, but it was still pretty magical."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "It was something that we hadn't seen before."}, {"time": 6457, "text": "And the first thing that we wound up doing with that was I had just gotten this working, and Tom Hall was sitting there with me, and we were looking over at our Super Nintendo on the side there with Super Mario 3 running."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "And we had the technology, we had the tools set up there, and we stayed up all night."}, {"time": 6477, "text": "And we basically cloned the first level of Super Mario Brothers."}, {"time": 6481, "text": "Performance wise as well?"}, {"time": 6482, "text": "And we had our little character running and jumping in there."}, {"time": 6485, "text": "It was close to pixel accurate as far as all the backgrounds and everything, but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled together from previous games that I had written."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "I just really kitbashed the whole thing together to make this demo."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "And that was one of the rare cases when I said I don't usually do these all night programming things."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "There's probably only two memorable ones that I can think about."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "One was the all nighter to go ahead and get our Dangerous Dave and copyright infringement is how we titled it."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "Because we had a game called Dangerous Dave running around with a shotgun shooting things, and we were just taking our most beloved game at the time there, the Super Mario 3, and sticking Dave inside that with this new scrolling technology that was going perfectly smooth for them as it ran."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "And Tom and I just blearily the next morning left, and we left a disk on the desk for John Romero and Jay Wilbur to see and just said, run this."}, {"time": 6545, "text": "And we eventually made it back in later in the day, and it was like they grabbed us and pulled us into the room."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "And that was the point where they were like, we got to do something with this."}, {"time": 6557, "text": "We're going to make a company."}, {"time": 6559, "text": "We're going to go make our own games, where this was something that we were able to just kind of hit them with a hammer of an experience like, wow, this is just like so much cooler than what we thought was possible there."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "And initially, we tried to get Nintendo to let us make Super Mario 3 on the PC."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "That's really what we wanted to do."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "We were like, hey, we can finish this."}, {"time": 6580, "text": "It's line of sight."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "And we sent something to Nintendo, and we heard that it did get looked at in Japan, and they just weren't interested in that."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "But that's another one of those life could have gone a very different way, where we could have been like Nintendo's house PC team at that point."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "And define the direction of Wolfenstein and Doom and Quake could have been a Nintendo creation."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "So at the same time that we were just doing our first scrolling demos, we reached out to Scott Miller at Apogee and said, it's like, hey, we do want to make some games."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "These things that you think you want, those are nothing."}, {"time": 6622, "text": "What do you see what we can actually do now?"}, {"time": 6624, "text": "This is going to be amazing."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "And he just popped right up and sent a check to us, where at that point, we still thought he might be a fraud, that he was just lying about all of this."}, {"time": 6634, "text": "But he was totally correct on how much money he was making with his shareware titles."}, {"time": 6639, "text": "And this was his real brainstorm about this, where shareware was this idea that software doesn't have a fixed price."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "If you use it, you send out of the goodness of your heart some money to the creator."}, {"time": 6651, "text": "And there were a couple of utilities that did make some significant success like that."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "But for the most part, it didn't really work."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "Now, there wasn't much software in a pure shareware model that was successful."}, {"time": 6663, "text": "The Apogee innovation was to take something, call it shareware, split it into three pieces."}, {"time": 6670, "text": "You always made a trilogy."}, {"time": 6672, "text": "And you would put the first piece out, but then you buy the whole trilogy for some shareware amount, which in reality, it meant that the first part was a demo, where you kind of like the demo went everywhere for free and you paid money to get the whole set."}, {"time": 6686, "text": "But it was still play to shareware."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "And we were happy to have the first one go everywhere."}, {"time": 6691, "text": "And it wasn't a crippled demo, where the first episode of all these trilogies, it was a real complete game."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "And probably 20 times as many people played that part of it, thought they had a great game, had fond memories of it, but never paid us a dime."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "But enough people were happy with that, where it was really quite successful."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "And these early games that we didn't think very much of compared to commercial quality games, but they were doing really good business, some fairly crude things."}, {"time": 6719, "text": "And people, it was good business."}, {"time": 6721, "text": "People enjoyed it."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "And it wasn't like you were taking a crapshoot on what you were getting."}, {"time": 6725, "text": "You just played a third of the experience."}, {"time": 6727, "text": "And you loved it enough to hand write out a check and put it in an envelope and address it and send it out to Apogee to get the rest of them."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "So it was a really pretty feel good business prospect there, because everybody was happy."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "They knew what they were getting when they sent it in."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "They would send in fan mail."}, {"time": 6747, "text": "If you're going to the trouble of addressing a letter and filling out an envelope, you write something in it."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "And there were just the literal bags of fan mail for the shareware games, so people loved them."}, {"time": 6758, "text": "I should mention that for you, the definition of wealth is being able to have pizza whenever you want."}, {"time": 6766, "text": "For me, there was a dream that I would play shareware games over and over, the part that's free, over and over."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "And it was very deeply fulfilling experience."}, {"time": 6776, "text": "But I dreamed of a time when I could actually afford the full experience."}, {"time": 6782, "text": "And this is kind of this dreamland beyond the horizon when you could find out what else is there."}, {"time": 6789, "text": "In some sense, even just playing the shareware was, it's the limitation of that."}, {"time": 6797, "text": "You know, life is limited, eventually we all die."}, {"time": 6801, "text": "In that way, shareware was somehow really fulfilling to have this kind of mysterious thing beyond what's free always there."}, {"time": 6812, "text": "It's kind of, I don't know, maybe it's because a part of my childhood is playing shareware games."}, {"time": 6817, "text": "That was a really fulfilling experience."}, {"time": 6819, "text": "It's so interesting how that model still brought joy to so many people."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "The 20X people that played it."}, {"time": 6825, "text": "I felt very good about that."}, {"time": 6827, "text": "I would run into people that would say, oh, I loved that game that you had early on, Commander Keen, whatever."}, {"time": 6833, "text": "And no, they meant just the first episode that they got to see everywhere."}, {"time": 6838, "text": "That's me, I played the crap out of Commander Keen."}, {"time": 6841, "text": "And that was all good."}, {"time": 6844, "text": "But so we were in this position where Scott Miller was just fronting us cash, saying, yeah, make a game."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "But we did not properly pull the trigger and say, all right, we're quitting our jobs."}, {"time": 6856, "text": "We were like, we're gonna do both."}, {"time": 6857, "text": "We're gonna keep working at Softdisk, working on this."}, {"time": 6861, "text": "And then we're going to go ahead and make a new game for Apogee at the same time."}, {"time": 6867, "text": "And this eventually did lead to some legal problems."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "And we had trouble."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "It all got worked out in the end, but it was not a good call at the time there."}, {"time": 6875, "text": "And your legal mind at the time was not stellar."}, {"time": 6879, "text": "You were not thinking in terms of the illegal terms."}, {"time": 6882, "text": "No, I definitely wasn't."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "None of us were."}, {"time": 6886, "text": "And in hindsight, yeah, it's like, how did we think we were gonna get away with even using our work computers to write software for our breakaway new company?"}, {"time": 6896, "text": "It was not a good plan."}, {"time": 6898, "text": "How did Commander Keen come to be?"}, {"time": 6900, "text": "So the design process, we would start from, we had some idea of what we wanted to do."}, {"time": 6905, "text": "We wanted to do a Mario like game."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "It was gonna be a side scroller."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "It was gonna use the technology."}, {"time": 6911, "text": "We had some sense of what it would have to look like because of the limitations of this adaptive tile refresh technology."}, {"time": 6917, "text": "It had to have fields of relatively constant tiles."}, {"time": 6921, "text": "You couldn't just paint up a background and then move that around."}, {"time": 6925, "text": "The early design or all the design for Commander Keen really came from Tom Hall, where he was kind of the main creative mind for the early id software stuff, where we had an interesting division of things where Tom was all creative and design."}, {"time": 6942, "text": "I was all programming."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "John Romero was an interesting bridge where he was both a very good programmer and also a very good designer and artist and kind of straddled between the areas."}, {"time": 6952, "text": "But Commander Keen was very much Tom Hall's baby."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "And he came up with all the design and backstory for the different things of kind of a mad scientist, little kid with building a rocket ship and a zap gun and visiting alien worlds and doing all of this that the background that we lay the game inside of."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "And there's not a whole lot to any of these things."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "Design for us was always just what we needed to do to make the game that was gonna be so much fun to play."}, {"time": 6983, "text": "And we laid out our first trilogy of games, the shareware formula, it's gonna be three pieces."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "We make Commander Keen one, two, and three."}, {"time": 6991, "text": "And we just really started busting on all that work."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "And it went together really quickly."}, {"time": 6997, "text": "It was like three months or something that while we were still making games every month for Gamer's Edge, we were sharing technology between that."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "I'd write a bunch of code for this and we'd just kind of use it for both."}, {"time": 7008, "text": "Again, not a particularly good idea there that had consequences for us."}, {"time": 7013, "text": "But in three months, we got our first game out and all of a sudden it was three times as successful as the most successful thing Apogee had had before."}, {"time": 7023, "text": "And we were making like $30,000 a month immediately from the Commander Keen stuff."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "And that was again, a surprise to us."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "It was more than we thought that that was gonna make."}, {"time": 7035, "text": "And we said, well, we're gonna certainly roll into another set of titles from this."}, {"time": 7039, "text": "And in that three months, I had come up with a much better way of doing the scrolling technology that was not the adaptive tile refresh, which in some ways was even simpler."}, {"time": 7049, "text": "And these things, so many of the great ideas of technology are things that are back of the envelope designs."}, {"time": 7056, "text": "I make this comment about modern machine learning where all the things that are really important practically in the last decade are, each of them fits on the back of an envelope."}, {"time": 7064, "text": "There are these simple little things."}, {"time": 7066, "text": "They're not super dense, hard to understand technologies."}, {"time": 7071, "text": "And so the second scrolling trick was just a matter of like, okay, we know we've got this 64K window."}, {"time": 7078, "text": "And the question was always like, well, you could make a two by two, but you can't go off the edge."}, {"time": 7085, "text": "But I finally asked, well, what actually happens if you just go off the edge?"}, {"time": 7089, "text": "If you take your start and you say, it's like, okay, I can move over, I'm scrolling, I can move over, I can move down, I'm scrolling."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "I get to what should be the bottom of the memory window."}, {"time": 7099, "text": "It's like, well, what if I just keep going?"}, {"time": 7101, "text": "And I say, I'm gonna start at, what happens if I start at FFFE at the very end of the 64K block?"}, {"time": 7109, "text": "And it turns out it just wraps back around to the top of the block."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "And I'm like, oh, well, this makes everything easy."}, {"time": 7115, "text": "You can just scroll the screen everywhere and all you have to draw is just one new line of tiles, which everything you expose, it might be unaligned off various parts of the screen memory, but it just works."}, {"time": 7128, "text": "That no longer had the problem of you had to have fields of the similar colors because it doesn't matter what you're doing, you could be having a completely unique world and you're just drawing the new strip as it comes on."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "But it might be, like you said, unaligned, so it can be all over the place."}, {"time": 7143, "text": "Yes, and it turns out it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 7144, "text": "I would have two page flipped screens, as long as they didn't overlap, they moved in series through this two dimensional window of graphics."}, {"time": 7152, "text": "And that was one of those like, well, this is so simple."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "This just works, it's faster, there it seemed like there was no downside."}, {"time": 7161, "text": "Funny thing was, it turned out after we shipped titles with this, there were what they called super VGA cards, the cards that would allow higher resolutions and different features that the standard ones didn't."}, {"time": 7175, "text": "And on some of those cards, this was a weird compatibility quirk again, because nobody thought this was not what it was designed to do."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "And some of those cards had more memory."}, {"time": 7185, "text": "They had more than just 256K and four planes."}, {"time": 7188, "text": "They had 512K or a megabyte."}, {"time": 7191, "text": "And on some of those cards, I scroll my window down and then it goes into uninitialized memory that actually exists there rather than wrapping back around at the top."}, {"time": 7201, "text": "And then I was in the tough position of do I have to track every single one of these?"}, {"time": 7206, "text": "And it was a mad house back then with there were 20 different video card vendors with all slightly different implementations of their nonstandard functionality."}, {"time": 7214, "text": "So either I needed to natively program all of the VGA cards there to map in that memory and keep scrolling down through all of that, or I kind of punted and took the easy solution of when you finally did run to the edge of the screen, I accepted a hitch and just copied the whole screen up there."}, {"time": 7233, "text": "So on some of those cards, it was a compatibility mode."}, {"time": 7238, "text": "In the normal ones, when it all worked fine, everything was just beautifully smooth."}, {"time": 7242, "text": "But if you had one of those cards where it did not wrap the way I wanted it to, you'd be scrolling around, scrolling around, and then eventually you'd have a little hitch where 200 milliseconds or something that was not super smooth as it froze a little bit."}, {"time": 7256, "text": "And this is the binary thing."}, {"time": 7257, "text": "Is it one of the standard screens or is it one of the weird ones, the Super VGA ones?"}, {"time": 7263, "text": "And so we would default to, and I think that was one of those that changed over the kind of course of deployment where early on we would have a normal mode and then you would enable the compatibility flag if your screen did this crazy flickery thing when you got to a certain point in the game."}, {"time": 7278, "text": "And then later, I think it probably got enabled by default as just more and more of the cards kind of did not do exactly the right thing."}, {"time": 7286, "text": "And that's the two edged sword of doing unconventional things with technology where you can find something that nobody thought about doing that kind of scrolling trick when they set up those cards."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "But the fact that nobody thought that was the primary reason when I was relying on that, then I wound up being broken on some of the later cards."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "Let me take a bit of a tangent, but ask you about the hacker ethic."}, {"time": 7310, "text": "Cause you mentioned shareware."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "It's an interesting world."}, {"time": 7313, "text": "The world of people that make money, the business and the people that build systems, the engineers."}, {"time": 7322, "text": "And what is the hacker ethic?"}, {"time": 7325, "text": "You've been a man of the people and you've embodied at least the part of that ethic."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "What did it mean to you at the time?"}, {"time": 7334, "text": "What does it mean to you today?"}, {"time": 7335, "text": "So Steven Levy's book, Hackers, was a really formative book for me as a teenager."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "I mean, I read it several times and there was all of the great lore of the early MIT era of hackers and ending up at the end with, it kind of went through the early MIT hackers and then the Silicon Valley hardware hackers and then the game hackers in part three."}, {"time": 7359, "text": "And at that time as a teenager, I really was kind of bitter in some ways."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "I thought I was born too late."}, {"time": 7366, "text": "I thought I missed the window there."}, {"time": 7368, "text": "And I really thought I belonged in that third section of that book with the game hackers."}, {"time": 7373, "text": "And they were talking about the Williams at Sierra and origin systems with Richard Garriott."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "And it's like, I really wanted to be there."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "And I knew that was now a few years in the past."}, {"time": 7385, "text": "It was not to be, but the early days, especially the early MIT hacker days, talking a lot about this sense of the hacker ethic, that there was this sense that it was about sharing information, being good, not keeping it to yourself, and that it's not a zero sum game, that you can share something with another programmer and it doesn't take it away from you."}, {"time": 7410, "text": "You then have somebody else doing something."}, {"time": 7413, "text": "And I also think that there's an aspect of it where it's this ability to take joy in other people's accomplishments, where it's not the cutthroat bit of like, I have to be first, I have to be recognized as the one that did this in some way, but being able to see somebody else do something and say, holy shit, that's amazing."}, {"time": 7433, "text": "And just taking joy in the ability of something amazing that somebody else does."}, {"time": 7438, "text": "And the big thing that I was able to do through ID Software was this ability to eventually release the source code for most of our, like all of our really seminal game titles."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "And that was a, it was a stepping stone process where we were kind of surprised early on where people were able to hack the existing games."}, {"time": 7460, "text": "And of course I had experience with that."}, {"time": 7461, "text": "I remember hacking my copies of Ultima."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "So I'd give myself 9999 gold and raise my levels and break out the sector editor."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "And so I was familiar with all of that."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "So it was just, it was with a smile when I started to see people doing that to our games, I am making level editors for Commander Keen or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D, but I made the pitch internally that we should actually release our own tools for like what we did, what we use to create the games."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "And that was a little bit debatable about, well, will this let other, we'll give people leg up."}, {"time": 7497, "text": "It's always like, what's that gonna mean for the competition?"}, {"time": 7500, "text": "But the really hard pitch was to actually release the full source code for the games."}, {"time": 7506, "text": "And it was a balancing act with the other people inside the company where it's interesting how the programmers generally did get, certainly the people that I worked closely with, they did kind of get that hacker ethic bit where you wanted to share your code."}, {"time": 7524, "text": "You were proud of it."}, {"time": 7525, "text": "You wanted other people to take it, do cool things with it."}, {"time": 7528, "text": "But interestingly, the broader game industry is a little more hesitant to embrace that than like the group of people that we happen to have at id Software, where it was always a little interesting to me seeing how a lot of people in the game modding community were very possessive of their code."}, {"time": 7547, "text": "They did not wanna share their code."}, {"time": 7549, "text": "They wanted it to be theirs."}, {"time": 7550, "text": "It was their claim to fame."}, {"time": 7552, "text": "And that was much more like what we tended to see with artists where the artists understand something about credit and wanting it to be known as their work."}, {"time": 7562, "text": "And a lot of the game programmers felt a little bit more like artists than like hacker programmers, in that it was about building something that maybe felt more like art to them than the more tool based and exploration based kind of hacking culture side of things."}, {"time": 7579, "text": "Yeah, it's so interesting that this kind of fear that credit will not be sufficiently attributed to you."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "And that's one of the things that I do bump into a lot because I try not to go..."}, {"time": 7594, "text": "I mean, it's easy for me to say because so much credit is heaped on me for the id Software side of things."}, {"time": 7599, "text": "But when people come up and they wanna pick a fight and say, no, it's like that wasn't where first person gaming came from and you can point to some of like things on obscure titles that I was never aware of or like the old Playdoh systems or each personal computer had something that was 3Dish and moving around."}, {"time": 7618, "text": "And I'm happy to say it's like, no, I mean, I saw Battlezone and Star Wars in the arcades."}, {"time": 7623, "text": "I had seen 3D graphics, I had seen all these things that are standing on the shoulders of lots of other people."}, {"time": 7629, "text": "But sometimes these examples they pull out, it's like, no, I didn't know that existed."}, {"time": 7632, "text": "I mean, I had never heard of that before then that didn't contribute to what I made, but there's plenty of stuff that did."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "And I think there's good cases to be made that obviously Doom and Quake and Wolfenstein were formative examples for what everything that came after that."}, {"time": 7651, "text": "But I don't feel the need to go fight and say claim primacy or initial invention of anything like that."}, {"time": 7658, "text": "But a lot of people do want to."}, {"time": 7660, "text": "I think when you fight for the credit in that way and it does go against the hacker ethic, you destroy something fundamental about the culture, about the community that builds cool stuff."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "I think credit ultimately, so I had this sort of, there's a famous wrestler and freestyle wrestling called Buvai Sarasateeva."}, {"time": 7683, "text": "And he always preached that you should just focus on the art of the wrestling and let people write your story however they want."}, {"time": 7695, "text": "The highest form of the art is just focusing on the art."}, {"time": 7700, "text": "And that is something about the hacker ethic is just focus on building cool stuff, sharing it with other cool people, and credit will get assigned correctly in the long arc of history."}, {"time": 7717, "text": "Yeah, and I generally think that's true."}, {"time": 7719, "text": "And you've got, there's some things, there's a graphics technique that got labeled CarMax Reverse."}, {"time": 7726, "text": "I am literally named, and it turned out that I wasn't the first person to figure that out."}, {"time": 7731, "text": "Most scientific things or mathematical things you wind up, it's like, oh, this other person had actually done that somewhat before."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "And then there's things that get attributed to me like the inverse square root hack that I actually didn't do."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "I flat out, that wasn't me."}, {"time": 7744, "text": "And it's like, it's weird how the memetic power of the internet, I cannot convince people of that."}, {"time": 7749, "text": "You're like the Mark Twain of programming."}, {"time": 7752, "text": "Everything just gets attributed to you now, even though you've never sought the credit of things."}, {"time": 7758, "text": "But part of the fact of the humility behind that is what attracts the attributions."}, {"time": 7765, "text": "Let's talk about a game."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "I mean, one of the greatest games ever made."}, {"time": 7769, "text": "I know you could talk about doing Quake and so on, but to me, Wolfenstein 3D was like, whoa."}, {"time": 7775, "text": "It blew my mind that a world like this could exist."}, {"time": 7778, "text": "So how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be in terms of the programming, in terms of the design, in terms of some of the memorable technical challenges?"}, {"time": 7787, "text": "And also, actually just something you haven't mentioned is how did these ideas come to be inside your mind, the adaptive side scrolling, the solutions to these technical challenges?"}, {"time": 7803, "text": "So I usually can introspectively pull back pretty detailed accounts of how technology solutions and design choices on my part came to be, where technically we had done two games, 3D games like that before, where Hover Tank was the first one, which had flat shaded walls, but did have the scaled enemies inside it."}, {"time": 7825, "text": "And then Catacombs 3D, which had textured walls, scaled enemies, and some more functionality, like the disappearing walls and some other stuff."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "But what's really interesting from a game development standpoint is those games, Catacombs 3D, Hover Tank, and Wolfenstein, they literally used the same code for a lot of the character behavior that a 2D game that I had made earlier called Catacombs did, where it was an overhead view game, kind of like Gauntlet, you're running around and you can open up doors, pick up items, basic game stuff."}, {"time": 7861, "text": "And the thought was that this exact same game experience just presented in a different perspective."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "It could be literally the same game just with a different view into it, would have a dramatically different impact on the players."}, {"time": 7876, "text": "So it wasn't a true 3D, you're saying that you could kind of fake it, you can like scale enemies, meaning things that are farther away, you can make them smaller."}, {"time": 7887, "text": "So the game was a 2D map, like all of our games use the same tool for creation."}, {"time": 7893, "text": "We use the same map editor for creating Keen as Wolfenstein and Hover Tank and Catacombs and all this stuff."}, {"time": 7899, "text": "So the game was a 2D grid made out of blocks."}, {"time": 7902, "text": "And you could say, well, these are walls, these are where the enemies start, then they start moving around."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "And these early games like Catacombs, you played it strictly in a 2D view."}, {"time": 7911, "text": "It was a scrolling 2D view, and that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh at the time to be able to do something like that."}, {"time": 7918, "text": "And then the thought that these early games, all it did was take the same basic enemy logic, but instead of seeing it from the God's eye view on top, you were inside it and turning from side to side, yawing your view and moving forwards and backwards and side to side."}, {"time": 7934, "text": "And it's a striking thing where you always talk about wanting to isolate and factor changes in values."}, {"time": 7940, "text": "And this was one of those most pure cases there where the rest of the game changed very little."}, {"time": 7945, "text": "It was our normal kind of change the colors on something and draw a different picture for it, but it's kind of the same thing."}, {"time": 7950, "text": "But the perspective changed in a really fundamental way."}, {"time": 7953, "text": "And it was dramatically different."}, {"time": 7956, "text": "I can remember the reactions where the artist, Adrian, that had been drawing the pictures for it."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "We had a cool big troll thing in Catacombs 3D, and we had these walls that you could get a key and you could make the blocks disappear, get really simple stuff."}, {"time": 7971, "text": "Blocks could either be there or not there."}, {"time": 7972, "text": "So our idea of a door was being able to make a set of blocks just disappear."}, {"time": 7977, "text": "And I remember the reaction where he had drawn these characters and he was slowly moving around and like people had no experience with 3D navigation."}, {"time": 7984, "text": "It was all still keyboard."}, {"time": 7985, "text": "We didn't even have mice set up at that time, but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall."}, {"time": 7992, "text": "The wall disappears in a little animation and there's a monster like right there."}, {"time": 7996, "text": "And he practically fell out of his chair."}, {"time": 7998, "text": "It was just like, ah!"}, {"time": 7999, "text": "And games just didn't do that."}, {"time": 8002, "text": "The games were the God's eye view."}, {"time": 8004, "text": "You were a little invested in your little guy."}, {"time": 8006, "text": "You can be like happy or sad when things happen, but you just did not get that kind of startle reaction."}, {"time": 8012, "text": "You weren't inside the game."}, {"time": 8013, "text": "Something in the back of your brain, some reptile brain thing is just going, oh shit, something just happened."}, {"time": 8019, "text": "And that was one of those early points where it's like, yeah, this is gonna make a difference."}, {"time": 8024, "text": "This is going to be powerful and it's gonna matter."}, {"time": 8027, "text": "Were you able to imagine that in the idea stage or no?"}, {"time": 8031, "text": "So not that exact thing."}, {"time": 8033, "text": "So again, we had cases like the arcade games, Battle Zone and Star Wars that you could kind of see a 3D world and things coming at you and you get some sense of it, but nothing had done the kind of worlds that we were doing and the sort of action based things."}, {"time": 8048, "text": "3D at the time was really largely about the simulation thoughts."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "And this is something that really might have trended differently if not for the id Software approach in the games where there were flight simulators, there were driving simulators, you had like hard drive in and Microsoft flight simulator."}, {"time": 8068, "text": "And these were doing 3D and general purpose 3D in ways that were more flexible than what we were doing with our games, but they were looked at as simulations."}, {"time": 8078, "text": "They weren't trying to necessarily be fast or responsive or letting you do kind of exciting maneuvers because they were trying to simulate reality and they were taking their cues from the big systems, the Evans and Sutherlands and the Silicon Graphics that were doing things."}, {"time": 8092, "text": "But we were taking our cues from the console and arcade games."}, {"time": 8096, "text": "We wanted things that were sort of quarter eaters that were doing fast paced things that you could smack you around rather than just smoothly gliding you from place to place."}, {"time": 8107, "text": "Quarter eaters."}, {"time": 8108, "text": "And you know, a funny thing is, so much that that built into us that Wolfenstein still had lives and you had like one of the biggest power ups in all these games like was an extra life because you started off with three lives and you lose your lives and then it's game over and there weren't save games in most of this stuff."}, {"time": 8126, "text": "It was, it sounds almost crazy to say this, but it was an innovation in Doom to not have lives."}, {"time": 8132, "text": "You know, you could just play Doom as long as you wanted."}, {"time": 8133, "text": "You just restart at the start of the level and why not?"}, {"time": 8136, "text": "This is like, we aren't trying to take people's quarters."}, {"time": 8139, "text": "They've already paid for the entire game."}, {"time": 8141, "text": "We want them to have a good time and you would have some, you know, some old timer purists that might think that there's something to the epic journey of making it to the end, having to restart all the way from the beginning after a certain number of tries."}, {"time": 8153, "text": "But now more fun is had when you just let people kind of keep trying when they're stuck rather than having to go all the way back and learn different things."}, {"time": 8161, "text": "So you've recommended the book, Game Engine Black Book Wolfenstein 3D for technical exploration of the game."}, {"time": 8167, "text": "So looking back 30 years, what are some memorable technical innovations that made this perspective shift into this world that's so immersive that scares you when a monster appears or some things you have to solve?"}, {"time": 8182, "text": "So one of the interesting things that come back to the theme of deadlines and resource constraints, the game Catacombs 3D, we shipped, we were supposed to be shipping this for Gamers Edge on a monthly cadence and I had slipped."}, {"time": 8196, "text": "I was actually late."}, {"time": 8197, "text": "It slipped like six weeks because this was texture mapped walls doing stuff that I hadn't done before."}, {"time": 8204, "text": "And at the six week point, it was still kind of glitchy and buggy."}, {"time": 8208, "text": "There were things that I knew that if you had a wall that was like almost edge on, you could slide over to it and you could see some things freak out or vanish or not work."}, {"time": 8217, "text": "And I hated that, but I was up against the wall."}, {"time": 8221, "text": "We had to ship the game."}, {"time": 8223, "text": "It was still a lot of fun to play."}, {"time": 8224, "text": "It was novel, nobody had seen it."}, {"time": 8226, "text": "It gave you that startle reflex reaction."}, {"time": 8229, "text": "So it was worth shipping, but it had these things that I knew were kind of flaky and janky and not what I was really proud of."}, {"time": 8237, "text": "So one of the things that I did very differently in Wolfenstein was I went, Catacombs used almost a conventional thing where you had segments that were one dimensional polygons basically that were clipped and back faced and done kind of like a very crude 3D engine from the professionals, but I wasn't getting it done right."}, {"time": 8259, "text": "I was not doing a good enough job."}, {"time": 8261, "text": "I didn't really have line of sight to fix it right."}, {"time": 8265, "text": "There's stuff that of course I look back, it's like, oh, it's obvious how to do this and do the math right, do your clipping right, check all of this, how you handle the precision."}, {"time": 8273, "text": "But I did not know how to do that at that time."}, {"time": 8275, "text": "Was that the first 3D engine you wrote Catacombs 3D?"}, {"time": 8279, "text": "Yeah, Hover Tank had been a little bit before that, but that had the flat shaded walls."}, {"time": 8282, "text": "So the texture mapping on the walls was what was bringing in some of these challenges that was hard for me and I couldn't solve it right at the time."}, {"time": 8291, "text": "Can you describe what flat shading is and texture mapping?"}, {"time": 8293, "text": "So the walls were solid color, one of 16 colors in Hover Tank."}, {"time": 8299, "text": "So that's easy, it's fast, you just draw the solid color for everything."}, {"time": 8303, "text": "Texture mapping is what we all see today where you have an image that is stretched and distorted onto the walls or the surfaces that you're working with."}, {"time": 8312, "text": "And it was a long time for me to just figure out how to do that without it distorting in the wrong ways."}, {"time": 8318, "text": "And I did not get it all exactly right in Catacombs and I had these flaws."}, {"time": 8324, "text": "So that was important enough to me that rather than continuing to bang my head on that when I wasn't positive I was gonna get it, I went with a completely different approach for drawing for figuring out where the walls were which was a ray casting approach, which I had done in Catacombs 3D I had a bunch of C code trying to make this work right and it wasn't working right."}, {"time": 8345, "text": "In Wolfenstein I wound up going to a very small amount of assembly code."}, {"time": 8351, "text": "So in some ways there should be a slower way of doing it but by making it a smaller amount of work that I could more tightly optimize it worked out and Wolfenstein 3D was just absolutely rock solid."}, {"time": 8362, "text": "It was nothing glitched in there."}, {"time": 8365, "text": "The game just was pretty much flawless through all of that and I was super proud of that."}, {"time": 8371, "text": "But eventually like in the later games I went back to the more span based things where I could get more total efficiency once I really did figure out how to do it."}, {"time": 8380, "text": "So there were two sort of key technical things to Wolfenstein, one was this ray casting approach which you still to this day you see people go and say let's write a ray casting engine because it's an understandable way of doing things that lets you make games very much like that."}, {"time": 8395, "text": "So you see ray casters in JavaScript, ray casters in Python, people that are basically going and re implementing that approach to taking a tiled world and casting out into it."}, {"time": 8406, "text": "It works pretty well but it's not the fastest way of doing it."}, {"time": 8409, "text": "Can you describe what ray casting is?"}, {"time": 8411, "text": "So you start off and you've got your screen which is 320 pixels across at the time if you haven't sized down the window for greater speed and at every pixel there's gonna be an angle from you've got your position in the world and you're going to just run along that angle and keep going until you hit a block."}, {"time": 8429, "text": "So up to 320 times across there it's gonna throw a cast array out into the world from wherever your origin is until it runs into a wall and then it can figure out exactly where on the wall it hits."}, {"time": 8442, "text": "The performance challenge of that is as it's going out every block it's crossing it checks is this a solid wall."}, {"time": 8449, "text": "So that means that in like the early Wolfenstein levels you're in a small jail cell going out into a small hallway it's super efficient for that because you're only stepping across three or four blocks but then if somebody makes a room that covers our maps were limited to 64 by 64 blocks."}, {"time": 8465, "text": "If you made one room that was nothing but walls at the far space it would go pretty slow because it would be stepping across 80 tile tests or something along the way."}, {"time": 8475, "text": "By the way the physics of our universe seems to be competing in this very thing."}, {"time": 8479, "text": "So this maps nicely to the actual physics of our world."}, {"time": 8483, "text": "Yeah you get like I follow a little bit of something like Steven Wolfram's work on interconnected network information states of that and that's it's beyond what I can have an informed opinion on but it's interesting that people are considering things like that and have things that can back it up."}, {"time": 8502, "text": "Yeah there's whole different sets of interesting stuff there."}, {"time": 8505, "text": "So Wolfenstein 3D had ray casting."}, {"time": 8508, "text": "Ray casting and then the other kind of key aspect was what I called compiled scalers where the idea of you'd saw this in the earlier classic arcade games like Space Harrier and stuff where you would take a picture which is normally drawn directly on the screen and then if you have the ability to make it bigger or smaller big chunky pixels or fizzly small drop sampled pixels."}, {"time": 8532, "text": "That's the fundamental aspect of what our characters were doing in these 3D games."}, {"time": 8536, "text": "You would have it's just like you might have drawn a tiny little character but now we can make them really big and make them really small and move it around."}, {"time": 8543, "text": "That was the limited kind of 3D that we had for characters."}, {"time": 8546, "text": "To make them turn there were literally eight different views of them."}, {"time": 8549, "text": "You didn't actually have a 3D model that would rotate."}, {"time": 8551, "text": "You just had these cardboard cutouts."}, {"time": 8553, "text": "But that was good enough for that startle fight reaction and it was kind of what we had to deal with there."}, {"time": 8560, "text": "So a straightforward approach to do that you could just write out your doubly nested loop of you've got your stretch factor and it's like you've got a point, you stretch by a little bit, it might be on the same pixel, it might be on the next pixel, it might have skipped a pixel."}, {"time": 8573, "text": "You can write that out but it's not gonna be fast enough where especially you get a character for that right in your face monster covering almost the entire screen."}, {"time": 8582, "text": "Doing that with a general purpose scaling routine would have just been much too slow."}, {"time": 8586, "text": "It would have worked when they're small characters but then it would get slower and slower as they got closer to you until right at the time when you most care about having a fast reaction time, the game would be chunking down."}, {"time": 8597, "text": "So the fastest possible way to draw pixels at that time was to, instead of saying I've got a general purpose version that can handle any scale, I used a program to make essentially a hundred or more separate little programs that was optimized for I will take an image and I will draw it 12 pixels tall."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "I'll take an image, I'll draw it 14 pixels tall up by every two pixels even for that."}, {"time": 8627, "text": "So you would have the most optimized code so that in the normal case where most of the world is fairly large, like the pixels are big, we did not have a lot of memory."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "So in most cases that meant that you would load a pixel color and then you would store it multiple times."}, {"time": 8645, "text": "So that was faster than even copying an image in a normal conventional case because most of the time the image is expanded."}, {"time": 8653, "text": "So instead of doing one read, one write for a simple copy, you might be doing one read and three or four writes as it got really big."}, {"time": 8660, "text": "And that had the beneficial aspect of just when you needed the performance most when things are covering the screen, it was giving you the most acceleration for that."}, {"time": 8668, "text": "By the way, were you able to understand this through thinking about it or were you testing like the right speed and like that?"}, {"time": 8676, "text": "This again comes back to, I can find the antecedents for things like this."}, {"time": 8681, "text": "So back in the Apple II days, the graphics were essentially single bits at a time."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "And if you wanted to make your little spaceship, if you wanted to make it smoothly go across the world, if you just took the image and you drew it out at the next location, you would move by seven pixels at a time, so it'd go chunk, chunk, chunk."}, {"time": 8701, "text": "If you wanted to make it move smoothly, you actually had to make seven versions of the ship that were pre shifted."}, {"time": 8707, "text": "You could write a program that would shift it dynamically, but on a one megahertz processor, that's not going anywhere fast."}, {"time": 8713, "text": "So if you wanted to do a smooth moving fast action game, you made separate versions of each of these sprites."}, {"time": 8720, "text": "Now there were a few more tricks you could pull that if it still wasn't fast enough, you could make a compiled shape where instead of this program that normally copies an image and says like, get this byte from here, stored here, get this byte, store this byte."}, {"time": 8735, "text": "If you've got the memory space, you could say, I'm going to write the program that does nothing but draw this shape."}, {"time": 8741, "text": "It's going to be like, I'm going to load the immediate value 25, which is some bit pattern, and then I'm going to store that at this location."}, {"time": 8751, "text": "Rather than loading something from memory that involved indexing registers and this other slow stuff, you could go ahead and say, no, I'm gonna hard code the exact values of all of the image right into the program."}, {"time": 8762, "text": "And this was always a horrible trade off there, which you didn't have much memory and you didn't have much speed."}, {"time": 8767, "text": "But if you had something that you wanted to go really fast, you could turn it into a program."}, {"time": 8771, "text": "And that was, knowing about that technique is what made me think about some of these unwinding it for the PC where people that didn't come from that background were less likely to think about that."}, {"time": 8783, "text": "I mean, there's some deep parallels probably to human cognition as well."}, {"time": 8787, "text": "There's something about optimizing and compressing the processing of a new information that requires you to predict the possible ways in which the game or the world might unroll."}, {"time": 8804, "text": "And you have something like compiled scaler is always there."}, {"time": 8807, "text": "So you have like, like you have a prediction of how the world will unroll and you have some kind of optimized data structure for that prediction."}, {"time": 8818, "text": "And then you can modify if the world turns out to be different, you can modify a slight way."}, {"time": 8822, "text": "And as far as building out techniques, so much of the brain is about the associative context."}, {"time": 8826, "text": "You know, they're just, when you learn something, it's in the context of something else and you can have faint, tiny little hints of things."}, {"time": 8833, "text": "And I do think there are some deep things around like sparse distributed memories and boosting."}, {"time": 8838, "text": "That's like, if you can just be slightly above the noise floor of having some hint of something, you can have things refined into pulling the memory back up."}, {"time": 8846, "text": "So having a, being a programmer and having a toolbox of like all of these things that, things that I did in all of these previous lives of programming tasks that still matters to me about how I'm able to pull up some of these things."}, {"time": 8858, "text": "Like in that case, it was something I did on the Apple 2 then being relevant for the PC."}, {"time": 8863, "text": "And I have still cases when I would, when I would work on mobile development then be like, okay, I did something like this back in the doom days, but now it's a different environment, but I have still had that tie."}, {"time": 8875, "text": "I can bring it in and I can transform it into what the world needs right now."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "And I do think that's actually one of the very core things with human cognition and brain like, you know, brain like functioning is finding these ways about you've got, your brain is kind of everything everywhere all at once."}, {"time": 8890, "text": "You know, it's, it is just a set of all of this stuff that is just fetched back by these queries that go into it."}, {"time": 8896, "text": "And they can just be slightly above the noise floor with a random noise in your neurons and synapses that are affecting exactly what gets pulled up."}, {"time": 8903, "text": "So you're saying some of these very specific solutions for different games, you find that there's a kernel of a deep idea that's generalizable to other, to other things."}, {"time": 8914, "text": "Yeah, you can't predict what it's going to be, but that idea of like, I called out that compiled shaders in the forward that I wrote for that, the game engine black book, as you know, this is, it's kind of an end point of unrolling code, but that's one of those things that thinking about that and having that in your mind."}, {"time": 8931, "text": "And I'm sure there are some programmers that, you know, hear about that."}, {"time": 8934, "text": "Think about it a little bit."}, {"time": 8935, "text": "It's kind of the mind blown moment."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "It's like, oh, you can just turn all of that data into code."}, {"time": 8940, "text": "And nowadays, you know, you have instruction cache issues and that's not necessarily the best idea, but there are different, it's an idea that has power and has probably relevance in some other areas."}, {"time": 8951, "text": "Maybe it's in a hardware point of view that there's a way you approach building hardware that has that same, you don't even have to think about iterating."}, {"time": 8958, "text": "You just bake everything all the way into it in one place."}, {"time": 8962, "text": "What is the story of how you came to program Doom?"}, {"time": 8965, "text": "What are some memorable technical challenges or innovations within that game?"}, {"time": 8969, "text": "So the path that we went after Wolfenstein got out and we were on this crazy arc where Keen one through three, more success than we thought, Keen four through six, even more success, Wolfenstein even more success."}, {"time": 8982, "text": "So we were on this crazy trajectory for things."}, {"time": 8986, "text": "So actually our first box commercial project was the Commander Keen game, but then Wolfenstein was going to have a game called Spear of Destiny, which was a commercial version, 60 new levels."}, {"time": 8997, "text": "So the rest of the team took the game engine pretty much as it was and started working on that."}, {"time": 9002, "text": "We got new monsters, but it's basically reskins of the things there."}, {"time": 9007, "text": "And there's a really interesting aspect about that that I didn't appreciate until much, much later about how Wolfenstein clearly did tap out its limit about what you want to play, all the levels and a couple of our license things."}, {"time": 9021, "text": "There was a hard creative wall that you did not really benefit much by continuing to beat on it."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "But a game like Doom and other more modern games like Minecraft or something, there's kind of a Turing completeness level of design freedom that you get in games that Wolfenstein clearly sat on one side of."}, {"time": 9040, "text": "All the creative people in the world could not go and do a masterpiece just with the technology that Wolfenstein had."}, {"time": 9046, "text": "Wolfenstein could do Wolfenstein, but you really couldn't do something crazy and different."}, {"time": 9050, "text": "But it didn't take that much more capability to get to Wolfenstein with the freeform lines and a little bit more artistic freedom to get to the point where people still announce new Doom levels today, all these years after without having completely tapped out the creativity."}, {"time": 9066, "text": "How did you put it?"}, {"time": 9067, "text": "Turing complete?"}, {"time": 9068, "text": "Yeah, Turing complete design space."}, {"time": 9070, "text": "Design space."}, {"time": 9071, "text": "Where it's like, you know, we have the kind of computational universality on a lot of things and how different subsurface work."}, {"time": 9076, "text": "For creativity."}, {"time": 9077, "text": "But yeah, there's things where a box can be too small, but above a certain point, you kind of are at the point where you really have almost unbounded creative ability there."}, {"time": 9088, "text": "And Doom was the first time you crossed that line."}, {"time": 9091, "text": "Yeah, where there were thousands of Doom levels created, and some of them still have something new and interesting to say to the world about it."}, {"time": 9098, "text": "Is that line, can you introspect what that line was?"}, {"time": 9103, "text": "Is it in the design space?"}, {"time": 9104, "text": "Is it something about the programming capabilities that you were able to add to the game?"}, {"time": 9110, "text": "So the graphics fidelity was a necessary part because the block limitations in Wolfenstein, what we had right there was not enough."}, {"time": 9120, "text": "The full scale blocks, although Minecraft really did show that perhaps blocks stacked in 3D and at one quarter of the scale of that, or one eighth in volume, is then sufficient to have all of that."}, {"time": 9133, "text": "But the wall sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein was too much of a creative limitation."}, {"time": 9138, "text": "We licensed the technology to a few other teams."}, {"time": 9141, "text": "None of them made too much of a dent with that."}, {"time": 9144, "text": "It just wasn't enough creative ability."}, {"time": 9147, "text": "But a little bit more, whether it was the variable floors and ceilings and arbitrary angles in Doom, or the smaller voxel blocks in Minecraft, is then enough to open it up to just worlds and worlds of new capabilities."}, {"time": 9161, "text": "What is binary space partitioning?"}, {"time": 9165, "text": "So the."}, {"time": 9165, "text": "Which is one of the technologies."}, {"time": 9167, "text": "Yeah, so jump around a little bit on the story path there."}, {"time": 9171, "text": "So while the team was working on Spirit Destiny for Wolfenstein, we had met another development team, Raven Software, while we were in Wisconsin."}, {"time": 9179, "text": "And they were doing, they had RPG background and I still kind of loved that."}, {"time": 9184, "text": "And I offered to do a game engine for them to let them do a 3D rendered RPG instead of the, like most RPG games were kind of hand drawn."}, {"time": 9194, "text": "They made it look kind of 3D, but it was done just all with artist work rather than a real engine."}, {"time": 9199, "text": "And after Wolfenstein, this was still a tile based world, but I added floors and ceilings and some lighting and the ability to have some sloped floors in different areas."}, {"time": 9208, "text": "And that was my intermediate step for a game called Shadowcaster."}, {"time": 9212, "text": "And it had slowed down enough."}, {"time": 9214, "text": "It was not fast enough to do our type of action things."}, {"time": 9217, "text": "So they had the screen crop down a little bit."}, {"time": 9219, "text": "So you couldn't go the full screen width like we would try to do in Wolfenstein, but I learned a lot."}, {"time": 9226, "text": "I got the floors and ceilings and lightings and it looked great."}, {"time": 9228, "text": "They were great artists up there."}, {"time": 9230, "text": "And it was an inspiration for us to look at some of that stuff."}, {"time": 9234, "text": "But I had learned enough from that, that I had the plan for, I knew faster ways to do the lighting and shadowing."}, {"time": 9241, "text": "And I wanted to do this free form geometry."}, {"time": 9243, "text": "I wanted to break out of this tile based 90 degree world limitations."}, {"time": 9249, "text": "So we had, that was when we got our next stations and we were working with these higher powered systems."}, {"time": 9254, "text": "And we built an editor that let us draw kind of arbitrary line segments."}, {"time": 9260, "text": "And I was working hard to try to make something that could render this fast enough."}, {"time": 9266, "text": "I was pushing myself pretty hard."}, {"time": 9268, "text": "And we were at a point where we could see some things that looked amazingly cool, but it wasn't really fast enough for the way I was doing it."}, {"time": 9277, "text": "For this flexibility, it was no longer, I couldn't just ray cast into it."}, {"time": 9281, "text": "And I had these very complex sets of lines and simple little worlds were okay."}, {"time": 9285, "text": "But the cool things that we wanted to do just weren't quite fast enough."}, {"time": 9289, "text": "And I wound up taking a break at that point."}, {"time": 9292, "text": "And I did the port."}, {"time": 9294, "text": "I did two ports of our games, Wolfenstein to the Super Nintendo."}, {"time": 9301, "text": "It was a crazy difficult thing to do, which was an even slower processors, like a couple of megahertz processor."}, {"time": 9310, "text": "And it had been this whole thing where we had farmed out the work and it wasn't going well."}, {"time": 9317, "text": "And I took it back over and trying to make it go fast on there where it really did not have much processing power."}, {"time": 9325, "text": "The pixels were stretched up hugely and it was pretty ugly when you looked at it."}, {"time": 9329, "text": "But in the end, it did come out fast enough to play and still be kind of fun from that."}, {"time": 9333, "text": "But that was where I started using BSP trees or binary space partitioning trees."}, {"time": 9338, "text": "It was one of those things I had to make it faster there."}, {"time": 9341, "text": "It was a stepping stone where it was reasonably easy to understand in the grid world of Wolfenstein where it was all still 90 degree angles."}, {"time": 9349, "text": "BSP trees were, I eased myself into it with that."}, {"time": 9353, "text": "And it was a big success."}, {"time": 9356, "text": "Then when I came back to working on Doom, I had this new tool in my toolbox."}, {"time": 9360, "text": "It was gonna be a lot harder with the arbitrary angles of Doom."}, {"time": 9363, "text": "This was where I really started grappling with epsilon problems."}, {"time": 9367, "text": "And just up until that point, I hadn't really had to deal with the fact that I am so many numeric things."}, {"time": 9373, "text": "This almost felt like a betrayal to me where people had told me that I had mathematicians up on a bit of a pedestal where I was, people think I'm a math wizard and I'm not."}, {"time": 9382, "text": "I really, everything that I did was really done with a solid high school math understanding."}, {"time": 9389, "text": "Algebra two trigonometry and that was what got me all the way through Doom and Quake and all of that, of just understanding basics of matrices and knowing it well enough to do something with it."}, {"time": 9401, "text": "What's the epsilon problems you ran into?"}, {"time": 9402, "text": "So when you wind up taking like a sloped line and you say, I'm going to intersect it with another sloped line, then you wind up with something that's not going to be on these nice grid boundaries."}, {"time": 9414, "text": "With the Wolfenstein tile maps, all you've got is horizontal and vertical lines looking at it from above."}, {"time": 9420, "text": "And if you cut one of them, it's just obvious the other one gets cut exactly at that point."}, {"time": 9424, "text": "But when you have angled lines, you're doing a kind of a slope intercept problem and you wind up with rational numbers there where things that are not going to evenly land on an integer or even on any fixed point value that you've got."}, {"time": 9437, "text": "So everything winds up having to snap to some fixed point value."}, {"time": 9440, "text": "So the lines slightly change their angle."}, {"time": 9443, "text": "You wind up, if you cut something here, this one's going to bend a little this way and it's not going to be completely straight."}, {"time": 9448, "text": "And then you come down to all these questions of, well, this one is a point on an angled line."}, {"time": 9455, "text": "You can't answer that in finite precision unless you're doing something with actual rational numbers."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "And later on, I did waste far too much time chasing things like that."}, {"time": 9464, "text": "How do you do precise arithmetic with rational numbers?"}, {"time": 9466, "text": "And it always blows up eventually, exponentially as you do it."}, {"time": 9470, "text": "So these kinds of things are impossible with computers."}, {"time": 9473, "text": "So they're possible."}, {"time": 9475, "text": "Again, there are paths to doing it, but you can't fit them conveniently in any of the numbers."}, {"time": 9480, "text": "You need to start using big nums and different factor trackings of different things."}, {"time": 9484, "text": "So you have to, if you have any elements of OCD and you want to do something perfectly, you're screwed if you're working with floating point."}, {"time": 9493, "text": "So you had to deal with this for the first time."}, {"time": 9495, "text": "And there were lots of challenges there about like, okay, they build this cool thing."}, {"time": 9500, "text": "And the way the BSP trees work is it basically takes the walls and it carves other walls by those walls in this clever way that you can then take all of these fragments."}, {"time": 9510, "text": "And then you can for sure, from any given point, get an ordering of everything in the world."}, {"time": 9515, "text": "And you can say, this goes in front of this, goes in front of this, all the way back to the last thing."}, {"time": 9520, "text": "And that's super valuable for graphics where kind of a classic graphics algorithm would be painter's algorithm."}, {"time": 9526, "text": "You paint the furthest thing first, and then the next thing, and then the next thing, and then it comes up and it's all perfect for you."}, {"time": 9532, "text": "That's slow because you don't want to have to have drawn everything like that, but you can also flip it around and draw the closest thing to you."}, {"time": 9539, "text": "And then if you're clever about it, you can figure out what you need to draw that's visible beyond that."}, {"time": 9545, "text": "And that's what BSP trees allow you to do."}, {"time": 9547, "text": "Yeah, so it's combined with a bunch of other things, but it gives you that ordering."}, {"time": 9552, "text": "It's a clever way of doing things."}, {"time": 9553, "text": "And I remember I had learned this from one of my graphics Bible at the time, a book called Foley and Van Damme."}, {"time": 9560, "text": "And again, it was a different world back there."}, {"time": 9562, "text": "There was a small integer number of books."}, {"time": 9564, "text": "And this book that was big fat college textbook that I had read through many times."}, {"time": 9572, "text": "I didn't understand everything in it."}, {"time": 9574, "text": "Some of it wasn't useful to me, but they had the little thing about finite orderings of you draw a little T shaped thing and you can say you can make a fixed ahead of time order from this and you can generalize this with the BSP trees."}, {"time": 9588, "text": "And I got a little bit more information about that."}, {"time": 9590, "text": "And it was kind of fun later while I was working on Quake, I got to meet Bruce Naylor, who is one of the original researchers that developed those technologies for academic literature."}, {"time": 9600, "text": "And that was kind of fun, but I was very much just finding a tool that can help me solve what I was doing."}, {"time": 9605, "text": "And I was using it in this very crude way in a two dimensional fashion, rather than the general 3D."}, {"time": 9610, "text": "The Epsilon problems got much worse in Quake and three dimensionals when things angle in every way."}, {"time": 9615, "text": "But eventually I did sort out how to do it reliably on Doom."}, {"time": 9620, "text": "There were still a few edge cases in Doom that were not absolutely perfect where they even got terminologies in the communities."}, {"time": 9627, "text": "Like when you got to something where it was messed up, it was a hall of mirrors effect because you'd sweep by and it wouldn't draw something there."}, {"time": 9633, "text": "And you would just wind up with the leftover remnants as you flipped between the two pages."}, {"time": 9639, "text": "But BSP trees were important for it."}, {"time": 9641, "text": "But it's again worth noting that after we did Doom, our major competition came from Ken Silverman and his build engine, which was used for Duke Nukem 3D and some of the other games for 3D Realms."}, {"time": 9654, "text": "And he used a completely different technology, nothing to do with BSP trees."}, {"time": 9659, "text": "So there's not just a one true way of doing things."}, {"time": 9663, "text": "There were critical things about to make any of those games fast."}, {"time": 9667, "text": "You had to separate your drawing into, you drew vertical lines and you drew horizontal lines, just kind of changing exactly what you would draw with them."}, {"time": 9675, "text": "That was critical for the technologies at that time."}, {"time": 9679, "text": "And like all the games that were kind of like that wound up doing something similar, but there were still a bunch of other decisions that could be made."}, {"time": 9686, "text": "And we made good enough decisions on everything on Doom."}, {"time": 9690, "text": "We brought in multiplayer significantly and it was our first game that was designed to be modified by the user community where we had this whole setup of our WAD files and PWADs and things that people could build with tools that we released to them."}, {"time": 9704, "text": "And they eventually rewrote to be better than what we released, but they could build things and you could add it to your game without destructively modifying it, which is what you had to do in all the early games."}, {"time": 9714, "text": "You literally hacked the data files or the executable before while Doom was set up in this flexible way so that you could just say, run the normal game with this added on on top and it would overlay just the things that you wanted to there."}, {"time": 9729, "text": "Would you say that Doom was kind of the first true 3D game that you created?"}, {"time": 9734, "text": "So no, it's still, Doom would usually be called a two and a half D game where it had three dimensional points on it."}, {"time": 9740, "text": "And this is another one of these kind of pedantic things that people love to argue about, about what was the first 3D game."}, {"time": 9745, "text": "I still, like every month probably I hear from somebody about, well, was Doom really a 3D game or something?"}, {"time": 9754, "text": "And I give the point where characters had three coordinates."}, {"time": 9758, "text": "So you had like an X, Y and Z, the cacodamon could be coming in very high and come down towards you."}, {"time": 9765, "text": "The walls had three coordinates on them."}, {"time": 9767, "text": "So on some sense it's a 3D game engine, but it was not a fully general 3D game engine."}, {"time": 9773, "text": "You could not build a pyramid in Doom because you couldn't make a sloped wall, which was slightly different where in that previous shadow caster game, I could have vertexes and have a sloped floor there, but the changes that I made for Doom to get higher speed and a different set of flexibility traded away that ability, but you literally couldn't make that."}, {"time": 9793, "text": "You could not, you could make different heights of passages, but you could not make a bridge over another area."}, {"time": 9800, "text": "You could not go over and above it."}, {"time": 9801, "text": "So it still had some 2D limitations to it."}, {"time": 9804, "text": "That's more about the building versus the actual experience."}, {"time": 9807, "text": "Cause the experience is."}, {"time": 9809, "text": "It felt like things would come at you, but again, you couldn't look up either."}, {"time": 9812, "text": "I am, you know, you could only pitch."}, {"time": 9814, "text": "It was four degrees of freedom rather than six degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 9818, "text": "You did not have the ability to tilt your head this way or pitch up and down."}, {"time": 9822, "text": "So that takes us to Quake."}, {"time": 9824, "text": "What was the leap there?"}, {"time": 9827, "text": "What was some fascinating technical challenges and there were a lot or not challenges, but innovations that you've come up with."}, {"time": 9834, "text": "So Quake was kind of the first thing where I did have to kind of come face to face with my limitations, where it was the first thing where I really did kind of give it my all and still come up, you know, come up a little bit short in terms of what and when I wanted to get it done."}, {"time": 9851, "text": "And the company ran, they had some serious stresses through the whole project and we bit off a lot."}, {"time": 9859, "text": "So the things that we set out to do was it was going to be really a true 3D engine where it could do six degree of freedom."}, {"time": 9866, "text": "You could have all the viewpoints."}, {"time": 9869, "text": "You could model anything."}, {"time": 9871, "text": "It had a really remarkable new lighting model with the surface caching and things."}, {"time": 9877, "text": "That was one of those where it was starting to do some things that they weren't doing even on the very high end systems."}, {"time": 9883, "text": "And it was going to be completely programmable in the modding standpoint, where the thing that you couldn't do in Doom, you could replace almost all of the media, but you couldn't really change the game."}, {"time": 9895, "text": "There were still some people that were doing the hex setting of the executable, the dehacked things where you could change a few things about rules and people made some early capture the flag type things by hacking the executable, but it wasn't really set out to do that."}, {"time": 9908, "text": "Quake was going to have its own programming language that the game was going to be implemented in it."}, {"time": 9913, "text": "And that would be able to be overwritten just like any of the media."}, {"time": 9916, "text": "Code was going to be data for that."}, {"time": 9918, "text": "And you would be able to have expansion packs that changed fundamental things and mods and so on."}, {"time": 9924, "text": "And the multiplayer was going to be playable over the internet."}, {"time": 9928, "text": "It was going to support a client server rather than peer to peer."}, {"time": 9932, "text": "So we had the possibility of supporting larger numbers of players in disparate locations with this full flexibility of the programming overrides with full six degree of freedom modeling and viewing."}, {"time": 9944, "text": "And with this fancy new light mapped kind of surface caching side."}, {"time": 9949, "text": "It was a lot."}, {"time": 9950, "text": "And this was one of those things that if I could go back and tell younger me to do something differently, it would have been to split those innovations up into two phases in two separate games."}, {"time": 9962, "text": "It will be phase one and phase two."}, {"time": 9963, "text": "So it probably would have been taking the Doom rendering engine and bringing in the TCP IP client server."}, {"time": 9970, "text": "Focusing on the multiplayer."}, {"time": 9972, "text": "And the Quake C or would have been Doom C programming language there."}, {"time": 9976, "text": "So I would have split that into programming language and networking with the same Doom engine rather than forcing everybody to go towards the Quake engine, which really meant getting a Pentium."}, {"time": 9987, "text":

speaking of people happier, our mutual friend, Joe Rogan, it seems like the most important moment of his life is centered around Quake."}, {"time": 10009, "text": "So it was a definitive part of his life."}, {"time": 10013, "text": "So would he agree with your thinking that they should split?"}, {"time": 10019, "text": "So he is a person who loves Quake and played Quake a lot."}, {"time": 10023, "text": "Would he agree that you should have done the Doom engine and focus on the multiplayer for phase one?"}, {"time": 10029, "text": "Or in your looking back, is the 3D world that Quake created was also fundamental to the enriching experience?"}, {"time": 10039, "text": "You know, I would say that what would have happened is you would have had a Doom looking but Quake feeling game eight months earlier and then maybe six months after Quake actually shipped, then there would have been the full running on a Pentium, six degree of freedom graphics engine type things there."}, {"time": 10058, "text": "So it's not that it wouldn't have been there."}, {"time": 10062, "text": "It would have been something amazingly cool earlier and then something even cooler somewhat later where I would much rather have gone and done two one year development efforts."}, {"time": 10073, "text": "I've cycled them through."}, {"time": 10074, "text": "I've been a little more pragmatic about that rather than killing us ourselves on the whole Quake development."}, {"time": 10081, "text": "But I would say it's obviously things worked out well in the end, but looking back and saying, how would I optimize and do things differently?"}, {"time": 10088, "text": "That did seem to be a clear case where I going ahead and we had enormous momentum on Doom."}, {"time": 10095, "text": "We did Doom two as the kind of commercial boxed version after our shareware success with the original, but we could have just made another Doom game adding those new features in."}, {"time": 10107, "text": "It would have been huge."}, {"time": 10108, "text": "We would have learned all the same lessons, but faster."}, {"time": 10111, "text": "And it would have given six degree of freedom and Pentium class systems a little bit more time to get mainstream because we did cut out a lot of people with the hardware requirements for Quake."}, {"time": 10122, "text": "Was there any dark moments for you personally, psychologically in having such harsh deadlines and having to solve so many difficult technical challenges?"}, {"time": 10134, "text": "So I've never really had really dark black places."}, {"time":

coped best on that when all I need to do is usually just kind of bear down on my work."}, {"time": 10191, "text": "I pull myself out of whatever hole I might be slipping into by actually making progress."}, {"time": 10197, "text": "I mean, maybe if I was in a position where I was never able to make that progress, I could have slid down further, but I've always been in a place where, okay, a little bit more work, maybe I'm in a tough spot here, but I always know if I just keep pushing, eventually I break through and I make progress, I feel good about what I'm doing."}, {"time": 10217,

of running their script."}, {"time": 10258, "text": "It's like, okay, it's kind of a weird kid here."}, {"time": 10260, "text": "Let's carefully probe around."}, {"time": 10262, "text": "It's like, do you ever think about ending it all?"}, {"time": 10265, "text": "I'm like, no, of course not."}, {"time": 10267, "text": "Never, not at all."}, {"time": 10268, "text": "This is temporary, things are

cruelty and suffering and that's absurd?"}, {"time": 10298, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I was not a victim of cruelty and suffering."}, {"time": 10301, "text": "It's like, I was an unhappy, somewhat petulant youth in my point where I'm not putting myself up with anybody else's suffering, but I was unhappy objectively."}, {"time": 10312, "text": "And the things that I did that very much characterized my childhood were I had books, comic books, Dungeons and Dragons, arcade games, video games."}, {"time": 10323, "text": "Like some of my fondest childhood memories are the convenience stores, the 711s and Quick Trips, because they had a spinner rack of comic books and they had a little side room with two or three video games, arcade games in it."}, {"time": 10335, "text": "And that was very much my happy place."}, {"time": 10338, "text": "If I could, I get my comic books and if I could go to a library and go through those little zero, zero, zero section where computer books were supposed to be."}, {"time": 10347, "text": "And there were a few sad little books there, but still just being able to sit down and go through that."}, {"time": 10351, "text": "And I read a ridiculous number of books, both fiction and nonfiction as a teenager."}, {"time": 10358, "text": "And my rebelling in high school was just sitting there with my nose in a book, ignoring the class through lots of it."}, {"time": 10366, "text": "And teachers had a range of reactions to that, some more accepting of it than others."}, {"time": 10374, "text": "So let us return to Quake for a bit with the technical challenges."}, {"time": 10377, "text": "What everything together from the networking to the graphics, what are some things you remember that were innovations you had to come up with in order to make it all happen?"}, {"time": 10392, "text": "Yeah, so there were a bunch of things on Quake where on the one hand, the idea that I built my own programming language to implement the game in."}, {"time": 10400, "text": "Looking back, and I try to tell people, it's like every high level programmer sometime in their career goes through and they invent their own language."}, {"time": 10408, "text": "It just seems to be a thing that's pretty broadly done."}, {"time": 10410, "text": "People will be like, I'm gonna go write a computer programming language."}, {"time": 10413, "text": "And I don't regret having done it, but after that, I switched from Quake C, my quirky little pseudo object oriented or entity oriented language there."}, {"time": 10425, "text": "Quake two went back to using DLLs with C and then Quake three, I implemented my own C interpreter or compiler, which was a much smarter thing to do that I should have done originally for Quake."}, {"time": 10435, "text": "But building my own language was an experience."}, {"time": 10437, "text": "I learned a lot from that."}, {"time": 10439, "text": "And then there was a generation of game programmers that learned programming with Quake C, which I feel kind of bad about, because we give JavaScript a lot of crap, but Quake C was nothing to write home about there."}, {"time": 10453, "text": "But it allowed people to do magical things."}, {"time": 10455, "text": "You get into programming, not because you love the BNF syntax of a language, it's because the language lets you do something that you cared about."}, {"time": 10464, "text": "And here's very much, you could do something in a whole beautiful three dimensional world."}, {"time": 10469, "text": "And the idea and the fact that the code for the game was out there, you could say, I liked the shotgun, but I want it to be more bad ass."}, {"time": 10476, "text": "You go in there and say, okay, now it does 200 points damage."}, {"time": 10479, "text": "And then you go around with a big grin on your face, blowing up monsters all over the game."}, {"time": 10483, "text": "So yeah, it is not what I would do today going back with that language, but that was a big part of it."}, {"time": 10491, "text": "Learning about the networking stuff, because it's interesting where I learned these things by reading books."}, {"time": 10497, "text": "So I would get a book on networking and find something, I read all about it and learn, okay, packets, they can be out of order or lost or duplicated."}, {"time": 10506, "text": "These are all the things that can theoretically happen to packets."}, {"time": 10509, "text": "So I wind up spending all this time thinking about how do we deal about all of that?"}, {"time": 10513, "text": "And it turns out, of course, in the real world, those are things that yes, theoretically can happen with multiple routes, but they really aren't things that your 99.999% of your packets have to deal with."}, {"time": 10525, "text": "So there was learning experiences about lots of that."}, {"time": 10528, "text": "Like why, when TCP is appropriate versus UDP and how if you do things in UDP, you wind up reinventing TCP badly in almost all cases."}, {"time": 10537, "text": "So there's good arguments for using both for different game technology, different parts of the game process, transitioning from level to level and all."}, {"time": 10546, "text": "But the graphics were the showcase of what Quake was all about."}, {"time": 10551, "text": "It was this graphics technology that nobody had seen there."}, {"time": 10555, "text": "And it was a while before there were competitive things out there."}, {"time": 10559, "text": "And it went a long time internally really not working where we were even building levels where the game just was not at all shippable with large fractions of the world, like disappearing, not being there, or being really slow in various parts of it."}, {"time": 10576, "text": "And it was this act of faith."}, {"time": 10578, "text": "It's like, I think I'm gonna be able to fix this."}, {"time": 10580, "text": "I think I'm gonna be able to make this work."}, {"time": 10583, "text": "And lots of stuff changed where the level designers would build something and then have to throw it away as something fundamental and the kind of graphics or level technology changed."}, {"time": 10593, "text": "And so there were two big things that contributed to making it possible at that timeframe."}, {"time": 10601, "text": "Two new things."}, {"time": 10602, "text": "There was certainly hardcore optimized low level assembly language."}, {"time": 10606, "text": "And this was where I had hired Michael Abrash away from Microsoft."}, {"time": 10610, "text": "And he had been one of my early inspirations where back in the soft disk days, the library of magazines that they had, some of my most treasured ones were Michael Abrash's articles in Dr. Dobbs journal."}, {"time": 10622, "text": "And it was amazing after all of our success in Doom, we were able to kind of hit him up and say, hey, we'd like you to come work at id Software."}, {"time": 10630, "text": "And he was in the senior technical role at Microsoft."}, {"time": 10633, "text": "And he was on track for, and this was right when Microsoft was starting to take off."}, {"time": 10638, "text": "And I did eventually convince him that what we were doing was gonna be really amazing with Quake."}, {"time": 10644, "text": "It was gonna be something nobody had seen before."}, {"time": 10648, "text": "It had these aspects of what we were talking about."}, {"time": 10651, "text": "We had metaverse talk back then."}, {"time": 10653, "text": "We had read Snow Crash and we knew about this."}, {"time": 10656, "text": "And Michael was big into the science fiction and we would talk about all that and kind of spin this tale."}, {"time": 10662, "text": "And it was some of the same conversations that we have today about the metaverse, about how you could have different areas linked together by portals and you could have user generated content and changing out all of these things."}, {"time": 10674, "text": "So you really were creating the metaverse with Quake."}, {"time": 10676, "text": "And we talked about things like, Duke used to be advertised as a virtual reality experience."}, {"time": 10682, "text": "That was the first wave of virtual reality was in the late 80s and early 90s, you had like the Lawn Mower Man movie and you had time in Newsweek talking about the early VPL headsets."}, {"time": 10694, "text": "And of course that cratered so hard that people didn't wanna look at virtual reality for decades afterwards, where it was just, it was smoke and mirrors."}, {"time": 10703, "text": "It was not real in the sense that you could actually do something real and valuable with it."}, {"time": 10708, "text": "But still we had that kind of common set of talking points."}, {"time": 10712, "text": "And we were talking about what these games could become and how you'd like to see people building all of these creative things."}, {"time": 10719, "text": "Because we were seeing an explosion of work with Doom at that time, where people were doing amazingly cool things."}, {"time": 10725, "text": "Like we saw cooler levels that we had built coming out of the user community."}, {"time": 10729, "text": "And then people finding ways to change the characters in different ways."}, {"time": 10734, "text": "And it was great."}, {"time": 10734, "text": "And we knew what we were doing in Quake was removing those last things."}, {"time": 10738, "text": "There was some quirky things with a couple of the data types that didn't work right for overriding."}, {"time": 10743, "text": "And then the core thing about the programming model."}, {"time": 10747, "text": "And I was definitely going to hit all of those in Quake."}, {"time": 10750, "text": "But the graphics side of it was still, I knew what I wanted to do."}, {"time": 10757, "text": "And it was one of these hubris things where it's like, well, so far I've been able to kind of kick everything that I set out to go do."}, {"time": 10766, "text": "But Quake was definitely a little bit more than could be comfortably chewed at that point."}, {"time": 10772, "text": "And, but Michael was one of the strongest programmers and graphics programmers that I knew."}, {"time": 10779, "text": "And he was one of the people that I trusted to write assembly code better than I could."}, {"time": 10784, "text": "And there's a few people that I can point to about things like this where I'm a world class optimizer."}, {"time": 10789, "text": "I mean, I make things go fast, but I recognize there's a number of people that can write tighter assembly code, tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA code than I can write."}, {"time": 10802, "text": "My best strengths are a little bit more at the system level."}, {"time": 10805, "text": "I mean, I'm good at all of that, but the most leverage comes from making the decisions that are a little bit higher up where you figure out how to change your large scale problems so that these lower level problems are easier to do or it makes it possible to do them in a uniquely fast way."}, {"time": 10823, "text": "So most of my big wins in a lot of ways from all the way from the early games through VR and the aerospace work that I'm doing or did, and hopefully the AI work that I'm working on now is finding an angle on something that means you trade off something that you maybe think you need, but it turns out you don't need."}, {"time": 10843, "text": "And by making a sacrifice in one place, you can get big advantages in another place."}, {"time": 10848, "text": "Is it clear at which level of the system those big advantages can be gained?"}, {"time": 10854, "text": "It's not always clear."}, {"time": 10855, "text": "And that's why the thing that I try to make one of my core values, and I proselytize to a lot of people is trying to know the entire stack, trying to see through everything that happens."}, {"time": 10868, "text": "And it's almost impossible on like the web browser level of things where there's so many levels to it, but you should at least understand what they all are, even if you can't understand all the performance characteristics at each level, but it goes all the way down to literally the hardware."}, {"time": 10882, "text": "So what is this chip capable of?"}, {"time": 10886, "text": "And what is this software that you're writing capable of?"}, {"time": 10889, "text": "And then with this architecture you put on top of that, then the ecosystem around it, all the people that are working on it."}, {"time": 10895, "text": "So there are all these decisions and they're never made in a globally optimal way, but sometimes you can drive a thread of global optimality through it."}, {"time": 10905, "text": "You can't look at everything, it's too complicated, but sometimes you can step back up and make a different decision."}, {"time": 10911, "text": "And we kind of went through this on the graphic side on Quake, where in some ways it was kind of bad where Michael would spend his time writing, like I'd rough out the basic routines, like, okay, here's our span rasterizer."}, {"time": 10923, "text": "And he would spend a month writing this beautiful cycle optimized piece of assembly language that does what I asked it to do."}, {"time": 10933, "text": "And he did it faster than like my original code would do, or probably what I would be able to do even if I had spent that month on it."}, {"time": 10940, "text": "But then we'd have some cases when I'd be like, okay, well, I figured out at this higher level instead of drawing these in a painter's order here, I do a span buffer and it cuts out 30% or 40% of all of these pixels, but it means you need to rewrite kind of this interface of all of that."}, {"time": 10957, "text": "And I could tell that wore on him a little bit, but in the end it was the right thing to do where we wound up changing that rasterization approach and we wound up with a super optimized assembly language core loop and then a good system around it which minimized how much that had to be called."}, {"time": 10974, "text": "And so in order to be able to do this kind of system level thinking, whether we're talking about game development, aerospace, nuclear energy, AI, VR, you have to be able to understand the hardware, the low level software, the high level software, the design decisions, the whole thing, the full stack of it."}, {"time": 10998, "text": "Yeah, and that's where a lot of these things become possible."}, {"time": 11001, "text": "When you're really, when you're bringing the future forward, I mean, there's a pace that everything just kind of glides towards where we have a lot of progress that's happening at such a different, so many different ways you kind of slide towards progress just left to your own, programs just get faster."}, {"time": 11014, "text": "For a while it wasn't clear if they were gonna get fatter more than they get, quicker than they get faster and it cancels out, but it is clear now in retrospect, no, programs just get faster and have gotten faster for a long time."}, {"time": 11026, "text": "But if you wanna do something like back at that original talking about scrolling games, say what, this needs to be five times faster."}, {"time": 11034, "text": "Well, we can wait six years and just it'll naturally get that much faster at that time or you come up with some really clever way of doing it."}, {"time": 11043, "text": "So there are those opportunities like that in a whole bunch of different areas."}, {"time": 11048, "text": "Now, most programmers don't need to be thinking about that."}, {"time": 11051, "text": "There's not that many, there's a lot of opportunities for this, but it's not everyone's work a day type stuff."}, {"time": 11057, "text": "So everyone doesn't have to know how all these things work."}, {"time": 11060, "text": "They don't have to know how their compiler works, how the processor chip manages cache eviction and all these low level things."}, {"time": 11068, "text": "But sometimes there are powerful opportunities that you can look at and say, we can bring the future five years faster."}, {"time": 11077, "text": "We can do something that, wouldn't it be great if we could do this?"}, {"time": 11080, "text": "Well, we can do it today if we make a certain set of decisions."}, {"time": 11084, "text": "And it is in some ways smoke and mirrors where you say it's like, Doom was a lot of smoke and mirrors where people thought it was more capable than it actually was, but we picked the right smoke and mirrors to deploy in the game where by doing this, people will think that it's more general."}, {"time": 11101, "text": "We are gonna amaze them with what they've got here and they won't notice that it doesn't do these other things."}, {"time": 11107, "text": "So smart decision making at that point, that's where that kind of global holistic top down view can work."}, {"time": 11116, "text": "And I'm really a strong believer that technology should be sitting at that table having those discussions because you do have cases where you say, well, you wanna be the Jonathan Ivy or whatever, where it's a pure design solution."}, {"time": 11132, "text": "And that's in some cases now where you truly have almost infinite resources."}, {"time": 11137, "text": "Like if you're trying to do a scrolling game on the PC now, you don't even have to talk to a technology person."}, {"time": 11143, "text": "You can just have, any intern can make that go run as fast as it needs to there and it can be completely design based."}, {"time": 11150, "text": "But if you're trying to do something that's hard, either that can't be done for resources like VR on a mobile chip set, or that we don't even know how to do yet, like artificial general intelligence, it's probably going to be a matter of coming at it from an angle."}, {"time": 11165, "text": "Like, I mean, for AGI, we have some of like what are some of the hudder principles about how you can AXI or some of the, there are theoretical ways that you can say, this is the optimal learning algorithm that can solve everything, but it's completely impractical."}, {"time": 11178, "text": "You just can't do that."}, {"time": 11180, "text": "So clearly you have to make some concessions for general intelligence and nobody knows what the right ones are yet."}, {"time": 11187, "text": "So people are taking different angles of attack."}, {"time": 11189, "text": "I hope I've

of fun where one of the early things that we did where there was kind of the young buck bit going in where I was the new guy."}, {"time": 11559, "text": "And he was the top man programmer at the soft

would certainly not take that away from him."}, {"time": 11641, "text": "And even after we parted ways and he took his swing with Eidos, in some ways, he was ahead of the curve with mobile gaming as

it to build the metaverse?"}, {"time": 11780, "text": "What is the metaverse in your view?"}, {"time": 11782, "text": "You started with discussing and thinking about Quake as a kind of a metaverse."},

build it?"}, {"time": 11799, "text": "So the term comes from Neal Stephenson's book Snow Crash, which many of us had read back in the 90s."}, {"time": 11804, "text": "It was one of those kind of formative books."}, {"time": 11807, "text": "And there was this sense that the possibilities and kind of the freedom and unlimited capabilities to build a virtual world that does whatever you want, whatever you ask of it, has been a powerful draw for generations of developers, game developers specifically, and people that are thinking about more general purpose applications."}, {"time": 11830, "text": "So we were talking about that back in the Doom and Quake days about how do you wind up with an interconnected set of worlds that you kind of visit from one to another."}, {"time": 11839, "text": "And as web pages were becoming a thing, you start thinking about what is the interactive kind of 3D based equivalent of this."}, {"time": 11847, "text": "And there were a lot of really bad takes."}, {"time": 11849, "text": "You had like Vermol and virtual reality markup languages."}, {"time": 11854, "text": "And there's aspects like that that came from people saying, well, what kind of capabilities should we develop to enable this?"}, {"time": 11863, "text": "And that kind of capability first work has usually not panned out very well."}, {"time": 11868, "text": "On the other hand, we have successful games that started with things like Doom and Quake and communities that formed around those, whether it was server lists in the early days or literal portaling between different games, and then modern things that are on completely different order of magnitude like Minecraft and Fortnite that have 100 million plus users."}, {"time": 11891, "text": "I still think that that's the right way to go to build the metaverse is you build something that's amazing that people love and people wind up spending all their time in because it's awesome."}, {"time": 11901, "text": "And you expand the capabilities of that."}, {"time": 11904, "text": "So even if it's a very basic experience, if it's awesome."}, {"time": 11908, "text": "Minecraft is an amazing case study in so many things."}, {"time": 11911, "text": "That's basic as it gets."}, {"time": 11912, "text": "What's been able to be done with that is really enlightening."}, {"time": 11916, "text": "And there are other cases where, like right now, Roblox is basically a game construction kit aimed at kids."}, {"time": 11923, "text": "And that was a capability first play."}, {"time": 11925, "text": "And it's achieving scale that's on the same order of those things."}, {"time": 11929, "text": "So it's not impossible, but my preferred bet would be you make something amazing that people love and you make it better and better."}, {"time": 11936, "text": "And that's where I could say we could have gone back and followed a path like that in the early days if you just take the same game, whether it's when Activision demonstrated that you could make Call of Duty every year."}, {"time": 11949, "text": "And not only is it not bad, people love it."}, {"time": 11952, "text": "And it's very profitable."}, {"time": 11954, "text": "The idea that you could have taken something like that, take a great game, release a new version every year that lets the capabilities grow and expand to start saying it's like, OK, it's a game about running around and shooting things, but now you can bring your media into it."}, {"time": 11970, "text": "You can add persistence of social signs of life or whatever you want to add to it."}, {"time": 11977, "text": "I still think that's quite a good position to take."}, {"time": 11981, "text": "And I think that while Meta is doing a bottoms up capability approach with Horizon Worlds where it's a fairly general purpose, creators can build whatever they want in their sort of thing, it's hard to compare and compete with something like Fortnite, which also has enormous amounts of creativity even though it was not designed originally as a general purpose sort of thing."}, {"time": 12005, "text": "So we have examples on both sides."}, {"time": 12008, "text": "Me personally, I would have bet on trying to do entertainment, valuable destination first, and expanding from there."}, {"time": 12016, "text": "So can you imagine the thing that will be kind of, if we look back a couple of centuries from now and you think about the experiences that marked the singularity, the transition where most of our world moved into virtual reality, what do you think those experiences will look like?"}, {"time": 12040, "text": "So I do think it's going to be kind of like the way the web slowly took over, where you're the frog in the pot of water that's slowly heating up, where having lived through all of that, I remember when it was shocking to start seeing the first website address on a billboard when you're like, hey, my computer world is infecting the real world."},

big bang sort of moment there."}, {"time": 12072, "text": "It was a bunch of little things that turned out not to even be the things that are relevant now that brought them into it."}, {"time": 12078, "text": "So I wonder if, I mean, like you said, you're not a historian."}, {"time": 12083, "text": "So maybe there is a historian out there that could really identify that moment, data driven way."},

that."}, {"time": 12102, "text": "I think that's kind of the fallacy of historians, though, looking for some of those kind of primary dominant causes where so many of these things are like we see an exponential curve."}, {"time": 12112, "text": "But it's not because like one thing is going exponential."}, {"time": 12115, "text": "It's because we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves overlapped on top of each other."}, {"time": 12120, "text": "And they just happen to keep adding up so that you've got something kind of going exponential at any given point."}, {"time": 12126, "text": "But no single one of them was the critical thing."}, {"time": 12129, "text": "There were dozens and dozens of things."}, {"time": 12131, "text": "I mean, seeing the transitions of stuff like as obviously MySpace giving way to other things, but even like blogging giving way to social media and getting resurrected in other guises."}, {"time": 12142, "text": "And the memes with the dancing baby GIF or whatever the all your base now belong to us."}, {"time": 12149, "text": "Whatever those early memes that led to the modern memes and the different evolution of humor on the internet that I'm sure the historians will also write books about from the different website that support to create the infrastructure for that humor like Reddit and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 12166, "text": "So people will go back, and they will name firsts and critical moments."}, {"time": 12170, "text": "But it's probably going to be a poor approximation of what actually happens."}, {"time": 12174, "text": "And we've already seen in the VR space where it didn't play out the way we thought it would in terms of what was going to be like when the modern era of VR basically started with my E3 demo of Doom 3 on the Rift prototype."}, {"time": 12188, "text": "So we're like first person shooters in VR, match made in heaven, right?"}, {"time": 12192, "text": "And that didn't work out that way at all."},

was something that played almost perfectly to what turned out to be the real strengths of VR where the one thing that I really underestimated importance in VR was the importance of the controllers."},

that was really amazing."}, {"time": 12246, "text": "But the controllers were super important."}, {"time": 12249, "text": "But the problem is so many things that you do with the controllers just suck."}, {"time": 12253, "text": "It feels like it breaks the illusion like trying to pick up glasses with the controllers where you're like, oh, use the grip button when you're kind of close and it'll snap into your hand."}, {"time": 12261, "text": "All of those things are unnatural actions that you do them and it's still part of the VR experience."}, {"time": 12267, "text": "But Beat Saber

hour just to get anywhere."}, {"time": 12322, "text": "Sometimes a new game takes an hour to get through the tutorial level."}, {"time": 12325, "text": "And that's not good for VR for a couple

headset, where it can be better than somebody that's living in a tiny apartment can have a palatial estate in virtual reality."}, {"time": 12491, "text": "They can have all their friends from all over the world come over and visit them without everybody getting on a plane and meeting in some place and dealing with all the other logistics hassles."}, {"time": 12501, "text": "There is real value in the presence that you can get for remote meetings."}, {"time": 12506, "text": "It's all the little things that we need to sort out, but those are things that we have line of sight on."}, {"time": 12512, "text": "People that have been in like a good VR meeting using work rooms where you can say, oh, that was better than a Zoom meeting."}, {"time": 12520, "text": "But of course it's more of a hassle to get into it."}, {"time": 12522, "text": "Not everyone has the headset."}, {"time": 12524, "text": "Interoperability is worse."}, {"time": 12526, "text": "You can't have, you cap out at a certain number."}, {"time": 12528, "text": "There's all these things that need to be fixed, but that's one of those things you can look at and say, we know there's value there."}, {"time": 12534, "text": "We just need to really grind hard, file off all the rough edges and make that possible."}, {"time": 12539, "text": "So you do think we have line of sight because there's a reason like, I do this podcast in person, for example."}, {"time": 12549, "text": "So doing it remotely, it's not the same."}, {"time": 12554, "text": "And if somebody were to ask me why it's not the same, I wouldn't be able to write down exactly why."}, {"time": 12560, "text": "But you're saying that it's possible, whatever the magic is for in person interaction, that immersiveness of the experience, we are almost there."}, {"time": 12572, "text": "Yes, so the idea of like, I'm doing a VR interview with someone."}, {"time": 12577, "text": "I'm not saying it's here right now, but you can see glimmers of what it should be."}, {"time": 12582, "text": "And we largely know what would need to be fixed and improved to, like you say, there's a difference between at remote interview doing a podcast over Zoom or something and face to face."}, {"time": 12593, "text": "There's that sense of presence, that immediacy, the super low latency responsiveness, being able to see all the subtle things there, just occupying the same field of view."}, {"time": 12603, "text": "And all of those are things that we absolutely can do in VR."}, {"time": 12607, "text": "And that simple case of a small meeting with a couple of people, that's the much easier case than everybody thinks the Ready Player One multiverse with a thousand people going across a huge bridge to amazing places, that's harder in a lot of other technical ways."}, {"time": 12622, "text": "Not to say we can't also do that, but that's further away and has more challenges."}, {"time": 12626, "text": "But this small thing about being able to have a meeting with one or a few people and have it feel real, feel like you're there, like you have the same interactions and talking with them, you get subtle cues as we start getting eye and face tracking and some of the other things on high end headsets."}, {"time": 12643, "text": "A lot of that is going to come over and it doesn't have to be as good."}, {"time": 12649, "text": "This is an important thing that people miss where there was a lot of people that, especially rich people that would look at VR and say, it's like, oh, this just isn't that good."}, {"time": 12659, "text": "And I'd say, it's like, well, you've already been courtside backstage and on pit row and you've done all of these experiences because you get to do them in real life."}, {"time": 12668, "text": "But most people don't get to."}, {"time": 12670, "text": "And even if the experience is only half as good, if it's something that they never would have gotten to do before, it's still a very good thing."}, {"time": 12677, "text": "And as we can just, we can push that number up over time."}, {"time": 12680, "text": "It has a minimum viable value level when it does something that is valuable enough to people, as long as it's better inside the headset on any metric than it is outside and people choose to go there, we're on the right path."}, {"time": 12693, "text": "And we have a value gradient that I'm just always hammering on."}, {"time": 12697, "text": "We can just follow this value gradient, just keep making things better rather than going for that one, close your eyes, swing for the fences, kind of silver bullet approach."}, {"time": 12708, "text": "Well, I wonder if there's a value gradient for in person meetings, because if you get that right, I mean, that would change the world."}, {"time": 12714, "text": "That it doesn't need to, I mean, you don't need a ready player one."}, {"time": 12719, "text": "But I wonder if there's that value gradient you can follow along, because if there is and you follow it, then there'll be a certain like phase shift at a certain point where people will shift from Zoom to this."}, {"time": 12738, "text": "I wonder, what are the bottlenecks?"}, {"time": 12743, "text": "Is it software, is it hardware?"}, {"time": 12745, "text": "Is it like, is it all about latency?"}, {"time": 12747, "text": "So I have big arguments internally about strategic things like that, where like the next headset that's coming out that we've made various announcements about is gonna be a higher end headset, more expensive, more features."}, {"time": 12761, "text": "Lots of people wanna make those trade offs."}, {"time": 12765, "text": "We'll see what the market has to say about the exact trade offs we've made here."}, {"time": 12769, "text": "But if you wanna replace Zoom, you need to have something that everybody has."}, {"time": 12775, "text": "So you like cheaper."}, {"time": 12776, "text": "I like cheaper because also lighter and cheaper wind up being a virtuous cycle there where expensive and more features tends to also lead towards heavier."}, {"time": 12787, "text": "And it just kind of goes, it's like, let's add more features."}, {"time": 12789, "text": "The features are not, they have physical presence and weight and draw from batteries and all of those things."}, {"time": 12796, "text": "So I've always favored a lower end, cheaper, faster approach."}, {"time": 12801, "text": "That's why I was always behind the mobile side of VR rather than the higher end PC headsets."}, {"time": 12806, "text": "And I think that's proven out well."}, {"time": 12809, "text": "But there's, ideally we have a whole range of things, but if you've only got one or two things, it's important that those two things cover the scope that you think is most important."}, {"time": 12820, "text": "When we're in a world when it's like cell phones and there's 50 of them on the market covering every conceivable ecological niche you want, that's gonna be great, but we're not gonna be there for a while."}, {"time": 12829, "text": "Where are the bottlenecks?"}, {"time": 12831, "text": "Is it the hardware or the software?"}, {"time": 12833, "text": "Yeah, so right now you can play, you can get work rooms on Quest and you can set up these things and it's a pretty good experience."}, {"time": 12841, "text": "It's surprisingly good."}, {"time": 12842, "text": "I haven't tried it."}, {"time": 12845, "text": "Yeah, the voice latency is better on that than a lot better than a Zoom meeting."}, {"time": 12850, "text": "So you've got a more, a better sense of immediacy there."}, {"time": 12853, "text": "The expressions that you get from the current hardware with just kind of your controllers and your head is pretty realistic feeling."}, {"time": 12861, "text": "You've got a pretty good sense of being there with someone with it."}, {"time": 12864, "text": "Are these like avatars of people?"}, {"time": 12868, "text": "Do you get to see their body?"}, {"time": 12870, "text": "And they're sitting around a table?"}, {"time": 12873, "text": "And it feels better than Zoom?"}, {"time": 12875, "text": "It feels better than you, yeah, better than you'd expect for that."}, {"time": 12877, "text": "It is definitely, yeah, I'd say it's quite a bit better than Zoom when everything's working right, but there's still all the rough edges of, the reason Zoom became so successful is because they just nailed the usability of everything."}, {"time": 12891, "text": "It's high quality with a absolutely first rate experience."}, {"time": 12894, "text": "And we are not there yet with any of the VR stuff."}, {"time": 12898, "text": "I'm trying to push hard to get, I keep talking about it's like, it needs to just be one click to make everything happen."}, {"time": 12925, "text": "User interface needs to get a lot better."}, {"time": 12928, "text": "Ubiquity of the headsets needs to get better."}, {"time": 12930, "text": "We need to have a hundred million of them out there just so that everybody knows somebody that uses this all the time."}, {"time": 12937, "text": "Well, I think it's a virtuous cycle because I do think the interface is the thing that makes or breaks this kind of revolution."}, {"time": 12948, "text": "It's so interesting how like you said one click, but it's also like how you achieve that one click."}, {"time": 12954, "text": "What is, can I ask a dark question?"}, {"time": 12958, "text": "Maybe let's keep it outside of meta, but this is about meta, but also Google and big company."}, {"time": 12965, "text": "Are they able to do this kind of thing?"}, {"time": 12967, "text": "It seems like, let me put on my cranky old man hat, is they seem to not do a good job of creating these user friendly interfaces as they get bigger and bigger as a company."}, {"time": 12982, "text": "Like Google has created some of the greatest interfaces ever early on in its, I mean, creating Gmail, just so many brilliant interfaces and it just seems to be getting crappier and crappier at that."}, {"time": 12997, "text": "Same with meta, same with Microsoft."}, {"time": 13002, "text": "It's just, it seems to get worse and worse at that."}, {"time": 13005, "text": "I don't know what it is, because you've become more conservative, careful, risk averse."}, {"time": 13009, "text": "Is that why?"}, {"time": 13011, "text": "It's been really eye opening to me working inside a tech titan, where I had my small companies and then we're acquired by a midsize game publisher and then Oculus getting acquired by meta and meta has grown by a factor of many just in the eight years since the acquisition."}, {"time": 13032, "text": "So I did not have experience with this and it was interesting because I remember like previously my benchmark for kind of use of resources was some of the government programs I interacted with on the aerospace side."}, {"time": 13046, "text": "And I remember thinking there was, okay, there's an air force program and they spent $50 million and they didn't launch anything."}, {"time": 13054, "text": "They didn't even build anything."}, {"time": 13055, "text": "It was just kind of like they made a bunch of papers and had some parts in a warehouse and nothing came of it."}, {"time": 13062, "text": "It's like $50 million and I've had to radically recalibrate my sense of like how much money can be spent with mediocre resources."}, {"time": 13074, "text": "Where on the plus side, VR has turned out, we've built pretty much exactly what, we just passed the 10 year mark then from like my first demo of the Rift."}, {"time": 13086, "text": "And if I could have said what I wanted to have, it would have been a standalone inside out tracked 4K resolution headset that I, that could still plug into a PC for high end rendering."}, {"time": 13098, "text": "And that's exactly what we've got on Quest 2 right now."}, {"time": 13100, "text": "Yes, first of all, let's pause on that with me being cranky and everything."}, {"time": 13104, "text": "It's what Meta achieved with Oculus and so on is incredible."}, {"time": 13110, "text": "I mean, this is, when I thought about the future of VR, this is what I imagined in terms of hardware, I would say."}, {"time": 13116, "text": "And maybe in terms of the experience as well, but it's still not there somehow."}, {"time": 13122, "text": "On the one hand, we did kind of achieve it and win."}, {"time": 13124, "text": "And we've got, we've sold, we're a success right now, but the amount of resources that have gone into it, it winds up getting cluttered up in accounting where Mark did announce that they spent $10 billion a year, like on Reality Labs."}, {"time": 13139, "text": "Now Reality Labs covers a lot."}, {"time": 13141, "text": "It was, VR was not the large part of it."}, {"time": 13144, "text": "It also had Portal and Spark and the big AR research efforts."}, {"time": 13148, "text": "And it's been expanding out to include AI and other things there where there's a lot going on there."}, {"time": 13155, "text": "But $10 billion was just a number that I had trouble processing."}, {"time": 13160, "text": "It's just, I feel sick to my stomach thinking about that much money being spent."}, {"time": 13164, "text": "But that's how they demonstrate commitment to this, where it's not more so than like, yeah, Google goes and cancels all of these projects, different things like that, while Meta is really sticking with the funding of VR and AR is still further out with it."}, {"time": 13184, "text": "It's not just gonna vanish, the work's going in."}, {"time": 13186, "text": "I just wish it could be, all those resources could be applied more effectively because I see all these cases."}, {"time": 13193, "text": "I point out these examples of how a third party that we're kind of competing with in various ways."}, {"time": 13198, "text": "There's a number of these examples and they do work with a 10th of the people that we do internally and a lot of it comes from, yes, the small company can just go do it while in a big company, you do have to worry about, is there some SDK internally that you should be using because another team's making it, you have to have your cross functional group meetups for different things."}, {"time": 13222, "text": "You do have more concerns about privacy or diversity and equity and safety of different things, parental issues and things that a small startup company can just kind of cowboy off and do something interesting."}, {"time": 13236, "text": "And there's a lot more that is a problem that you have to pay attention to in the big companies, but I'm not willing to believe that we are within even a factor of two or four of what the efficiency could be."}, {"time": 13248, "text": "I am constantly kind of crying out for it's like, we can do better than this."}, {"time": 13253, "text": "And you wonder what the mechanisms to unlock that efficiency are."}, {"time": 13257, "text": "I don't, there is some sense in a large company that like an individual engineer might not believe that they can change the world."}, {"time": 13267, "text": "Maybe you delegate a little bit of the responsibility to be the one who changes the world in a big company, I think, but the reality is like the world will get changed by a single engineer anyway."}, {"time": 13281, "text": "So if whether inside Google or inside a startup, it doesn't matter, it's just like Google and Meta needs to help those engineers believe they're the ones that are gonna decrease that latency."}, {"time": 13292, "text": "It'll take one John Carmack, the 20 year old Carmack that's inside Meta right now to change everything."}, {"time": 13300, "text": "And I try to point that out and push people."}, {"time": 13303, "text": "It's like, try to go ahead."}, {"time": 13305, "text": "And when you see some, because there is, you get the silo mentality where you're like, okay, I know something's not right over there, but I'm staying in my lane here."}, {"time": 13313, "text": "And there's a couple of people that I can think about that are willing to just like hop all over the place and man, I treasure them."}, {"time": 13321, "text": "The people that are just willing to, they're fearless."}, {"time": 13323, "text": "They will go over and they will go rebuild the kernel and change this distribution and go in and hack a firmware over here to get something done right."}, {"time": 13331, "text": "And that is relatively rare."}, {"time": 13334, "text": "There's thousands of developers and you've got a small handful that are willing to operate at that level."}, {"time": 13339, "text": "And it's potentially risky for them."}, {"time": 13342,

for it's like you said something insensitive in that post and you should probably not say that."}, {"time": 13358, "text": "But for the most part, yes, I get away with, every week I'm posting something pretty loud and opinionated internally."}, {"time": 13367, "text": "And I think that's useful for the company, but yeah, it's rare to have a position like that."}, {"time": 13374, "text": "And I can't necessarily offer advice for how someone can do that."}, {"time": 13379, "text": "Well, you could offer advice to a company in general to give a little bit of freedom for the young wild, like the wildest ideas come from the young minds."}, {"time": 13390, "text": "And so you need to give the young minds freedom to think big and wild and crazy."}, {"time": 13396, "text": "And for that, they have to be opinionated."}, {"time": 13398, "text": "They have to think crazy ideas and thoughts and pursue them with a full passion without being slowed down by bureaucracy or managers and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 13411, "text": "Obviously startups really empower that, but big companies could too."}, {"time": 13414, "text": "And that's a design challenge for big companies to see how can you enable that?"}, {"time": 13420, "text": "How can you empower that?"}, {"time": 13421, "text": "Yeah, because the big company, there are so many resources there."}, {"time": 13423, "text": "And they do, amazing things do get accomplished, but there's so much more that could come out of that."}, {"time": 13429, "text": "And I'm always hopeful."}, {"time": 13431, "text": "I'm an optimist in almost everything."}, {"time": 13433, "text": "I think things can get better."}, {"time": 13434, "text": "I think that they can improve things that you go through a path and you're learning kind of what does and doesn't work."}, {"time": 13441, "text": "And I'm not ready to be fatalistic about the kind of the outcome of any of that."}, {"time": 13446, "text": "Me neither, I know too many good people inside of those large companies that are incredible."}, {"time": 13452, "text": "You have a friendship with Elon Musk."}, {"time": 13456, "text": "Often when I talk to him, he'll bring up how incredible of an engineer and just a big picture thinker you are."}, {"time": 13462, "text": "His huge amount of respect for you."}, {"time": 13466, "text": "I just, I've never been a fly in the wall between a discussion between the two of you."}, {"time": 13470, "text": "I just wonder, is there something you guys debate, argue about, discuss?"}, {"time": 13476, "text": "Is there some interesting problems that the two of you think about?"}, {"time": 13481, "text": "You come from different worlds."}, {"time": 13482, "text": "Maybe there's some intersection in aerospace."}, {"time": 13485, "text": "Maybe there's some intersection in your new efforts in artificial intelligence in terms of thinking."}, {"time": 13493, "text": "Is there something interesting you could say about sort of the debates the two of you have?"}, {"time": 13497, "text": "So I think in some ways, we do have a kind of similar background where we're almost exactly the same age."}, {"time": 13503, "text": "And we had kind of similar programming backgrounds on the personal computers and even some of the books that we would read and things that would kind of turn us into the people that we are today."}, {"time": 13514, "text": "And I think there is a degree of sensibility similarities where we kind of call bullshit on the same things and kind of see the same opportunities in different technology."}, {"time": 13527, "text": "And there's that sense of, I always talk about the speed of light solutions for things."}, {"time": 13531, "text": "And he's thinking about kind of minimum manufacturing and engineering and operational standpoints for things."}, {"time": 13539, "text": "And so, I mean, I first met Elon right at the start of the aerospace era where I wasn't familiar with, I was still in my game dev bubble."}, {"time": 13547, "text": "I really wasn't familiar with all the startups that were going and being successful and what went on with PayPal and all of his different companies."},

funding in the larger scheme of things compared to like a NASA or something like that was really tiny."}, {"time": 13598, "text": "It was a lot more than I had at the time."}, {"time": 13600, "text": "But it was interesting."}, {"time": 13602, "text": "I had a point years later when I realized, okay, my financial resources at this point are basically what Elon's was when he went all in on SpaceX and Tesla."}, {"time": 13614, "text": "And there's, I think in many corners, he does not get the respect that he should about being a wealthy person that could just retire."}, {"time": 13624, "text":

money in the world and blew it."}, {"time": 13638, "text": "And he could have been the business case example of that."}, {"time": 13642, "text": "But the things that he was doing, space exploration, electrification of transportation, solar city type things, these are big world level things."}, {"time": 13654, "text": "And I have a great deal of admiration that he was willing to throw himself so completely into that because in contrast with myself, I was doing armadillo aerospace with this tightly bounded, it was John's crazy money at the time that had a finite limit on it."}, {"time": 13671, "text": "It was never going to impact me or my family if it completely failed."}, {"time": 13676, "text": "And I was still hedging my bets, working at id Software at the time when he had been really all in there."}, {"time": 13684, "text": "And I have a huge amount of respect for that."}, {"time": 13688, "text": "And people do not, the other thing I get irritated with is people that say, it's like, oh, Elon's just a business guy."}, {"time": 13693, "text": "He just got like, he was gifted the money and he's just kind of investing in all of this when he was really deeply involved in a lot of the decisions."}, {"time": 13704, "text": "Not all of them were perfect, but he cared very much about engine material selection, propellant selection."}, {"time": 13711, "text": "And for years he'd be kind of telling me, it's like, get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff."}, {"time": 13717, "text": "It's like, liquid oxygen is the only proper oxidizer for this."}, {"time": 13721, "text": "And the times that I've gone through the factories with him, we're talking very detailed things about like how this weld is made, how this sub assembly goes together, what are like startup shut down behaviors of the different things."}, {"time": 13738, "text": "So he is really in there at a very detailed level."}, {"time": 13743, "text": "And I think that he is the best modern example now of someone that tries to, that can effectively micromanage some decisions on things on both Tesla and SpaceX to some degree where he cares enough about it."}, {"time": 13756, "text": "I worry a lot that he stretched too thin that you get Boring Company and Neuralink and Twitter and all the other possible things there where I know I've got limits on how much I can pay attention to that I have to kind of box off different amounts of time."}, {"time": 13774, "text": "And I look back at like at my aerospace side of things, it's like, I did not go all in on that."}, {"time": 13778, "text": "I did not commit myself at a level that it would have taken to be successful there."}, {"time": 13783, "text": "And I, yeah, and it's kind of a weird thing just like having a discussion with him."}, {"time": 13789,
