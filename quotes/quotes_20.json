philosophical gap at all."}, {"time": 307, "text": "To me, there is a big technical gap."}, {"time": 312, "text": "There's a huge technical gap, but I don't see any reason why it's more than a technical gap."}, {"time": 319, "text": "So, when you mentioned AI, you mentioned SRI, and maybe can you describe to me when you first fell in love with robotics, with robots or inspired, so you mentioned Flaky or Shaky Flaky, and what was the robot that first captured your imagination, what's possible?"}, {"time": 342, "text": "Well, so the first robot I worked with was Flaky."}, {"time": 342, "text": "Shaky was a robot that the SRI people had built, but by the time, I think when I arrived, it was sitting in a corner of somebody's office dripping hydraulic fluid into a pan, but it's iconic and really everybody should read the Shaky Tech Report because it has so many good ideas in it."}, {"time": 360, "text": "I mean, they invented ASTAR search and symbolic planning and learning macro operators."}, {"time": 366, "text": "They had low level kind of configuration space planning for their robot."}, {"time": 374, "text": "They had vision."}, {"time": 374, "text": "That's the basic ideas of a ton of things."}, {"time": 379, "text": "Can you take a step back?"}, {"time": 379, "text": "Shaky have arms."}, {"time": 379, "text": "What was the job?"}, {"time": 379, "text": "Shaky was a mobile robot, but it could push objects, and so it would move things around."}, {"time": 386, "text": "With which actuator?"}, {"time": 386, "text": "With itself, with its base."}, {"time": 392, "text": "And they had painted the baseboards black, so it used vision to localize itself in a map."}, {"time": 403, "text": "It detected objects."}, {"time": 403, "text": "It could detect objects that were surprising to it."}, {"time": 409, "text": "It would plan and replan based on what it saw."}, {"time": 409, "text": "It reasoned about whether to look and take pictures."}, {"time": 415, "text": "I mean, it really had the basics of so many of the things that we think about now."}, {"time": 423, "text": "How did it represent the space around it?"}, {"time": 423, "text": "So it had representations at a bunch of different levels of abstraction."}, {"time": 428, "text": "So it had, I think, a kind of an occupancy grid of some sort at the lowest level."}, {"time": 434, "text": "At the high level, it was abstract symbolic kind of rooms and connectivity."}, {"time": 434, "text": "So where does flaky come in?"}, {"time": 441, "text": "So I showed up at SRI and we were building a brand new robot."}, {"time": 441, "text": "As I said, none of the people from the previous project were kind of there or involved anymore."}, {"time": 448, "text": "So we were kind of starting from scratch and my advisor was Stan Rosenstein."}, {"time": 453, "text": "He ended up being my thesis advisor and he was motivated by this idea of situated computation or situated automata."}, {"time": 460, "text": "And the idea was that the tools of logical reasoning were important, but possibly only for the engineers or designers to use in the analysis of a system, but not necessarily to be manipulated in the head of the system itself."}, {"time": 484, "text": "So I might use logic to prove a theorem about the behavior of my robot, even if the robot's not using logic in its head to prove theorems."}, {"time": 490, "text": "So that was kind of the distinction."}, {"time": 494, "text": "And so the idea was to kind of use those principles to make a robot do stuff."}, {"time": 494, "text": "But a lot of the basic things we had to kind of learn for ourselves because I had zero background in robotics."}, {"time": 509, "text": "I didn't know anything about control."}, {"time": 509, "text": "I didn't know anything about sensors."}, {"time": 509, "text": "So we reinvented a lot of wheels on the way to getting that robot to do stuff."}, {"time": 513, "text": "Do you think that was an advantage or a hindrance?"}, {"time": 517, "text": "Oh no, I mean, I'm big in favor of wheel reinvention actually."}, {"time": 517, "text": "I mean, I think you learn a lot by doing it."}, {"time": 524, "text": "It's important though to eventually have the pointers to, so that you can see what's really going on."}, {"time": 529, "text": "But I think you can appreciate much better the good solutions once you've messed around a little bit on your own and found a bad one."}, {"time": 540, "text": "I think you mentioned reinventing reinforcement learning and referring to rewards as pleasures, pleasure."}, {"time": 544, "text": "Or I think, which I think is a nice name for it."}, {"time": 551, "text": "It's more fun almost."}, {"time": 551, "text": "Do you think you could tell the history of AI machine learning reinforcement learning and how you think about it from the fifties to now?"}, {"time": 563, "text": "One thing is that it's oscillates, right?"}, {"time": 563, "text": "So things become fashionable and then they go out and then something else becomes cool and that goes out and so on."}, {"time": 569, "text": "And I think there's, so there's some interesting sociological process that actually drives a lot of what's going on."}, {"time": 578, "text": "Early days was kind of cybernetics and control, right?"}, {"time": 578, "text": "And the idea that of homeostasis, right?"}, {"time": 586, "text": "People have made these robots that could, I don't know, try to plug into the wall when they needed power and then come loose and roll around and do stuff."}, {"time": 591, "text": "And then I think over time, the thought, well, that was inspiring, but people said, no, no, no, we want to get maybe closer to what feels like real intelligence or human intelligence."}, {"time": 603, "text": "And then maybe the expert systems people tried to do that, but maybe a little too superficially, right?"}, {"time": 610, "text": "So, oh, we get the surface understanding of what intelligence is like, because I understand how a steel mill works and I can try to explain it to you and you can write it down in logic and then we can make a computer and for that."}, {"time": 629, "text": "And then that didn't work out."}, {"time": 629, "text": "But what's interesting, I think, is when a thing starts to not be working very well, it's not only do we change methods, we change problems, right?"}, {"time": 636, "text": "So it's not like we have better ways of doing the problem of the expert systems people were trying to do."}, {"time": 643, "text": "We have no ways of trying to do that problem."}, {"time": 647, "text": "Oh, yeah, no, I think maybe a few, but we kind of give up on that problem and we switched to a different problem and we worked that for a while and we make progress."}, {"time": 660, "text": "As a broad community."}, {"time": 660, "text": "As a community, yeah."}, {"time": 660, "text": "And there's a lot of people who would argue, you don't give up on the problem, it's just you decrease the number of people working on it."}, {"time": 669, "text": "You almost kind of like put it on the shelf, say, we'll come back to this 20 years later."}, {"time": 673, "text": "Or you might decide that it's malformed."}, {"time": 673, "text": "Like you might say, it's wrong to just try to make something that does superficial symbolic reasoning behave like a doctor."}, {"time": 686, "text": "You can't do that until you've had the sensory motor experience of being a doctor or something."}, {"time": 693, "text": "So there's arguments that say that that problem was not well formed."}, {"time": 693, "text": "Or it could be that it is well formed, but we just weren't approaching it well."}, {"time": 698, "text": "So you mentioned that your favorite part of logic and symbolic systems is that they give short names for large sets."}, {"time": 708, "text": "So there is some use to this."}, {"time": 708, "text": "They use symbolic reasoning."}, {"time": 708, "text": "So looking at expert systems and symbolic computing, what do you think are the roadblocks that were hit in the 80s and 90s?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "So the fact that I'm not a fan of expert systems doesn't mean that I'm not a fan of some kinds of symbolic reasoning, right?"}, {"time": 727, "text": "So let's see, roadblocks."}, {"time": 727, "text": "Well, the main road block, I think, was that the idea that humans could articulate their knowledge effectively into some kind of logical statements."}, {"time": 746, "text": "So it's not just the cost, the effort, but really just the capability of doing it."}, {"time": 751, "text": "Because we're all experts in vision, right?"}, {"time": 751, "text": "But totally don't have introspective access into how we do that."}, {"time": 756, "text": "And it's true that, I mean, I think the idea was, well, of course, even people then would know, of course, I wouldn't ask you to please write down the rules that you use for recognizing a water bottle."}, {"time": 768, "text": "And everyone understood that."}, {"time": 772, "text": "But we might ask you to please write down the rules you use for deciding, I don't know, what tie to put on or how to set up a microphone or something like that."}, {"time": 784, "text": "But even those things, I think people maybe, I think what they found, I'm not sure about this, but I think what they found was that the so called experts could give explanations that sort of post hoc explanations for how and why they did things, but they weren't necessarily very good."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And then they depended on maybe some kinds of perceptual things, which again, they couldn't really define very well."}, {"time": 808, "text": "So I think fundamentally, I think the underlying problem with that was the assumption that people could articulate how and why they make their decisions."}, {"time": 820, "text": "So it's almost encoding the knowledge from converting from expert to something that a machine could understand and reason with."}, {"time": 831, "text": "No, no, no, no, not even just encoding, but getting it out of you."}, {"time": 836, "text": "Not, not, not writing it."}, {"time": 836, "text": "I mean, yes, hard also to write it down for the computer, but I don't think that people can produce it."}, {"time": 842, "text": "You can tell me a story about why you do stuff, but I'm not so sure that's the why."}, {"time": 848, "text": "So there are still on the hierarchical planning side, places where symbolic reasoning is very useful."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So as you've talked about, so where's the gap?"}, {"time": 864, "text": "So saying that humans can't provide a description of their reasoning processes."}, {"time": 874, "text": "But that doesn't mean that it's not good to do reasoning of various styles inside a computer."}, {"time": 881, "text": "Those are just two orthogonal points."}, {"time": 881, "text": "So then the question is what kind of reasoning should you do inside a computer?"}, {"time": 892, "text": "And the answer is, I think you need to do all different kinds of reasoning inside a computer, depending on what kinds of problems you face."}, {"time": 896, "text": "I guess the question is what kind of things can you encode symbolically so you can reason about?"}, {"time": 902, "text": "I think the idea about, and even symbolic, I don't even like that terminology because I don't know what it means technically and formally."}, {"time": 917, "text": "I do believe in abstractions."}, {"time": 917, "text": "So abstractions are critical, right?"}, {"time": 917, "text": "You cannot reason at completely fine grain about everything in your life, right?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "You can't make a plan at the level of images and torques for getting a PhD."}, {"time": 929, "text": "So you have to reduce the size of the state space and you have to reduce the horizon if you're going to reason about getting a PhD or even buying the ingredients to make dinner."}, {"time": 942, "text": "And so how can you reduce the spaces and the horizon of the reasoning you have to do?"}, {"time": 949, "text": "And the answer is abstraction, spatial abstraction, temporal abstraction."}, {"time": 949, "text": "I think abstraction along the lines of goals is also interesting, like you might, well, abstraction and decomposition."}, {"time": 953, "text": "Goals is maybe more of a decomposition thing."}, {"time": 960, "text": "So I think that's where these kinds of, if you want to call it symbolic or discrete models come in."}, {"time": 965, "text": "You talk about a room of your house instead of your pose."}, {"time": 972, "text": "You talk about doing something during the afternoon instead of at 2.54."}, {"time": 972, "text": "And you do that because it and you do that because it makes your reasoning problem easier."}, {"time": 980, "text": "And also because you have, you don't have enough information to reason in high fidelity about your pose of your elbow at 2.35 this afternoon anyway."}, {"time": 994, "text": "When you're trying to get a PhD."}, {"time": 999, "text": "Or when you're doing anything really."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "Except for at that moment, at that moment, you do have to reason about the pose of your elbow, maybe, but then you, maybe you do that in some continuous joint space kind of model."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And so again, I, my biggest point about all of this is that there should be the dogma is not the thing, right?"}, {"time": 1018, "text": "We shouldn't, it shouldn't be that I'm in favor against symbolic reasoning and you're in favor against neural networks."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "It should be that just, just computer science tells us what the right answer to all these questions is."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "If we were smart enough to figure it out."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "When you try to actually solve the problem with computers, the right answer comes out."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "But you mentioned abstractions."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "I mean, neural networks form abstractions or rather there's, there's automated ways to form abstractions and there's expert driven ways to form abstractions and expert human driven ways."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "And humans just seem to be way better at forming abstractions currently and certain problems."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "So when you're referring to 2.45 PM versus afternoon, how do we construct that taxonomy?"}, {"time": 1064, "text": "Is there any room for automated construction of such abstractions?"}, {"time": 1070, "text": "Oh, I think eventually, yeah."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "I mean, I think when we get to be better and machine learning engineers, we'll build algorithms that build awesome abstractions."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "That are useful in this kind of way that you're describing."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "So let's then step from the, the abstraction discussion and let's talk about POMM MDPs."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Partially observable Markov decision processes."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "So uncertainty."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "So first, what are Markov decision processes?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "What are Markov decision processes?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And maybe how much of our world can be models and MDPs?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "How much, when you wake up in the morning and you're making breakfast, how do you, do you think of yourself as an MDP?"}, {"time": 1110, "text": "So how do you think about MDPs and how they relate to our world?"}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Well, so there's a stance question, right?"}, {"time": 1116, "text": "So a stance is a position that I take with respect to a problem."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "So I, as a researcher or a person who designs systems, can decide to make a model of the world around me in some terms."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "So I take this messy world and I say, I'm going to treat it as if it were a problem of this formal kind, and then I can apply solution concepts or algorithms or whatever to solve that formal thing, right?"}, {"time": 1142, "text": "So of course the world is not anything."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "It's not an MDP or a POMM DP."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "I don't know what it is, but I can model aspects of it in some way or some other way."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "And when I model some aspect of it in a certain way, that gives me some set of algorithms I can use."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "You can model the world in all kinds of ways."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "Some have, some are, some are, some are more accepting of uncertainty, more easily modeling uncertainty of the world."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "Some really force the world to be deterministic."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "And so certainly MDPs model the uncertainty of the world."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Model some uncertainty."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "They model not present state uncertainty, but they model uncertainty in the way the future will unfold."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "So what are Markov decision processes?"}, {"time": 1187, "text": "So Markov decision process is a model."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "It's a kind of a model that you could make that says, I know completely the current state of my system."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And what it means to be a state is that I, that all the, I have all the information right now that will let me make predictions about the future as well as I can."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "So that remembering anything about my history wouldn't make my predictions any better."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "And, but then it also says that then I can take some actions that might change the state of the world."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "And that I don't have a deterministic model of those changes."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "I have a probabilistic model of how the world might change."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "It's a, it's a useful model for some kinds of systems."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "I think it's a, I mean, it's certainly not a good model for most problems, I think, because for most problems you don't actually know the state."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "For most problems you, it's partially observed."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "So that's now a different problem class."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "That's where the POMDPs, the part that we observe with the Markov decision processes step in."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "So how do they address the fact that you can't observe most incomplete information about most of the world around you?"}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So now the idea is we still kind of postulate that there exists a state."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "We think that there is some information about the world out there such that if we knew that we could make good predictions, but we don't know the state."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "And so then we have to think about how, but we do get observations."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Maybe I get images or I hear things or I feel things, and those might be local or noisy."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "And so therefore they don't tell me everything about what's going on."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "And then I have to reason about given the history of actions I've taken and observations I've gotten, what do I think is going on in the world?"}, {"time": 1299, "text": "And then given my own kind of uncertainty about what's going on in the world, I can decide what actions to take."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "And so how difficult is this problem of planning under uncertainty in your view and your long experience of modeling the world, trying to deal with this uncertainty in especially in real world systems?"}, {"time": 1317, "text": "Optimal planning for even discrete POMDPs can be undecidable depending on how you set it up."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "And so lots of people say, I don't use POMDPs because they are intractable."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "And I think that that's kind of a very funny thing to say because the problem you have to solve is the problem you have to solve."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "So if the problem you have to solve is intractable, that's what makes us AI people, right?"}, {"time": 1344, "text": "So we solve, we understand that the problem we're solving is wildly intractable that we can't, we will never be able to solve it optimally, at least I don't."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "So later we can come back to an idea about bounded optimality and something."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "But anyway, we can't come up with optimal solutions to these problems."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "So we have to make approximations, approximations in modeling, approximations in the solution algorithms and so on."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And so I don't have a problem with saying, yeah, my problem actually, it is POMDP in continuous space with continuous observations."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "And it's so computationally complex, I can't even think about it's, you know, big O whatever."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "But that doesn't prevent me from, it helps me, gives me some clarity to think about it that way and to then take steps to make approximation after approximation to get down to something that's like computable in some reasonable time."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "When you think about optimality, the community broadly has shifted on that, I think a little bit in how much they value the idea of optimality, of chasing an optimal solution."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "How has your views of chasing an optimal solution changed over the years when you work with robots?"}, {"time": 1420, "text": "I think we have a little bit of a methodological crisis actually from the theoretical side."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "I mean, I do think that theory is important and that right now we're not doing much of it."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "So there's lots of empirical hacking around and training this and doing that and reporting numbers, but is it good?"}, {"time": 1440, "text": "Is it bad?"}, {"time": 1440, "text": "We don't know."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "It's very hard to say things."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "And if you look at like computer science theory, so people talked for a while, everyone was about solving problems optimally or completely."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And then there were interesting relaxations."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "So people look at, oh, are there regret bounds or can I do some kind of approximation?"}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Can I prove something that I can approximately solve this problem or that I get closer to the solution as I spend more time and so on?"}, {"time": 1474, "text": "What's interesting I think is that we don't have good approximate solution concepts for very difficult problems."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "I like to say that I'm interested in doing a very bad job of very big problems."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "So very bad job, very big problems."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "I like to do that, but I wish I could say something."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "I wish I had a, I don't know, some kind of a formal solution concept that I could use to say, oh, this algorithm actually, it gives me something."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "Like I know what I'm going to get."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "I can do something other than just run it and get out."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So that, that notion is still somewhere deeply compelling to you."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "The notion that you can say, you can drop thing on the table says this, you can expect this, this algorithm will give me some good results."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "I hope there's, I hope science will, I mean, there's engineering and there's science."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "I think that they're not exactly the same."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "And I think right now we're making huge engineering, like leaps and bounds."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "So the engineering is running away ahead of the science, which is cool."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And often how it goes, right?"}, {"time": 1547, "text": "So we're making things and nobody knows how and why they work roughly, but we need to turn that into science."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "There's some form."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "It's a, yeah, there's some room for formalizing."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "We need to know what the principles are."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Why does this work?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Why does that not work?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "I mean, for a while, people built bridges by trying, but now we can often predict whether it's going to work or not without building it."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Can we do that for learning systems or for robots?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "So your hope is from a materialistic perspective that intelligence, artificial intelligence systems, robots are just fancier bridges."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Belief space."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "What's the difference between belief space and state space?"}, {"time": 1587, "text": "So you mentioned MDPs, FOMDPs, reasoning about, you sense the world, there's a state."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "Uh, what, what's this belief space idea?"}, {"time": 1599, "text": "That sounds so good."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "It sounds good."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "So belief space, that is instead of thinking about what's the state of the world and trying to control that as a robot, I think about what is the space of beliefs that I could have about the world."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "What's, if I think of a belief as a probability distribution of our ways the world could be, a belief state is a distribution."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "And then my control problem, if I'm reasoning about how to move through a world I'm uncertain about, my control problem is actually the problem of controlling my beliefs."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So I think about taking actions, not just what effect they'll have on the world outside, but what effect they'll have on my own understanding of the world outside."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "And so that might compel me to ask a question or look somewhere to gather information, which may not really change the world state, but it changes my own belief about the world."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "That's a powerful way to, to empower the agent, to reason about the world, to explore the world."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "So what kind of problems does it allow you to solve to, to consider belief space versus just state space?"}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Well, any problem that requires deliberate information gathering, right?"},

breakfast."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "You show this presentation of the WTF, where's the fork of robot looking at a sink."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "And can you describe how we plan in this world of

pretty important."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "And a lot of people won't give you that to start with."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "So almost like a convolution in the, uh, uh, in the object, semantic

representations."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "And so, so I think there are, so you, I've come I've come far field from perception, but I think, um, I think the thing that's going to make perception that kind of the next step is actually understanding better what it should produce."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "So what are we going to do with the output of it?"}, {"time": 2436, "text": "It's fine when

okay."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "So do you think a robot needs to have a self awareness, consciousness, fear of mortality, or is it, is it simpler than that?"}, {"time": 2496, "text": "Or is

of the use of self awareness."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "Well, but I, okay, but then what does self awareness mean?"}, {"time": 2529, "text": "I mean, that you need to have some part of the system that can observe other parts of the system and tell whether they're working well or not."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "That seems critical."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "So does that count as, I mean, does that count as self awareness or not?"}, {"time": 2541, "text": "Well, it depends on whether you think that there's somebody at home who can articulate whether they're self aware."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "But clearly, if I have like, you know, some piece of code that's counting how many times this procedure gets executed, that's a kind of self awareness, right?"}, {"time": 2557, "text": "So

research that's most compelling to you for, you know, trying to achieve human level intelligence in our robots?"}, {"time": 2574, "text": "Well, to me, I guess the thing that seems most compelling to me at the moment is this question of what to build in and what to learn."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "Um, I think we're, we don't, we're missing a bunch of ideas and, and we, you know, people, you know, don't you dare ask me how many years it's going to be until that happens because I won't even participate in the conversation because I think we're missing ideas and I don't know how long it's going to take to find them."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "So I won't ask you how many years, but, uh, maybe I'll ask you what it, when you'll be sufficiently impressed that we've achieved it."}, {"time": 2614,

together and tries to build a better robot cause they want to out compete each other."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "Like the DARPA challenge with the autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "Do you see the value of that or it can get in the way?"}, {"time": 2658, "text": "I think it can get in the way."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "I mean, some people, many people find it motivating."},

cycle where for a contest, a bunch of smart people get super motivated and they hack their brains out and much of what gets done is just hacks, but sometimes really cool ideas emerge."}, {"time":

board of, uh, machine learning resigned and we founded the new journal, but it was sort of, it was more open."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "So it's completely open."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "It's open access."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "Actually, uh, uh, I had a postdoc, George Conidaris who wanted to call these journals free for all, uh, because there were, I mean, it both has no page charges and

just fast forward through the history."}, {"time": 380, "text": "Can you maybe talk through the technical evolution of autonomous vehicle systems from the first two Grand Challenges to the Urban Challenge to today, are there major shifts in your mind or is it the same kind of technology just made more robust?"}, {"time": 397, "text": "I think there's been some big, big steps."}, {"time": 400, "text": "So for the Grand Challenge, the real technology that unlocked that was HD mapping."}, {"time": 411, "text": "Prior to that, a lot of the off road robotics work had been done without any real prior model of what the vehicle was going to encounter."}, {"time": 421, "text": "And so that innovation that the fact that we could get decimeter resolution models was really a big deal."}, {"time": 433, "text": "And that allowed us to kind of bound the complexity of the driving problem the vehicle had and allowed it to operate at speed because we could assume things about the environment that it was going to encounter."}, {"time": 445, "text": "So that was the big step there."}, {"time": 451, "text": "For the Urban Challenge, one of the big technological innovations there was the multi beam LIDAR and being able to generate high resolution, mid to long range 3D models of the world and use that for understanding the world around the vehicle."}, {"time": 473, "text": "And that was really kind of a game changing technology."}, {"time": 478, "text": "In parallel with that, we saw a bunch of other technologies that had been kind of converging half their day in the sun."}, {"time": 488, "text": "So Bayesian estimation had been, SLAM had been a big field in robotics."}, {"time": 497, "text": "You would go to a conference a couple of years before that and every paper would effectively have SLAM somewhere in it."}, {"time": 504, "text": "And so seeing that the Bayesian estimation techniques play out on a very visible stage, I thought that was pretty exciting to see."}, {"time": 518, "text": "And mostly SLAM was done based on LIDAR at that time."}, {"time": 521, "text": "Yeah, and in fact, we weren't really doing SLAM per se in real time because we had a model ahead of time, we had a roadmap, but we were doing localization."}, {"time": 531, "text": "And we were using the LIDAR or the cameras depending on who exactly was doing it to localize to a model of the world."}, {"time": 537, "text": "And I thought that was a big step from kind of naively trusting GPS, INS before that."}, {"time": 546, "text": "And again, lots of work had been going on in this field."},

thought was very cool."}, {"time": 563, "text": "So for the urban challenge, those are already maps constructed offline in general."}, {"time": 568, "text": "And did people do that individually, did individual teams do it individually so they had their own different approaches there or did everybody kind of share that information at least intuitively?"}, {"time": 582, "text": "So DARPA gave all the teams a model of the world, a map."}, {"time": 589, "text": "And then one of the things that we had to figure out back then was, and it's still one of these things that trips people up today is actually the coordinate system."}, {"time": 600, "text": "So you get a latitude longitude and to so many decimal places, you don't really care about kind of the ellipsoid of the earth that's being used."}, {"time": 609, "text": "But when you want to get to 10 centimeter or centimeter resolution, you care whether the coordinate system is NADS 83 or WGS 84 or these are different ways to describe

were multiple hypotheses for that because a vehicle at an intersection might be going right or it might be going straight or it might be making a left turn."}, {"time": 701, "text": "And we had to deal with the challenge of the fact that our behavior was going to impact the behavior of that other operator."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And we did a lot of that in relatively naive ways, but it kind of worked."}, {"time": 714, "text": "Still had to have some kind of solution."}, {"time": 717, "text": "And so where does that, 10 years later, where does that take us today from that artificial city construction to real cities to the urban environment?"}, {"time": 727, "text": "Yeah, I think the biggest thing is that the actors are truly unpredictable."}, {"time": 735, "text": "That most of the time, the drivers on the road, the other road users are out there behaving well, but every once in a while they're not."}, {"time": 747, "text": "The variety of other vehicles is, you have all of them."}, {"time": 752, "text": "In terms of behavior, in terms of perception, or both?"}, {"time": 758, "text": "Back then we didn't have to deal with cyclists, we didn't have to deal with pedestrians, didn't have to deal with traffic lights."}, {"time": 766, "text": "The scale over which that you have to operate is now is much larger than the air base that we were thinking about back then."}, {"time": 772, "text": "So what, easy question, what do you think is the hardest part about driving?"}, {"time": 779, "text": "Easy question."}, {"time": 780, "text": "Yeah, no, I'm joking."}, {"time": 782, "text": "I'm sure nothing really jumps out at you as one thing, but in the jump from the urban challenge to the real world, is there something that's a particular, you foresee as very serious, difficult challenge?"}, {"time": 798, "text": "I think the most fundamental difference is that we're doing it for real."}, {"time": 806, "text": "That in that environment, it was both a limited complexity environment because certain actors weren't there, because the roads were maintained, there were barriers keeping people separate from robots at the time, and it only had to work for 60 miles."}, {"time": 823, "text": "Which, looking at it from 2006, it had to work for 60 miles, right?"}, {"time": 828, "text": "Looking at it from now, we want things that will go and drive for half a million miles, and it's just a different game."}, {"time": 840, "text": "So how important, you said LiDAR came into the game early on, and it's really the primary driver of autonomous vehicles today as a sensor."}, {"time": 850, "text": "So how important is the role of LiDAR in the sensor suite in the near term?"}, {"time": 854, "text": "So I think it's essential."}, {"time": 857, "text": "I believe, but I also believe that cameras are essential, and I believe the radar is essential."}, {"time": 862, "text": "I think that you really need to use the composition of data from these different sensors if you want the thing to really be robust."}, {"time": 872, "text": "The question I wanna ask, let's see if we can untangle it, is what are your thoughts on the Elon Musk provocative statement that LiDAR is a crutch, that it's a kind of, I guess, growing pains, and that much of the perception task can be done with cameras?"}, {"time": 892, "text": "So I think it is undeniable that people walk around without lasers in their foreheads, and they can get into vehicles and drive them, and so there's an existence proof that you can drive using passive vision."}, {"time": 910, "text": "No doubt, can't argue with that."}, {"time": 912, "text": "In terms of sensors, yeah, so there's proof."}, {"time": 914, "text": "Yeah, in terms of sensors, right?"}, {"time": 916, "text": "So there's an example that we all go do it, many of us every day."}, {"time": 921, "text": "In terms of LiDAR being a crutch, sure."}, {"time": 965, "text": "And so any technology that we can bring to bear that accelerates this self driving technology coming to market and saving lives is technology we should be using."}, {"time": 978, "text": "And it feels just arbitrary to say, well, I'm not okay with using lasers because that's whatever, but I am okay with using an eight megapixel camera or a 16 megapixel camera."}, {"time": 992, "text": "These are just bits of technology, and we should be taking the best technology from the tool bin that allows us to go and solve a problem."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "The question I often talk to, well, obviously you do as well, to sort of automotive companies, and if there's one word that comes up more often than anything, it's cost, and trying to drive costs down."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "So while it's true that it's a tragic number, the 37,000, the question is, and I'm not the one asking this question because I hate this question, but we want to find the cheapest sensor suite that creates a safe vehicle."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "So in that uncomfortable trade off, do you foresee LiDAR coming down in cost in the future, or do you see a day where level four autonomy is possible without LiDAR?"}, {"time": 1049, "text": "I see both of those, but it's really a matter of time."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "And I think really, maybe I would talk to the question you asked about the cheapest sensor."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "I don't think that's actually what you want."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "What you want is a sensor suite that is economically viable."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "And then after that, everything is about margin and driving costs out of the system."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "What you also want is a sensor suite that works."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "And so it's great to tell a story about how it would be better to have a self driving system with a $50 sensor instead of a $500 sensor."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "But if the $500 sensor makes it work and the $50 sensor doesn't work, who cares?"}, {"time": 1095, "text": "So long as you can actually have an economic opportunity, there's an economic opportunity there."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And the economic opportunity is important because that's how you actually have a sustainable business and that's how you can actually see this come to scale and be out in the world."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And so when I look at LiDAR, I see a technology that has no underlying fundamentally expense to it, fundamental expense to it."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "It's going to be more expensive than an imager because CMOS processes or FAP processes are dramatically more scalable than mechanical processes."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "But we still should be able to drive costs down substantially on that side."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "And then I also do think that with the right business model you can absorb more, certainly more cost on the bill of materials."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Yeah, if the sensor suite works, extra value is provided, thereby you don't need to drive costs down to zero."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "It's the basic economics."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "You've talked about your intuition that level two autonomy is problematic because of the human factor of vigilance, decrement, complacency, over trust and so on, just us being human."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "We over trust the system, we start doing even more so partaking in the secondary activities like smartphones and so on."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Have your views evolved on this point in either direction?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Can you speak to it?"}, {"time": 1184, "text": "So, and I want to be really careful because sometimes this gets twisted in a way that I certainly didn't intend."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "So active safety systems are a really important technology that we should be pursuing and integrating into vehicles."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "And there's an opportunity in the near term to reduce accidents, reduce fatalities, and we should be pushing on that."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "Level two systems are systems where the vehicle is controlling two axes."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "So braking and throttle slash steering."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "And I think there are variants of level two systems that are supporting the driver."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "That absolutely we should encourage to be out there."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "Where I think there's a real challenge is in the human factors part around this and the misconception from the public around the capability set that that enables and the trust that they should have in it."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And that is where I kind of, I'm actually incrementally more concerned around level three systems and how exactly a level two system is marketed and delivered and how much effort people have put into those human factors."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So I still believe several things around this."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "One is people will overtrust the technology."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "We've seen over the last few weeks a spate of people sleeping in their Tesla."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "I watched an episode last night of Trevor Noah talking about this and him, this is a smart guy who has a lot of resources at his disposal describing a Tesla as a self driving car and that why shouldn't people be sleeping in their Tesla?"}, {"time": 1293, "text": "And it's like, well, because it's not a self driving car and it is not intended to be and these people will almost certainly die at some point or hurt other people."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "And so we need to really be thoughtful about how that technology is described and brought to market."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "I also think that because of the economic challenges we were just talking about, that these level two driver assistance systems, that technology path will diverge from the technology path that we need to be on to actually deliver truly self driving vehicles, ones where you can get in it and drive it."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Can get in it and sleep and have the equivalent or better safety than a human driver behind the wheel."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "Because again, the economics are very different in those two worlds and so that leads to divergent technology."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "So you just don't see the economics of gradually increasing from level two and doing so quickly enough to where it doesn't cause safety, critical safety concerns."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "You believe that it needs to diverge at this point into basically different routes."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And really that comes back to what are those L2 and L1 systems doing?"}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And they are driver assistance functions where the people that are marketing that responsibly are being very clear and putting human factors in place such that the driver is actually responsible for the vehicle and that the technology is there to support the driver."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And the safety cases that are built around those are dependent on that driver attention and attentiveness."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And at that point, you can kind of give up to some degree for economic reasons, you can give up on say false negatives."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "And the way to think about this is for a four collision mitigation braking system, if it half the times the driver missed a vehicle in front of it, it hit the brakes and brought the vehicle to a stop, that would be an incredible, incredible advance in safety on our roads, right?"}, {"time": 1433, "text": "That would be equivalent to seat belts."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "But it would mean that if that vehicle wasn't being monitored, it would hit one out of two cars."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "And so economically, that's a perfectly good solution for a driver assistance system."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "What you should do at that point, if you can get it to work 50% of the time, is drive the cost out of that so you can get it on as many vehicles as possible."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "But driving the cost out of it doesn't drive up performance on the false negative case."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And so you'll continue to not have a technology that could really be available for a self driven vehicle."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "So clearly the communication, and this probably applies to all four vehicles as well, the marketing and communication of what the technology is actually capable of, how hard it is, how easy it is, all that kind of

beautiful thing."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "That's right, the word deep kind of, yeah, exactly, it implies hierarchy."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "I didn't even think about that."}, {"time": 1271,

you could paint a picture of the kind of methods of neuroimaging, maybe the history which you were a part of, from statistical parametric mapping."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "I mean, just what's out there that's interesting for people maybe outside the field to understand of what are the actual methodologies of looking inside the human brain?"}, {"time": 1305, "text": "Right, well, you can answer that question from two perspectives."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "Basically, it's the modality."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "What kind of signal are you measuring?"}, {"time": 1312, "text": "And they can range from, and let's limit ourselves to sort of imaging based noninvasive techniques."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "So looking at the anatomy noninvasively would be the first sort of neuroimaging that people might want to employ."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "Then you move on to the kinds of measurements that reflect dynamic function, and the most prevalent of those fall into two camps."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "You've got these metabolic, sometimes hemodynamic, blood related signals."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "So these metabolic and or hemodynamic signals are basically proxies for elevated activity and message passing and neuronal dynamics in particular parts of the brain."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "Characteristically though, the time constants of these hemodynamic or metabolic responses to neural activity are much longer than the neural activity itself."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And this is referring, forgive me for the dumb questions, but this would be referring to blood, like the flow of blood."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "So there's a ton of, it seems like there's a ton of blood vessels in the brain."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "So what's the interaction between the flow of blood and the function of the neurons?"}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Is there an interplay there or?"}, {"time": 1417, "text": "Yup, yup, and that interplay accounts for several careers of world renowned scientists, yes, absolutely."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "So this is known as neurovascular coupling, is exactly what you said."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "It's how does the neural activity, the neuronal infrastructure, the actual message passing that we think underlies our capacity to perceive and act, how is that coupled to the vascular responses that supply the energy for that neural processing?"}, {"time": 1449, "text": "So there's a delicate web of large vessels, arteries and veins, that gets progressively finer and finer in detail until it perfuses at a microscopic level, the machinery where little neurons lie."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "So coming back to this sort of onion perspective, we were talking before using the onion as a metaphor for a deep hierarchical structure, but also I think it's just anatomically quite a useful metaphor."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "All the action, all the heavy lifting in terms of neural computation is done on the surface of the brain, and then the interior of the brain is constituted by fatty wires, essentially, axonal processes that are enshrouded by myelin sheaths."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "And these, when you dissect them, they look fatty and white, and so it's called white matter, as opposed to the actual neuro pill, which does the computation constituted largely by neurons, and that's known as gray matter."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "So one peculiar thing about cerebral metabolism, brain metabolism, is it really needs to be driven in the moment, which means you basically have to turn on the taps."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "So if there's lots of neural activity in one part of the brain, a little patch of a few millimeters, even less possibly, you really do have to water that piece of the garden now and quickly,

"Absolutely, but it is slightly compromised in terms of the resolution."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "So the deployment of these little microvessels that water the garden to enable the neural activity to play out, the spatial resolution is in order of a few millimeters, and crucially, the temporal resolution is the order of a few seconds."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "So you can't get right down and dirty into the actual spatial and temporal scale of neural activity in and of itself."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "To do that, you'd have to turn to the other big imaging modality, which is the recording of electromagnetic signals as they're generated in real time."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "So here, the temporal bandwidth, if you like, or the low limit on the temporal resolution is incredibly small, talking about milliseconds."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "And then you can get into the phasic fast responses that is in and of itself the neural activity, and start to see the succession or cascade of hierarchical recurrent message passing evoked by a particular stimulus."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "But the problem is you're looking at electromagnetic signals that have passed through an enormous amount of magic soup or spaghetti of collectivity, and through the scalp and the skull, and it's become spatially very diffuse."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "So it's very difficult to know where you are."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "So you've got this sort of catch 22."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "You can either use an imaging modality that tells you within millimeters which part of the brain is activated, but you don't know when, or you've got these electromagnetic EEG, MEG setups that tell you to within a few milliseconds when something has responded, but you're not aware."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "So you've got these two complementary measures, either indirect via the blood flow, or direct via the electromagnetic signals caused by neural activity."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "These are the two big imaging devices."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "And then the second level of responding to your question, what are the, from the outside, what are the big ways of using this technology?"}, {"time": 1724, "text": "So once you've chosen the kind of neural imaging that you want to use to answer your set questions, and sometimes it would have to be both,

upon the mathematics of blobs."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "So seriously, they're actually called Euler characteristics and they have a lot of fancy names in mathematics."}, {"time": 1827, "text":

the blob."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And that's basically the, if you were a map maker of America and you did not know its structure, the first thing were you doing constituting or creating a map

saying that it might be incredibly challenging, including the low bound of the bandwidth and so on."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "I kind of, so just to full disclosure, I come from the machine learning world."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "So my natural thought is the hardest part is the engineering challenge of controlling the weather, of getting those satellites up and running and so on."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "And once they are, then the rest is fundamentally the same approaches that allow you to win in the game of Go will allow you to potentially play in this soup, in this chaos."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "So I have a hope that sort of machine learning methods will help us play in this soup."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "But perhaps you're right that it is a biology and the brain is just an incredible system that may be almost impossible to get in."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "But for me, what seems impossible is the incredible mess of blood vessels that you also described without, we also value the brain."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "You can't make any mistakes, you can't damage things."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "So to me, that engineering challenge seems nearly impossible."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "One of the things I was really impressed by at Neuralink is just talking to brilliant neurosurgeons and the roboticists that made me realize that even though it seems impossible, if anyone can do it, it's some of these world class engineers that are trying to take it on."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "So I think the conclusion of our discussion here of this part is basically that the problem is really hard but hopefully not impossible."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "So if it's okay, let's start with the basics."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "So you've also formulated a fascinating principle, the free energy principle."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "Could we maybe start at the basics and what is the free energy principle?"}, {"time": 2599, "text": "Well, in fact, the free energy principle inherits a lot from the building of these data analytic approaches to these very high dimensional time series you get from the brain."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "So I think it's interesting to acknowledge that."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "And in particular, the analysis tools that try to address the other side, which is a functional integration, so the connectivity analyses."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "So on the one hand, but I should also acknowledge it inherits an awful lot from machine learning as well."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "So the free energy principle is just a formal statement that the existential imperatives for any system that manages to survive in a changing world can be cast as an inference problem in the sense that you can interpret the probability of existing as the evidence that you exist."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "And if you can write down that problem of existence as a statistical problem, then you can use all the maths that has been developed for inference to understand and characterize the ensemble dynamics that must be in play in the service of that inference."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "So technically, what that means is you can always interpret anything that exists in virtue of being separate from the environment in which it exists as trying to minimize variational free energy."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "And if you're from the machine learning community, you will know that as a negative evidence lower bound or a negative elbow, which is the same as saying you're trying to maximize or it will look as if all your dynamics are trying to maximize the complement of that which is the marginal likelihood or the evidence for your own existence."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "So that's basically the free energy principle."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "But to even take a sort of a small step backwards, you said the existential imperative."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "There's a lot of beautiful poetic words here, but to put it crudely, it's a fascinating idea of basically just of trying to describe if you're looking at a blob, how do you know this thing is alive?"}, {"time": 2754, "text": "What does it mean to be alive?"}, {"time": 2755, "text": "What does it mean to exist?"}, {"time": 2757, "text": "And so you can look at the brain, you can look at parts of the brain, or this is just a general principle that applies to almost any system."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "That's just a fascinating sort of philosophically at every level question and a methodology to try to answer that question."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "So that's a huge endeavor and it's nice that there's at least some, from some perspective, a clean answer."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "So maybe can you talk about that optimization view of it?"}, {"time": 2790, "text": "So what's trying to be minimized, maximized?"}, {"time": 2793, "text": "A system that's alive, what is it trying to minimize?"}, {"time": 2796, "text": "Right, you've made a big move there."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "First of all, it's good to make big moves."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "But you've assumed that the thing exists in a state that could be living or nonliving."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "So I may ask you, what licenses you to say that something exists?"}, {"time": 2820, "text": "That's why I use the word existential."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "It's beyond living, it's just existence."}, {"time": 2825, "text": "So if you drill down onto the definition of things that exist, then they have certain properties if you borrow the maths from nonequilibrium steady state physics that enable you to interpret their existence in terms of this optimization procedure."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "So it's good you introduced the word optimization."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "So what the free energy principle in its sort of most ambitious, but also most deflationary and simplest, says is that if something exists, then it must, by the mathematics of nonequilibrium steady state, exhibit properties that make it look as if it is optimizing a particular quantity."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "And it turns out that particular quantity happens to be exactly the same as the evidence lower bound in machine learning or Bayesian model evidence in Bayesian statistics."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "Or, and then I can list a whole other list of ways of understanding this key quantity, which is a bound on surprise or self information if you have information theory."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "There are a number of different perspectives on this quantity."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "It's just basically the log probability of being in a particular state."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "I'm telling this story as an honest, an attempt to answer your question."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "And I'm answering it as if I was pretending to be a physicist who was trying to understand the fundaments of nonequilibrium steady state."}, {"time": 2938, "text":

kind of systems are you imagining as a sort of more specific kind of case study?"}, {"time": 2951, "text": "Yeah, I'm imagining a range of systems, but at its simplest, a single celled organism that can be identified from its eco niche or its environment."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "So at its simplest, that's basically what I always imagined in my head."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "And you may ask, well, is there any, how on earth can you even elaborate questions about the existence of a single drop of oil, for example?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "But there are deep questions there."}, {"time":

thing, where does the drop of oil end and where does it begin?"}, {"time": 3067, "text": "Right, so I mean, you're asking deep questions, deep in a nonmillennial sense here."}, {"time": 3072, "text":

mean from the inside?"}, {"time": 3774, "text": "What I mean is that the internal states that can influence the active states, where the active states can influence, but they're not influenced by the

we realize, in terms of essentially swimming, essentially moving, changing one's shape, a morphogenesis that is dynamic and possibly adaptive."}, {"time": 3915, "text": "So that's what I was trying to get at between the difference between the oil drop and the little tadpole."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "The tadpole is moving around."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "Its active states are actually changing the external states."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "And there's now a cycle, an action perception cycle, if you like, a recurrent dynamic that's going on that depends upon this deeply structured

way to this point."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "Or things of that nature, especially when it comes to professional wrestling, teaching people like, no, I know you're just using this in a show, but this

like one of the most important aspects of the competition itself, across almost every style."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "And this is where submission, like catch wrestling or submission wrestling or Jiu Jitsu feels different, which it seems like for most wrestling, for a lot of wrestling, the dominance is the goal, as opposed to submission, which I guess those are two are related, but dominating the position."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "So that's what pinning is."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "It's almost like breaking your opponent, like breaking through all of their defenses to where they're

it to work within the system to constantly improve it, to manage better?"}, {"time": 2469, "text": "Man, I don't know that one."}, {"time": 2470, "text": "I mean, my general sense, and maybe this is the Nietzschean part of me, is that, yeah, it would take maybe not even just, maybe not even defining it specifically as revolution."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "Maybe it would just take just total calamity to get people to stop being shitty, to not stop being a lesser version of themselves, to stop thinking more about things from the paradigm that we exist in now, where we're giving so much value to stuff that isn't really all that valuable."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "Where we're so concerned about likes, and I don't just mean like whether we get them or not, but that, oh man, maybe we should take this off of our platform, because this is too destabilizing to people."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "Because once you exceed Dunbar's number, I think it's actually, without having the right

patterning."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "And now, and with also coupled with seemingly more sensitivity towards human states."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "So I feel like women, like the classic idea is like, oh, you know, women are psychic, you know, they have a sixth sense and what have you."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "And I think that's just a way of simplifying, what I think is that women may be more in tune with picking up on the unsaid."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "Like they might be better at seeing physical cues, inflection and tone, like different, like they may be far more sensitive to

there's a clip there, I think from a documentary where he talks about he is like fully afraid as he walks up to the ring and as he gets closer and closer and closer, he gets more confident until he gets in and then he's a god or something like that."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "That coupled with his statement on Joe Rogan that he gets aroused at the possibility of true, like of hurting somebody in the ring."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "So like he gets aroused at the violence."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "I like it because it's coupled to your basically statement that we need to own, to find our own

belong here."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "Yeah, it was never a problem for me."}, {"time": 5063, "text": "In fact, if anything, what I had to understand was, well, not only did I learn the hard way,

let you know that you get exposed and infected tomorrow."}, {"time": 866, "text": "The only way to know that is to be testing yourself frequently."}, {"time": 871, "text": "And the reason it matters is that these tests can be accessible if we are okay with saying the real purpose of a public health test is to answer the question, am I infectious?"}, {"time": 882, "text": "The reason we want to answer that is if you're infectious, that's when you isolate."}, {"time": 882, "text": "We actually don't want to isolate PCR positive individuals who are no longer infectious."}, {"time": 887, "text": "That's bad public health practice."}, {"time": 896, "text": "If I haven't been infectious for three weeks, I don't want to have somebody tell me that I need to go and isolate for 10 days just because I happen to use a PCR test today, three weeks after I was infectious."}, {"time": 908, "text": "And furthermore, I definitely don't want the public health agency to come and round up all the people I was with last night and say, you guys have to quarantine for 14 days because you were with Michael who wasn't infectious yesterday."}, {"time": 923, "text": "It's nonsensical to do that."}, {"time": 923, "text": "And it's a huge disincentive to actually get tested."}, {"time": 929, "text": "Huge disincentive to get tested."}, {"time": 929, "text": "People, if it's too sensitive, especially with flights, things like that, we shouldn't be stopping people from taking a flight if they haven't been infectious for 60 days."}, {"time": 939, "text": "And to be clear, people are only infectious for somewhere between three and seven days, but can be positive on a PCR test for 30 to 70 days."}, {"time": 946, "text": "So, I mean, it's potentially a tenfold difference in terms of how long you're PCR positive versus how long you're infectious."}, {"time": 960, "text": "So, we don't want to be taking people during those 30 to 70 days and saying you need to isolate just because you go and get a swab, or you can't go on your trip just because you had COVID last month."}, {"time": 971, "text": "That's not good use of a test."}, {"time": 971, "text": "So, the reason we don't have these tools right now is because when we evaluate a rapid test as a medical device, the FDA says, well, this has to achieve the properties that we expect from a medical device, which again, doesn't have to take time into account, doesn't really have to take cost or resources or scalability or access into account."}, {"time": 999, "text": "It only takes sensitivity and specificity to catch molecules."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And that's because you're only infectious for maybe 20%."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "So, theoretically, it should only have a 20% sensitivity against the PCR while still being a perfect medical, a perfect public health test."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "And the test is answering the question, am I infectious?"}, {"time": 1053, "text": "That's what you're testing for, not for the exact counting of the virion particles in your system."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "So, why are we still here?"}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So, have you had conversations with folks?"}, {"time": 1063, "text": "You said that there's a bunch of leaders that are kind of starting to wake up to this idea, but why is this taking this so long?"}, {"time": 1078, "text": "Why don't we still have hundreds of millions of at home tests?"}, {"time": 1078, "text": "The reason it's taking long, the reason it's taking long, I think, is because every agency and government is generally deferential to the FDA."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And in this context, I would argue that government hasn't been particularly creative."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So, for example, last year, when Trump was still president, I would, or in the transition, and I recall talking to the White House a number of times and saying, here's a plan to give us our lives back."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "I think that was actually the title of the Atlantic article."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "And this plan can stop shutdowns, it can stop outbreaks, it can allow society to keep running and could have prevented the outbreaks of last winter and fall and saved hundreds of thousands of lives."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "So, when I bring that to the White House or to the government, the federal government, whoever it might be, and I say, here's a plan, this would work."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "They say, what I get back is, this sounds really interesting, Michael."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "It looks like it checks out."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "But there's one problem, we don't have the test, there's no scale."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "And that's kind of where it all dropped."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "It's like this defeatist attitude of like, don't have the test, so we can't act on it."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "But now it's really changing."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "Well, and so that's really where things have been."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "And so nobody's paid attention."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "It's always been this like esoteric thing that, yeah, maybe one day we'll get around to it, but really it's not that important."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "And the pandemic's going away."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "But this was like 100% predictable, everything that's happening today."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "We predicted it last year."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "It's not, this isn't like rocket science or anything."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "The variants and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "So the FDA, we can start to understand why, but also like one question I want to ask, is it possible to go around the FDA?"}, {"time": 1192, "text": "So why has the FDA not changed?"}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And why has nobody tried to push the FDA to change?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "I think what the real reason is the FDA has one job around these tests and it is to authorize them as medical devices."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "They haven't been charged with doing anything else."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "So in their eyes, they're doing exactly what they're supposed to do."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "They're evaluating these tests as medical devices and they're telling company after company after company, sorry, you don't make the cut."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "And the only way to make the cut is really to kind of skew your clinical trials to favor the rapid test being positive, which isn't really good practice."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "We shouldn't be trying to skew clinical trials."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "But that's kind of what's happened."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "It's been forced upon the companies to do that."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "And so I think the FDA truly believes from the bottom of their heart that they are doing the right thing here."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "And I would argue that to an extent they are."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "I've been pretty hard on the FDA, but maybe the issue is a higher level issue."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "Like the in vitro diagnostics division is they get applications and they evaluate them and the applications are for medical claims."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "That's however, because there's been a misunderstanding of these tests and the companies only know to apply for these as medical claims because there's nothing else in this country to apply for except the medical claim."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "So we don't have a public health pathway to evaluate a test and authorize a test."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "We have defunded and devalued public health for so long that we literally don't have a language for it."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "We don't have laws, a language, words."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Is it called a public health test?"}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Is it called something else?"}, {"time": 1300, "text": "I call it a public health test because I'm trying to create a new definition here, but that's why nobody's acted because everyone says, well, there's no other pathway."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "So the FDA in vitro medical diagnostics division is the only pathway."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "So what I am trying to do is to say, look, the FDA very clearly states that they do not authorize or review public health tools and they don't authorize or review public health tests for COVID."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "So what I want the president of the United States to do is to utilize executive powers and take an executive action that can simply state like one line."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "One line could potentially change all of this."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "And it's a pretty obvious and simple line."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "And it is that any tools used for public health testing during this public health emergency will be designated as public health tools."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "Like it's obvious, like it's public health emergency."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "It's a tool used for public health that should be designated as a public health tool."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "If we can do that, if we can get that language out there so that that's the president's decision, then all of a sudden the FDA is off the hook."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "They're not trying to cram a square peg through a round hole."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "They can say, look, the antigen tests are not on us anymore."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "At least if they're going to be used for public health, like when you test a thousand people at a time or test a school classroom if they've been exposed, this is public health."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "And so then the CDC could take it over."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "The CDC could say, okay, what are the metrics we are interested in?"}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And they could say, we're interested in a test that can catch you if you're infectious."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "So you want high viral load detection."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "That's fast, that's scalable."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "And hey, if your test has been used in Europe for months and has performed extremely well, then we'll give you a certificate by right immediately."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "And that could actually get hundreds of millions of additional tests into the United States tomorrow."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "So you need some kind of classification from an FDA or from somebody to call it a public health tool in order for it to be manufactured."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "Is it possible to just go around all of this and just for somebody to manufacture at scale tests?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Well, if you did that and you just called them, you put a claim on them that called them public health tools, the FDA has a very weird view of this and they will tell you that it's illegal, that it's a crime."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "Is there a way to say like Elon Musk did with the flamethrower, it's not a flamethrower?"}, {"time": 1469, "text": "Believe me, I've tried to think of all the different approaches."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "There's major inconsistencies here."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "So it's not like we don't have a precedent for a public health test even during this pandemic."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "There is a very strong precedent."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "Pooled testing, we have companies like Ginkgo based out here in Cambridge that are working with 100 different labs around the country."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "So that might mean like not a ton of quality control over those labs."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "I don't want to say that they don't, I'm just saying the reality is if you're working with that many labs, it's hard to say, they're running pooled testing of millions and millions and millions of kids."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "So here you have a company that's testing in each pool five to 25 kids at a time, millions of kids in a pretty distributed way across the country in all these different labs and the FDA doesn't care at all."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "You don't need an EUA."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "It doesn't need a regulatory authority."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "It's collection on site."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "It's getting shipped to a lab."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "There's no oversight of it."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "So why does that have no oversight but a rapid test for the exact same purpose?"}, {"time": 1540, "text": "You're just giving people immediate results instead of two day delayed pooled PCR results."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "So it's a much more effective tool."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "Why is the rapid test used for the same purpose, not designated as a public health tool, but requiring FDA authorization?"}, {"time": 1558, "text": "It's a ridiculous reason and it's because the FDA says that if a test, and this is actually CMS that says this and the FDA adopts it, if a test alters your behavior, if you get a single result and it's going to alter your behavior, then that is a medical device."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "But the thing that I find ridiculous is like, okay, but you can give a pooled test that alters 25 people's behavior at once and that's not falling, like that's more risky."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "One person turns positive in the pool and 25 people have to be quarantined."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "And how do they evaluate the accuracy?"}, {"time": 1602, "text": "So for people who don't know, pooled test is you're testing a small fraction of the people."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "And if one of them is positive, then you basically say, we have to retest everybody in the pool."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "So you take, let's say you have a school and each classroom you might have 20 kids each swab their nose in a classroom and all those swabs go into a single tube."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "And then you rinse that tube out with some saline and you run a PCR test on that tube of 25 samples, 20 samples."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "And so if that tube turns positive in the PCR test, then all 20 or 25 of those students are now having to quarantine."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "And if there's no positive, then all 20 or 25 students are interpreting that their result is negative."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "So it really is ridiculous decision by the FDA to say that if the test itself only tests one sample at a time, it's medicine because it will tell you one person at a time, if you're positive or if you're negative."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "But if you do it as a pool and you tell 25 people that your pool was negative, then that's somehow different."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "That's public health, not medicine."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "There's no logic there."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "Was it just personalities and accidents of history or something like that?"}, {"time": 1680, "text": "For example, you talk about the public health tools and CDC, you look at masks."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "So masks were decided to somehow be an effective tool to help with the pandemic."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "So I'm sure the evidence that was used there was probably not as strong as the evidence supporting antigen rapid tests."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "I was very much reading a lot of research on masks."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "It's really tricky to show how well they stop the transmission of a virus, especially when you don't fully understand how the virus is transmitted or the viral load required, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "But then the CDC pretty quickly decided masks or whatever, there's some oscillations back and forth, but then they quickly decided, everybody decided masks is a good tool."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "So masks being decided a good tool and then rapid antigen tests, not a good tool."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "Is that just like certain personalities who didn't speak up in a meeting or who did speak up in a meeting?"}, {"time": 1738, "text": "Is this just like a weird roll of the dice or is there a better explanation?"}, {"time": 1743, "text": "I think it's somewhat of a roll of the dice, but I also think it's that testing."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "So doctors don't pretend to really understand much about fluid dynamics and how well masks are working."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "That's way out of their realm."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "Doctors do believe that they understand all aspects of the tests."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "And so the greatest barriers to rapid tests being brought to market or being rolled out heavily and supported as public health tools, the greatest barriers came from physicians saying, hell no, we can't use a test that's not as sensitive as a PCR."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "And look at what happens if you use this antigen test and not a PCR test."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "You get people who are showing a positive on a PCR and negative on an antigen."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "And they just assume that that was a false negative on the antigen."}, {"time": 1805, "text":

the biggest problem here is that we placed physicians in decision making power."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "When this pandemic hit, everyone called up clinical laboratory folks and microbiologists and physicians to ask, well, what kind of test should we use, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And there is no training in medical school for this kind of public health work."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "You have to optimize on the right qualities of a test that have nothing to do with medicine."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "And then sometimes, if not frequently, they're actually at odds."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "And I'll give an example why the physicians, you could see why the physicians would have been against it from their perspective."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "And they say, if a physician is a TSA agent at the airport, you know, a TSA agent, their role at any given time, and the role they think that the instruments need to play is I want you to scan the bag as well as possible."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "This is the only bag that I'm interested in at the moment."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "And this is my lane, this is my bag."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "I want to make sure that my instrument's doing, I don't want the crappy instrument in my lane, I want to make sure that I'm doing everything I can."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "But what those TSA agents don't have to worry about is, well, how many other instruments are there in this airport?"}, {"time": 1896, "text": "Is anyone getting through the lines here without going through security?"}, {"time":

there's a big gap in the security line and people are flowing through without going through security, that's not on the TSA agent."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "That's not a big systematic problem of that of the system."}, {"time": 1916, "text": "And we can't expect that TSA agent to have ever even thought about that."}, {"time": 1916, "text": "Like, that's not on them."}, {"time": 1924, "text":

frequency."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "We just need scale."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "We need to think differently because our only goal if we're doing frequent routine testing of asymptomatic people

test idea enabling, but the, but the FDA itself has created the idea by saying we don't regulate public health tools."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "So the word is out there."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "The FDA has said, we don't regulate them."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "So that gives the president an opportunity to say, okay, these are those, you know, these are public health tools by definition."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "And, and I do think that this is a kind of a crisis and it's a crisis of testing, but it's also a crisis of like, really, we're going to go through this whole pandemic and never figure this thing out."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "That's just really sad."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "You know, if we get through this and don't figure out how to evaluate a rapid test."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "So how do vaccines play with this?"}, {"time": 2295, "text": "So one of the things that when people discuss solutions to COVID, there's a sense that once you have a vaccine COVID is solved."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "So how does that interplay?"}, {"time": 2302, "text": "Like, why do we still need tests if we have vaccines?"}, {"time": 2309, "text": "Yeah, I actually wrote an op ed in New York times or Wall Street Journal or something that was titled why we still need rapid tests with vaccines."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And the real reason is because we have evaluated our vaccines based on their ability to stop disease."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "In fact, most of the trials didn't evaluate them based on their ability to stop transmission."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "They didn't even evaluate that at all, no less put it as one of the metrics for authorization."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "And with a virus like this, it would be a bit naive to think that it's really going to stop transmission well."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "I think a lot of excitement happened right after the first clinical trials."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "And I'm sure we were talking about it when I was last here, I would imagine given the timing."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "But those first clinical trials came out and everyone jumped for joy that these things were going to be the end to this pandemic."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "But we had really short sighted vision there by not recognizing two main features."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "One is that they might not stop transmission."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "Another, I guess three, another is that new variants might come around that will break through the vaccine protective immunity."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "And the third is that we were measuring the efficacy of these vaccines during the peak of their performance in the first few months after people got vaccinated."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "And that gives a skewed view of just how effective these are going to be long term."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "So what happened with the vaccines is that everyone got very comfortable, including the CDC saying, if you've been vaccinated, this is the end of the pandemic for you."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "And let's keep it up."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "But then Delta comes along and waning immunity comes along."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "And both of these things compound exactly as anticipated to get breakthrough cases."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "And unfortunately, what we're seeing now is the CDC and the administration went so all in on saying that breakthrough cases are rare, that transmission doesn't really happen if you're vaccinated without great data, especially with Delta, that once people started seeing breakthrough cases, they started interpreting that as a failure of the vaccine."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "The vaccines are still working to keep people out of the hospital for the most part, but they're not working to stop transmission."}, {"time": 2453, "text": "And if our goal is to stop transmission, which until we decide as a society that we have different goals, like we're okay with people getting ill and letting transmission go because we don't want to worry about it anymore."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "So until we decide that we're not going to stop transmission, we need other avenues besides the vaccine because it's not doing it."}, {"time": 2470, "text": "It also means that herd immunity isn't going to happen."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "And unfortunately, as long as we keep letting spread happen in the context of vaccinated people, we're kind of giving this virus a bootcamp of exactly what it needs to do and mutate to get around our vaccine derived antibodies."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "And that makes me very nervous."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "So the more we can do to stop spread in the unvaccinated, in the elderly vaccinated, and in other people, the better."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "We just should be focusing on that."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "So in your eyes, the solution would look like this."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "You would make enough tests where every single person will get tested every single day?"}, {"time": 2513, "text": "I think that that would be..."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "I don't want to do that actually."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "I want to do a variation on that."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "I think what we should do is have a dynamical testing program."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "It doesn't have to be complicated."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "Every household has a box of tests in their cupboard."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "And if you haven't seen any cases in your community for a long time, stop testing."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "Do wastewater testing to see if there's any RNA coming back."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "If you start to see RNA in the wastewater that represents the virus, and

test per week?"}, {"time": 2555, "text": "Can you start to just pause on that idea?"}, {"time": 2555, "text": "That's really cool, the wastewater testing."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "That's the thing?"}, {"time": 2564, "text": "So you can get a sense of how prevalent the virus is in a particular community by testing the wastewater?"}, {"time": 2569, "text": "And so the viral load associated, the viral load that you can find in the community represents the prevalence of the virus in the community, which is really quite nice."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "That's a nice way to paint like a map of the intensity of the virus."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "Okay, so when it goes above a certain level, you can start doing much higher frequency testing in each household."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "So I don't want people to be in testing purgatory, like that's not what I want."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "I just want us to get through this damn pandemic."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "And so we can monitor the wastewater or any other methods."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "We can monitor the hospitals and the clinics."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "And if somebody does come in with COVID like symptoms, and then a few other people come in, you realize, okay, we got spread happening in our community."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "Send out a text message, put it on the news, put in the newspaper, whatever you need to do, tell people, tell families, use your test."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "And if the cases get worse, because you're just doing it once a week, that's not going to stop transmission, but it's going to enable you to identify where outbreaks are happening."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "If you start to find outbreaks in pockets, then the rule is simply, okay, let's squash the outbreak real fast."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "So everyone in that area in certain zip code or whatever it might be, test every two days for seven days or every day for seven days, and you'll get rid of the outbreak."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "And if you've now gone, again, a week or two with no cases identified, stop the testing again."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "That's the nice thing that everything changes when people have the tests in their home."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "It becomes dynamic."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "It can become easy."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "You send a text message, take your test today."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "If some people don't do it, that's fine."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "The only goal is to get R below one, and you stop the outbreak."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "People think it has to be near perfect."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "I always hear people say, oh, what if somebody doesn't use it?"}, {"time": 2688, "text": "Or what if somebody lies?"}, {"time": 2688, "text": "Well, you have 98% of people testing or even 50%."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "That's a whole lot better."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "And another big difference that people, I think, oftentimes have a problem wrapping their head around, especially to an extent physicians who are used to different kinds of metrics, is that all we have to do to completely stop an outbreak from spreading in a community is to get, for every 100 infected people, to get them to go on and infect 95."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "Most people would say, oh my God, that's a horrible program."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "You're still letting 100 people go and infect 95 people."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "But for a virus like this, that's a massive public health win."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "If you can get 100 people to infect 90, most people, doctors, I would say, like a lot of people would say, that sounds like a failure, to be honest."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "But if you do that for multiple days in a row, then in a couple of weeks, you've gone from a big outbreak to a very, very small outbreak."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "And on the other hand, if you don't do that, if you allow 100 people to just infect 140 people, because you're not doing the testing, then instead of having 20 people at the end of those four weeks with the testing, you literally would have 600."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "Massive differences here."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "The only goal then is to get R below one, have 100 people infect less than 100, and you stop the outbreaks and everyone stays safe."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "From everything you've seen, how cheap can these things get?"}, {"time": 2781, "text": "From like in the past year, in terms of the developments you've seen with the various test manufacturers, how cheap can it be to make a test, to manufacture a test?"}, {"time": 2786, "text": "So there's the manufacturing process that could be 50 cents, maybe less."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "It's hard to really have eyeballs inside these companies in terms of where they're producing them in China and Taiwan, a number of other places."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "Some of them are produced here in the United States too, but 50 cents, say, was a very, very reasonable, generous number for how much it costs per test."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "You look at a place with high market competition that has actually authorized a lot of these tests like Germany."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "Germany has 60, 70 some odd different companies of high quality rapid tests authorized."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "You can go there and buy it for 80 cents, and they're still making a profit."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "And so it's extremely cheap."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "Market competition can drive these tests way down in terms of cost."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "I think one of the most important features of a rapid test program is what do you do with the result?"},

lead to a crisis if we don't fix this soon because we're going to have massive demand for testing in the next couple of weeks."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "But when he says that, that's essentially saying, okay, companies need to make sure that their people are testing."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "So are you going to base it on the honor system?"}, {"time": 2876, "text": "I would say you probably would not base testing on the honor system if it's like to take somebody who would otherwise be quarantined from work in school."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "And so you can go to school as long as your test is negative."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "So test to stay program is a big thing that I've been pushing for and others have."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "Businesses bringing people into work who need to test, they need to have verification, but they don't want to set up nursing stations in their lobbies or in the school parking lot or whatever."}, {"time": 2904, "text": "Everyone's tired of that."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "We need to bring the tests into the home, but that means we need the technology to enable it."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "And so I was at a conference recently."},

a conference to raise money for prostate cancer research."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "I was at this conference recently, Francis Collins, a number of other people were there."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "And every morning we all had to test in the morning, which I thought was a great idea obviously before we walked into that conference."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "But you didn't have to test there and they didn't base it on the honor system."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "Every morning I scanned a QR code on the box and eMed, which is a service that provides test verification, popped up with a proctor right on my phone or on my computer and said, okay, let's go through your tests."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "And they watch you, they videotape you using the test."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "So it's all recorded."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "It's all a reportable type of test."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "And at the end of it, just from your home, you don't actually see the proctor, you know, but they're just verifying that you actually do it."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "They verify the test, they verify the test results with you."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "And at the end of it, you've then gotten from your couch or from your car, wherever you are, an actual verified laboratory report that can be considered proof that you yourself use the test and you yourself got a negative."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "So the tools are out here if we want to use them at scale."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And in fact, the CDC uses eMed now to enable people to come back into the United States through an antigen test."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "So before you get on your flight, you're sitting in the airport in Heathrow or wherever you are, you can get on your computer, use your eMed test, and you get the negative and CDC will accept that, TSA will accept you to come back into the US with a rapid antigen test that you did without anyone else watching, except for this proctor on your phone."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "Super simple."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "How much private information is being collected?"}, {"time": 3027, "text": "So like this, you know, people have in the United States, the American way, they have a hesitancy on the overreach of government in things like vaccine passports, like using any mechanism of verification that's controlled by government can lead to overreach by said government."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "So there's a concern of that."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Do you see there a way of achieving testing that's verified but does not violate people's privacy or sense of freedom?"}, {"time": 3066, "text": "The way that right now in the United States, they're requesting that these tests get, that the results get delivered to public health agencies."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "But I've long held that while that's ideal, it should never be the thing that holds up somebody being allowed to know their own status."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "But if you are going to work and you have to let your boss or your manager, whomever, know that you were negative that day, or if you're going to school, I think it's going to be hard to maintain complete privacy in that situation because they need to know your name."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "But sure, I mean, could you cut off the public health reporting?"}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Yes, you could."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "But I worry, I mean, can you opt out?"}, {"time": 3111, "text": "Maybe you could opt out."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "That should be a feature."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "I want to opt out of the public health reporting because for whatever reason, otherwise I'm not going to do the test."}, {"time": 3116, "text": "But that means that, okay, then you're not going to go to work."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "So right now there's this serious tension and I am very uncomfortable with the idea that we force anyone to do anything."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "But there is a tension between these two things for sure."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "And how do you balance that during a public health emergency?"}, {"time": 3141, "text": "I think first and foremost, let people, everyone has a right to know their status."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "The fact that we have made it hard for people to know their status on their terms, I think is a travesty."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "I mean, it's just so terrible that we have prioritized us knowing at the expense of you."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "Essentially what public health has long said during this pandemic is, if I'm public health, if I can't know, then you can't know your status."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "That's not the right way to look at public health."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "We need to engage the public."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "And if some of them don't want to participate in the public health part, but want to know their status, by default, they are participating in public health, whether they know it or not, because they're not going to go get their mom sick by mistake."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "At least most people wouldn't."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "And then also you can create systems where you can, individuals can form relationships based on their status without ever reporting it to a centralized place."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "So you can go to, I don't know, a local business owner might require that you show that you're negative, but that doesn't require reporting it."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "You can, like there might be basically like an ID that's only in possession, you are the only person in possession of that."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "So you literally show it, here's a test I took, it's negative and nobody else knows about that test."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "So that could very well be done, even through a company like eMed."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "I think, and I might be wrong here, I believe that they take the test result, and because they are considered a CLIA waived laboratory, like a digital laboratory, they report their results by law out to the public health agencies."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "But let's say there was something a little different."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "Let's say you were verifying an over the counter test, and it doesn't have to be a CLIA waive because it's over the counter, then you're not bound by CLIA rules."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "And you could create the same service, but that just doesn't report out to the public health agencies."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "It gives people the option to opt in or out of public health reporting."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "And I know that public health people get a little queasy when I talk about this, but as a public health person myself, I guess of course I would prefer that the data be available to evaluate to know where the cases are."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "But first and foremost, I want to make sure that the people using the test are going to use the test."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "And if that means that they're not reporting, and if that's the only way that they will use it is if it's not reported, then that's better than no test."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "Especially given that the central to the vaccine hesitancy is a distrust of authority and the distrust of government."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "So you're asking people to get tested and report their status to a centralized authority when they clearly do not trust that authority."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "It seems like a perfect solution to let people who are hesitant on the vaccine to get their own status and have full control of that information and opt in, provide that information if they wish to, but they have the full control of it and have the freedom to do that information what they want."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "I fully agree with that."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "I think we can have the verified services and we could have the privacy if you want it."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "If you need to go into a restaurant and there's a rule that you have to be a negative test, have it on your phone and only your phone."}, {"time": 3353, "text":

{"time": 3359, "text": "And in that case, you'd want something that just is there and is not going anywhere else."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "And I think that those services, I think they can exist."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "And it's a struggle because for those companies, they don't want to fall out of favor with the CDC or with the FDA."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "And so this is a big problem in our marketplace in general by having private companies who want to be the public health agents of this pandemic."}, {"time": 3384, "text": "We lose a lot of control because the companies ultimately have to do what's going to make them money so they survive and keep performing the service."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "It's really just such a hard problem."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "And this is why last time I was here, I'm guessing I was probably really pushing for the government to be producing these tests."}, {"time": 3405, "text": "I think I would have still been pushing for that."},

tests."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "I really am sort of serious that these tests are simple to make, but we've been using machines to make them that have been around for a long time."}, {"time": 3429,

mentioned, know how to solve that problem."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "I've had a lot of discussion with Tesla folks and know with people that used to work at Tesla, like Jim Keller, about how to make stuff much cheaper, much better."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "That's basically what Tesla is world class at."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "It's like, okay, does this thing have to cost $1,000?"}, {"time":

given that choice, a lot of people go test in America because there's like a division, it seems like."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "So is this just politics?"}, {"time": 3495, "text": "Is this just words?"}, {"time": 3495, "text": "Or do you think this is actually going to lead to something?"}, {"time": 3502, "text": "And maybe can you explain what the action plan is?"}, {"time": 3507, "text":

"text": "We want to get everyone vaccinated."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "All these things."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And one pillar is saying any company in the United States that has more than 100 employees is now required to ensure that any unvaccinated individuals in their workforce test weekly."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "Another pillar is that the president's going to reduce the cost of PCR tests."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "By 35%, which is pretty moderate reduction."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "And is going to reduce the cost of antigen tests and scale them up and make 280 million tests

Yeah, but the question is how long that whole process takes."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "I think, you know, my guess is probably by the end of next year, early 2023, we will probably start looking at this as though it is not a particularly dangerous virus for most people."}, {"time": 4714, "text": "The elderly though, it will still be, but that's because their immunity...

wise."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "Well, I mean, it's because the intuition is like, okay, now that there's a vaccine, you're either going to take the vaccine or get infected and then there'll be herd immunity over, like it'll be very quick."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "So, you know, that's the intuition, but it seems like that's not happening."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "It seems like we're in this constant state of fear mongering for different reasons."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "It's almost like the virus got deeply integrated, not into just our biology, but in the game of politics and in the fear mongering around the news because the virus now started being together with the vaccine and the masks and it started getting integrated into the division and that's so effective at monetizing social media, for example."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "And so it's like, all right, so how do you get out of that?"}, {"time": 4787, "text": "Because you can always kind of present certain kinds of numbers about number of cases or how full hospitals are and start making claims about that we're still, this is as bad as it's ever been, those kinds of statements."}, {"time": 4801, "text": "And so

they're information."}, {"time": 4824, "text": "It can allow us to control things."}, {"time": 4824, "text": "Just like we drive down a road and we look at the cars and we don't hit other cars because

1320, "text": "On the news media, on the journalists, on scientists, that's scary to me."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "But of course, the direct advertisement to consumers, like you said, is a

advertising."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "You would think in a rational society that was way out on a limb as a lone country besides New Zealand that allows direct to consumer advertising, that part of

be preventing."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "But we don't require that."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "So the companies can afford to do very large studies so that very small differences become statistically

what is building the architectures to start with."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "And the fact that the universe has discrete things and it is completely mind blowing."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "If you think about it for one second, the fact there's any objects at all, and there's, because for me, the object is a proxy for a machine that built it, some information being moved around, actuation,

thought, and then there's a lineage of those objects."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "So I think what is fascinating is that, you put it much more elegantly, but the barrier between life and non life is accruing enough memories to then actuate."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "So what that means is there are contingency, there are things that happen in the universe get trapped, these memories then have a causal effect on the future."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "And then when you get those concentrated in a machine, and you're actually able in real time, able to integrate the past, the present with the

that Sarah said, is simple machines creating complex machines."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "So there's a million questions there."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So how the hell does a simple machine create a complex machine?"}, {"time": 1241, "text": "By mutation."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "So this is what we were talking about at the beginning, is you have the minimum replicator, so a molecule."},

itself, but then there has to be some variability, otherwise it's not gonna get more functional."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "So you need to add bits on."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "So you have a minimum

1298, "text": "Doesn't the machine that creates the object need to be as or more powerful than the things it creates?"}, {"time": 1308, "text": "So how can you get complexity from simplicity?"}, {"time": 1311, "text": "So the way you get complexity from simplicity is that you, I'm just making this up, but this is kind of my notion, and you have a large volume of stuff, so you're able to get seeds, if you like, random cues from the environment."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "So you just use those objects to basically write on your tape, ones and zeros, whatever."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "And that is necessarily rich, complex, okay?"}, {"time": 1337, "text": "But it has a low assembliness, but even though it has a high assembly number, we can talk about that."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "But then when you start to then integrate that all into a smaller volume, as over time, and you become more autonomous, you then make the transition."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "I don't know what you think about that."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "I think the easiest way to think about it is actually, which I know is a concept you hate, but I also hate, which is entropy, but people are more familiar with

okay."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Sorry to keep interrupting."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "No, no, no, it's fine."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "I like it too, it's very funny."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "But I think it's a good way of phrasing it because I think this kind of idea we have in assembly theory is that, you know, physics as we know it has basically removed time as being a physical observable of an object."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And the argument I would make is that when you look at things like water bottles or us, we're actually things that exist that have a large extent in time."},

of science."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "We are ready to start an interesting discussion with our peers."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "You're the machine that created the object, and we'll see what the object takes us."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "All right, so what is assembly theory?"}, {"time": 1469, "text": "Yeah, well, I think the easiest way for people to understand it is to think about assembly and molecules, although the theory is very general."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "It doesn't just apply to molecules."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "And this was really Lee's insight, so it's kind of funny that I'm explaining it, but."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "I'll mark you."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "Okay, all right, I'm ready, I'm ready."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "You have to tell me where I get the check marks minus, but."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "It's your theory as well."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "But imagine a molecule, and then you can break the molecule apart into elementary building blocks."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "They happen to be bonds."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "And then you can think of all the ways, for molecular assembly theory, you can think of all the ways of building up the original molecule."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "So there's all these paths that you can assemble it."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And the sort of rules of assembly is you can use pieces that have been generated already."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So it has this kind of recursive property to it."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "And so that's where kind of memory comes into assembly theory."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "And then the assembly index is the shortest path in that space."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So it's supposed to be the minimal amount of history that the universe has to undergo in order to assemble that particular object."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "And the reason that this is significant is we figured out how to measure that with a mass spec in the lab."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "And we had this conjecture that if that minimal number of steps was sufficiently large, it would indicate that you required a machine or a system that had information about how to assemble that specific object because the combinatorial space of possibilities is getting exponentially large as the assembly index is increasing."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "So it's just, sorry to interrupt, so that means there's a sufficiently high assembly index that if observed in an object is an indicator that something lifelike created it or is the object itself lifelike?"}, {"time": 1568, "text": "But you might want to make the distinction that a water bottle is not life, but it would still be a signature that you were in that domain of physics and that I might be alive."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "So there will be potentially a lot of arguments about where the line, at which assembly index does interesting stuff start to happen."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "The point is we can make all the arguments, but it should be experimentally observable and Lee can talk more about that part of it."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "But the point I want to make about it is there was always this intuition that I had that there should be some complexity threshold in the universe above which you would start to say whatever physics governs life actually becomes operative."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "And I think about it a little bit like we have Planck's constant, and we have the fine structure constant."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "And then this sort of assembly threshold is basically another sort of potentially constant of nature."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "It might depend on the specific features of the system, but which we debate about sometimes."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "But then when you're past that, you have to have some other explanation than the current explanations we have in physics, because now you're in high memory."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "The things actually require time for them to exist and time becomes a physical variable."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "The path to the creation of the object is the memory."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So you need to consider that."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "Yeah, but the point is that's a feature of the object."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "So when I think of all the things in this room, we see the projection of them as a water bottle, but assembly theory would say that this is a causal graph of all the ways the universe can create this thing."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "That's what it is as an object."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "And we're all interacting, a causal graph."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And most of the creativity in the biosphere is because a lot of the objects that exist now are huge in their structure across time."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Four billion years of evolution to get to us."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "Is it possible to look at me and infer the history that led to me?"}, {"time": 1681,

that you can communicate with, i.e."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "other humans, you can infer a lot probably."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "Yeah, also with them."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "Which we do genomically even."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "I mean, it's not like, we have a lot of information in us, we can reconstruct histories from."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "Assembly is saying something slightly deeper."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "Yeah, one thing to add."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "I mean, it's not just about the object, but the objects occur and not just objects with high assembly number, because you can have random things that have a high assembly number, but they must have, there must be a number of identical copies."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "So you know you're getting away from the random, because you could take a snapshot."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "This is why, it's not I hate entropy, I love entropy when used correctly, but it's about the problem of entropy, you have to have a labeler."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "And so you can label the beginning and the end, the start and the finish, you know, where what you can do in assembly is say, oh, I have a number of objects in abundance."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "They all have these features."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "And then you can infer."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "And one of the things that we debated a lot, particularly during lockdown, because I almost went insane trying to crush the, produce the assembly equation."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "So we came up with the assembly equation."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "I had, just imagine this."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "So you have a string where, actually it makes me sick trying to remember it."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "It was so, it did my head in for a long time."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Yeah, because I couldn't, so if you just have a string of say words, say, you know, a series of words, series of letters."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "So you just have A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, D. And you find that object and you just have four A's, four B's, four C's, four D's together, boom."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "Then, and that you measured that."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "So you physically measured that string of letters."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "Then what you could do is you can infer sub graphs of maybe the four A's, the four B's, the four C's and the four C's, but you don't see them in the real world."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "You just infer them."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "And I really got stuck with that because there's a problem to try and work out what's the difference between a long, you know, a physical object and this assembly space of the objects that we realized the best way to put that is infer in time."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "So although we can't infer your entire history, we know at some point the four A's were made, the four B's was made, the four C's were made, the four D's were made and they all got added together."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And that's one really interesting thing that's come out of the theory, but the killer when we knew we were going beyond beyond standard complexity theories, but incredibly successful is that we realized we could start to measure these things for real across domains."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "So the assembly index is actually an intrinsic property of all stuff that you can break into components, particularly molecules are good because you can break them up into smaller molecules, into atoms."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "The challenge will be making that more general across all the domains, but we're working on it right now and I think the theory will do that."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "So components, domains, so you're talking about basically measuring the complexity of an object in what, biology, chemistry, physics, that's what you mean by domains."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "Complexity of tests."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "Sociology."}, {"time": 1866, "text":

are interested in and people that worry about the mind body problem."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "But the whole idea is, you know, if we have, you know, the microscopic world of physics is causally complete, it seems like there's no room for higher level causes like our thoughts to actually have any impact on the world."}, {"time": 1916, "text": "And that didn't, that seems problematic when you get to studying life and mind because it does seem that quote unquote, emergent properties do matter to matter."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And then there's this other sort of paradoxical situation where information looks like it's disembodied."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "So we talk about information, like it can just move from any physical system to any other physical system."}, {"time": 1937,

mathematics is also disembodied, right?"}, {"time": 1948, "text": "Like the platonic world of forms and I think all of those things are hinging that we really don't know how to think about abstractions as physical things."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "And really, I think what assembly theory is pointing to is what we're missing there is the dimension of time."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "And

that saved me."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "And I said to Abhishek, Abhishek's my postdoc in Glasgow, Daniel is Sarah's postdoc in ASU."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "I was like, I have the experimental

universe?"}, {"time": 2145, "text": "When I find those features, I know the universe has had a coherent memory and is basically alive."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "And so that gives you the lower

2171, "text": "And then I realized it was intrinsic."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "And then Sarah realized it was intrinsic and these hyperobjects were coming."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "And we were kind of fusing that notions together."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "And then the team were like, yeah, but if I have enough energy and I have enough resources, I might not take the shortest path."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "I might go a bit longer."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "I might take a really long path because it allows me then to do something else."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "So what you can do is, let's say I've got two different objects, A and B, and they both have different shortest paths to get them."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "But then if you want to make A and B together, they will have a compromise."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "So in the joint assembly space, that might be an average, but actually it's the shortest way you can make both A and B with a minimum amount of resource in time."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "So suddenly you then layer these things up."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "And so the average becomes not important, but as you literally overlap those sets, you get a new shortest path."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "And so what we realized time and time again when we're doing the math, the shortest path is intrinsic, is fundamental, and is measurable, which is kind of mind blowing."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "So what we're talking about, some basic ingredients, maybe we'll talk about that, what those basic ingredients could be and how many steps, when you say shortest path, how many steps it takes to turn those basic ingredients into the final meal."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So how to make a, what's the shortest way to make a pizza?"}, {"time": 2255,

mean, maybe we're gonna get to alien civilizations later, right?"}, {"time": 2327, "text": "But I would argue very strongly that alien civilization A and alien civilization B, they're different assembly spaces."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "And the shortest path will help you do that quickly."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "All right, so all aliens in this causality graphs have a common ancestor in the..."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "If the building blocks are the same, which means they live in the same universe as us."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "So this is the assumption."}, {"time": 2376, "text":

2385, "text": "So at least there's not different classes of causality graphs, right?"}, {"time": 2393, "text": "The universe doesn't just say like, here you get the red causality graph, and you get the blue one."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "These basic ingredients, and they're geographically constrained, or constrained in space or time, or something like that."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "They're constrained in time because only by the virtue of the fact that you need enough time to have passed for some things to exist."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "So the universe has to be big enough in time for some things."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "So just one point on the shortest path versus the average path, which I think we'll get to this, is you had a nice way of saying it's like the minimal compression is the shortest path for the universe to produce that."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "But it's also like the first time in the ordering of events that you might expect to see that object."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "But the average path tells you something about the actual steps that were realized, and that becomes an emergent property of that object's interaction with other objects."},

nice features of assembly is you've basically gotten rid of, you just look at the things that exist, and you've gotten rid of the mechanisms for constructing them in some sense."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "Like the machines are not as important in the current construction of the theory, although I would like to bridge it to some ideas about constructors."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "But then you can only communicate with things as Lee was saying, if you have some overlap in the past history."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "So if you had an alien species that had absolutely no overlap, then there would be no means of communication."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "But as we progress further and further in time and more things become possible because the assembly spaces are larger, because you can have a larger assembly space in terms of index and also just the size of the space, because it's exponentially growing, then more things can happen in the future."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "And the example I like to give is actually when we made first contact with gravitational waves, because that's an alien phenomenon that's been permeating our planet, not alien in life phenomenon, but alien like something we had never knew existed."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "It's been like there's gravitational waves rippling through this room right now, but we had to advance to the level of Einstein

causal graph have to start intersecting."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "Yeah, we needed the idea to emerge first, the abstraction, right?"}, {"time": 2538, "text": "And then we had to build the technology that could actually observe features of that abstraction."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "So the nice promising thing is over time, the graph can grow so we can start overlapping eventually."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Yeah, so the interesting feature of that graph is there was an event 1.4 billion years away of a black hole merger that we detected on our detector."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "And now suddenly we're connected through this communication channel with this distant event in our universe that if you think about 1.4 billion years ago, what was happening on this planet or even further

ago."}, {"time": 2620, "text": "We detected the gravity wave."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "I mean, I think it's amazing that at that time, we weren't even, we were just becoming multicellular, right?"},

backwards."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "So, although we didn't do anything back to the graph back in time, we understood this existence then overlapped going forward."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "Well, that's because our graphs are larger."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "Yeah, but that means that has a consequence."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "One of the things I was trying to say is I think, I don't know,

has to be this transition in random constructions."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "So when the object that's being constructed by the process bakes in that memory and those memories then add on and add on

think that, like the cell that we have in biology on earth is our way of doing that, that really the maximum ability to take memories and to act on the future."}, {"time": 2693, "text": "Oh, I think that's mathematics."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "No, mathematics doesn't exist."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "No, but that's the point."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "The point is that abstractions do exist."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "They're real physical things."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "We call them abstractions."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So I think mathematics is a really good example."},

interesting."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "I think this is why we think it describes reality so well because it's the most copyable kind of information."}, {"time": 2750, "text": "It retains its properties when you move it between physical media, which means that it's very deep."}, {"time": 2756, "text": "And so it seems to describe the universe really well, but it probably is because it's information that's very deep in our past."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "And it's just, we invented a way of communicating it very effectively between us."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "Isn't math more fundamental?"}, {"time": 2771, "text": "Isn't the assembly of the graph, isn't basically, I sound completely boring."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "It's like math, assembly theory invented math, but it did."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "It has to be."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "So what is math exactly?"}, {"time": 2788, "text": "It's a nice simplification, a simple description of what?"}, {"time": 2798,

can correct me."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "Lay in on us, Lee."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "We're ready."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "I think the ability to label objects and place them into classes and then do operations on the objects is what math is."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "So on that point, what does it mean to be object first versus information first?"}, {"time": 2827, "text": "So what's the difference between object and information when you get to that low fundamental level?"}, {"time": 2831, "text": "Well, I might change my view."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "So I'm stuff first, the stuff."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "And then when stuff becomes objects, it has to invent information."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "And then the information acts on more stuff and becomes more objects."},

become actionable, that's information."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "But there's always memory, but it's not actionable."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "And then it's not information."}, {"time": 2870,

can't transmit it, if it doesn't have any causal consequence."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "Falls in the forest."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "Why is that not information?"}, {"time": 2883, "text": "It's not information."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "It's stuff."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "It's stuff happening, but it's not causal."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "Yeah, yeah, we can."}, {"time": 2891, "text":

math."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "Well, the universe is just math."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "Then we might as well not bother having any conversation because the conversation already written, we just might as well go to the future and say, can you just give us the conversations happened already?"}, {"time": 2918, "text": "So I think the problem is that math petitions are so successful at labeling stuff and so successful understanding the stuff through those labels, they forget that actually those labels had to emerge and that information had to be built on those memories."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "So memory in the universe, so constraints, graph, when they become actionable and the graph can loop back on itself or interact with other graphs and they can intersect, those memories become actionable and therefore they're information."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "And I think you just changed my mind on something pretty big, but I don't have a pen."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "So I can't write, I'm gonna write it down later, but roughly the idea is like you've got these two graphs of objects of stuff that you have memories and then when they intersect and then they can act on each other, that's maybe the mechanism by which information is then, so then you can then abstract."}, {"time": 2969, "text": "So when one graph can then build another graph and say, hey, you don't have to go through the nonsense we had to go through."}, {"time": 2974, "text": "Here's literally the way to do it."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "Stuff always comes first, but then when stuff builds the abstraction, the abstractions can be then teleported onto other stuff."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "And the abstractions is the looping back power."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "Am I making, I don't know, I got stuck."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "Yeah, so first, God made stuff."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "Then after that, when you start to be able to form abstractions, that's when the information."},

3024, "text": "We were time, causality, mathematics."}, {"time": 3030, "text": "So what is mathematics in this picture of stuff, objects, memory, and information?"}, {"time": 3043, "text": "What exactly is mathematics?"}, {"time": 3044, "text": "It's the most efficient labeling scheme that you can apply to lots of different graphs."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "Labeling scheme doesn't make it

we have a problem, right?"}, {"time": 3066, "text": "Cause we can't not be us, like we're stuck in the shells we are and we're trying to observe the world."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "And so mathematics looks like it has certain properties."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "And I guess the thought experiment I find is useful is to try to imagine if you were outside of us looking at us as physical systems using mathematics, what would be the specific features you associate to the property of understanding mathematics and being able to implement it in the universe, right?"}, {"time": 3092, "text": "And when you do that, mathematics seems to have some really interesting properties relative to other kinds of abstraction we might talk about like language or artistic expression."},

"text": "What color blue do you mean?"}, {"time": 3116, "text": "And you have a harder time visualizing what I actually mean."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "So mathematics carries a lot of meaning with it when it's copied between physical systems."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "It's also the reason we use it to communicate with computers."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "And then the second one is it retains its property of actually what it can do in the universe when it's copied."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "So the example I like to give there is think about like Newton's law of gravitation."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "It's actually, it's a compressed regularity of a bunch of phenomena that we observe in the universe, but then that information actually is causal in a sense that it allows us to do things we wouldn't be able to do without that particular knowledge and that particular abstraction."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "And in this case, like launch satellites to space or send people to Mars or whatever it is."}, {"time": 3185, "text": "So is it helping the overlap of causal graphs then by mapping?"}, {"time": 3191, "text": "Oh, I think that's the explanation for what it is in terms of the physical theory of assembly would be some feature of the structure of the assembly spaces of causal graphs and their relationship to each other."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "So for example, and I mean, this is things that we're gonna have to work out over the next few years."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "I mean, we're in totally uncharted conceptual territory here, but as is usual, diving off the deep end, but I would expect that we would be able to come up with a theory of like, why is it that some physical systems can communicate with each other?"}, {"time": 3223, "text": "Like language, language is basically because we're objects extended over time and some of the history of that assembly space actually overlaps."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "And when we communicate, it's because we actually have shared structure in our causal history."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "Let me have another quick go at this, right?"}, {"time": 3236, "text": "So I think we all agree."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "So I think we take mathematics for granted because we've gone through this chain, right?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Of, you know, we all share a language now, okay?"}, {"time": 3246, "text": "And we can, well, we share language, so we have languages that we can make interoperable."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "And so whether you're speaking, I don't know, all the different dialects of Chinese, all the

Twitter or Instagram, more importantly, to play like, here's an organism of a low assembly index and here's an organism of a high assembly index and let's watch them create more and more memories and more and more complex objects."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "And so like, in mathematics, you get to observe what that looks like to build up an intuition what assembly index is like."}, {"time": 4455, "text": "We are building a toolkit right now."}, {"time": 4457, "text": "So I think it's a really good idea, but what we've got to do is I'm kind of still obsessed with the infrastructure required."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "And one of the reasons why I was pushing on information and mathematics when human beings, when human beings, we take a lot of the infrastructure for granted."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "And I think we have to strip that back a bit for going forward, but you're absolutely right."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "I would agree that I think the fact that we exist in the universe, this is like, I can see that lots of people would disagree with the statement, but I don't think Sarah will, but I don't know."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "The fact that objects exist, I don't think anyone on earth will disagree that objects can exist elsewhere, right?"}, {"time": 4495, "text": "But they will disagree that life can exist elsewhere."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "But what perhaps I'm trying to say is that the acquisition, the universe's ability to acquire memory is the very first step for building life."}, {"time": 4510, "text": "And that must be, that's so easy to happen."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "So therefore alien life is everywhere because all alien life is, is those memories being compressed and minimalized and the alien equivalent of the cell working."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "So I think that we will build new technologies to find aliens, but we need to understand what we are first and how we go from physics to chemistry to biology."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "The most interesting thing, as you're saying to these two organisms, different assemblies, there's one you get into biology."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Biology gets more and more weird, more and more contingent."}, {"time": 4546, "text": "Physics is, chemistry is less weird cause the rules of chemistry are smaller than the rules of biology."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "And then going away to physics where you have a very nicely tangible number of ways of arranging things."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "And I think assembly theory just helps you appreciate that."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "And so once we get there, my dream is that we are just gonna be able to suddenly, I mean, I'm maybe just being really arrogant here."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "I don't mean to be arrogant."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "It's just, I've got this hammer called assembly and everything's a nail."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "But I think that once we crack it, we'll be able to use assembly theory plus telescopes to find aliens."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "Do you have, Sarah, do you have disagreements with Lee on the number of aliens that are out there?"}, {"time": 4588, "text": "I do actually, yeah, well."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "And what they look like."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "So any of the things we've been talking about, is there nuanced, it's always nice to discover wisdom through nuanced disagreement."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "Yeah, I don't wholly disagree, but I think, but I do think I disagree."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "It's kind of, there's nuance there."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "But Lee made it."}, {"time": 4612, "text": "You can disagree."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "No, it's fine."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "It is nuanced, right?"}, {"time": 4615, "text": "So you made the point earlier that you think, once we discover what life is, we'll see alien life everywhere."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "And I think I agree on some levels in the sense that I think the physics that governs us is universal."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "But I don't know how far I would go to say, to say that we're a likely phenomenon because we don't understand all of the features of the transition at the origin of life, which we would just say in assembly, as you go from the no memory physics to there's like a critical transition around the assembly index where assembliness starts to increase."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "And that's what we call the evolution of the biosphere and complexification of the biosphere."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "So there's a principle of increasing assembliness where that goes back to what I was saying at the very beginning about the physics of the possible, that the universe basically gets in this mode of trying to make as much possibilities as possible."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "Now, how often that transition happens that you get the kind of cascading effect that we get in our biosphere, I think we don't know."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "If we did, we would know the likelihood of life in the universe."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "And a lot of people wanna say life is common, but I don't think that we can say that yet till we have the empirical data, which I think you would agree with."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "But then there's this other kind of thought experiment I have which I don't like, but I did have it, which is if life emerges on one planet and you get this real high density of things that can exist on that planet, is it sort of dominating the density of creation that the universe can actually generate?"}, {"time": 4699, "text": "So like if you're thinking about counting entropy, right?"}, {"time": 4701, "text": "Like the universe has a certain amount of stuff in it."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "And then assembly is kind of like an entropic principle."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "It's not entropy."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "But the idea is that now transformations among stuff or the actual physical histories of things now become things that you have to count as far as saying that these things exist and we're increasing the number of things that exist."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "And if you think about that cosmologically, maybe Earth is sucking up all the life potential of the whole universe, I don't know."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "But I haven't."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "How's that, can you expand that a little bit?"}, {"time": 4731, "text": "Why can any one geographical region suck up the creative capacity of the universe?"}, {"time": 4737, "text": "Just like, I know it's a ridiculous thought."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "I don't actually agree with it, but it was just a thought experiment."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "I love that you can have thoughts that you don't like and don't agree with, but you have to think through them anyway."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "The human mind is fascinating."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "Yeah, I think these sort of counterfactual thought experiments are really good when you're trying to build new theories because you have to think through all the consequences."}, {"time": 4759, "text": "And there are people that want to try to account for, say, the degrees of freedom on our planet in cosmological inventories of talking about the entropy of the universe."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "And when we're thinking about cosmological arrow of time and things like that."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "Now, I think those are pretty superficial proposals as they stand now, but assembly would give you a way of counting it."}, {"time": 4778, "text": "And then the question is if there's a certain maximal capacity of the universe's speed of generating stuff, which Lee always has this argument that assembly is about time."}, {"time": 4787, "text": "The universe is generating more states."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "Really what it's generating is more assembly possibilities."}, {"time": 4792, "text": "And then dark energy might be one manifestation of that, that the universe is accelerating its expansion because that makes more physical space."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "And what's happening on our planet is it's accelerating in the expansion of possible things that exist."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "And maybe the universe just has a maximal rate of what it can do to generate things."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "And then if there is a maximal rate, maybe only a certain number of planets can actually do that."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "Or there's a trade off about the pace of growth on certain planets versus others."}, {"time": 4818, "text": "I have a million questions there, but do you have thoughts on?"}, {"time": 4820, "text": "Just a quick, yeah, I'll just say something very quick."}, {"time": 4823, "text": "No, it's good, I think I get it."}, {"time": 4824, "text": "I think I get it."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "So what I want to say is when I mean aliens are everywhere, I mean memories are the prerequisite for aliens via selection and then concentration of selection when selection becomes autonomous."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "So what I would love to do is to build, say a magical telescope that was a memory, a magical one, or a real one, that would be a memory detector to see selection."}, {"time": 4851, "text": "So you could get to exoplanets and say that exoplanet looks like there's lots of selection going on there."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "Maybe there's evolution and maybe there's going to be life."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "So what I'm trying to say is narrow down the regions of space where you say there's definitely evidence of memory as high assembly there or not high assembly, because that would be life, but where it's capable of happening."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "And then that would also help us frame the search for aliens."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "I don't know how likely it is to make the transition to cells and all the other things."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "But I think that we just need to get more data."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "Well, I didn't like the thought experiment because I don't like the idea that if the universe has a maximal limit on the amount it can generate per unit time that our existence is actually precluding the existence of other things."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "Well, I'll just say one thing."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "But I think that's probably true anyway because of the resource limitations."}, {"time": 4895, "text": "So I don't like your thought experiment because I think it's wrong."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "Well, no, no, I do like the thought experiment."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "So what you're trying to say is like, there is a chain of events that goes back that's manifestly culminated with life on Earth."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "And you're not saying that life isn't possible elsewhere."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "You say that there has been these number of things, contingent things that have happened that have allowed life to merge here."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "That doesn't mean that life can't emerge elsewhere, but you're saying that the intersection of events may be concentrated here, right?"}, {"time": 4924, "text": "And I think there's... Not exactly."}, {"time": 4926, "text": "It's more like if you look at, say the causal graphs are fundamental, maybe space is an emergent property, which is consistent with some proposals on quantum gravity, but also how we talk about things in assembly theory."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "Then the universe is causal graphs generating more structure in causal graphs, right?"}, {"time": 4944, "text": "So this is how the universe is unfolding."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "And maybe there's a cap on the rate of generation."}, {"time": 4950, "text": "Like there's only so much stuff that gets made per update of the universe."}, {"time": 4954, "text": "And then if there's a lot of stuff being made in a particular region that happens to look the same locally, spatially, that's an after effect of the fact that the whole causal graph is updating."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "Like it's... Yeah, I don't know that."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "I think that that doesn't work."}, {"time": 4971, "text": "I don't think it works either, but I don't have a good argument in my mind about."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "But I do like the idea of the capacity that universe, cause you've got the number of states."}, {"time": 4977, "text": "Yeah, we can come back to it."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "Let me ask real quick."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "Like why does different like local pockets of the universe start remembering stuff?"}, {"time": 4987, "text": "How does memory emerge exactly?"}, {"time": 4990, "text": "So at the origin of the universe, it was very forgetful."}, {"time": 4996, "text": "That's when the physicists were happiest."}, {"time": 4997, "text": "It was low memory objects, which is like ultra low memory objects, which is what the definition of stuff."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "Okay, so how does memory emerge?"}, {"time": 5009, "text": "How does the temporal stickiness of objects emerge?"}, {"time": 5018, "text": "I'm gonna take a very chemocentric point of view because I can't imagine any other way of doing it."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "You could think of other ways maybe."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "But I would say heterogeneity in matter is where the memory..."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "So you must have enough different ways of rearranging matter for there to be a memory."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "So what that means, if you've got particles colliding in a box, let's just take some elements in a box."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "Those elements can combine in a combinatorial set of ways."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "So there's a combinatorial explosion of the number of molecules or minerals or solid objects, bonds being made."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "Because there's such a large number, the population of different objects that are possible, this goes back to assembly theory where assembly theory, there's four types of universes."}, {"time": 5067, "text": "So you've got basically, and this is what one was up earlier where one universe where you've just got everything is possible."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "So you can take all the atoms and combine them and make everything."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "Then you've got basically what is the assembly combinatorial where you basically have to accrue information in steps."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "Then you've got assembly observed, and then you've got the object assembly going back."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "So what I'm trying to say is like, if you can take atoms and make bonds, let's say you take a nitrogen atom and add it to a carbon atom, you find an amino acid, then you add another carbon atom on in a particular configuration, then another one, all different molecules."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "They all represent different histories."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "So I would say for me right now, the most simple route into life seems to be through recording memories and chemistry."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "But that doesn't mean there can't be other ways and can't be other emergent effects."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "But I think if you can make bonds and lots of different bonds, and those molecules can have a causal effect on the future."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "So imagine a box of atoms, and then you combine those atoms in some way."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "So you make molecule A from load of atoms, and then molecule A can go back to the box and influence the box."}, {"time": 5145, "text": "Then you make A prime or AB or ABC."}, {"time": 5149, "text": "And that process keeps going, and that's where the memories come from, is that heterogeneity in the universe from bonding."}, {"time": 5157, "text": "I don't know if that makes any sense."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "And it's beginning to flourish at the chemistry level."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "So the physicists have no, like not enough."}, {"time": 5171, "text": "They're like desperately begging for more freedom and heterogeneous components to play with."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "What do you think about that, Sarah?"}, {"time": 5184, "text": "I mentioned already, I think it's significant that whatever physics governs life emerges actually in chemistry."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "It's not relevant at the subatomic scale or even at the atomic scale."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "It's in, well, atomic scale because chemistry."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "But like when you get into this combinatorial diversity that you get from combining things on the periodic table, that's when selection actually matters or the fact that some things can exist and others can't exist actually starts to matter."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "So I think of it like you don't study gravity inside the atomic nucleus."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "You study it in terms of large scale structure of the universe or black holes or things like that."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "And whatever we're talking about as physics of information or physics of assembly becomes relevant at a certain scale of reality."}, {"time": 5228, "text": "And the transition that you're talking about, I would think of as just when you get a sufficient density in terms of the assembly space of like the relationship of the overlap and the assembly space, which is like a feature of common memory, there is this transition to assembly dominated physics, whatever that is."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "Oh, like when we're talking about, and we're trying to map out exactly what that transition looks like."}, {"time": 5253, "text": "We're pretty sure of some of its features, but we haven't done all of the... Do you think if you were there in the early universe, you would have been able to predict the emergence of chemistry and biology?"}, {"time": 5263, "text": "And I ask that because at this stage as humans, do you think we can possibly predict the length of memory that might be able to be formed later on in this pocket of the universe?"}, {"time": 5276, "text": "Like how complex is, what is the ceiling of assembly?"}, {"time": 5282, "text": "I think as much time as you have in the past is how much you can predict in the future."}, {"time": 5286, "text": "Because it's actually physical in the system and you have to have enough time for features of that structure to exist."}, {"time": 5295, "text": "Wait, let me push back on that."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "Isn't there somewhere in the universe that's like a shortest path that's been, that stretches all the way to the beginning?"}, {"time": 5304, "text": "That's building some giant monster?"}, {"time": 5306, "text": "Maybe, yeah."}, {"time": 5308, "text": "So you can't predict."}, {"time": 5309, "text": "The universe has as much memory as the largest assembly object in the universe."}, {"time": 5313, "text": "But so you can't predict."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "You can't predict any deeper than that, no."}, {"time": 5318, "text": "So like that, I guess what I'm saying is, like what intuition do you have about complexity living in the world that you'd have today?"}, {"time": 5326, "text": "Right, because you just, you can, I mean I guess how long does it get more fun?"}, {"time": 5334, "text": "Like isn't there gonna be at some point, because there's a heat death in the universe, isn't there going to be a point of the most, of the highest assembly of object, with the highest probability being generated?"}, {"time": 5347, "text": "When is the universe gonna be the most fun, and can we freeze ourselves and then live then?"}, {"time": 5351, "text": "And will you know when you're having the most fun that this is the best time, you're in your prime?"}, {"time": 5356, "text": "Are you going to do what everyone does, which is deny that you're in your prime, and the best years are still ahead of you?"}, {"time": 5363, "text": "What option do you have?"}, {"time": 5366, "text": "I don't, I mean the problem is there's lots of, lots of really interesting features here."}, {"time": 5371, "text": "I just wanna mention one thing that might be, is I do think assembly theory applies all the way back to subatomic particles."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "And I also think that cosmological selection might've been actually, there might've been, I would say it's a really boring bit, but it's really important for a cosmologist that universes have gone through."}, {"time": 5387, "text": "Was it Lee Smolin who proposed this?"}, {"time": 5389, "text": "Maybe that there is this, that basically a universe evolves, you've got the wrong constants, we'll start again."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "And the most productive constants where you can allow particles to form in a certain way, propagate to the next universe, and we go again."}, {"time": 5401, "text": "So actually selection goes all the way back, and there's this cycle of universes."}, {"time": 5404, "text": "And now this universe has been selected because life can occur, and it carries on."}, {"time": 5410, "text": "But I've really butchered that."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "There is a much more."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "So this is some aspect where through the selection process there's parameters that are being fine tuned, and we happen to be living in one where there's some level of fine tuning."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "Is there, given that, can you steel man the case that we humans are alone in the universe?"}, {"time": 5431,

a."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "Yes, it's possible."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "Let's assume."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "Well, we know."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "I mean, it's possible."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "So let me, so okay, so there is a particular set of elements on Earth in a particular ratio, and the right gravitational constant, and the right viscosity, you know, of stuff being able to move around, the right distance from our sun, right number of events where we have a moon, the Earth is rotating."}, {"time": 5470, "text": "The late heavy bombardment produced a lot of, brought in the right stuff."}, {"time": 5476, "text": "And Mars was cooking up, you know, the right molecules first."}, {"time": 5481, "text": "So it was habitable before Earth."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "It was actually doing the combinatorial search."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "And before Mars kind of became uninhabitable, it seeded Earth with the right molecular replicators."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "And there was just the right stuff on Earth, and that's how the miracle of life occurred."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "Although I find I'm very uncomfortable with that because actually, because life came so quickly in the Earth's past."}, {"time": 5510, "text": "But that doesn't mean that life is easy elsewhere."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "It just might mean that, because chemistry is actually not a long term thing."}, {"time": 5520, "text": "Chemistry can happen quickly."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "So maybe going on with the steel manning of the argument to say actually, the fact that life emerged quickly doesn't mean that life is easy."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "It just means that the chemistry was right on Earth, and Earth is very special."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "And that's why there's no life anywhere else in the universe."}, {"time": 5537, "text": "Yeah, so Sarah mentioned this kind of cascading thing."}, {"time": 5541, "text": "So what if that's the reason we're lucky, is that we got to have a rare cascading of, like an accelerating cascading effect in terms of the complexity of things."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "So like, maybe most of the universe is trying to get sticky with the memory, and it's not able to really form it."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "And then we got really lucky in that."}, {"time": 5563, "text": "And it has nothing, like there's a lot of Earth like conditions, let's say, but it's just you really, really have to get lucky on this."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "But I'm doing experiments right now."}, {"time": 5574, "text": "In fact, experiments that Sarah and I are working on, because we have some joint funding for this, where we're seeing that the universe can get sticky really quickly."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "Now, of course, we're being very anthropocentric, we're using laboratory tools, we're using theory, but actually, the phenomena of selection, the process of developing heterogeneity, we can do in the lab."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "We're just seeing the very first hints of it."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "And wouldn't it be great if we can start to pin down a bit more precisely becoming good Bayesianists for this, for the origin

machine."}, {"time": 5645, "text": "Yeah, so, I mean, Lee and I are trying right now to build a vision for a large institute or experimental program, basically, to do this problem."}, {"time": 5657,

to run?"}, {"time": 5674, "text": "What volume of chemical space do you need to explore before you actually see an event?"}, {"time": 5680, "text": "And I like to make an analogy to one of my favorite

would think nothing interesting would emerge, but actually what we're looking at is something that I believe is called glider guns or a glider gun, which is moving objects in this multi cell space

intractable."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "You might as well just build the experiment."}, {"time": 6326, "text": "Because you have, in the physical space, you have all the objects with all the

control how much information you put in, you can try to see how much does that particular trajectory you've set up start generating its own assembly."}, {"time": 6393, "text": "So you know where it starts, and then you want to try to see it take off on its own when you try to pinch it off as much as possible."}, {"time": 6403, "text": "Quick pause, bathroom break."}, {"time": 6407, "text": "And now we're back."}, {"time": 6410, "text": "We talked about the early days of the universe when there was just stuff and no memory, not even causality."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "I think Lee at least

agree, but I was trying to be facetious and I'm trying to make a point because I think that if there is a causal bottleneck through which information can't propagate in principle, then it's very hard to think of an experiment, even in principle, even one that's beyond my mediocre intellect, right?"}, {"time": 6488, "text": "Which is fine."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "I'm happy to accept that."},

can't exist before the Big Bang."}, {"time": 6521, "text": "Yeah, I mean, this goes back to an argument that you might not want to have the argument here."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "I was talking to Sarah earlier today about an argument we had about time a long time ago."}, {"time": 6532, "text": "A long time in time."}, {"time": 6533, "text": "And what I would, it's like, I think there is this thing called time or state creation."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "The universe is creating states and it's outside of space, but they create space."}, {"time": 6542, "text": "So what I mean is you can imagine there are states being created all the time."}, {"time": 6545, "text": "And there is this thing called time."}, {"time": 6548, "text": "Time is a clock, which you can use to measure when things happen, but that doesn't mean, because you can't measure something, that states aren't being created."}, {"time": 6557, "text": "And so you might locally refer to the Big Bang and the Big Bang occurred at some point when those states were there."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "Probably there had to be enough states for the Big Bang to occur."}, {"time": 6570, "text": "And then, but I think that there is something wrong with our conception of how the universe was created and the Big Bang because we don't really get time."}, {"time": 6580, "text": "Because again, I don't want to become boring and sound like a broken record, but time is a real thing."}, {"time": 6588, "text": "And until I can really explain that more elegantly, I'm just gonna get into more trouble."}, {"time": 6594, "text": "Well, we're gonna talk about time because time is a useful measuring device for experiments, but also time is an ideal, okay."}, {"time": 6602, "text": "But let me first ask Sarah, what do you think?"}, {"time": 6605, "text": "Is it a useful question to ask what happened before the Big Bang?"}, {"time": 6608, "text": "Is it a useful question to ask what's outside the universe?"}, {"time": 6614, "text": "So I would think about it as the Big Bang is an event that we reconstructed as probably happening in the past of our universe based on current observational data."}, {"time": 6624, "text": "And so the way I like to think about it is we exist locally in something called the universe."}, {"time": 6633, "text": "So, and going back to like the physics of existence, we exist locally in the space of all things that could exist and we can infer certain properties of the structure of where we exist locally."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "And one of the properties that we've inferred in the past is that there is a thing we call the Big Bang."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "There's some signatures of our local environment that indicate that there was a very low information event that started our universe."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "I think that's actually just an artifact of the structure of the assembly space that when you start losing all the memory in the objects, it looks like what we call a Big Bang."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "So I think it makes sense to talk about where you are locally."}, {"time": 6676, "text": "I think it makes sense to talk about counterfactual possibilities, what could exist outside the universe in the sense that they become part of our reasoning and therefore part of our causal chain of things that we can do."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "So like the multiverse in my mind exists, but it doesn't exist as a multiverse of possible universes."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "It exists as an idea in our minds that allows us to reason about how physics works and then to do physics differently because we reason about it that way."}, {"time": 6702, "text": "So I always like to recenter it on things exist, but they don't always exist like we think they exist."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "So when we're thinking about things outside the universe, they absolutely exist because we're thinking about them, but they don't look like the projections in our minds."}, {"time": 6720, "text": "And something you said just gave an idea to go back to your question."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "If there was, I mean, if something caused the Big Bang, if there was some memory or some artifact of that, then of course, to answer your question, it's worth going back to that because that would imply there is something beyond that barrier, that filter."},

that."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "I think the most interesting things for us to be doing are finding explanations that allow us to do more, like that optimism."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "So I tend to draw the boundary on questions I ask as being scientific ones because I find that that's where the most creative potential is to impact the future trajectory of what we're doing on this planet."},

"text": "It's the time to reset from our limited perspective."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "And so the question is, is it useful to ever study the thing that was forgotten?"}, {"time": 6785, "text": "Or should we focus just on the memories that are still there?"}, {"time": 6788, "text": "Well, the point I was trying to make about the experiment is I was trying to say both things."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "And I think perhaps yes, from the portfolio point of view, if you could then imagine what was forgotten and then work forwards, you will have different consequences."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "So then it becomes testable."}, {"time": 6802, "text": "So as long as we can find tests, then it's definitely worth thinking about."}, {"time": 6806, "text": "What I don't like is when physicists say what happened before the Big Bang and before, before, before, without giving me any credible conjecture about how would we know the difference?"}, {"time": 6818, "text": "But the way you framed it is quite nice."}, {"time": 6820, "text": "It's like, what have we forgotten?"}, {"time": 6823, "text": "Is there room for God in assembly theory?"}, {"time": 6827, "text": "Who's God?"}, {"time": 6829,

"Like does God need?"}, {"time": 6843, "text": "I mean, well, you can go back to like Thomas Aquinas and arguments for the existence of God."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "But I think most of the interesting theological arguments are always about whether something has to exist or there was a first thing that had to exist."}, {"time": 6857, "text": "But I think there's a lot of logical loopholes in those kind of arguments."}, {"time": 6859, "text": "Well, so God here, meaning the machine that creates, that generates the stuff."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "But God, so what I was trying to say earlier is that."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "Isn't that just the universe though?"}, {"time": 6873, "text": "Well, yeah, well, but there's a difference between, I sort of imagine like a black box, like a machine."}, {"time": 6881, "text": "I mean, I would be more comfortable calling that God because it's a machine."}, {"time": 6885, "text": "You go into a room and there's a thing with a button."}, {"time": 6887, "text": "Yeah, I don't like the great programmer in the sky version."}, {"time": 6890, "text": "Yeah, but if it's more kind of like, I don't like to think of, if you look at a cellular automata, if it's the cells and the rules, that doesn't feel like God that generates a bunch of stuff."}, {"time": 6906, "text": "But if there's a machine like that does, that runs the cellular automata and set the rules, then that feels like God."}, {"time": 6915, "text": "That sort of, in terms of terminology."}, {"time": 6919, "text": "So I wonder if there's like a machine that's

that I can't remember the phrase, but something like, I mean, does God exist in our universe?"}, {"time": 6935, "text": "Where does God exist?"}, {"time": 6936, "text": "God at least exists in abstraction in our minds, particularly of people who have religious faith they believe in."}, {"time": 6945, "text": "But let's then take, but you're talking a little bit more about generics, say, well, is there a mechanism beyond the universe you're calling God?"}, {"time": 6951, "text": "I would say God did not exist at the beginning, but he or she does now."}, {"time": 6959, "text": "Because I'm saying the mechanism."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "Well, you don't know that he didn't exist in the beginning."}, {"time": 6963, "text": "So like this could be us in our minds trying to, like just listening to gravitational waves, detecting gravitational waves."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "It's us trying to go back further and further into our memories to try to understand the machines that make up, that make up us."}, {"time": 6983, "text": "And so it's possible that we're trying to grasp at possible kind of what kind of machines could create."}, {"time": 6992, "text": "There's always a

states."}, {"time": 7054, "text": "So what you're saying is if God is a mechanism, so I might actually agree, but then the thing is lots of people see God as more than a mechanism."}, {"time": 7064, "text": "For me, God could be the causal graph in assembly theory that creates all the stuff that the memories we know."}, {"time": 7070, "text": "And the fact that we can even relate to each other is because we have the same, we share that heritage."}, {"time": 7074, "text": "And why we love each other or we like to see God in each other is it's just we know we have a shared existence."}, {"time":

what we would call the living components of the universe."}, {"time": 7161, "text": "So if you wanted to say God is a physically real thing, which you were saying is like an emergent property of our

that is just what the physics of life is."}, {"time": 7179, "text": "Is it possible that we've forgotten much of the mechanisms that created the universe?"}, {"time": 7185, "text": "So like, so

conception of time is probably as fundamental as God because it gave rise to human intelligence and consciousness in which we can have this abstract notion of God."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "So I think that you're maybe talking about God in a very mechanistic, kind of unsophisticated sense, whereas other people say that God is more sophisticated and got all this, you know, feelings and love and, you know, and this abstracting ability."}, {"time": 7287, "text": "So is that what, or do you mean that?"}, {"time": 7289, "text": "Do you mean God as in this conscious entity that decided to flick the universe into existence?"}, {"time": 7296, "text": "Well, one of the features that God would have is the ability to flick the universe into existence."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "I, you know, like Windows 95, I don't know if God is Windows 95 or Windows XP or Windows 10, I don't know the full feature set."}, {"time": 7315, "text": "So at the very least, you have to flick the universe into existence, and then other features might include ability to interact with that universe in interesting ways, and then how do you interact with the universe in interesting ways?"}, {"time": 7331,

there is."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "I mean, like when you have children, you're like one of the magical things of that is you're kind of mini gods."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "I mean, first of all,

in this case, so if you're talking about a general neural network, I mean, in general neural network, you can train it on any sort of data, right, depending on the framework, whether it's like text, or image data, or whatnot."}, {"time": 7525, "text": "And that's fine, but there's no causal structure associated with that data."}, {"time": 7531, "text": "Now just imagine, rather than, you know, let's say we're gonna classify a difference between cat and dog, right?"}, {"time": 7536, "text": "Classic cat and dog neural network."}, {"time": 7568, "text": "Because we need to, because we'll create the entire graph of events, and be able to kind of look at cause and effect across those graphs."}, {"time": 7579, "text": "I'm explaining it really badly, but it's a gene of an idea, and I'm guessing very smart, very rich people in AI are already doing this."}, {"time": 7588, "text": "Trying to not generate cats and dogs, but trying to generate things of high assembly index."}, {"time": 7595, "text": "Yeah, and I think, and also using causal graphs in neural networks, and machine learning, and deep learning, maybe building a new architecture."}, {"time": 7604, "text": "I'm just wondering, is there something we can get out of assembly theory that allows us to rebuild current machine learning architectures to give causation more cheaply?"}, {"time": 7614, "text": "I mean, I don't know if that's what you, we've been inventing this for a little while, but we're trying to finish the theory paper first before we do anything else."}, {"time": 7621, "text": "Yeah, you also wanna have, say, goal directed behavior in neural networks, then assembly theory is a good framework for doing that."}, {"time": 7628, "text": "Daniel's been thinking about that a lot."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "And I think it's a really interesting idea that you can map concepts from how neural networks learn to thinking about goal directed behavior as a learning process."}, {"time": 7640, "text": "That you're learning a specific goal."}, {"time": 7641, "text": "The universe is learning a goal when it generates a particular structure, and that you can map that physical structure in a neural network."}, {"time": 7651, "text": "Well, in a neural network, you're designing the goal."}, {"time": 7654, "text": "In biology, I mean, people are not supposed to use teleological language in biology, which is ridiculous, but, because goals are real things."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "They're just post selected."}, {"time": 7667, "text": "So you can talk about goals after the fact."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "Once a goal emerges in the universe, that physical entity has a goal."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "But Lee and I came up with a test for, like a Turing test for goal directed behavior based on the idea of assembly."}, {"time": 7681, "text": "We have to formalize it still, but I would like to write a paper on it."}, {"time": 7684, "text": "But the basic idea is if you had two systems that were completely equivalent, you know, like in the instantaneous, like physical experimental setup."}, {"time": 7696, "text": "So Lee has to figure out how to do this."}, {"time": 7698, "text": "But there was something that would be different in their future."}, {"time": 7701, "text": "And there was a symmetry breaking you observe in the present based on that possibility of that future outcome."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "Then you could say that that system had some representation of some kind of goal in mind about what it wanted to do in the future."}, {"time": 7713, "text": "And I, so goals are interesting because they don't exist as instantaneous things."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "They exist across time, which is one of the reasons that assembly theories may be more naturally able to account for the existence of goals."}, {"time": 7728, "text": "So goals are, they only exist in time, or they manifest themselves in time through, you said, symmetry breaking."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "So it's almost like, imagine, like if representations in your mind are real, right?"}, {"time": 7745, "text": "And you can imagine future possibilities, but imagine everything else is physically equivalent."}, {"time": 7751, "text": "And the only thing that you actually change your decision based on is what you model as being the future outcome."}, {"time": 7757, "text": "Then somehow that representation in your mind of the future outcome becomes causal to what you're doing now."}, {"time": 7762, "text": "So there's kind of like retro causal effect, but it's not actually retro causal."}, {"time": 7765, "text": "It's just that your assembly space is actually includes those possibilities as part of the structure."}, {"time": 7772, "text": "It's just, you're not observing all the features of the assembly space in the current moment."}, {"time": 7776, "text": "Or the possibilities exist, but they don't become a goal until they're realized."}, {"time": 7782, "text": "So one of the features of assembly space that's super interesting, and it's easier to envision with like Legos, for example, is if you're thinking about an assembly space, you can't observe the entire assembly space in any instant in time."}, {"time": 7794, "text": "So if you imagine a stack of Legos, and you wanna look at the assembly space of a stack of Legos, you have to break the Legos apart, and then you look at all the possible ways of building up the original object."}, {"time": 7805, "text": "So now you have in your mind the goal of building that object, and you have all the possible ways of doing it."}, {"time": 7810, "text": "And those are actual physical features of that object, but that object doesn't always exist."}, {"time": 7814, "text": "What exists is the possibility of generating it."}, {"time": 7817, "text": "And the possibilities are always infinite."}, {"time": 7820, "text": "Well, for that particular object, like it has a well defined assembly space."}, {"time": 7825, "text": "And I guess what I'm saying is that object is the assembly space, but you actually have to unpack that object across time to view that feature of it."}, {"time": 7833, "text": "It's only an observable across time."}, {"time": 7835, "text": "The term goal is such a important and difficult to explain concept, right?"}, {"time": 7841, "text": "Because what you want is a way is like, I think only conscious beings can have conscious goals."}, {"time": 7849, "text": "Everything else is doing selection."}, {"time": 7851, "text": "And but selection does invent goals."}, {"time": 7853, "text": "And in a way that the way that biology reinterprets the past in the present is kind of helped you to understand there was a goal in the past now, right?"}, {"time": 7865, "text": "It's kind of like goals only exist back in time."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "So first of all, only conscious beings can have conscious goals."}, {"time": 7877, "text": "I'm not even gonna touch that one."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "Go for it, come on."}, {"time": 7883, "text": "The line between conscious goals and non conscious goals, exactly."}, {"time": 7888, "text": "And also maybe just on top of that, you said a Turing test for goal directed behavior."}, {"time": 7893, "text": "What does a Turing test potentially look like?"}, {"time": 7899, "text": "So if you've got two objects, we were thinking about this."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "So we actually got some funding to work to go on two teams."}, {"time": 7903, "text": "So I'm trying to do, and part of this is I'm trying to do a bit of theory and Sarah is teaching me a bit of theory and Sarah is trying to design experiments and I'm teaching experiments."}, {"time": 7912, "text": "Cause I think it's really good for us to have that."}, {"time": 7913, "text": "So say, when would a, so that's good."}, {"time": 7918, "text": "I like this, I'm sure we're using Dan Dennett essay."}, {"time": 7922, "text": "Yeah, and I can explain why we wouldn't want to call it a Turing test after, but Dan Dennett."}, {"time": 7925, "text": "So Dan Dennett wrote this really nice essay about herding cats and freewill inflation."}, {"time": 7932, "text": "The title is so brilliant."}, {"time": 7934, "text": "That's the actual title?"}, {"time": 7934, "text": "That's the title, yeah."}, {"time": 7935, "text": "Herding cats and freewill inflation."}, {"time": 7939, "text": "I mean, it's not, maybe not."}, {"time": 7942, "text": "So if you've got a, let's imagine you've got two objects on a hillside, okay?"}, {"time": 7946, "text": "And it just happens to be a snowy hill and let's just say you see an object get rolling down the hill."}, {"time": 7951, "text": "Or you, and the rock rolls down the hill but the start goes to the end."}, {"time": 7956, "text": "How do you know that object's had a goal?"}, {"time": 7958, "text": "Now you unveil the object and you'll see it's actually a skier."}, {"time": 7961, "text": "And the skier starts at the top and goes down the bottom."}, {"time": 7965, "text": "Then you look at the rock."}, {"time": 7966, "text": "Rock rolls down the hill and goes to the bottom."}, {"time": 7968, "text": "How can you tell the difference between the two?"}, {"time": 7971, "text": "So, and what Dan says is like, well, this is clear."}, {"time": 7974, "text": "The skier's in control."}, {"time": 7976, "text": "And because they're adjusting the trajectory, so there's some updating going on."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "Then the only way you could really do that is if you put the skier back to the top of the hill again, they would tend to start roughly in the same space and probably take all that complex set of trajectories and end up pretty much at the same finish point, right?"}, {"time": 7992, "text": "With plus or minus a few meters."}, {"time": 7993, "text": "Whereas if it was just a random rock going down to a random trajectory, that wouldn't happen."}, {"time": 7998, "text": "And so what Sarah and I were kind of doing when we were writing this grant, we were like, we need to somehow instantiate the skier and the rock in an experiment."}, {"time": 8007, "text": "And then say, okay, when does the object, so for an object to have a goal, it has to have an update."}, {"time": 8014, "text": "It has to have some sensing and some kind of, you know, inbuilt actuation to respond to the environment."}, {"time": 8021, "text": "And then we just have to iterate on that."}, {"time": 8024, "text": "And maybe Sarah, you can then fill in the Turing test part."}, {"time": 8027, "text": "Well, yeah, I guess the motivation for me was slightly different."}, {"time": 8030, "text": "So I get really frustrated about conversations about consciousness as most people do."}, {"time": 8034, "text": "You know, a lot of people are, which is not necessarily related to free will directly or to this goal directed behavior."}, {"time": 8041, "text": "But I think there's a whole set of bundled and related topics here."}, {"time": 8044, "text": "But I think for me, I was, you know, everybody's always interested in explaining intrinsic experience and quantifying intrinsic experience."}, {"time": 8052, "text": "And there's all sorts of problems with that because you can never actually be another physical system."}, {"time": 8057, "text": "So you can't know what it's like to be another physical system."}, {"time": 8060, "text": "So I always thought there must be some way of getting at this problem about if an agent or an entity is conscious or at least has internal representations and those are real physical things, that it must have causal consequences."}, {"time": 8074, "text": "So the way I would ask the question of consciousness is not, you know, what is it like intrinsically?"}, {"time": 8080, "text": "But if things have intrinsic experience, is there any observable difference from the outside about the kind of causation that that physical system would enact in?"}, {"time": 8090, "text": "And for me, the most interesting thing that humans do is have imagination."}, {"time": 8093, "text": "So like we can imagine rockets centuries before we build them."}, {"time": 8097, "text": "They've become real physical things because we imagine them."}, {"time": 8100, "text": "And people might disentangle that from conscious experience, but I think a lot of the sort of imagination we do is actually a conscious process."}, {"time": 8106, "text": "So then this becomes a question of if I were observing systems and I said, one had an internal representation, which is slightly different than a conscious experience, obviously."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "So I'm entangling some concepts, but it's a loose set of thought experiments."}, {"time": 8122, "text": "Then how, and I set them up in a physically equivalent situation."}, {"time": 8128, "text": "Would it be the case that there would be experimental observables associated with it?"}, {"time": 8134, "text": "And that became the idea of trying to actually measure for internal representation and conscious."}, {"time": 8140, "text": "So Turing basically didn't wanna do that."}, {"time": 8142, "text": "You just wanted the machine that could emulate and trick you into having the behavior, but never dealt with the internal experience because he didn't know how to do that."}, {"time": 8151, "text": "And I guess I was wondering, is there a way to set up the experiment where you could actually test for that?"}, {"time": 8157, "text": "For imagination that led to the thing."}, {"time": 8160, "text": "That there was something internal going on, some kind of inner world, as people say, or you could say, it actually is an agent, it's making decisions, it has an internal representation."}, {"time": 8173, "text": "And whether you say that's experience or not is a different thing, but at least the feature that there's some abstraction it's doing that's not obvious from looking at the physical substrates."}, {"time": 8183, "text": "Do you think it's possible to do that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 8185, "text": "One of the compelling things about the Turing test is that defining intelligence, defining any complicated concept as a thing like observing it from the surface and not caring about what's going on deep inside because how do you know?"}, {"time": 8203, "text": "So the idea is exactly that."}, {"time": 8231, "text": "But then what we wanna try and do is train the oil droplets to be like crabs, give them an internal representation, give them the ability to integrate information from the environment so they remember the past, are in the present, and can imagine a future."}, {"time": 8251, "text": "And in a very limited way, their kind of game engine, their limited simulation of the world allows them to then make a decision."}, {"time": 8258, "text": "They're objects across time."}, {"time":

of the essay in assembly theory makes complete sense."}, {"time": 8337, "text": "Because you need an expanding universe in assembly theory to create novelty that you search for, that then when you

the expansion of the universe look like?"}, {"time": 8362, "text": "Why does the expansion of the universe give you more possibilities of novelty and cool stuff?"}, {"time": 8370, "text": "So for me,

only have the ability to store one bit of information, so then you can't do very much."}, {"time": 8383, "text": "So what the universe has been doing since forever, it's been creating more, it's been increasing the size of its RAM, okay?"}, {"time": 8393, "text": "So it's like one megabyte, two megabyte, three megabyte, four megabytes, all the way up."}, {"time": 8397, "text": "And so the more RAM

about the ordering of things."}, {"time": 8556, "text": "So that's the causal graph part."}, {"time": 8558, "text": "And so then the fundamental structure of the universe is that there is a certain

there's a lot."}, {"time": 9060, "text": "I think what I'm interested in as far as the phenomena of free will is, do we have individual autonomy and agency?"}, {"time": 9070, "text": "And when I do

are your causal history and there's some determinism from that past, but there's also room for creativity."}, {"time": 9124, "text": "And I think it's actually necessary that something like free will

the best way to."}, {"time": 9215, "text": "It's really interesting, like what is imagination and what role does it play in the human experience, in the experience of any agent?"}, {"time": 9224,

the transition to life being the universe acquiring memory, and life does something really interesting."}, {"time": 9236, "text": "You just think about biology generally."}, {"time": 9238, "text": "It remembers states of the past to adapt to things that happen in the future."}, {"time": 9241, "text": "So the longer life has evolved on this planet, the deeper that past is, the more memory we have,

the universe has existed in before, it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed, and we can actually make them come into existence."}, {"time": 9262, "text": "And I think that's the most unique feature about the transition to whatever we are from what life on this planet has been doing for the last four billion years."}, {"time": 9272, "text": "And I think it's deeply related to the phenomenon we call consciousness."}, {"time": 9274, "text": "Yeah, I was gonna, I mean, just agree with that."}, {"time": 9276, "text": "I think that consciousness is the ability to generate those counterfactuals."}, {"time": 9280, "text": "Now, whether you can say, you know, are there degrees of consciousness?"}, {"time": 9283, "text": "I mean, I'm sorry, panpsychist, but electrons don't have counterfactuals, although they do have some kind of, they are able to search a space and pathways."}, {"time": 9293, "text": "But I think that there is a very concrete, or concrete, there's a very specific property that humans have, and I don't know if it's unique to humans."}, {"time": 9305, "text": "I mean, maybe dogs can do it, and birds can do it, right?"}, {"time": 9309, "text": "And where

think that, although I've changed my view a bit, because there's some really interesting physicists out there who talks about how the measurement problem in Newtonian space, but I don't want to go

will."}, {"time": 9382, "text": "And I'm like, your belief system's broken here, right?"}, {"time": 9386, "text": "Because you're demanding free will in a deterministic universe."}, {"time": 9392,

that structure, it's like the same idea as like an experiment being an example of life, right?"}, {"time": 10391, "text": "That's a really abstract and subtle concept."}, {"time": 10393, "text": "And I guess what I'm saying is life is information propagating through matter."}, {"time": 10398, "text": "So once you start having things interacting, they in some sense co mingle and they become part of

then, the more interesting question is, are there two distinct origins events?"}, {"time": 10419, "text": "And I still think that there's reasons that on a single planet, you would have one origins

10528, "text": "So the structure across time is two examples of life become one example of life because life is the entire structure across time."}, {"time": 10536, "text": "Right, but there could be a lot of variation within."}, {"time": 10539, "text": "Yeah, so the question we're all interested in is how many independent origins of a complexifying causal chain are there in the universe?"},

things."}, {"time": 10585, "text": "Let's go all the way back before origin of life."}, {"time": 10587, "text": "Origin of life."}, {"time": 10590, "text": "Chemistry emerges, so there's all these, I

can speciate."}, {"time": 10620, "text": "And I was trying to, and I think what Sarah said was, convinced me of, because I was like, no, we're gonna have lots of different chemistry, shadow biosphere

am not from Karl Stasi, you know, I'm from the government."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "Thank you for pointing that out."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "And then he asked this question, he says, can you imagine to one day work for the government?"}, {"time": 2951, "text": "And so I gave a pretty clever answer."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "I said, yes, but not as a chemist."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "So I answered the question that he didn't ask."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "I helped him out."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "So we made an arrangement to meet for lunch, which in Germany is the main meal at

wasn't ready."}, {"time": 10859, "text": "So I just ignored this thing, I mean, I couldn't ignore it, but I went on to work, got on the A train, went to work, and then went to my cubicle and stared at

the Soviet Union was gone."}, {"time": 11565, "text": "So he showed up at the US embassy in Moscow and told him what he had and it was on a weekend and apparently there was a junior person in charge

of the Baltic republics and contacted MI6 and they said, come on in, old fellow, have a cup of tea."}, {"time": 11599, "text": "And so they managed to get this stuff out of the Dacha and get it to

wasn't illegal, that I was still living there, they didn't know whether I was active, inactive and the other thing that they knew that I was a really, really well trained agent because I was still there, right."}, {"time": 11655, "text": "So they took, I think, almost three years to investigate me, watch me from a distance because if I was still active, I would have found out that somebody is investigating me."}, {"time": 11670, "text": "So you started being less and less active in terms of... Oh, I stopped completely."}, {"time": 11674, "text": "What I mean is... Oh, surveillance detection."}, {"time": 11676, "text": "Yes, surveillance detection."}, {"time": 11677, "text": "After three months, I stopped altogether."}, {"time": 11681, "text": "Yeah, good point."}, {"time": 11682, "text": "And FBI is still very careful."}, {"time": 11684, "text": "They were very careful."}, {"time": 11685, "text": "They pretty much watched me and at one point, I had a house in the country with one neighbor, at one point that house was for sale, so the FBI bought it and they put a couple of agents there and just didn't keep a closer eye on me."}, {"time": 11701,

along very well."}, {"time": 11724, "text": "There was a lot of friction and she was constantly complaining about things and I got sick and tired of it and one day we had an argument in the kitchen

her."}, {"time": 11752, "text": "If something doesn't quite fit, it is not because I don't love the both of them, Chelsea and Penelope."}, {"time": 11759, "text": "So when I said that, the listening device was active, so the FBI was hearing my confession."}, {"time": 11768, "text": "I was once a KGB agent, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and I quit and then stayed here because of you and Chelsea and that also made it clear to the FBI that I wasn't active anymore."}, {"time": 11786, "text": "They had both of that."}, {"time": 11787, "text": "So now they knew an attempt to turn me would have been useless because you turned somebody who was active, but they figured there was enough reason to treat me nicely because they figured I had a lot of information that was as aged as it was, but it was still important for the FBI to get to know."}, {"time": 11816, "text": "And so one day, it was a Friday evening, I'm driving back home from the office and I'm being stopped by a state police."},

right?"}, {"time": 11866, "text": "Routine traffic stop."}, {"time": 11867, "text": "Yeah, I did it, no problem."}, {"time": 11869, "text": "And then again, somebody came from the right, came into my view and he flipped his ID and he said, FBI, we would like to have a talk with you."}, {"time": 11882, "text": "This is my now friend, Joe Riley, who actually is the, he's the godfather of Trinity and my last child."}, {"time": 11891, "text": "Anyway, he told me later that when I heard that phrase, all the blood left my face, I became totally white."}, {"time": 11904, "text": "But I recovered very quickly and he said it himself, so they took me to a vehicle and there was another agent in the vehicle and he had a gun strapped to his ankle, so it was pretty real."}, {"time": 11922, "text": "First question I had, so am I under arrest?"}, {"time": 11924, "text": "And the answer was no."}, {"time": 11927, "text": "And then my instinct kicked in and my ability to operate very well under high pressure situations."}, {"time": 11937, "text": "And I asked him, so what took you so long?"}, {"time": 11941, "text": "You know, the intent of that was to defuse any kind of tension."}, {"time": 11952, "text": "And I saw a smile."}, {"time": 11955, "text": "Instant friends."}, {"time": 11956, "text": "Yeah, I knew that I had to make them like me and I'm, I think by now I know I'm a pretty likable person."}, {"time": 11971, "text": "And I, when they took me to a motel, which they had rented, there was two wings at a right angle, they bought all the rooms in one wing and they had a guard at each end of that wing and they took me in the middle and there were some props there, some binders with labels and I immediately thought, this is pretty silly because what I noticed that the labels all referred back to my early years."}, {"time": 12007, "text": "I knew that they didn't know much else."}, {"time": 12010, "text": "So I told Joe that afterwards and that was not a great idea, but anyway."}, {"time": 12019, "text": "But I volunteered."}, {"time": 12020, "text": "I made the following statement before we even started the interview."}, {"time": 12024, "text": "I said, I know there's only one way for me to, and my family, to have a chance to get through here without much damages if I'm completely 100% cooperative and it's my intent to do exactly that."}, {"time": 12040,

already that they would let me go."}, {"time": 12051, "text": "And after two hours they let me go."}, {"time": 12055, "text": "But they had the area covered with a whole bunch of people."}, {"time": 12060, "text": "And the head of that team talked to me and he said, if you think of running, we got every intersection in this area covered."}, {"time": 12070, "text": "I didn't say anything, but you know, I had no thought of running."}, {"time": 12076, "text": "So and that was the beginning of another phase of my life where I was cooperating with the FBI for quite a while and living still undercover for several years until I had real good documentation and became an American citizen seven years ago."}, {"time": 12093, "text": "From today, seven years ago."}, {"time": 12096, "text": "So recently."}, {"time": 12099, "text": "Quite recent."}, {"time": 12100, "text": "The hypocrisy took a long time to figure out how to make me real and also not put me in these witness protection program, you know, to keep my name and then just, you know, make everything like official."}, {"time": 12117, "text": "So for instance, I had to change my birth year simply because if I, Jack Barsky was born in 1944, if I kept 1944, the FBI would have helped me commit a crime because I would have collected social security four years sooner."}, {"time": 12135, "text": "So anyway, yes, it took quite a while."}, {"time": 12140, "text": "And when I finally got the call from the office of Homeland Security, the lady says, this is agent so and so from Homeland Security, can you come into the

think."}, {"time": 9260, "text": "But it's not so much, I mean, photosynthesis is part of the problem."}, {"time": 9265, "text": "It's a difficult thing to do."}, {"time": 9266, "text": "Again, we

origin that explored this whole domain over there that the bacteria had never gone into."}, {"time": 9298, "text": "So that kind of says that the reason that it only happened once is probably because it's difficult, because the wiring is difficult."}, {"time": 9305, "text": "But then it happened at least 2.2 billion years ago, right before the GOE, maybe as long as 3 billion years ago, when there

being washed into the oceans, which sounds incredibly parochial."}, {"time": 9562, "text": "But the issue is, I mean, what the data is showing, we can track roughly how oxygen was going into the atmosphere from carbon isotopes."}, {"time": 9575, "text": "So there's two main isotopes of carbon that we need to think about here."}, {"time": 9578, "text": "One is carbon 12, 99% of carbon is carbon 12."}, {"time": 9581, "text": "And then 1% of carbon is carbon 13, which is a stable isotope."}, {"time": 9586, "text": "And then there's carbon 14, which is a trivial radioactive, it's trivial in amount."}, {"time": 9590, "text": "So carbon 13 is 1%."}, {"time": 9593, "text": "And life and enzymes generally, you can think of carbon atoms as little balls bouncing around, ping pong balls bouncing around."}, {"time": 9601, "text": "Carbon 12 moves a little bit faster than carbon 13 because it's lighter and it's more likely to encounter an enzyme."}, {"time": 9608, "text": "And so it's more likely to be fixed into organic matter."}, {"time": 9611, "text": "And so organic matter is enriched."}, {"time": 9613, "text": "And this is just an observation."}, {"time": 9614, "text": "It's enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent compared to carbon 13, relative to what you would expect if it was just equal."}, {"time": 9621, "text": "And if you then bury organic matter as coal or oil or whatever it may be, then it's no longer oxidized."}, {"time": 9631, "text": "So some oxygen remains leftover in the atmosphere."}, {"time": 9635, "text": "And that's how oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere."}, {"time": 9637, "text": "And you can work out historically how much oxygen there must've been in the atmosphere by how much carbon was being buried."}, {"time": 9643, "text": "And you think, well, how can we possibly know how much carbon was being buried?"}, {"time": 9646, "text": "And the answer is, well, if you're burying carbon 12, what you're leaving behind is more carbon 13 in the oceans and that precipitates out into limestone."}, {"time": 9654, "text": "So you can look at limestones over these ages and work out what's the carbon 13 signal."}, {"time": 9659, "text": "And that gives you a kind of a feedback on what the oxygen content."}, {"time": 9663, "text": "Right before the Cambrian explosion, there was what's called a negative isotope anomaly excursion, which is basically the carbon 13 goes down by a massive amount and then back up again 10 million years later."}, {"time": 9675, "text": "And what that seems to be saying is the amount of carbon 12 in the oceans was disappearing, which is to say it was being oxidized."}, {"time": 9690, "text": "And if it's being oxidized, it's consuming oxygen."}, {"time": 9693, "text": "And that should, so a big carbon 13 signal says the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is really going down, which means there's much more carbon 12 being taken out and being oxidized."}, {"time": 9704, "text": "Sorry, this is getting too complex, but."}, {"time": 9706, "text": "Well, it's a good way to estimate the amount of oxygen."}, {"time": 9709, "text": "If you calculate the amount of oxygen based on the assumption that all this carbon 12 that's being taken out is being oxidized by oxygen, the answer is all the oxygen in the atmosphere gets stripped out, there is none left."}, {"time": 9721, "text": "And yet the rest of the geological indicators say, no, there's oxygen in the atmosphere."}, {"time": 9726, "text": "So it's a kind of a paradox."}, {"time": 9727, "text": "And the only way to explain this paradox just on mass balance of how much stuff is in the air, how much stuff is in the oceans and so on, is to assume that oxygen was not the oxygen, it was sulfate."}, {"time": 9739, "text": "Sulfate was being washed into the oceans."}, {"time": 9742, "text": "It's used as an electron acceptor by sulfate reducing bacteria, just as we use oxygen as an electron acceptor."}, {"time": 9748, "text": "So they pass their electrons to sulfate instead of oxygen."}, {"time": 9751, "text": "Bacteria did."}, {"time": 9754, "text": "So these are bacteria."}, {"time": 9756, "text": "So they're oxidizing carbon, organic carbon with sulfate, passing the electrons onto sulfate, that reacts with iron to form iron pyrite or fool's gold, sinks down to the bottom, gets buried out of the system."}, {"time": 9771, "text": "And this can account for the mass balance."}, {"time": 9773, "text": "So why does it matter?"}, {"time": 9775, "text": "It matters because what it says is there was a chance event, tectonically there was a lot of sulfate sitting on land as some kind of mineral."}, {"time": 9786, "text": "So calcium sulfate minerals, for example, are evaporitic."}, {"time": 9791, "text": "And because there happened to be some continental collisions, mountain building, the sulfate was pushed up the side of a mountain and happened to get washed into the ocean."}, {"time": 9804, "text": "Yeah, so I wonder how many happy accidents like that are possible."}, {"time": 9807, "text": "Statistically, it's really hard."}, {"time": 9808, "text": "Maybe you can rule that in statistically, but this is the course of life on earth."}, {"time": 9814, "text": "Without all that sulfate being raised up, this Cambrian explosion almost certainly would not have happened."}, {"time": 9819, "text":

several ways."}, {"time": 9831, "text": "So folks who challenge the validity of the theory of evolution will give us an example."}, {"time": 9840, "text": "Now I'm not well studied in this, but will give us an example of the Cambrian explosion as like, this thing is weird."}, {"time": 9847, "text": "Oh, it is weird, yeah."}, {"time": 9848, "text": "So the question I would have is what's the biggest mystery or gap in understanding about evolution?"}, {"time": 9859, "text": "Is it the Cambrian explosion?"}, {"time": 9861, "text": "And if so, what's our best understanding of how to explain, first of all, what is it?"}, {"time": 9868, "text": "In my understanding, in the short amount of time, maybe 10 million years, 100 million years, something like that, a huge number of animals, a variety, diversity of animals were created."}, {"time": 9879, "text": "Anyway, there's like five questions in there."}, {"time": 9881, "text": "Is that the biggest mystery?"}, {"time": 9883, "text": "No, I don't think it's a particularly big mystery really anymore."}, {"time": 9888, "text": "There are still mysteries about why then."}, {"time": 9891, "text": "And I've just said sulfate being washed into the oceans is one."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "It needs oxygen and oxygen levels rose around that time."}, {"time": 9899, "text": "So probably before that, they weren't high enough for animals."}, {"time": 9902, "text": "What we're seeing with the Cambrian explosion is the beginning of predators and prey relationships."}, {"time": 9907, "text": "We're seeing modern ecosystems and we're seeing arms races and we're seeing the full creativity of evolution unleashed."}, {"time": 9920, "text": "So I talked about the boring billion, nothing happens for one and a half billion years, one and a half billion years."}, {"time": 9929, "text": "The assumption, and this is completely wrong, this assumption, is then that evolution works really slowly and that you need billions of years to affect some small change and then another billion years to do something else."}, {"time": 9944, "text": "Evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it stays that way for tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years."}, {"time": 9950, "text": "And Steven Jay Gould used to argue this, he called it punctuated equilibrium, but he was doing it to do with animals and to do with the last 500 million years or so, where it's much less obvious than if you think about the entire planetary history."}, {"time": 9962, "text": "And then you realize that the first two billion years was bacteria only."}, {"time": 9966, "text": "You have the origin of life, two billion years of just bacteria, oxygen photosynthesis arising here."}, {"time": 9971, "text": "Then you have a global catastrophe, snowball earths and great oxidation event and then another billion years of nothing happening and then some period of upheavals and then another snowball earth and then suddenly you see the Cambrian explosion."}, {"time": 9983, "text": "This is long periods of stasis where the world is in a stable state and is not geared towards increasing complexity."}, {"time": 9991, "text": "It's just everything is in balance."}, {"time": 9993, "text": "And only when you have a catastrophic level, global level problem like a snowball earth, it forces everything out of balance and there's a tipping point and you end up somewhere else."}, {"time": 10002, "text": "Now, the idea that evolution is slow is wrong."}, {"time": 10008, "text": "It can be incredibly fast."}, {"time": 10010, "text": "And I

one kind of tube into a tube with nobbles on it into a tube with arms on it and then multiple arms and then at one end is the head where it starts out as a swelling."}, {"time": 10031, "text": "It's not difficult intellectually to understand how these things can happen."}, {"time": 10038, "text": "It boggles the mind that it can happen so quickly, but we're used to human timescales."}, {"time": 10044, "text": "And what we need to talk about is generations of things that live for a year in the ocean."}, {"time": 10050, "text": "And then a million years is a million generations."}, {"time": 10053, "text": "And the amount of change that you can do, it can affect in that period of time is enormous."}, {"time": 10058, "text": "And we're dealing with large populations of things where selection is sensitive to pretty small changes and can, so again, as soon as you throw in the competition of predators and prey and you're ramping up the scale of evolution, it's not very surprising

you guys speak Italian or no?"}, {"time": 525, "text": "Not Italian, but we studied French and Spanish in school."}, {"time": 529, "text": "And Romanian."}, {"time": 530, "text": "I feel like every country calls their language a romance language."}, {"time": 533, "text": "But it's Romanian, French, Spanish, Portuguese."}, {"time": 538, "text": "And I think there was one more that was like this dialect, but those are considered the romance languages."}, {"time": 543, "text": "Okay, so where would you put Italian?"}, {"time": 545, "text": "I think we got yelled at so much in Italian that it's not gonna be a love word."}, {"time": 550, "text": "So it wasn't working."}, {"time": 551, "text": "It's on the bottom of the list cause people did not use it nicely to us."}, {"time": 555, "text": "But I always really liked how French sounds."}, {"time": 559, "text": "I think something about it where maybe Spanish actually sounds nicer to the ears, but French has more character and it feels more sultry."}, {"time": 567, "text": "So I like French."}, {"time": 569, "text": "Yeah, that was my answer too."}, {"time": 571, "text": "Sultry, okay."}, {"time": 573, "text": "I feel like French, in France, I feel like I'm always being judged."}, {"time": 579, "text": "Like they're better than me."}, {"time": 580, "text": "That's what French."}, {"time": 581, "text": "They are better than us."}, {"time": 583, "text": "It's just so true."}, {"time": 585, "text": "Which is why I long to belong to that."}, {"time": 590, "text": "I like the British accent."}, {"time": 591, "text": "The British accent?"}, {"time": 593, "text": "Actually, one thing we did on our Italian trip is we just picked up British accents for the entire trip for fun."}, {"time": 600, "text": "And we forgot we were doing them to the point where we talked to British people and they'd ask us, why are you talking like that?"}, {"time": 605, "text": "We just couldn't stop."}, {"time": 607, "text": "I did feel much more elegant and mature."}, {"time": 611, "text": "People like, I don't know if they felt the same way about us, but it was more of the confidence."}, {"time": 616, "text": "You do feel like you're more poised for sure."}, {"time": 620, "text": "So how'd you guys get into chess?"}, {"time": 622, "text": "When did you first, let's say, when did you first fall in love with chess?"}, {"time": 628, "text": "So we both started playing when we were pretty young, around six years old."}, {"time": 632, "text": "That's when our dad taught us."}, {"time": 633, "text": "And I enjoyed playing chess because I had good results early on, but a lot of it was being pushed from my dad to play chess."}, {"time": 642, "text": "And I only really started loving it when we moved from Canada and we started moving a lot and chess was the one stable thing that I had."}, {"time": 650, "text": "And it was also where all of my friends were."}, {"time": 653, "text": "So it was kind of that foundational thing for me."}, {"time": 657, "text": "And that's when I started studying chess very intensely."}, {"time": 659, "text": "And when I started putting in the hours out of my own will and not because I was being pushed by my dad, that's when I started really loving it."}, {"time": 665, "text": "And I even wanted to take time off college to just focus on chess."}, {"time": 669, "text": "So training and competing?"}, {"time": 671, "text": "Training and competing, yeah."}, {"time": 672, "text": "It was when I was doing it for myself that I started getting my best results."}, {"time": 677, "text": "And actually enjoying the thing."}, {"time": 679, "text": "And really enjoying it, yeah."}, {"time": 681, "text": "I would spend summer vacations studying for tournaments and my mom would come and say, \"'You need to make friends, go leave the house.\""}, {"time": 687, "text": "And I'd be like, no, I need to play chess."}, {"time": 689, "text": "And I remember those moments."}, {"time": 691, "text": "That you rebelled by playing chess, that's awesome."}, {"time": 695, "text": "How did you get into it?"}, {"time": 696, "text": "Yeah, my experience with loving in high school is very opposite from Alex's, but right, my sister was playing and my dad taught me when I was also six."}, {"time": 704, "text": "Andrea was cool in high school, unlike me."}, {"time": 706, "text": "You were."}, {"time": 707, "text": "I wouldn't say cool, I'd say more balanced and I was interested in other hobbies."}, {"time": 711, "text": "In my childhood, if I ever really did love chess, there's certainly moments about traveling and being together with my family and spending those moments together, but those are more the social and the experiences."}, {"time": 722, "text": "But funny enough, I think my happiest moment where I really played the game for my own enjoyment was probably my most recent tournament."}, {"time": 731, "text": "Because this was after, obviously, we've been streaming and I'm no longer in high school, but when I was in school, I was always playing for college and for the results, trying to build a resume."}, {"time": 742, "text": "So I was too stressed out about the pressure to really enjoy the game."}, {"time": 745, "text": "Whereas when I just played my first tournament, so it was after a two year break because of the pandemic and it was also all live on Twitch, so there was some pressure, but it was the first time that I was really eager to study for the game, sitting and focusing since we've been streaming and not getting distracted by something else."}, {"time": 764, "text": "In years, like I said."}, {"time": 766, "text": "And the tournament experience, I hit my highest rating and it was my best tournament ever."}, {"time": 770, "text": "And I think most of that is because it came from my own enjoyment."}, {"time": 774, "text": "So you didn't enjoy the domination?"}, {"time": 776, "text": "Because I think you did really well, right?"}, {"time": 778, "text": "This is like a couple months ago?"}, {"time": 780, "text": "Oh yeah, yeah, the tournament."}, {"time": 781, "text": "Well, of course, I think the results came from enjoying the tournament."}, {"time": 784, "text": "Because I would be in high school studying triple the amount of time, like six hours every day compared to this tournament, I didn't even prepare for it."}, {"time": 792, "text": "And for three years, I wouldn't be able to pass one rating, whereas in this one tournament, I passed it by like 70 points without even any preparation."}, {"time": 799, "text": "So it was, I think, as soon as you stopped worrying about the competitions, when the games get much better."}, {"time": 804, "text": "What does it mean to pass a rating?"}, {"time": 806, "text": "So I was stuck at 1900."}, {"time": 808, "text": "1900 is 100 points off of expert."}, {"time": 812, "text": "Usually when you reach 2000, you're considered an expert, which is the rating Andrea was going for."}, {"time": 816, "text": "Okay, expert, that's a technical term or that's like a talk and trash term?"}, {"time": 820, "text": "It's more of a colloquial term where if somebody is around a 2000 and you're playing them in a tournament, they won't have the actual title next to their name, but you always say, I'm playing an expert."}, {"time": 829, "text": "What about like the more official things like master?"}, {"time": 832, "text": "Does that have to do with the rating or something else?"}, {"time": 833, "text": "Yeah, so national master in the US is when you're 2200."}, {"time": 837, "text": "Okay, and what's international master?"}, {"time": 839, "text": "International master is based off of a different system, the FIDE system, which is international."}, {"time": 844, "text": "To be an international master, it's 2400 and you have to have three international master norms."}, {"time": 852, "text": "Yeah, I think Magnus said he's a 28, six something."}, {"time": 856, "text": "That was, yeah."}, {"time": 857, "text": "And then he said, that's pretty decent."}, {"time": 860, "text": "Well, he always talks a lot about that."}, {"time": 861, "text": "But see the thing is, I think what he meant is that's a decent rating because it accurately captures his actual level."}, {"time": 869, "text": "So it's not overinflated or underinflated and so on."}, {"time": 872, "text": "And so the discussion there was how do you get to, can a human being get to 2900?"}, {"time": 878, "text": "And then he says, because my current rating is pretty decent at representing my skill level, it's gonna be a long road to actually get there."}, {"time": 886, "text": "Because it's like, so you have to beat people at your same level, that's how the number increases."}, {"time": 892, "text": "And you beat a bunch of people in the tournament, right?"}, {"time": 894, "text": "That are higher than your luck."}, {"time": 895, "text": "I did, I got very lucky."}, {"time": 896, "text": "I was playing, I was really nervous because my category was like 200 points above my rating."}, {"time": 901, "text": "And of course, I was very rusty and I didn't play in a tournament in a while, but it went pretty well."}, {"time": 907, "text": "Do you feel the pressure when you're actually recording it, like the streaming?"}, {"time": 911, "text": "It was definitely, so before every round I was vlogging and I was doing meet and greets and doing other things for the livestream."}, {"time": 918, "text": "Yeah, I saw you do a meet and greet."}, {"time": 921, "text": "You didn't know what the hell you were doing, it's great."}, {"time": 924, "text": "Like what am I, how do I do this?"}, {"time": 925, "text": "Yeah, I see."}, {"time": 927, "text": "It was actually really wholesome."}, {"time": 929, "text": "The beginning was very silly because I was just not expecting that it was gonna be more of a seminar."}, {"time": 935, "text": "I thought it was like, oh, you pose and take pictures, but they actually asked really nice, meaningful questions, but unfortunately it's bad for YouTube retention and we cut them all out, so."}, {"time": 943, "text": "Bad for YouTube?"}, {"time": 945, "text": "The good long form conversation."}, {"time": 947, "text": "So it was like questions, Q and A type of thing."}, {"time": 948, "text": "Exactly, you have to have very fast paced for YouTube and that seminar was not fast paced."}, {"time": 954, "text": "Okay, well, not everything in life needs to be on YouTube, right?"}, {"time": 957, "text": "There's like two parallel things, stuff that's fun for YouTube."}, {"time": 960, "text": "Yes, one day we'll post that Q and A. Yeah, when you guys like, when you become like ultra famous, you're currently just regular famous."}, {"time": 968, "text": "And then they'll appreciate the long, slow content, yes."}, {"time": 972, "text": "And that, the YouTube aspect, the creation aspect, does that add to the fun, ultimately, of the chess, of like your love of chess?"}, {"time": 980, "text": "Oh, for the love of chess in general or just for competing in that one tournament?"}, {"time": 984, "text": "No, love of chess in general."}, {"time": 985, "text": "I think you said that for competing for that tournament is adding pressure."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "So I would say Twitch was the thing that really changed how I approached the game."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "I think with some YouTubers, there's a pressure to be almost somebody else."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "You create a persona and you're stuck in that persona."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "I think I'm too much of a boomer to know what the hell Twitch is anyway, but it feels like when you're actually live streaming, you can't help but be who you really are."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "I think it's, oh, well, I think when you're live streaming and I've talked to a lot of other streamers about this, you kind of just over exaggerate one side of your personality."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "And of course, it's kind of like being like on all the time."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "Like you're trying to be more entertaining and sometimes you're being silly at moments or more, you take what character traits like people know you for."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And for me, one is being like ADHD and the younger sibling who's very energetic and causes trouble, even though sometimes it's a little switch."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "Yeah, I'm sure you cause trouble just for the camera."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "And also there's things that you are really interested in about what you do."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Like I love competitive chess where I could sit and really think about it, but I know that that is not gonna be as entertaining for stream."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "I know that's not gonna be as entertaining for YouTube."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "So you kind of have to take what you like, but then really adapt it for whatever the format is."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And sometimes that feels inauthentic, but other times it just feels like repackaging what you love for people in a more general audience to enjoy."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "Do you feel like it's a trap a little bit as you evolve?"}, {"time": 1131, "text": "Like you're trapped in?"}, {"time": 1133, "text": "Oh, I think social media, oh, sorry, go ahead."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Social media in general is a trap of that kind?"}, {"time": 1139, "text": "Well, so we've been trying to switch to learn how to make YouTube videos recently."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "And so much of learning YouTube school is kind of the beastification of content where you try to get to the point of the video within like the first 10 seconds to not lose people."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "The beastificate, you mean like Mr."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "Beast?"}, {"time": 1158, "text": "Yeah, where it's so fast paced, there's a reason to wait, there's high stakes."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "And everything is created to keep people watching the video and keep people on the platform."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And in some ways it is a trap because it's harder to do the kind of content you like because you really have to squeeze it to be like, okay, well, do we have a good thumbnail for this?"}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Do we have a good title for this?"}, {"time": 1178, "text": "And that's something that we're trying to figure out how to keep true to what we wanna do."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "Yeah, see, the way I think about it is, yeah, there's a lot of stuff you can create and yeah, the Mr. Beastification process."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "But also I think about what are the videos, conversations or things I will create in this life that will be the best thing I do."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "And I try not to do things in my life that will prevent me from getting there."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "I feel like if you're always focusing on doing kind of, optimizing the thumbnail in the 10 seconds and so on, you'll never do the thing that's truly you're known for and remembered for."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "So finding that balance is tricky."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "I get that, but at the same time, this might be my own copium, which I know is a word you know now."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "Yeah, I'm slowly learning the full complexity of the term, yes."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "But the other way I think about it is, it is a skill to learn how to communicate with large audiences."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And first I started streaming chess, which is something I just did and really loved, but now I have to learn how to translate that format."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "And if that's a skillset we could build, then we could use it to do really important things."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "And I've seen a lot of YouTubers who have done interviews about how, they didn't love the kind of content they did at first, but what they're doing right now is really meaningful."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "So I like to think of it, maybe like skill development, cause not everybody hits off podcasts where they can talk to super interesting people right off the bat."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "Yeah, you can be slow and boring in a podcast."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "You don't have to worry about the first 10 seconds."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "I mean, people like keep pushing me for, cause the first 10 seconds of the videos I do is, well, I know it's most important for YouTube, but I don't give a damn."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "I wrote a Chrome extension that hides all the views and likes."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "I don't look at the click through."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "I don't look at Twitch views, Andrea does."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "So we also can relate."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "I love numbers too, but that's why I don't look at it."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "Cause you become like, oh, you'll start to think that a conversation or I think you did sucks because it doesn't get views, but that's just not the case."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "YouTube algorithm is this monster that figures stuff out."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "And if you let it control your mind, I feel like it's going to destroy you creatively."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "So you have to find a nice balance."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "I have to say, I was laughing a little bit when I was listening to the Magnus episode and the first 10 minutes, you guys are talking about soccer, football."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "Two robots seem human in the conversation."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "I was like, let's have some fun, make conversation about non chess related topics."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "Yeah, talk about sports."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "Yeah, it was kind of hilarious."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "I was surprised that even at his level, I wasn't sure, but I was surprised how much he loves chess."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "It sounds cliche to say, but like the way he looked at a chess board, you know those memes like, I wish somebody looked at me the way he still like the way he glanced down and he reached for the pieces with excitement to show me something."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "There was, there wasn't like, okay, I'll show you."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "It was like, like there was still that fire."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "That's something that always shocks me about some of like super grandmasters."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "Like one of my coaches was a person who also, his name's GM Hammer of Norway."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "He also coached Magnus."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "He was his second and he was helping me train for my tournament."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "And I was kind of putting off doing the homework."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "He's like, if you're putting it off, that means you're studying the wrong thing."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Like you should be enjoying even when you're practicing, which when I grew up, I thought to get to the top level, like practicing has to be hard and unpleasant."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "And when I was listening to Magnus episode, he was like, I didn't read books very much."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Or there was one thing that you said that's like very normal for studying classical chess that he didn't do just because it didn't interest him."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "He says, I suck at puzzles."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "I don't like puzzles."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "Yeah, and he doesn't do what he doesn't enjoy."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "And that's because it's like purely driven out of passion."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "I think the internet was like, I suck at puzzles too."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "Yeah, they like that."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "They're grandmasters."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "I don't have to study at all."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "It's just, it's fun."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "And, but I think the lesson there that's really powerful is he spends most of the day thinking about chess because he wants to."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "So do whatever, if you're into getting better at chess, do whatever it takes to actually just the number of hours you spend a day thinking about chess, maximize that."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "If you're like super serious about it."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "I actually get very addicted whenever I start studying chess, which is why I don't do it as seriously when I'm focused on content."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "Cause I go through these rabbit holes where if I'm focusing on chess, I wanna be as good as I possibly can at the game."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Otherwise it's hard for me to enjoy it cause it's such a competitive thing."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "And I remember training for tournaments and when you're training for tournaments, you even start dreaming about chess and you can stop thinking about it."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "And it's as if you're flipped into this completely different world, which is also what I like best about the game that it's a completely different living experience."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "And then you take some drugs and now you start to see things on the ceiling."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "Is there some factual hallucination like to the Queen's Gambit, like those scenes?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "I think it's... Is that based on your life story?"}, {"time": 1491, "text": "Well, I can't say that on camera."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "Actually chess players are very careful to not take drugs."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "They drink a lot."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "They drink so much."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "It's actually crazy for how good they're able to play chess when they do."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "But when it comes to things like psychedelics or other things, they usually stay away from those cause they don't wanna mess anything up in their brain."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "So this is actually intervention."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "I saw that you mentioned somewhere, I think it was the lie detector test where you have a drinking problem."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "Is that an actual..."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "I think that's actually a meme that we like to joke about on stream because occasionally we'd have like a white claw on stream or something like that."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "And then people meme about it."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "It goes back to Andrea's point of amplifying a part of your personality to make yourself a little bit more entertaining."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "I'm gonna use that as an excuse from now on."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "This podcast is just amplifying a part of that personality."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "I'm not really like this, but have you played drunk?"}, {"time": 1548, "text": "Like Magnus has played drunk."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "He says it helps someone with the creativity."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "Well, Andrea is under 21, so she's obviously would never do that."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "But I have played while drinking."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "Actually, I enjoy playing chess and drinking more than pre gaming or going out to a club and drinking, which sounds really silly."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "And I'll usually play against opponents who are also having some beer."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And it does make you feel like you're seeing the game from a fresher perspective where it can sometimes make you feel more confident, liquid confidence, and it does help with creativity."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "You just feel like you could pull things off, but there's also a limit."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "It's more like you've had one drink or two drink, but then it goes beyond that."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "And then you just start missing tactics and it's not worth it."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "Yeah, I think it only helps players in very short time controls."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "One time I was challenging this grandmaster on stream and we were playing bullet chess, which is one minute chess."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "And I was giving him handicaps."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And I said, okay, you have to take four shots before the next game."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "And he just got like 10 times stronger and transformed into like the Hulk and destroyed me more than the last game."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "But of course, if you're playing like a three hour game, it's gonna get old."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "But I think in short time controls, it's amazing."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "Yeah, definitely has to be blitz."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "It has to be where it's more intuition rather than sitting and calculating."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "This is probably like negatively affecting your ability to calculate."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "How much when you guys play, when you look at the chess board, how much of it is calculation?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "How much of it is memorized openings?"}, {"time": 1642, "text": "It really depends between short form chess."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "So five minutes, three minutes, one minute and classical chess."},

into chess streaming because I couldn't spend entire weekends or weeks playing tournaments."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "I would just, while I was in college, log on and play these long blitz or bullet sessions."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "And it's very fast."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "So you don't have time to go calculate as deeply."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "You basically have to calculate short lines pretty quickly."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "And a lot of it is pattern recognition and intuition."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "As three minutes, you said?"}, {"time": 1676, "text": "Three minutes, yeah."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "And so for that, it's just basically intuition."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "A lot of it is intuition, yeah."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "See, I saw on streams you actually keep talking while playing chess."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "It seems really difficult."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "Yeah, that helps my result."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "That doesn't help my result."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "It doesn't, it hurts."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "It helps content, not the game."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "But you can still do it."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "Because it feels like how can you possibly concentrate while talking?"}, {"time": 1697, "text": "It's because so much of it is intuition."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "You're not, while you're talking, you're thinking about that topic, but then you just come to the board and you just understand what you should be doing here."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "And then sometimes you get in trouble because

you?"}, {"time": 1731, "text": "Not physically in terms of chess."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "Well, yes, of course she is higher rated."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "But when we do play, I think her

what I'm saying, because don't worry, it's related, okay?"}, {"time": 1757, "text": "Because if I can get an advantage in the beginning of the game, but as soon as she starts trading pieces down, like my confidence drops, because I know that the end game is the hardest part of the game and the longest, and that's where she ends up beating me."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "So her end game is I think really what makes the difference."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "It sounds like her psychological warfare is better too, because if you're getting nervous."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "But it's harder to play against higher rated players, same how Magnus and former world champions have that psychological edge."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "So I think it's always going to be different for Andrea, because

does help."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "What does it feel like to play a higher rated player?"}, {"time": 1801, "text": "What's the experience of that?"}, {"time": 1806, "text": "Playing somebody like Magnus."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "So it depends on how much higher rated than you they are."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "If it's someone who's like between me and Andrea, let's say it's a 200 point

Tuesday."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And I got really lucky, beat a GM, drew an international master, and then I got paired against Hikaru Nakamura."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "And my brain just went blank, because I just know that I'm so unlikely to win that I couldn't even play the game properly when it's that much of a difference where they should be winning like 99% of the time."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "But that's like psychological."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "So you're saying that's the biggest experience is like actually knowing the numbers and statistically thinking there's no way I can win."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "But I meant like, is there a suffocating feeling like positionally you feel like you're constantly under attack?"}, {"time": 1857, "text": "You just feel like you're slowly getting outsmarted."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "And the worst is when you don't even know what you're doing wrong."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "You come out of that and you're like, I thought I was doing great and I got slowly squeezed."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "I didn't understand what was going on."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "And you're just kind of baffled."}, {"time": 1871,

1879, "text": "You just see it slowly getting the position better."}, {"time": 1882, "text": "And that's what it feels like."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "I would add it's kind of different for me if they're someone who's significantly higher rated."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "So let's say more than like 300 points or you're playing Magnus."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "What I notice is I just feel lost straight as soon as I don't know my preparation because they know so many opening lines that they're gonna know the best line to beat you that you haven't studied."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "So then on move 10, you're like, he already has a maybe plus 0.5 advantage which is really small."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "But for someone with such a significant skill level you know you already lost at that point."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "And it's like a third of the game."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of Andrea?"}, {"time": 1920, "text": "Andrea is very good at opening preparation."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "As she said."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "As she said, she likes bringing that up."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "I mean, she's very meticulous about it where she'll really go in and learn her lines."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "And having that initial starting confidence isn't just helpful for the opening but it helps develop your plans for the middle game."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "So I think she's very good at that."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "I think she's actually pretty good at tactical combinations."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "What is tactics?"}, {"time": 1949, "text": "Tactics is like solving puzzles or basically finding lines that are forced where if you find them, you're going to win."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "So that's like puzzles within a position."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "Whereas strategic chess is making slow moves and over the process of like 20 moves you get a slightly better position based on an understanding of the overall strategy."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "So in my extensive research review on Wikipedia, it says your most played opening is the King's Indian defense."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "In which,

Indian."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "Probably is my most played opening."}, {"time": 1995, "text": "And it's one where even when my coach who was a grandmaster taught me, he was like, so you know, I've been playing the King's Indian for 10 years and I still don't understand it."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "And it's one of those openings that computers really don't like because you do, or at least

your knight out to F6."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "I'll just put in the stereotypical, classical King's Indian more so to say."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "We actually have a very famous King's Indian game in the notes that we prepared."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "For the record, I asked you guys for some games that you find pretty cool and maybe to get a chance to talk about some."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "So this is the King's Indian."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "As you can see, white has much more control over the center."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "White has three pawns in the center while black has none past the fifth rank."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "And you just have this pawn on D6."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "And one of the ideas in chess is if you're not taking the center, then your plan revolves around trying to continually challenge it."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "But what is really fun about the King's Indian is that black sometimes gets these crazy King side attacks while white gets Queen side attacks."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "And even though it's a little bit suspicious for black and the computer could usually break it, it's hard to defend as a human when you're being attacked."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "But if you don't pull off the attack as black, then you're just gonna end up being lost in the end game."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "So it's like a very asymmetrical position."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "It's very asymmetrical, although a lot of people now stop playing into the classical King's Indian, even though computers give it a big advantage."}, {"time": 2104, "text": "And they play these slower lines in the King's Indian, which are less fun to play."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "What's slower mean?"}, {"time": 2110, "text": "It takes a longer time to do something interesting with?"}, {"time": 2115, "text": "They basically don't let you get as much of a King side attack because they try opening up the center and then you have no weaknesses,

are all on the fourth row in a row together."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "That feels like a bad position."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "For black?"}, {"time": 2138, "text": "For white."}, {"time": 2139,

just like they're like feel vulnerable there in a row together."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "Like it's like, you know, cause they're like, who's gonna defend them?"}, {"time": 2154, "text": "I guess the Knights defend and the Queen defends it."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "You're actually talking about a theme that you do see sometimes, which is called hanging pawns."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "And when you have two pawns right next to each other with no other pawns to defend them."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "Yeah, so it is a valid point."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "And actually as black, you're trying to break apart these pawns or get them to push and create some holes into the position, but it's a trade off."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "And that's a lot of what chess openings are about."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "You get more space, but you'll also end up having to protect your pawns potentially or move them forward to the point where they're overextended."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And plus

trapped, like you can't do anything."}, {"time": 2197, "text": "Everything's blocked, yeah."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "And blocked off, yeah."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "It's like you can't have fun."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "Yeah, one of the most, one of the opening principles for white is get your pawns in the center."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "So I'd say like this is actually preferable for white."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "Let's go over some opening principles."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "Cause this is a very good learning lesson for any chess beginners in the audience."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "Okay, so first thing you wanna do is control the center."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "There we go, E4, the more aggressive one."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "Isn't that like the basic vanilla move?"}, {"time": 2229, "text": "I didn't, somebody told me that's the most popular opening move in chess."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "Why is that considered aggressive?"}, {"time": 2236, "text": "So it's E4 and D4 and the king's pawn is known as being for more tactical players, whereas D4 is known for more positional players."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "So that's why it's considered more aggressive."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "Tactical."}, {"time": 2249, "text": "More gambits with E4, I think."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "So tactical means I'm gonna try to attack you."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "You're gonna try to go for puzzles and rely more on your combination abilities."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "Whereas if it's something positional, you usually have like three to four moves that are all good in the position, whereas tactics, you need to see this one line."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "So it's more precise."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "So this one's cool cause he can like, the queen can come out, the bishop can come out."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "Yeah, and that's one of the most popular checkmates and usually what you teach new students to try to cheese their friends cause then they feel really excited that they know this new trap where you bring the bishop and the queen out and you try to checkmate on F7."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "It's the trap that queen's gambit, Beth Harmon, falls for in their first game versus the janitor."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "She gets all mad cause she gets checkmated very early."}, {"time": 2298, "text": "Oh, that's the one she gets checkmated with?"}, {"time": 2301, "text": "I love how you guys were actually paying attention to the games carefully, which is pretty cool that they did a good job of improving, evolving her game throughout the show to actually represent an actual growth of a chess player."}, {"time": 2314, "text": "They really took every detail into consideration, which was cool."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "That's, I brought stuff into the center."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "We'll do the same."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "So then you want to develop your pieces."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "So in the beginning of the game, you want to take out the bishops and knights first because you don't want to start with the most valuable piece like the queen cause then it'll become a vulnerability and it'll get attacked very early on."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "And the reason you're taking out these two pieces first is cause you want to castle your king."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "So you can move a knight move or a bishop move and that's considered developing."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "So at this stage, not like even before getting a few pawns out."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "You usually want to start with getting a pawn because you want to get space in the center, but also when you push pawns, it helps free up some of your pieces."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "So usually start with one pawn first and then you could start taking out your minor pieces, which is the bishop and the knight."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "I have anxiety about a pawn just floating out there."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "Defenseless."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "But it's not attacked yet."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "See, those are what you call ghost threats."}, {"time": 2376, "text": "So you're scared of something that hasn't happened yet."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "So if I were to attack it."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "Feel like there's a deeper thing going on here."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "Actually, let's say."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "Yeah, so you're attacking the pawn in the center here and it is vulnerable, but as soon as you do that, I can develop my own knight and defend it as well."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "And now for people just listening, there's two pawns that just came out to meet each other and a couple of knights."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "You love the chess commentary."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "The pawns met after midnight."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "Well, I'm going to romanticize the game a bit."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "So like there's, if you bring out the bishops with the knights, you're matching that with the other."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "Black is going to match it."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "Whatever you're attacking with."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "Yep, he's developing."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "It's going to defend it."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Now you could develop your bishop or your knight, whatever you'd like."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "Oh no, now you give him options."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "Now I am attacking the pawn in the center, which is what you were afraid about before, but let's see how you defend it here."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "By doing this symmetrical thing, bringing out the knight on the other side."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "And actually your other move was good as well, defending with the pawn, because then you're freeing up space for your bishop."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "So you're basically trying to develop your pieces as quickly as possible, put your pawns in the center, and then get your king to safety."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "And that's usually the basic opening tips that you get."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "And it is kind of counterintuitive that safety is in the corner of the board for a king."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "That was always confusing to me, but you know."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "Three pawns in front, though you typically don't push those."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "Maybe like one, maybe I'll go one square, but these will be like the wall of defense that keep him safe."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "But another way to also think about it is your pieces usually wanna point towards the center."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "If you have a knight closer to the center than closer to the side, it actually has more squares it can go to."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "So a huge part of it is just wanting to have flexibility for where your pieces go."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "So more pieces are going to be able to make threats in the center or even open up the position."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "So since that's where it's most likely to open, you want your king somewhere where the position will stay closed so that you have the pawns to defend."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "You know, there's like rules like this, but I always wonder, cause I've built chess engines, but then you start to wonder like, why is it that positionally these things are good?"}, {"time": 2523, "text": "Like you've built up an intuition about it, but I wish, and that's the thing that would be amazing if engines could explain, why is this kind of thing better than this kind of thing?"}, {"time": 2533, "text": "You start to build up an intuition, but if I'm just like knowing nothing about chess, it feels confusing that cornering your king, like getting him like trapped here."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "Like it feels like you could get checkmated easier there if I was just using like dumb intuition, but it seems like that's not the case."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "I imagine maybe, cause AlphaZero learned by playing games against itself, right?"}, {"time": 2558, "text": "And I imagine if you have a lot of games and you do build an intuition, because if you were to keep your king in the center, you just see that in those games, you're dealing with threats a lot more often."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "But yeah, there's shortcut rules and this doesn't even mean it's the best way to play chess as we've seen with AlphaZero kind of changing the rules of the game a little bit."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "But as a human, to learn it from scratch is a lot more difficult than to start with principles."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "So that's why beginners usually learn chess this way."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "Yeah, because you're playing other humans and the other humans have also operated on a different principles."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "And that's why people that come up now that are training with engines are just going to be much better than the people of the past because they're gonna try out weirder ideas that go against the principles of old."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "And they're gonna do like weird stuff, including sacrifices and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "Yeah, and I also think that's why AlphaZero was so shocking because Stockfish was using an opening database."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "So it was already based off of knowledge that humans have from playing chess for years that we just thought is how you're supposed to play."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "Whereas AlphaZero just learned from playing the game so many times and came up with very novel opening ideas."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "Were you impressed by AlphaZero?"}, {"time": 2632, "text": "Have you seen some of the games?"}, {"time": 2633, "text": "I have seen some of the games."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "I think impressed, bewildered, and motivated were the three things I experienced."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "I think Magnus said he was also impressed that it could easily be mistaken for creativity."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "That's his trash talk towards the AI."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "That was a beautiful sentence."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "I was listening to the podcast."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "I mean, as a human, I agree with him because you don't wanna give the machine the power of creativity, but if it looks creative, give it a compliment."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "I know that you're being nice to the machines in case they are ever looking back through this."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "What other principles are there for the opening?"}, {"time": 2676, "text": "You can go a little bit more forward, let's say."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "Yeah, we can finish full development."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "Positions like this, let's just say you developed all of your pieces."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "So that's like a really nice, like nobody took any pieces and we're just in a nice positional thing."}, {"time": 2693, "text": "Yeah, so it's not actually a very accurate one."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "So I'm actually, I could put a different one on the board, but usually after you've developed all of your pieces, you wanna get your queen out a little bit to connect your rooks, and you also start thinking about certain pawn pushes and getting more space."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "But another good tip is just can you improve the position of your pieces?"}, {"time": 2715, "text": "Think about timing."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "So if you've already moved a piece once and there's a piece that hasn't moved at all, then you wanna focus on the piece that hasn't moved at all to be able to have it more likely to jump into the game."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "Right, so don't move pieces multiple times."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "Like try to move it to the most optimal position."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "What, so what's the Indian, I think we kind of went over it, but did you ever say why you like it so much?"}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Because it's weird?"}, {"time": 2742, "text": "Because it's king size?"}, {"time": 2743, "text": "I liked it because it's a very fun, aggressive defense where you're just throwing your pieces towards white, and there's so many sacrificing opportunities."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "And for some reason, tactical games always feel like the most beautiful, the most satisfying, and that's what I liked about the King's Indian."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "But I also suffered a lot from this love because I would play things that are not necessarily correct, then my attack wouldn't pan out, and then I would just struggle the rest of the game having no play and just trying to defend."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "So if you're always attacking, Wikipedia also says that, that you're known for your attacking play."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "It's also known for losses according to Stanford."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Okay, let's not bring that up."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "See Wikipedia doesn't talk trash, it just says nice things."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "Yeah, Wikipedia's a lot nicer."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "I actually played a lot of positional chess in classic because I really like the slow squeeze, but when I transitioned to playing a lot of online chess, it's almost as if I was looking for more instant gratification because it feels so much better to beat someone with an attack."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "And even if sometimes it doesn't pan out, I was okay with it because you get so many games in."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "So I think my style in online chess really changed from my classical chess."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "What about you Andrea?"}, {"time": 2817, "text": "Do you have a style?"}, {"time": 2818, "text": "Are you attacking?"}, {"time": 2819, "text": "Are you a more like conservative defensive player?"}, {"time": 2822, "text": "Are you chaotic?"}, {"time": 2823, "text": "Opening wise, I like to play more positionally."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "Like I like to push T4 and just slowly improve my pieces and slowly get an attack."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "But like Alex said, if you're playing bullet chess or blitz against viewers, you often like wanna play riskier moves that may not be as good."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "And then that's kind of when I would play more aggressive."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "But I do enjoy tournaments for that reason because then like once you're 15 moves in, which as soon as you're out of your prep, I like sitting and thinking in more positional, yeah, positional middle games."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "One of the games you found to be pretty cool was the Hakara Nakamura versus Galfan in 2009."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "And that one I think includes the King's Indian defense."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "Why is that an interesting one to you?"}, {"time": 2872, "text": "I also play the King's Indian as black and I love this model game."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "But as Alex was saying, like all these advantages for the King's Indian."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "But now there's this one line that like every higher rated player just destroys my King's Indian."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "And you see these beautiful games and like, ah, yes, I wanna play for these ideas."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "But now no one plays into it anymore and you just get demolished."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "So this is why I don't play the King's Indian anymore, but not to ruin the fun."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "It's a love hate relationship, truly."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "The reality."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "But that's like the higher level players do or does everybody?"}, {"time": 2901, "text": "Yeah, if you're studying openings and you know this line as white, you just, you automatically get the upper edge."}, {"time": 2907, "text": "And that's kind of how openings develop."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "You start having players trying new lines and then you see ones and then everybody adopts it if they think it's the best one."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "But yeah, so Hikaru is really known for his aggressive style of play."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "Is Hikaru black here or what?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "Yeah, Hikaru is black here."}, {"time": 2923, "text": "So he's playing the King's Indian."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "And as you can see in this position, white already has a lot, a huge center advantage."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "But what Hikaru is gonna start doing even with the next move is bringing all of his pieces towards the white King side, because his plan is to start pushing his pawns towards the white King and ignore the attack that goes on in the Queen side."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "It's all of the dream attack with the King's Indian."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "So there's a complete asymmetry towards the King side and the left side of the board is a ton of pieces."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "Wow, he moved the knight like three times in a row."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "Yep, and that's what you need to do because you have to move the knight in order to make space for your pawn."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "So again, this is why it's so counterintuitive and Stockfish doesn't like it."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "You're putting almost most of your pieces

mimicking it, that's awesome."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "Okay, so yeah, here you see white going for a Queen side attack, black going for the King side attack and you can keep going a little bit and I'll wait to where he starts with the pretty sacrifices."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "It's more fun to analyze games in person than on the computer, I think."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "Okay, so here Hikaru is preparing the attack and what I really like about this game is that he finds these tactics that are not necessarily what a computer would go for but it's very hard to face as a human and that's why a lot of people play the King's Indian because in practice it's hard to defend against."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "So we can keep moving a little bit forward."}, {"time": 3019, "text": "Yep, so white is just continuing the King side plan."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "No, is that like the first piece I think that's taken in the game?"}, {"time": 3025, "text": "Yep, that's the first trade."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Attack begins."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "Exactly, Hikaru had to pause his attack for a little bit to just make sure that white didn't have two dire threats on the Queen side."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "So cool to see the asymmetry of this thing."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "Exactly, that's what's beautiful about the King's Indian."}, {"time": 3039, "text": "And just one thing to highlight because his rook move here is very bizarre and typically like a computer probably didn't like this but the ideas are interesting because this is a major weakness for black that they're coming to attack and he's also making room for his Bishop to come backwards and challenge."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "So this is like a human like maneuver that computers would like."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "I think computers would like this though because you'd have to move it regardless because he takes the pawn here and his rook would be under attack."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "Yeah, well having looked at it, when I actually studied this as a line and this right away isn't the best move cutting computer."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "So actually that's such a good question."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "So do you guys when you study games use your mind but do you also use computers to build up your intuition of like looking at a position like this and what would a computer do and then try to understand why it wants to do that?"}, {"time": 3084, "text": "When I was studying seriously I would try to use my own mind because you're never gonna get the exact same position so you really need to notice trends and often computers will give you moves that are only specific to that position because of a certain tactic."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "But I do use computers to check what I did and make sure I didn't make any obvious blunder that I might have missed."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "What does a computer tell you?"}, {"time": 3107, "text": "Just like what is the best move or does it give you any kind of explanation of why?"}, {"time": 3112, "text": "It doesn't tell you why but it gives you the different valuations of the position like black is down a half pawn here or something like that but it hints you towards what the right move is and then it's on you to figure out why and you can usually figure out why if not right away then just by going through a few moves and being like, oh, okay, that makes sense."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "I feel like a computer will take you down with some weird lines potentially like sacrifice."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "Like why the hell am I sacrificing this?"}, {"time": 3140, "text": "Well, we'll get to the pretty sacrifice soon."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "So we could just keep playing."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "The pawns are being pushed forward."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "Yeah, and Hikaru is kind of ignoring the queen side attack here."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "They basically both only reply to each other's

operation where you move one piece."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "You're doing like the branch analysis."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "Like, and so you still have to somehow visualize the branching process and not forget stuff."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "Maybe that's like constant memory recall or something."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "You're always looking at one board at a time, but."}, {"time": 3276,

back."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "I guess you're keeping the position in your memory."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "So you're remembering where all the pieces are and then you're playing it out on one board and then you can come back to the initial one that you started with that you kind of just keep in your brain and it's also easier to come back to it once you've played a position from it."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "I feel like it's that memory recall that gets you to blunder."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "So I'll like see that I'm being attacked by certain things, but then because I get so

least in a beginner level, there's like a, I don't know, a Bishop just sitting there, obviously attacking your like queen or something."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "And then you just forget that Bishop exists."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "Cause if they just sit there for a few moves and don't move, you just forget their existence."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "And then it's just, yeah, that's definitely very embarrassing."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "Well, it happens to everyone, so."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "Okay, so we see a few trades happening on the queen side where he had to go for those, otherwise he's in trouble."}, {"time": 3378, "text": "And this is where the game, oh, sorry."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "This is where it gets exciting."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "Yeah, so Knight H4 is really when the sacrifice starts."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "And here the two important pawns are the ones in front of the King, cause they're helping with the entire defense and Hikaru is actually preparing to sacrifice his Knight for a pawn just so that he can continue his attack and open up the position."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "Because if you don't do that here as black and don't get some kind of attack, you are completely lost on the queen side."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "And also you've pushed all of your own king side pawns, so you're gonna be in danger."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "So it's one of those do or die moments."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "Oh, okay, so that's what makes it all in, cause the King is wide open."}, {"time": 3418, "text": "Yeah, yeah, the King is wide open and all of White's pieces are pointed towards the queen side too, where you're also cramped."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "So is the attack primarily by black done by the two pawns and the Knight?"}, {"time": 3430, "text": "And the light squared Bishop is always extremely important."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "So you don't wanna trade this in the King's Indian because it's very helpful for a lot of attacks."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "Even though it's on the other side of the board, I guess it can go all the way across in, like I'm not sure what it's doing here, but probably threatening."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "Like for example, if it was another move black could have played would be something like Bishop H3, where if you take the Bishop, you actually get mated on G2."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "With what?"}, {"time": 3456, "text": "So let's say you take here and then you could push the pawn and then it would be checkmate."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "So you're kind of using your Bishop to sacrifice against White's King side pawns."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "Yeah, I'll be freaking out if their Bishop did that."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "What are they up to?"}, {"time": 3471, "text": "Right, and that's the thing, this position looks very scary as White because all of Black's pawns are starting to come towards you."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "And it's one of those things where humans do start to worry in these positions, whereas computers obviously can just calculate the best line and maybe the attack doesn't go through."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "So you're saying the computer might say that the White is actually a slight favorite here?"}, {"time": 3492, "text": "Yeah, potentially."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "Okay, so then White makes a little bit of room by moving the Rook."}, {"time": 3499, "text": "And the attack begins."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "I like the commentary here."}, {"time": 3503, "text": "The Knight is hugging the King."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "And actually White can't even take the King here because then H4 and H3 is coming in."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "White can't take the Knight."}, {"time": 3512, "text": "Yeah, oh did I say King?"}, {"time": 3513, "text": "Yes, thank you, the Knight."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "White can't take the Knight because why?"}, {"time": 3517, "text": "So if White takes the Knight here, then Black starts pushing his pawn to H4 with H3 incoming and the idea of trying to defend against this is, it looks very difficult."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "So White just chooses."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "It'd be cool to watch a chess game, to experience watching it without understanding it just for a day."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "Feel like I could use that to make better content."}, {"time": 3542, "text": "I mean, that's what getting drunk does."}, {"time": 3543, "text": "Unfortunately for chess players, it never leaves your brain."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "Doesn't matter how."}, {"time": 3548, "text": "But this is actually a very cute move because Black's Queen is under attack, but the King is so cramped that he can't actually take it or he's gonna get checkmated by a pawn, which is a sad way to go cruelly."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "Yeah, those pawns are doing a lot of work here."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "That is the King's Indian."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "This is the King's Indian player's dream."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "The attack of the King side pawns."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "Yeah, these pawns are like, right, so they're the ones that are doing a lot of the threatening."}, {"time": 3573, "text": "Right, and they're also opening up the position to bring more of the pieces in."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "But the pawns kind of help break open the King side, but they can't checkmate by themselves."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "So after the pawns come in, that's when you need to start bringing in pieces as well, which you will see Ahi Kar do here."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "He puts."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "One more sacrifice."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "This was actually another beautiful sacrifice in the game."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "But then puts the King in check with a pawn."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "Right, and the pawn is going to be given here for free, but the idea is you're giving your own piece because you want to have more space and open up the King, which is what you're always trying to do when you have a King side."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "You're trying to remove as many of the King's defenders as you can without giving up too much."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "And then you have a ton of pieces on the King side for black, just waiting to."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "To do harm."}, {"time": 3623, "text": "And notice how every single move, white is getting attacked."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "Like they're just never getting a break."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "Black just keeps throwing all their pieces."}, {"time": 3630, "text": "So it's funny that black's Queen has been hanging for like three moves now and white still can't do anything about it."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "So rook puts the King in check."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "The King runs."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "And then again, we leave the Queen hanging and you develop a piece, this light squared Bishop that's so important, and you're once again threatening checkmate on G2."}, {"time": 3651, "text": "And then Bishops coming to the game."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "Once again, the Queen hanging."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "I mean, the game is just so beautiful."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "The amount of calculation Hikaru put into this position."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "It feels like so much is in danger."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "And Knight takes what?"}, {"time": 3669, "text": "A pawns."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "So now his Queen is attacked twice and he doesn't care."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "He takes the Bishop and he's still threatening the checkmate on G2."}, {"time": 3678, "text": "And then the Queen takes the Bishop."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "So now he's defending against G2 and black just goes and grabs some material back here."}, {"time": 3689, "text": "So here, black is already is winning."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "Well, he ends up winning a Knight here because black had to be so much on the defensive."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "He's just taking pieces."}, {"time": 3699, "text": "Yeah, I mean at this point, you're up two whole pieces."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "So you knew it was in here."}, {"time": 3706, "text": "And Queen."}, {"time": 3707, "text": "Queen."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "And then you take, and then the rook takes and there's not as much of an attack on the King anymore, but Hikaru is up a Knight here, which is GG."}, {"time": 3721, "text": "Yeah, what's the correct way of saying that?"}, {"time": 3724, "text": "Because I played Demis Hassabis."}, {"time": 3727, "text": "I played him in chess."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "And then I quickly realized like from his facial expressions that I should have like stopped playing."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "It was like, it's already set."}, {"time": 3739, "text": "Yeah, when it's."}, {"time": 3740, "text": "And then he's like, like, this is the good time to like, give up."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "You're not gonna get to checkmate where like this, you know, he could see like, the checkmate is like five or seven moves away or something."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "And what's the play?"}, {"time": 3754, "text": "Usually you have to resign if you're in a position or you should through chess etiquette resign when you're in a position where your opponent is definitely gonna win out of respect."}, {"time": 3766, "text":

two rooks, a king, and they only have their sole king, but they're still playing on."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "So that's a position where it's obvious they can't win."}, {"time": 3788, "text":

theoretically be a draw, but it could be very hard to defend because it's a hard technique to know as a human."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "And especially in that game, I know that Nepo was also in time pressure, which makes it even harder."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "So in situations like that, you should always continue."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "It's more where an engine would give you something

out, Black would have been completely lost."}, {"time": 3893, "text": "How often does that happen, by the way?"}, {"time": 3894, "text": "Like as an attacking player, how often do you put yourself in the position of like, I'm screwed unless this works out?"}, {"time": 3901, "text": "In online chess more than I should."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "And it's usually when I sacrifice, I know it's either gonna work or I'm lost."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "And those are the most fun positions to play usually."}, {"time": 3913, "text": "But in tournaments, if you're doing a sacrifice, you're playing it with 100% confidence because you're taking the time to calculate it."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "But yeah, when you have three minutes, you don't have time."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "So you take a whim and you follow your intuition and you find out later."}, {"time": 3927, "text": "Or you're very confident it'll work and you haven't calculated all the way until the end, but you've calculated to the point where you have enough in exchange for the sack and you think you could play that position."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "How do you train chess these days?"}, {"time": 3941, "text": "What's, do you practice?"}, {"time": 3944, "text": "Do you do deliberate practice?"}, {"time": 3945, "text": "I mean, you're in this tough position because you're also a creator and educator and entertainer."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "So do you try to put in time of like daily practice?"}, {"time": 3955, "text": "I don't train chess anymore when I'm focusing on creating."}, {"time": 3960, "text": "I do if I'm preparing for a tournament."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "But back in the day, I would train very seriously for tournaments."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "And the way it would work is I do opening preparation for a specific tournament because that's when you really need to have those lines memorized and you could also prepare for specific opponents."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "And I would do tactics to make sure I stay sharp."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "So those were the two things I would do every single day for a tournament and then mix up the rest with like maybe some end games, maybe some positional chess."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "So what does tactics preparation looks like?"}, {"time": 3990, "text": "Do you do like a puzzle, like a random puzzle thing?"}, {"time": 3994, "text": "Yeah, I would just train puzzles for at least like 30 to 60 minutes or books."}, {"time": 3999, "text": "And sometimes you were, and there's different kinds of puzzles."}, {"time": 4002, "text": "One you could train for pattern recognition where you're supposed to go through them very quickly."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "And that's just so that when you're playing the game, if your mind is tired, it's still keeping track of things a little bit more easily."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "And then there's where you're practicing your combination and those sometimes take like 20 minutes to find because you have to just calculate a lot."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "And it's more like making sure that you've trained with that muscle."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "But Andrea is actually very good at finding ways to balance and still study while also doing content."}, {"time": 4029, "text": "Yeah, so what, you're able to do both?"}, {"time": 4031, "text": "That's the hard thing."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "I was getting very irritated with content because I'm very competitive."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "I don't like playing chess if I'm losing."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "And if you're talking and entertaining, you're gonna be losing more games than winning."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "So then I started doing more training streams where I'd bring on my coach."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "And one of the things that I wanted to add to Alex's training repertoire."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "So I would do daily puzzles every time I'm streaming, which helped me a lot, even if it's like, there's this thing on chess.com called Puzzle Rush, where you have three minutes and you just do puzzle after puzzle where they get incrementally harder."}, {"time": 4065, "text": "And it's just a really good way to build your pattern recognition, especially when you're rusty."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "So I would do that till I hit a high score and I wouldn't play any blitz until I hit the score that I want."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "But that's kind of more like the fun part of chess studying."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "The very important one is actually analyzing your losses in your tournament games."}, {"time": 4084, "text": "And first you sit and you look through your mistake yourself and try to see if you can find the better moves."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "And then that's when you would check over with a computer to see if you're right."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "So game analysis is also very important, which I try to do."}, {"time": 4096, "text": "I remember to give a shout out, I listened to a couple of episodes of the Perpetual Chess Podcast, which is pretty good."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "But whatever I listened to, I remember the, it's, I think they really focus on like teaching people."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "How to train."}, {"time": 4115, "text": "Yeah, how to play, how to train, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4117, "text": "They do like, yeah, I'm looking now, adult improver."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "So basically like how do regular noobs get better at chess?"}, {"time": 4126, "text": "One of the things that, one of the person that said, I think he was the grandmaster, but he said, to maximize the amount of time you spend every day of like, basically as you were saying, like suffering."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "So like you, it's not about the, like you should be thinking."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "You should be doing calculating."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "So it's the opposite of what Magnus said."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "Like

{"time": 4154, "text": "That's how you get better."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "Yeah, it really depends what you're training."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "Cause I used to think the same, but it depends what you're weaker at."}, {"time": 4160, "text": "Cause if you're doing the really difficult puzzles, you're training for like visualization and calculating more moves ahead than you typically would, which maybe you wouldn't get into that as often in a regular game because typically you run into like three to four tactics, which are actually the easier and more fun ones to solve."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "So it really depends."}, {"time": 4179, "text": "And on top of that, as a hobbyist, your motivation is very different than when you're playing from a young age and have pretty high competitive ambition."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "And a lot of people who are new to chess, you could basically work on anything and still improve."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "So if you're focusing on

first."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "And then you throw a game you shouldn't, and this shouldn't hurt my ego as much as it does, but it's always kids."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "Or when I was a high school girl, it's the younger boys who are really cocky."}, {"time": 4246, "text": "And when they win, they start rubbing it in your face and they're yawning and looking around when like 90% of the

theory very much."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "I just like playing the game and getting into middle games and end games."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "But yeah, typically the only time we're playing each

banned."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "But I honestly really liked the chaotic environments for chess games."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "Cause I think it's a good way to break more into the mainstream

delayed the development of his King and put his Queen out a little bit too exposed."}, {"time": 4877, "text": "So Bobby Fisher immediately punished that."}, {"time": 4879, "text": "And then there was just like a beautiful combination where it was like a 12 in a row perfect moves, which was a tactic, just winning the game."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "But it only came from punishing those

"text": "And the fact that so many people spend so much of their life on it, but you can also spend so much of your life because it's so deep and so interesting."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "And I mean, I've definitely experienced moments where I didn't want to do anything but chess."}, {"time": 4993, "text": "And I had that before I went to college where I just wanted to take a gap year and focus on chess because I went to high school, we moved a lot, there was always other things going on."}, {"time": 5003, "text": "So I felt like I could never really focus on chess."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "And the one time I could, by taking a gap year, I ended up not doing because my parents really wanted me to go to university right away."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "But I think maybe if I had taken that gap year, I don't know if I would have gone back to school."}, {"time": 5017, "text": "So maybe it wasn't a bad thing."}, {"time": 5019, "text": "I'd also say that's pretty universal."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "I think if you want to be the best at anything you do or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "So I don't know if that's only chess."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "Well, some things, some obsessions are more transferable to a balanced social life."}, {"time": 5034, "text": "Like healthy development."}, {"time": 5035, "text": "Yeah, chess is a lot less social than most other sports."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "Yeah, there's something deeply isolating about this game."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "I mean, the great chess players I've met, I mean, it's really competitive too."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "And there's something that you're almost nonstop paranoid about blundering at every level."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "And that develops a person who is really anxious about losing versus someone who deeply enjoys perfection or winning and so on."}, {"time": 5067, "text": "It's just this constant paranoia about losing."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "Maybe I'm misinterpreting it, but that creates huge amount of stress over like thousands of games, especially in a young person."}, {"time": 5081, "text": "And that blundering is such a painful experience because you could be playing a game that you've played for five, six hours and you have one lapse in focus and you blunder and you throw the entire game away."}, {"time": 5094, "text": "And sometimes not just the entire game, but the entire tournament."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "Now you can't place or do anything anymore."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "So you just feel those mistakes so strongly."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "Yeah, there's no one to blame but yourself."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "Are you guys hard on yourself?"}, {"time": 5108, "text": "Have you been about losing?"}, {"time": 5110, "text": "Like before you became super famous for streaming where you could be like, well, fuck this, at least I can have fun playing."}, {"time": 5117, "text": "So I was really hard on myself and I went to play a tournament in Canada to try to qualify for the Olympiad team."}, {"time": 5124, "text": "And I was like, well, I'm an adult now."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "I'm not gonna feel emotional if I lose."}, {"time": 5130, "text": "And then I got there on the first day."}, {"time": 5133, "text": "I think I was ranked like fourth in Canada for females."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "How long ago was this?"}, {"time": 5140, "text": "This was like earlier in the year actually."}, {"time": 5143, "text": "And I go and I lose to somebody lower rated on the first day."}, {"time": 5147, "text": "And I think it was because I blundered and I went back to my room and I was like, I am not an adult."}, {"time": 5152, "text": "I'm not eating, I'm not leaving this room."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "I feel terrible and I know I shouldn't, but it just cuts so deep."}, {"time": 5159, "text": "And then I actually ended up qualifying for the Olympiad team, but I didn't wanna play because I didn't have enough time to train and the losses are so painful that I was like, it's not worth it."}, {"time": 5169, "text": "Yeah, in high school and growing up, I just remember weekends."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And I think being competitive in any sport, again, probably people relate to this, which is like spending weekends crying."}, {"time": 5180, "text": "And even like Alex said, like punishing yourself because you're disappointed in yourself because you fight so hard and you prepare and you study and you're like, oh, yeah."}, {"time": 5189, "text": "But that's once again on the bright side though, when you're studying so hard and after like a four hour game and you actually are on the opposite end and you win, you feel like such a huge rush of dopamine and serotonin and you're like on a high from the wind."}, {"time": 5205, "text": "So there's also plus sides or you can turn this around."}, {"time": 5207, "text": "But yeah, like Alex said, like losing after preparing for something and fighting on hours and hours is the worst feeling in the world."}, {"time": 5214, "text": "Did you ever get anything like that with martial arts?"}, {"time": 5218, "text": "Yeah, so, you know, wrestling, I wrestled all through high school and middle school."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "Definitely, so it's an individual sport."}, {"time": 5223, "text": "I did a lot of individual sport, tennis, those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "But I think even with wrestling and tennis, you're still on a team."}, {"time": 5231, "text": "You can still like, there's still a comradery there."}, {"time": 5234, "text": "I feel like with chess, especially you go on your own with the tournaments, like you really are alone."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "But I mean, I always personally just had like a very self critical mind in general."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "I would not."}, {"time": 5246, "text": "It's one of the reasons I decided not to play chess because I think when I was really young, I met somebody who was able to play blindfold chess."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "They were teaching me, they were laying in there on the couch, trashed, drinking and smoking."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "And there were."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "Sounds like a Russian."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "There are now a faculty somewhere in the United States."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "But he making jokes, talking to others and he would move the pieces, like he would yell across the room."}, {"time": 5278, "text": "And I remember thinking that if a person is able to do that, then that kind of world you can live in inside your mind that becomes the chessboard."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "To me, that meant like the chessboard is not just out here."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "It could be in here and you could do these beautiful, you can create these beautiful patterns in your mind."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "I thought like, I had such a strong pull towards that where I had to decide either I'm gonna dedicate everything to this or not."}, {"time": 5309, "text": "You can't do half assed."}, {"time": 5310, "text": "And then that's when I decided to walk away from it because I had so much other beautiful things in my life."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "I loved mathematics."}, {"time": 5318, "text": "I loved, just everything was beautiful to me."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "I thought chess would pull me all in."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "And there was nothing like it, I think, in my whole life since then."}, {"time": 5329, "text": "I think it's such a dangerous addiction."}, {"time": 5332, "text": "It's such a beautiful addiction, but it's a dangerous one, depending on what your mind is like."}, {"time": 5336, "text": "It reminds me of something I thought of before I stopped competing as much."}, {"time": 5341, "text": "And I'd look at people and think, imagine being so intelligent that you could become a grandmaster and yet only spending the rest of your life being a grandmaster."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "Because it's one of those things where it does require a lot of mental power, but by doing chess, you're not gonna be able to explore other subjects deeply."}, {"time": 5361, "text": "And not in a way that is bad necessarily, more an admiration and wondering what else could have been because I've just seen people get to these levels of obsession where it's all they wanna do."}, {"time": 5371, "text": "And they're grandmasters, but they're not even top players."}, {"time": 5374, "text": "So they're never gonna make a living out of it."}, {"time": 5376, "text": "They'll make like maybe 30, 40K a year max."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "They can't even focus on their competitive chess because they have to supplement it by teaching and doing things they don't like."}, {"time": 5385, "text": "And it's just because of how strong of an obsession it can be because it truly is very intellectually rewarding."}, {"time": 5392, "text": "And I think that's what people are addicted to in the self improvement, but you can get that from a lot of other things as well."}, {"time": 5398, "text": "Well, I think for me, what I was inspired by that stuck with me is that a human being could be so good at one thing."}, {"time": 5410, "text": "To me, that person on the couch drinking and so on, I assumed he was the best chess player in the world."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "Like to be able to play inside your head, it just felt like a feat that's incredible."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "And so I fell in love with the idea that I hope to be something like that in my life at something."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "It would be pretty cool to be really good at one thing."}, {"time": 5431, "text": "And like life in some sense is a search for the things that you could be that good at."}, {"time": 5436, "text": "I didn't even think about like how much money does it make or any of that."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "It's can I fall in love with something and make it a life pursuit where I can be damn good at it."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "And being damn good at it is the source of enjoyment."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "Not like not to win because you want to win a tournament or win because like you just want to be better at somebody else."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "No, it's for the beauty of the game itself or the beauty of the activity itself."}, {"time": 5463, "text": "And then you realize that that's one of the compelling things about chess."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "It is a game with rules and you can win."}, {"time": 5470, "text": "If you want to be really damn good in some aspect of life like that, it's a harder and weirder pursuit."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "Don't you feel like you kind of did that with computer science or AI related things?"}, {"time": 5484, "text": "Like getting that level of damn good."}, {"time": 5487, "text": "That's one of the cool things about AI and robotics or intellectual pursuits or scientific pursuits is you can spend until you're 80 doing it."}, {"time": 5496, "text": "So I'm in the early days of that."}, {"time": 5497, "text": "One of the reasons I came to Texas, one of the reasons I didn't want to pursue an academic career at MIT is I want to build a company."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "And so I'm in the early days of that AI company."}, {"time": 5512, "text": "And so it's an open world to see if I'm actually going to be good at it."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "But the thing that's there that I've been cognizant of my whole life is that I have a passion for it."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "Something within me draws me to that thing."}, {"time": 5526, "text": "And you have to listen to that, to that voice."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "So with chess, you're fucked unless you like early on are really training really hard."}, {"time": 5536, "text": "I think life is more forgiving."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "You can be world class at a thing after making a lot of mistakes."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "And after spending the first few decades of your life doing something completely different."}, {"time": 5550, "text": "And chess, it's like an Olympic sport."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "Like there's no, perfection is a requirement, is a necessity."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "What do you think is that pursuit for you?"}, {"time": 5562, "text": "Like why did you decide to stream?"}, {"time": 5565, "text": "What drew you?"}, {"time": 5566, "text": "I like these questions."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "Now we're really getting deep."}, {"time": 5570, "text": "Yeah, this is like a therapy session."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "I mean, isn't it terrifying to be in front of a camera?"}, {"time": 5575, "text": "Well, it's terrifying to be in front of five cameras."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "The set up is."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "Corrections, six."}, {"time": 5580, "text": "Six, okay."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "It's more terrifying for me to try to remember if I actually turned them all."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "Like I mentioned to you off mic, I'm still suffering from a bit of PTSD after screwing up a recording of Magnus."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "He had to console me because that was the thing."}, {"time": 5599, "text": "I felt, okay, you wanna build robots."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "If you can't get a camera to even run correctly, how are you gonna do anything else in life?"}, {"time": 5610, "text": "Oh no, don't let it spiral like that."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "It was spiraling hard and I was just laying there and just feeling sorry for myself."}, {"time": 5618, "text": "But I think that feeling, by the way, and the small tangent, is really useful."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "I feel like a lot of growing happens when you feel shitty."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "As long as you can get out of it."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "Like don't let it spiral indefinitely."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "But just feeling really, really shitty about everything in my life."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "Like I was having an existential crisis."}, {"time": 5638, "text": "Like how will I be able to do anything at all?"}, {"time": 5641, "text": "Like you're a giant failure, all those kinds of negative voices."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "But I think I made some good decisions in the week after that."}, {"time": 5650, "text": "Of like, okay."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "Do you think you couldn't have made those decisions if you were less hard on yourself?"}, {"time": 5656, "text": "Me personally, no."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "I'm too lazy."}, {"time": 5659, "text": "Okay, so you really need to be angry at yourself enough to go and do what you need."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "Yeah, it's not even angry, it's just upset of being self critical."}, {"time": 5667, "text": "Like also for me personally, because I don't have proclivities for depression, I have a lot more room to feel extremely shitty about myself."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "So if you're somebody that can get stuck in that place, like clinically depressed, you have to be really, really careful."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "You have to notice the triggers, you don't wanna get into that place."}, {"time": 5691, "text": "But for me, just looking empirically, feeling shitty has always been productive."}, {"time": 5698, "text": "Like it makes me long term happier."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "Ultimately, it makes me more grateful to be alive and it helps me grow, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5706, "text": "So I kinda embrace it."}, {"time": 5710, "text": "Otherwise, I feel like I will never do anything."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "I have to feel shitty, but that's not a thing I prescribe to others."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "There's a famous professor at MIT, his name is Marvin Minsky."}, {"time": 5722, "text": "And when he was giving advice about like to the students, he said, the secret to my success was that I always hated everything I did in the past."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "So always sort of being self critical about everything you've accomplished, never really take a moment of gratitude."}, {"time": 5739, "text": "And I think for a lot of people that hear that, that's not good."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "You should like take a pause and be grateful, but it really worked for him."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "So it's a choice you have to make."}, {"time": 5750, "text": "It reminds me of the quote, be happy but never satisfied, where you can have a positive spin and still want to improve yourself."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "But yeah, like when did you decide to take a step in the spotlight, that terrifying spotlight of the internet?"}, {"time": 5771, "text": "It was actually my senior year of college and I was really busy with work and school and chess was kind of like this lost love."}, {"time": 5781, "text": "And the interesting thing is that the longer I don't play chess, the more I kind of miss playing it casually and enjoy it more."}, {"time": 5787, "text": "Cause then I start looking at it with fresh eyes, but I didn't have time to play tournaments."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "So I started streaming online because it was more social than just playing strangers on the internet without knowing anything about who they are."}, {"time": 5801, "text": "And I started slowly growing a community and got in touch with chess.com pretty quickly too."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "So then it was this hobby that I would do once a week, every Thursday at 8 p.m. And it was one of the things that brought me a lot of joy."}, {"time": 5815, "text": "And actually I, speaking of depression, did struggle for it with at least 10 years of my life."}, {"time": 5822, "text": "And it was one of those things where chess and streaming was such a distraction and it brought me such great joy that I just kept doing it cause I really, really liked it."}, {"time": 5833, "text": "And then I was working on something that didn't pan out and decided to go and take a risk and just stream full time, which, you know, seemed a little bit weird at the moment."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "Was that terrifying, that leap?"}, {"time": 5849, "text": "It was terrifying, but I had taken so many terrifying leaps in the past and they didn't, you know, the last two hadn't worked out, but I was like, well, I'll get it eventually."}, {"time": 5859, "text": "So somehow having failed before and going through failure and knowing that it'll be okay, made me more likely to just try something that was a very, very weird job."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "Goodbye camera."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "I saw it die."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "Yeah, the camera, we don't need it."}, {"time": 5875, "text": "But one of the cameras died."}, {"time": 5876, "text": "Luckily we have another five."}, {"time": 5879, "text": "Like this is where this triggers the spiral, Alexis is gonna go to A to death now."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "It's still somehow awake."}, {"time": 5889, "text": "Is there advice you can give about the dark places you've gone in your mind, the depression you suffered from, how to get out from your own story?"}, {"time": 5898, "text": "Whenever I go to those really dark places, the scariest thing is that it feels like I will never get rid of this feeling and it is very overwhelming."}, {"time": 5911, "text": "And I just have to kind of look back over time spans and remember that every single time I have got through it and remind myself that it is just temporary."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "And that has been the most helpful thing for me because I just try to combat the scariest thing about it."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "And then believe, have faith that it's gonna, like this will go away."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "And take action obviously to make sure it goes away."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "And I've also tried to spin it as depression is one of the hardest things I've had to deal with, but also one of the biggest motivators because if I just am left with my own brain, I get very depressed."}, {"time": 5947, "text": "Then I really like working or focusing on things."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "So it actually pushed me to try to focus on school, try to focus on chess, focus on whatever I'm doing."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "And also if I'm feeling really bad, then there's probably something a little bit off and I use it as a signal and try to think of it as, okay, this is just a sign that there's things that could be improved for long term."}, {"time": 5967, "text": "What about you, Andrea?"}, {"time": 5968, "text": "Have you gone to dark places in your mind?"}, {"time": 5971, "text": "I'd say my family, like I see Alex going through this, my mom also has very serious depression."}, {"time": 5978, "text": "Luckily, I got the genes where I don't go through that serious level of depression that they do."}, {"time": 5984, "text": "I'd say mine is much more temporarily."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "So it's more similar to what I was feeling when I was feeling shitty about it."}, {"time": 5991, "text": "Exactly, you go through periods, yes, exactly, where like, but I know that it's not something that's clinical and that's just a genetic thing or a mental thing, whereas I know it's more serious for like my family members."}, {"time": 6024, "text": "So it's short term and then it helps me come up with the things that I enjoy the most content wise and it also long term taught me just how to have a more balanced life, like doing small things that make me happier on a daily basis, to like working out, to eating healthier, which I notice when I don't do for weeks, I just get a lot more depressed."}, {"time": 6044, "text": "What has playing chess taught you about life?"}, {"time": 6048, "text": "Has it made you better at life in any kind of way or has it made you worse?"}, {"time": 6054, "text": "You know, a lot of people kind of romanticize the idea that chess is kind of like life or life is kind of like chess and becoming better at making decisions on the chess board is gonna make you better at making decisions in life."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "Is there some truth to that?"}, {"time": 6069, "text": "I always shy away from these comparisons with chess and life."}, {"time": 6075, "text": "Cause yeah, it has both positives and negatives."}, {"time": 6077, "text": "So one thing it really helps develop from an early age is having an analytical mind, but then you could also get like paralysis of analysis where you've just thought of everything to death and you're moving too slowly when you just have to keep going forward cause there's not a great path ahead."}, {"time": 6093, "text": "So it's more like exercising your brain and staying sharp and then also applying that to other things."}, {"time": 6101, "text": "Whereas if instead of playing chess, you were watching TV or something like that, you'd probably end up being less sharp."}, {"time": 6107, "text": "Yeah, I used to, in high school, I'd always preach like, ah, chess transfers to life skills that I would teach."}, {"time": 6115, "text": "I taught chess for juvenile department for a special education school."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "I'd cite studies in prisons where like, oh, playing chess helped them with X and for your kids, it helps with teamwork and thinking over life choices."}, {"time": 6127, "text": "And now that I'm older, I don't believe in any of that BS."}, {"time": 6129, "text": "But I do think that the process of working really hard at something which takes really long to see results and you have to be really dedicated."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "And like, I remember in high school and in middle school, well, all my friends, they were having fun on the weekends and I'd have to be there studying as a chess a day and knowing one day I'll pay off, but for like two, three years, nothing paid off."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "Kind of learning that type of patience with anything, it's like, you know, like getting a real job."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "I can't say I ever really worked a real job in my life since I went straight into streaming and I got to work for myself, but I'd say it's what people go to college for."}, {"time": 6167, "text": "Like they learn how to live in the real world and I'd say that that's what chess taught me as a kid."}, {"time": 6172, "text": "When you're streaming, when you're doing the creative work, do you feel lonely?"}, {"time": 6178, "text": "So a bunch of creators talk about sort of the, it's counterintuitive because you're famous now, you know."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "Sort of, not quite, but we're very lucky to have each other."}, {"time": 6191, "text": "So is that the source of the comfort and like, is there some sense where it's isolating to have these personalities, they have to always be having fun, being wild and so on?"}, {"time": 6204, "text": "Or is it actually the opposite?"}, {"time": 6205, "text": "Like, is it a source of comfort to know that there's so many cool people out there that are giving you their love?"}, {"time": 6211, "text": "It started as a source of comfort because it started with a very small community who would be something, it would be around 200 to 300 viewers and you know, only like 30 to 40 of them would actually chat actively."}, {"time": 6225, "text": "So you felt like it was a community, not an audience."}, {"time": 6227, "text": "So you like knew them personally almost."}, {"time": 6230, "text": "And it was people who were interested in chess and I would really enjoy that."}, {"time": 6235, "text": "And then as, you know, we started growing bigger, the audience kind of changed where they're not there for you personally, they're there while you're entertaining and it changed for me."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "And I ended up being a lot more self conscious of things online and started even thinking of myself more like a product than a human being when I'm online because I had to."}, {"time": 6258, "text": "Brand."}, {"time": 6259, "text": "Otherwise you just start taking everything personally that people comment about you and it's based off a very small clip."}, {"time": 6266, "text": "I see, so it was almost a kind of a defense mechanism."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "And it took time to get enough, because even if you have tough skin, eventually it gets to you when you're online every single day listening to, you know, thousands of people's feedback on you."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "I think the loneliest part of being creator is going through burnout, which everyone is just, it's bound to happen, which is why I think we're very lucky that we have each other because right, it's a numbers game and you're viral and trendy at one point and then you have to fall."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "And then there's months where you're just grinding."}, {"time": 6300, "text": "And I just come into my friends room and I'm like, Andrea, we're irrelevant."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "That's where I'm glad, that's really like the worst part of being creator and figuring out how to get over that hump."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "But it makes me very grateful that I have my sister because I know that I'm not the only person going through it."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "And yeah, I know that most of my creator friends feel very lonely in that process because they don't have someone who's their family and their business partner and they're working by each other side by side."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "You kind of tie in your self worth to your job and your content and maybe even more extremely than other jobs because you also are the entire company and the entire product."}, {"time": 6335, "text": "So when things are going well or when things are not, you just need to be careful to not reflect it like, oh, I am doing bad."}, {"time": 6341, "text": "I am bad rather than the trends have now changed."}, {"time": 6344, "text": "There's outside things we're gonna keep going and this is just the normal waves, which is how we think about it now."}, {"time": 6349, "text": "And also just about, are we enjoying this?"}, {"time": 6352, "text": "Is this what we wanna make?"}, {"time": 6353, "text": "But we were stuck in the camp for a while when we 10Xed our viewership after the pandemic because people were home and playing chess."}, {"time": 6362, "text": "And then of course that dropped by like 70%."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "And then you see that and you're trying your best and you just kind of have to deal with it and be like, okay, I'm just gonna keep persevering and maybe it'll get better."}, {"time": 6374, "text": "I mean, this is a struggle of sorts in the 21st century of like how to be an artist, how to be a creator, how to be an interesting mind in response to this algorithm."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "I'm telling you, turning off views and likes is really good."}, {"time": 6390, "text": "I don't look at Twitch views for that reason."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "And I get obsessed with the numbers too."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "And I know Andrea does, but for me, what I try now is to be more focused in the moment, but Andrea somehow can do it even with the views."}, {"time": 6402, "text": "So you just, you get, you have fun with it."}, {"time": 6404, "text": "I'm too much of like a given to the temporary satisfaction."}, {"time": 6408, "text": "Like I like seeing, I like knowing that if something happens right now, viewership's gonna boost by a couple of hundred and seeing that I'm right, of course."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "But what about when the viewers start dropping?"}, {"time": 6418, "text": "Exactly, well, and I always, like you just have this intuition now."}, {"time": 6422, "text": "But I think also the reason that it doesn't affect me so much is when we first started our content journey, we were only Twitch streamers."}, {"time": 6430, "text": "And we, our livelihood were based on Twitch viewers."}, {"time": 6433, "text": "But now like I've learned how to recycle that content into like YouTube and shorts and other things where I know like, okay, if this stream does badly, there's so many more things you can do that also just have a much larger output."}, {"time": 6444, "text": "So it doesn't get to me as much as it did."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "Do you ever feel that with your podcasts or do you feel like it's been authentic since the start?"}, {"time": 6452, "text": "No, so there's a million things to say there."}, {"time": 6455, "text": "So one is there's a reason I stopped taking a salary at MIT and moved to Texas is I wanted my bank account to go to zero because I do my best with my back against the wall."}, {"time": 6468, "text": "So one of the comforts I have is I don't care if this podcast is popular or not."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "I want it to not be popular."}, {"time": 6474, "text": "So I don't want it to make money."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "You're failing Lex."}, {"time": 6477, "text": "Yeah, I wanna, I mean, I just do best when I'm more desperate."}, {"time": 6483, "text": "That's like one thing to say."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "Seems like a reoccurring theme with how you build up your greatest work, which is honestly very respectable."}, {"time": 6490, "text": "Yeah, so thank you."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "I wouldn't recommend."}, {"time": 6497, "text": "Right, thank you for finding the silver lining for an unhealthy mental state."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "But the other thing is I was very conscious just like with chess and those kinds of things that I love numbers."}, {"time": 6511, "text": "And I would be, if I paid attention, if I tried to be somebody at their best, like Mr."}, {"time": 6518, "text": "Beast who really pays attention to numbers, I would just not, I'd become destroyed by it."}, {"time": 6527, "text": "The highs and the lows of it."}, {"time": 6528, "text": "And I just don't think I would be creating the best work possible."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "But one of the big benefits of a podcast, it's listeners and there's an intimacy with the voice."}, {"time": 6542, "text": "And I think that is much more stable and a deeper and a more meaningful connection than YouTube."}, {"time": 6550, "text": "YouTube is a fickle mistress."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "So it's a weird drug that like, it really wants you."}, {"time": 6558, "text": "With very addicting feedback loops."}, {"time": 6560, "text": "When you have a video that's number one out of 10, oh my God, the adrenaline you get."}, {"time": 6565, "text": "And then the thing I really don't like also is the world will introduce you as a person that has a video on YouTube with some X number of views."}, {"time": 6579, "text": "Like the world wants you to be addicted to these numbers."}, {"time": 6583, "text": "Because they associate it with having done a good job."}, {"time": 6586, "text": "Because that's what people think views are, even if it's not."}, {"time": 6588, "text": "And primarily because they don't have any other signal of what's a good job."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "I think the much better signal is people that are close to you, your family, your colleagues, that say, wow, that was cool, I listened to that, that was really, I didn't know this, this was really powerful, this is really moving and so on."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "But definitely I'm terrified of numbers."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "Because I feel like, just like I said, I'd rather be a Stanley Kubrick, right?"}, {"time": 6616, "text": "You'd rather create great art, not to be pretentious, but the best possible thing you can create."}, {"time": 6624, "text": "Whatever the beauty that's, the capacity for creating beauty that's in you, I would like to maximize that."}, {"time": 6629, "text": "And I feel like for some people like Mr."}, {"time": 6629, "text": "Beast, I think those are perfectly aligned."}, {"time": 6635, "text": "Because he just loves the most epic thing possible, but not for everybody."}, {"time": 6638, "text": "I think there's a lot of people for whom that's not perfectly aligned."}, {"time": 6642, "text": "And so I'm definitely one of those."}, {"time": 6644, "text": "And I'm still really confused why anybody listens to this anyway."}, {"time": 6649, "text": "But that's also something I guess you're trying to find, trying to figure out."}, {"time": 6654, "text": "I get very afraid of ever becoming someone who just makes junk food content, where you can't stop while you're in the moment, and it has all of your attention, but when you're done, it didn't really bring any value to your life, which is something that I think the algorithm still does really reward."}, {"time": 6674, "text": "And making sure that as we are learning how to create better content, it's still something that is gonna be meaningful long term."}, {"time": 6681, "text": "Well, ultimately, you inspire a lot of young people."}, {"time": 6686, "text": "Yeah, those are the best."}, {"time": 6687, "text": "When I get messages from people who are like, I played you a year ago, and my rating was 1400, and now I'm 1900."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "I'd like to challenge you again."}, {"time": 6695, "text": "It's a 14 year old writing a former email."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "Those things are always very, very fun to get."}, {"time": 6700, "text": "And even just outside of chess, it's just empowering to see, like for young women too, to see that kind of thing."}, {"time": 6706, "text": "I mean, you guys are being yourself, and making money for being yourself, and having fun, and growing as human beings, which I think is really inspiring for people to see."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "So in that sense, it's really rewarding."}, {"time": 6719, "text": "And then the way I think about it is there is some benefit of doing entertaining type of stuff so that you get the, kind of like Mr."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "Beast does with philanthropy, right?"}, {"time": 6733, "text": "The bigger Mr."}, {"time": 6733, "text": "Beast becomes, the more effective he is at actually doing positive impact on the world."}, {"time": 6738, "text": "So those things are tied together."}, {"time": 6742, "text": "But of course, with podcasts, you guys, well, maybe you have these kinds of tense things, but what kind of ideas, what kind of people do platform?"}, {"time": 6751, "text": "What kind of person, what kind of human being do you wanna be?"}, {"time": 6759, "text": "Because you are actually becoming a person, and a set of ideas in front of the public eye, and you have to ask yourself that question really hard, like really seriously."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "Because if you're doing stuff in private, you have the complete luxury to try shit out."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "I think you have less of a luxury to try shit out because the internet can be vicious in punishing you for trying shit out."}, {"time": 6785, "text": "And do you think that's sometimes a bad thing where you have less freedom to make mistakes?"}, {"time": 6791, "text": "Yeah, you have two choices."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "So one, you put up a wall and say I don't give a shit what people think."}, {"time": 6797, "text": "I don't like doing that because I like being fragile to the world, keeping my, sort of wearing my heart on my sleeve."}, {"time": 6803, "text": "Or the other one, yeah, you have to be, you have to actually think through what you're gonna say."}, {"time": 6810, "text": "You have to think of like, what do I believe?"}, {"time": 6813, "text": "You have to be more serious about what you put out there."}, {"time": 6818, "text": "It's annoying, but it's also actually, you should have always been doing that."}, {"time": 6823, "text": "You should be deliberate with your actions and your words."}, {"time": 6828, "text": "But I don't know, it's, but some of it, it's such a balance because some of my favorite people are brilliant people that allow themselves to act ridiculous and be silly."}, {"time": 6841, "text": "Elon Musk, who's become a good friend, is the silliest human of all."}, {"time": 6845, "text": "I mean, he's incredibly brilliant and productive and so on, but allows themselves to be silly."}, {"time": 6851, "text": "And that's also inspiring to people."}, {"time": 6853, "text": "Like you don't have to be perfect."}, {"time": 6855, "text": "You don't have to, you can be a weird, a giant weird mess."}, {"time": 6859, "text": "Then it's okay."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "I think when you start to delve into political topics, into topics that really get tense for people, then you have to be a little bit more careful and deliberate."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "But it's also wise to stay the hell away from those topics in general."}, {"time": 6875, "text": "Like I mentioned to you offline, somebody I've been debating whether I want to talk to or not is Karjakin on the chess board because chess is just a game, but throughout the history of the 20th century, it was played between the Russians and the Americans and so on where they were at war, cold or hot war."}, {"time": 6897, "text": "Those are interesting conversations to be had at the Olympics and so on."}, {"time": 6903, "text": "It's not just a game."}, {"time": 6905, "text": "It's like a mini war."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "And so I have to decide whether I want to talk to him or not and those kinds of things."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "You have to make those kinds of decisions."}, {"time": 6914, "text": "For now, you guys are not playing chess with Donald Trump or Obama or so on."}, {"time": 6918, "text": "We are not right now, no."}, {"time": 6920, "text": "How long is a stream?"}, {"time": 6922, "text": "Like a few hours, right?"}, {"time": 6923, "text": "Now they're two to three hours."}, {"time": 6924, "text": "When I was first streaming, I'd stream for like six hours a day."}, {"time": 6928, "text": "A day."}, {"time": 6929, "text": "At least usually."}, {"time": 6930, "text": "Yeah, for like six to seven days a week."}, {"time": 6933, "text": "Are you doing just like a talking one?"}, {"time": 6934, "text": "No, I'd be playing chess the entire time while talking."}, {"time": 6938, "text": "And when I started streaming, that's kind of how everybody blows up on Twitch."}, {"time": 6944, "text": "You're just putting in crazy hours and you're always there."}, {"time": 6947, "text": "It's not about making the best content."}, {"time": 6949, "text": "It's about letting people feel like they're hanging out with you and just being on as much as you can."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "But I ended up feeling very burnt out because it's hard to be your best self when you're in front of a camera for that long because you do get scared of going into places where you want to learn, but you might not be the best in."}, {"time": 6969, "text": "Because it's harder to learn in public than do something that like, yeah, we're better than 99% of our viewers at chess."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "So that's a lot less scary than trying to play a game that you're bad at or discuss topics that you're interested in."}, {"time": 6982, "text": "Yeah, have the beginner's mind and be dumb at something."}, {"time": 6987, "text": "Yeah, which is where the fun is and you get to learn together, but people punish you for it on the internet."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "Yeah, I think like Alex said at the beginning, when we were grinding a lot, you don't really even have time for much of a private life because you're streaming every hour of your life and people want it, like the appeal of streamers, it's called like being parasocial where you feel like they're your friend and they like it because they want you to share everything about your life."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "Really the main challenge for me at first when trying to prioritize quantity over quality, which we're not doing anymore, was realizing that I can't turn everything I'm interested in and every passion into content."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "Before I'm like, well, I must stream more, but I like music and I like playing piano and I like reading into these topics and I like fitness and then I try to live stream all of it and that's just, at some point it's like, just enjoy your time off for those hobbies and prioritize what you're good at because that's just gonna be better for the channel overall."}, {"time": 7052, "text": "So that was a learning lesson for sure."}, {"time": 7054, "text": "It's nice because there are some intersections when I have tried new things that I really enjoy and it pays off, but that's less often."}, {"time": 7061, "text": "So it's more like you can be yourself, but only specific parts of yourself online and the rest, sometimes it's nice to just keep private and feel that you could just give it your 100% freedom."}, {"time": 7076, "text": "See, I feel like I try to be the exact same person on podcasts as in private life."}, {"time": 7083, "text": "I really don't like hiding anything."}, {"time": 7086, "text": "But you're also a generalist, right?"}, {"time": 7088, "text": "Where you have people with all topics."}, {"time": 7090, "text": "For us, we built our audience off a very specific thing so people sometimes feel like, even at the start when we started playing less chess, they're like, I subbed for chess."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "Why are you not playing chess?"}, {"time": 7101, "text": "People are tuning in for an interesting conversation on a bunch of topics."}, {"time": 7105, "text": "So like the more you are yourself, the better it is, but it is very hard when you build your brand on like one type of gaming content."}, {"time": 7111, "text": "Build your brand."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "But yeah, the way you become a generalist is you slowly expand."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "It's like expand to checkers."}, {"time": 7125, "text": "I guess that's like a downward."}, {"time": 7127, "text": "Maybe poker."}, {"time": 7128, "text": "Poker, yeah, exactly, poker."}, {"time": 7130, "text": "But also just the ideas, the space of ideas."}, {"time": 7132, "text": "And one of the cool things about chess is when you're talking over the chess board, you're, it's a kind of podcast, you know?"}, {"time": 7139, "text": "That is actually an idea we've had with playing chess while also doing a podcast and talking with people."}, {"time": 7145, "text": "It's kind of like an icebreaker."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "We're also focusing on the game at the same time."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "But you know, we are slowly evolving and we're doing more things."}, {"time": 7152, "text": "Like one thing we wanted to do is spend less time in front of the computer."}, {"time": 7156, "text": "So now we're doing a chess travel show where we go to different countries and look at the chess culture."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "So it actually feels like we're doing things that we would want to do and explore anyway."}, {"time": 7165, "text": "And maybe it's not as much in the idea space, which we both enjoy and do a lot in our own free time, but in the sharing cool experiences with our audience that we actually want to do."}, {"time": 7176, "text": "Where do you look forward to going?"}, {"time": 7177, "text": "We're going to Romania on September 9th."}, {"time": 7181, "text": "And I think this is the most exciting for me because we're going back to, you know, the country where our entire family's from, where our grandmother taught our dad who taught us how to play chess."}, {"time": 7192, "text": "It has a very strong chess culture."}, {"time": 7194, "text": "So it'll be very unique to go back and see how everything is when we haven't been back for a very long time."}, {"time": 7201, "text": "And for Romanians, like it's very rare when there's like a famous Romanian who accomplishes something, which is why like right now, Andrew Tate's the most famous Romanian."}, {"time": 7210, "text": "But he's banned for a bad reason."}, {"time": 7213, "text": "And there's like something very special about Romanian pride."}, {"time": 7217, "text": "And when we meet fellow Romanians in the US, like it's just an amazing connection."}, {"time": 7222, "text": "And like, I hear the way my dad talk about like, for example, Nadia, who was a famous Romanian gymnast and he's like, yeah, like Romania, we sucked at everything."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "But when she won the Olympics for gymnast, every kid on the street was doing gymnastics because it's very rare that they make it to that level of success."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "And I'm not saying that we're super successful, super famous, but it is really cool to meet other Romanians through chess because it's a very special bond."}, {"time": 7245, "text": "Yeah, you feel like it's a community and like you belong."}, {"time": 7250, "text": "Yeah, you can't get that anywhere else."}, {"time": 7253, "text": "Let me ask your opinion since you mentioned him, Andrew Tate, you're both women, successful women, you're both creators."}, {"time": 7261, "text": "So Andrew Tate is an example of somebody that has become exceptionally successful at galvanizing public attention, but he's also, from many perspective, a misogynist."}, {"time": 7276, "text": "Do you think I should talk to him on this podcast?"}, {"time": 7279, "text": "How would you feel as a fan as somebody, I'm talking to the great Alex and Andrea Botez and the next episode is with Andrew Tate?"}, {"time": 7292, "text": "I think it's a double edged sword and most of these things are not as black and white as they seem, you know, because on one hand, I don't agree with his beliefs and I think he said a lot of things that are very hurtful and that influence people's opinions."}, {"time": 7345, "text": "And the thing about the internet, you make the wrong decision, you're gonna pay for it."}, {"time": 7428, "text": "Would you think that's morally ethical?"}, {"time": 7429, "text": "So that is something that I think is important."}, {"time": 7434, "text": "We try to find ways to have conversations and reach some mutual understanding and try instead of just amplifying the worst about every human being."}, {"time": 7444, "text": "Well, so one of the major reasons I'm struggling with is because I really enjoy talking to brilliant women."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "I think it's also, a lot of women reached out to me saying like, it is what it is, but they're inspired when the female guest is on."}, {"time": 7460, "text": "And to me, if I talk to somebody like Andrew Tate, even if I have a really hard hitting, I think it could be a very good conversation that lessens the likelihood that a brilliant, powerful female will go on the show."}, {"time": 7477, "text": "Because they'll never watch it, but the thing we do in this society is we put labels on each other."}, {"time": 7482, "text": "Well, Lex is the person that platforms misogynists."}, {"time": 7488, "text": "I did a thing where Joe Rogan got in trouble over an N word controversy earlier in the year."}, {"time": 7496, "text": "And Joe's a good friend of mine and I said that I stand with Joe, that he's not a racist or something like that."}, {"time": 7502, "text": "And within certain communities, I'm now somebody who's an apologist for racists, right?"}, {"time": 7509, "text": "Or a racist myself, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 7512, "text": "And we put labels without ever listening to the content, without ever sort of, actually just even the very simple step or it seems to be difficult of like, taking on the best possible interpretation of what a person said and giving them the benefit of the doubt and having empathy for another person."}, {"time": 7531, "text": "So you have to play in this field where people will assign labels to each other and it's difficult."}, {"time": 7539, "text": "But ultimately, I believe, I hope that good conversations is a way to like a greater understanding for people to grow together as a society and improve and learn the lessons, the mistakes of the past."}, {"time": 7552, "text": "But you also have to play this game where people just like putting labels on each other and canceling each other over those."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "Or that guy said one thing nice about Donald Trump, he must be a far right Nazi."}, {"time": 7564, "text": "Or the opposite, that this person said something nice about the vaccine, he must be a far left whatever, because apologist for whatever, for Fauci."}, {"time": 7580, "text": "Or most of us I think are ultimately in the middle."}, {"time": 7583, "text": "It's a weird, it's a weird thing."}, {"time": 7585, "text": "But I think, and it's also painful on a personal level."}, {"time": 7588, "text": "Like people have written to me about things like single words, half sentences that I've said about either Putin or Zelensky where they have hate towards me because of what I said."}, {"time": 7603, "text": "Either both directions."}, {"time": 7605, "text": "I've now accumulated very passionate people that some call me a Putin apologist, some call me a Zelensky apologist."}, {"time": 7614, "text": "And it hurts to, given how much I have family there, how much I've seen of suffering there, and to carry that burden over time and not let it destroy you is tough."}, {"time": 7624, "text": "So like, do you wanna take on another thing like that when you have conversations?"}, {"time": 7629, "text": "Or can I just talk to awesome people like you two?"}, {"time": 7633, "text": "Where it's not that burden."}, {"time": 7634, "text": "We're not controversial."}, {"time": 7636, "text": "Or you're interesting, you're fascinating, you're

for 27 years, he was the best in his field by far, but would he be able to stand up to someone like Magnus Carlsen who has had these tools?"}, {"time": 7845, "text": "So most chess players have said

study chess with."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "And of course, if you compare him to like Gary Kasparov, he plays most like Stockfish, but Gary Kasparov at his time, he beat more players of his skill

championships and not feeling a joy out of that."}, {"time": 8042, "text": "So maybe by not doing that and focusing instead on a goal like 2,900, he'll be more likely to accomplish it because he's focusing on what actually motivates him to play chess."}, {"time": 8053, "text": "But I do think that it will hurt how we judge the next world champion."}, {"time": 8061, "text": "I think it won't change him being the best player in the world."}, {"time": 8065, "text": "And for someone to replace him, even let's say like Nepo versus Sting, even if one of them win and right on some stance, it does lower the merit because now who has the world chess championship title isn't actually the best player in the world."}, {"time": 8079, "text": "And that has happened before in the past, but still going to take the same effort to prove when they would pass him like 10, 20 years to become stronger than Magnus."}, {"time": 8089, "text": "So I don't think it changes the skill level that it takes to become the best chess player in the world."}, {"time": 8094, "text": "I think for chess fans, it's very disappointing, but I think in the overall like grand scheme of like the public view to people who don't really, so like, you know, what breaks the popular culture and you think of what names people know who don't play chess like Bobby Fischer did it."}, {"time": 8110, "text": "Most people know

determine the best player."}, {"time": 8144, "text": "Like, and it's too exciting inducing to him to have a small number of games."}, {"time": 8150, "text": "He doesn't mind losing, which is really

the world championship, and then he would enjoy it much more."}, {"time": 8188, "text": "And also play shorter games because they emphasize the like pure chess, actually being able to like much more

step up and meet him in a place that makes sense, change the world championship."}, {"time": 8216, "text": "So FIDE changing it somehow, a loss for that."}, {"time": 8220, "text": "Or having other

more and more, like the Crypto Cup and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 8236, "text": "And the Grand Tour does play in, which takes a lot of the top players and they do it online in shorter
