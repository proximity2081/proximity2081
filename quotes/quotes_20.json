[{"title": "Yann LeCun: Dark Matter of Intelligence and Self-Supervised Learning | Lex Fridman Podcast #258", "id": "SGzMElJ11Cc", "quotes": [{"time": 290, "text": "So you have to figure out a way without human assistance or without significant amount of human assistance to get that truth from the world."}, {"time": 299, "text": "So the mystery there is how much signal is there?"}, {"time": 303, "text": "How much truth is there that the world gives you?"}, {"time": 306, "text": "Whether it's the human world, like you watch YouTube or something like that, or it's the more natural world."}, {"time": 312, "text": "So how much signal is there?"}, {"time": 314, "text": "So here's the trick."}, {"time": 316, "text": "There is way more signal in sort of a self supervised setting than there is in either a supervised or reinforcement setting."}, {"time": 324, "text": "And this is going to my analogy of the cake."}, {"time": 330, "text": "The cake as someone has called it, where when you try to figure out how much information you ask the machine to predict and how much feedback you give the machine at every trial, in reinforcement learning, you give the machine a single scalar."}, {"time": 343, "text": "You tell the machine you did good, you did bad."}, {"time": 345, "text": "And you only tell this to the machine once in a while."}, {"time": 349, "text": "When I say you, it could be the universe telling the machine, right?"}, {"time": 354, "text": "But it's just one scalar."}, {"time": 355, "text": "And so as a consequence, you cannot possibly learn something very complicated without many, many, many trials where you get many, many feedbacks of this type."}, {"time": 364, "text": "Supervised learning, you give a few bits to the machine at every sample."}, {"time": 371, "text": "Let's say you're training a system on recognizing images on ImageNet with 1000 categories, that's a little less than 10 bits of information per sample."}, {"time": 382, "text": "But self supervised learning, here is the setting."}, {"time": 384, "text": "Ideally, we don't know how to do this yet, but ideally you would show a machine a segment of video and then stop the video and ask the machine to predict what's going to happen next."}, {"time": 397, "text": "And so we let the machine predict and then you let time go by and show the machine what actually happened and hope the machine will learn to do a better job at predicting next time around."}, {"time": 409, "text": "There's a huge amount of information you give the machine because it's an entire video clip of the future after the video clip you fed it in the first place."}, {"time": 420, "text": "So both for language and for vision, there's a subtle, seemingly trivial construction, but maybe that's representative of what is required to create intelligence, which is filling the gap."}, {"time": 433, "text": "So it sounds dumb, but can you, it is possible you could solve all of intelligence in this way, just for both language, just give a sentence and continue it or give a sentence and there's a gap in it, some words blanked out and you fill in what words go there."}, {"time": 455, "text": "For vision, you give a sequence of images and predict what's going to happen next, or you fill in what happened in between."}, {"time": 463, "text": "Do you think it's possible that formulation alone as a signal for self supervised learning can solve intelligence for vision and language?"}, {"time": 473, "text": "I think that's the best shot at the moment."}, {"time": 476, "text": "So whether this will take us all the way to human level intelligence or something, or just cat level intelligence is not clear, but among all the possible approaches that people have proposed, I think it's our best shot."}, {"time": 489, "text": "So I think this idea of an intelligent system filling in the blanks, either predicting the future, inferring the past, filling in missing information, I'm currently filling the blank of what is behind your head and what your head looks like from the back, because I have basic knowledge about how humans are made."}, {"time": 513, "text": "And I don't know what you're going to say, at which point you're going to speak, whether you're going to move your head this way or that way, which way you're going to look, but I know you're not going to just dematerialize and reappear three meters down the hall, because I know what's possible and what's impossible according to intuitive physics."}, {"time": 531, "text": "You have a model of what's possible and what's impossible and then you'd be very surprised if it happens and then you'll have to reconstruct your model."}, {"time": 537, "text": "Right, so that's the model of the world."}, {"time": 539, "text": "It's what tells you, what fills in the blanks."}, {"time": 542, "text": "So given your partial information about the state of the world, given by your perception, your model of the world fills in the missing information and that includes predicting the future, re predicting the past, filling in things you don't immediately perceive."}, {"time": 558, "text": "And that doesn't have to be purely generic vision or visual information or generic language."}, {"time": 564, "text": "You can go to specifics like predicting what control decision you make when you're driving in a lane, you have a sequence of images from a vehicle and then you have information if you record it on video where the car ended up going so you can go back in time and predict where the car went based on the visual information."}, {"time": 586, "text": "That's very specific, domain specific."}, {"time": 589, "text": "Right, but the question is whether we can come up with sort of a generic method for training machines to do this kind of prediction or filling in the blanks."}, {"time": 599, "text": "So right now, this type of approach has been unbelievably successful in the context of natural language processing."}, {"time": 608, "text": "Every modern natural language processing is pre trained in self supervised manner to fill in the blanks."}, {"time": 613, "text": "You show it a sequence of words, you remove 10% of them and then you train some gigantic neural net to predict the words that are missing."}, {"time": 620, "text": "And once you've pre trained that network, you can use the internal representation learned by it as input to something that you train supervised or whatever."}, {"time": 632, "text": "That's been incredibly successful."}, {"time": 633, "text": "Not so successful in images, although it's making progress and it's based on sort of manual data augmentation."}, {"time": 642, "text": "We can go into this later, but what has not been successful yet is training from video."}, {"time": 647, "text": "So getting a machine to learn to represent the visual world, for example, by just watching video."}, {"time": 652, "text": "Nobody has really succeeded in doing this."}, {"time": 654, "text": "Okay, well, let's kind of give a high level overview."}, {"time": 657, "text": "What's the difference in kind and in difficulty between vision and language?"}, {"time": 663, "text": "So you said people haven't been able to really kind of crack the problem of vision open in terms of self supervised learning, but that may not be necessarily because it's fundamentally more difficult."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Maybe like when we're talking about achieving, like passing the Turing test in the full spirit of the Turing test in language might be harder than vision."}, {"time": 686, "text": "So in your view, which is harder or perhaps are they just the same problem?"}, {"time": 691, "text": "When the farther we get to solving each, the more we realize it's all the same thing."}, {"time": 696, "text": "It's all the same cake."}, {"time": 697, "text": "I think what I'm looking for are methods that make them look essentially like the same cake, but currently they're not."}, {"time": 704, "text": "And the main issue with learning world models or learning predictive models is that the prediction is never a single thing because the world is not entirely predictable."}, {"time": 719, "text": "It may be deterministic or stochastic."}, {"time": 720, "text": "We can get into the philosophical discussion about it, but even if it's deterministic, it's not entirely predictable."}, {"time": 727, "text": "And so if I play a short video clip and then I ask you to predict what's going to happen next, there's many, many plausible continuations for that video clip and the number of continuation grows with the interval of time that you're asking the system to make a prediction for."}, {"time": 746, "text": "And so one big question with self supervised learning is how you represent this uncertainty, how you represent multiple discrete outcomes, how you represent a sort of continuum of possible outcomes, et cetera."}, {"time": 760, "text": "And if you are sort of a classical machine learning person, you say, oh, you just represent a distribution, right?"}, {"time": 769, "text": "And that we know how to do when we're predicting words, missing words in the text, because you can have a neural net give a score for every word in the dictionary."}, {"time": 778, "text": "It's a big list of numbers, maybe 100,000 or so."}, {"time": 782, "text": "And you can turn them into a probability distribution that tells you when I say a sentence, the cat is chasing the blank in the kitchen."}, {"time": 793, "text": "There are only a few words that make sense there."}, {"time": 795, "text": "It could be a mouse or it could be a lizard spot or something like that, right?"}, {"time": 801, "text": "And if I say the blank is chasing the blank in the Savannah, you also have a bunch of plausible options for those two words, right?"}, {"time": 810, "text": "Because you have kind of a underlying reality that you can refer to to sort of fill in those blanks."}, {"time": 818, "text": "So you cannot say for sure in the Savannah, if it's a lion or a cheetah or whatever, you cannot know if it's a zebra or a do or whatever, wildebeest, the same thing."}, {"time": 835, "text": "But you can represent the uncertainty by just a long list of numbers."}, {"time": 838, "text": "Now, if I do the same thing with video, when I ask you to predict a video clip, it's not a discrete set of potential frames."}, {"time": 847, "text": "You have to have somewhere representing a sort of infinite number of plausible continuations of multiple frames in a high dimensional continuous space."}, {"time": 857, "text": "And we just have no idea how to do this properly."}, {"time": 860, "text": "Fine night, high dimensional."}, {"time": 862, "text": "So like you, It's finite high dimensional, yes."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Just like the words, they try to get it down to a small finite set of like under a million, something like that."}, {"time": 875, "text": "I mean, it's kind of ridiculous that we're doing a distribution over every single possible word for language and it works."}, {"time": 882, "text": "It feels like that's a really dumb way to do it."}, {"time": 886, "text": "Like there seems to be like there should be some more compressed representation of the distribution of the words."}, {"time": 895, "text": "You're right about that."}, {"time": 896, "text": "And so do you have any interesting ideas about how to represent all of reality in a compressed way such that you can form a distribution over it?"}, {"time": 903, "text": "That's one of the big questions, how do you do that?"}, {"time": 906, "text": "Right, I mean, what's kind of another thing that really is stupid about, I shouldn't say stupid, but like simplistic about current approaches to self supervised learning in NLP in text is that not only do you represent a giant distribution over words, but for multiple words that are missing, those distributions are essentially independent of each other."}, {"time": 930, "text": "And you don't pay too much of a price for this."}, {"time": 933, "text": "So you can't, so the system in the sentence that I gave earlier, if it gives a certain probability for a lion and cheetah, and then a certain probability for gazelle, wildebeest and zebra, those two probabilities are independent of each other."}, {"time": 955, "text": "And it's not the case that those things are independent."}, {"time": 958, "text": "Lions actually attack like bigger animals than cheetahs."}, {"time": 961, "text": "So there's a huge independent hypothesis in this process, which is not actually true."}, {"time": 967, "text": "The reason for this is that we don't know how to represent properly distributions over combinatorial sequences of symbols, essentially because the number grows exponentially with the length of the symbols."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And so we have to use tricks for this, but those techniques can get around, like don't even deal with it."}, {"time": 987, "text": "So the big question is would there be some sort of abstract latent representation of text that would say that when I switch lion for gazelle, lion for cheetah, I also have to switch zebra for gazelle?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "Yeah, so this independence assumption, let me throw some criticism at you that I often hear and see how you respond."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "So this kind of filling in the blanks is just statistics."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "You're not learning anything like the deep underlying concepts."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "You're just mimicking stuff from the past."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "You're not learning anything new such that you can use it to generalize about the world."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "Or okay, let me just say the crude version, which is just statistics."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "It's not intelligence."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "What do you have to say to that?"}, {"time": 1039, "text": "What do you usually say to that if you kind of hear this kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1042, "text": "I don't get into those discussions because they are kind of pointless."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "So first of all, it's quite possible that intelligence is just statistics."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "It's just statistics of a particular kind."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "Yes, this is the philosophical question."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "It's kind of is it possible that intelligence is just statistics?"}, {"time": 1060, "text": "Yeah, but what kind of statistics?"}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So if you are asking the question, are the models of the world that we learn, do they have some notion of causality?"}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So if the criticism comes from people who say, current machine learning system don't care about causality, which by the way is wrong, I agree with them."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "Your model of the world should have your actions as one of the inputs."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "And that will drive you to learn causal models of the world where you know what intervention in the world will cause what result."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "Or you can do this by observation of other agents acting in the world and observing the effect."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Other humans, for example."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So I think at some level of description, intelligence is just statistics."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "But that doesn't mean you don't have models that have deep mechanistic explanation for what goes on."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "The question is how do you learn them?"}, {"time": 1121, "text": "That's the question I'm interested in."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "Because a lot of people who actually voice their criticism say that those mechanistic model have to come from someplace else."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "They have to come from human designers, they have to come from I don't know what."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "And obviously we learn them."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "Or if we don't learn them as an individual, nature learn them for us using evolution."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "So regardless of what you think, those processes have been learned somehow."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So if you look at the human brain, just like when we humans introspect about how the brain works, it seems like when we think about what is intelligence, we think about the high level stuff, like the models we've constructed, concepts like cognitive science, like concepts of memory and reasoning module, almost like these high level modules."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Is this serve as a good analogy?"}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Like are we ignoring the dark matter, the basic low level mechanisms?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Just like we ignore the way the operating system works, we're just using the high level software."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "We're ignoring that at the low level, the neural network might be doing something like statistics."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "Like meaning, sorry to use this word probably incorrectly and crudely, but doing this kind of fill in the gap kind of learning and just kind of updating the model constantly in order to be able to support the raw sensory information to predict it and then adjust to the prediction when it's wrong."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "But like when we look at our brain at the high level, it feels like we're doing, like we're playing chess, like we're like playing with high level concepts and we're stitching them together and we're putting them into longterm memory."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "But really what's going underneath is something we're not able to introspect, which is this kind of simple, large neural network that's just filling in the gaps."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Right, well, okay."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So there's a lot of questions and a lot of answers there."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "Okay, so first of all, there's a whole school of thought in neuroscience, computational neuroscience in particular, that likes the idea of predictive coding, which is really related to the idea I was talking about in self supervised learning."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So everything is about prediction."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "The essence of intelligence is the ability to predict and everything the brain does is trying to predict, predict everything from everything else."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Okay, and that's really sort of the underlying principle, if you want, that self supervised learning is trying to kind of reproduce this idea of prediction as kind of an essential mechanism of task independent learning, if you want."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "The next step is what kind of intelligence are you interested in reproducing?"}, {"time": 1281, "text": "And of course, we all think about trying to reproduce sort of high level cognitive processes in humans, but like with machines, we're not even at the level of even reproducing the learning processes in a cat brain."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "The most intelligent or intelligent systems don't have as much common sense as a house cat."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "So how is it that cats learn?"}, {"time": 1305, "text": "And cats don't do a whole lot of reasoning."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "They certainly have causal models."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "They certainly have, because many cats can figure out how they can act on the world to get what they want."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "They certainly have a fantastic model of intuitive physics, certainly the dynamics of their own bodies, but also of praise and things like that."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "So they're pretty smart."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "They only do this with about 800 million neurons."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "We are not anywhere close to reproducing this kind of thing."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "So to some extent, I could say, let's not even worry about like the high level cognition and kind of longterm planning and reasoning that humans can do until we figure out like, can we even reproduce what cats are doing?"}, {"time": 1352, "text": "Now that said, this ability to learn world models, I think is the key to the possibility of learning machines that can also reason."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "So whenever I give a talk, I say there are three challenges in the three main challenges in machine learning."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "The first one is getting machines to learn to represent the world and I'm proposing self supervised learning."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "The second is getting machines to reason in ways that are compatible with essentially gradient based learning because this is what deep learning is all about really."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And the third one is something we have no idea how to solve, at least I have no idea how to solve is can we get machines to learn hierarchical representations of action plans?"}, {"time": 1397, "text": "We know how to train them to learn hierarchical representations of perception with convolutional nets and things like that and transformers, but what about action plans?"}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Can we get them to spontaneously learn good hierarchical representations of actions?"}, {"time": 1410, "text": "Also gradient based."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Yeah, all of that needs to be somewhat differentiable so that you can apply sort of gradient based learning, which is really what deep learning is about."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So it's background, knowledge, ability to reason in a way that's differentiable that is somehow connected, deeply integrated with that background knowledge or builds on top of that background knowledge and then given that background knowledge be able to make hierarchical plans in the world."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "So if you take classical optimal control, there's something in classical optimal control called model predictive control."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "And it's been around since the early sixties."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "NASA uses that to compute trajectories of rockets."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And the basic idea is that you have a predictive model of the rocket, let's say, or whatever system you intend to control, which given the state of the system at time T and given an action that you're taking the system."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "So for a rocket to be thrust and all the controls you can have, it gives you the state of the system at time T plus Delta T, right?"}, {"time": 1478, "text": "So basically a differential equation, something like that."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "And if you have this model and you have this model in the form of some sort of neural net or some sort of a set of formula that you can back propagate gradient through, you can do what's called model predictive control or gradient based model predictive control."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "So you can unroll that model in time."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "You feed it a hypothesized sequence of actions."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "And then you have some objective function that measures how well at the end of the trajectory, the system has succeeded or matched what you wanted to do."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "Is it a robot harm?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "Have you grasped the object you want to grasp?"}, {"time": 1520, "text": "If it's a rocket, are you at the right place near the space station, things like that."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And by back propagation through time, and again, this was invented in the 1960s, by optimal control theorists, you can figure out what is the optimal sequence of actions that will get my system to the best final state."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "It's basically planning."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "And a lot of planning systems in robotics are actually based on this."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "And you can think of this as a form of reasoning."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "So to take the example of the teenager driving a car, you have a pretty good dynamical model of the car."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "It doesn't need to be very accurate."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "But you know, again, that if you turn the wheel to the right and there is a cliff, you're gonna run off the cliff, right?"}, {"time": 1566, "text": "You don't need to have a very accurate model to predict that."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And you can run this in your mind and decide not to do it for that reason."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "Because you can predict in advance that the result is gonna be bad."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "So you can sort of imagine different scenarios and then employ or take the first step in the scenario that is most favorable and then repeat the process again."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "The scenario that is most favorable and then repeat the process of planning."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "That's called receding horizon model predictive control."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "So even all those things have names going back decades."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "And so if you're not a classical optimal control, the model of the world is not generally learned."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "Sometimes a few parameters you have to identify."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "That's called systems identification."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "But generally, the model is mostly deterministic and mostly built by hand."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "So the question of AI, I think the big challenge of AI for the next decade is how do we get machines to learn predictive models of the world that deal with uncertainty and deal with the real world in all this complexity?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "So it's not just the trajectory of a rocket, which you can reduce to first principles."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "It's not even just the trajectory of a robot arm, which again, you can model by careful mathematics."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "But it's everything else, everything we observe in the world."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "People, behavior, physical systems that involve collective phenomena, like water or trees and branches in a tree or something or complex things that humans have no trouble developing abstract representations and predictive model for, but we still don't know how to do with machines."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Where do you put in these three, maybe in the planning stages, the game theoretic nature of this world, where your actions not only respond to the dynamic nature of the world, the environment, but also affect it."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "So if there's other humans involved, is this point number four, or is it somehow integrated into the hierarchical representation of action in your view?"}, {"time": 1686, "text": "I think it's integrated."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "It's just that now your model of the world has to deal with, it just makes it more complicated."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "The fact that humans are complicated and not easily predictable, that makes your model of the world much more complicated, that much more complicated."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Well, there's a chess, I mean, I suppose chess is an analogy."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "So multicolored tree search."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "There's a, I go, you go, I go, you go."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "Like Andre Capote recently gave a talk at MIT about car doors."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "I think there's some machine learning too, but mostly car doors."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "And there's a dynamic nature to the car, like the person opening the door, checking, I mean, he wasn't talking about that."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "He was talking about the perception problem of what the ontology of what defines a car door, this big philosophical question."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "But to me, it was interesting because it's obvious that the person opening the car doors, they're trying to get out, like here in New York, trying to get out of the car."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "You slowing down is going to signal something."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "You speeding up is gonna signal something, and that's a dance."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "It's a asynchronous chess game."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "So it feels like it's not just, I mean, I guess you can integrate all of them to one giant model, like the entirety of these little interactions."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "Because it's not as complicated as chess."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "It's just like a little dance."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "We do like a little dance together, and then we figure it out."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "Well, in some ways it's way more complicated than chess because it's continuous, it's uncertain in a continuous manner."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "It doesn't feel more complicated."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "But it doesn't feel more complicated because that's what we've evolved to solve."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "This is the kind of problem we've evolved to solve."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "And so we're good at it because nature has made us good at it."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "Nature has not made us good at chess."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "We completely suck at chess."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "In fact, that's why we designed it as a game, is to be challenging."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "And if there is something that recent progress in chess and Go has made us realize is that humans are really terrible at those things, like really bad."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "There was a story right before AlphaGo that the best Go players thought there were maybe two or three stones behind an ideal player that they would call God."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "In fact, no, there are like nine or 10 stones behind."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "I mean, we're just bad."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "So we're not good at, and it's because we have limited working memory."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "We're not very good at doing this tree exploration that computers are much better at doing than we are."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "But we are much better at learning differentiable models to the world."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "I mean, I said differentiable in a kind of, I should say not differentiable in the sense that we went back far through it, but in the sense that our brain has some mechanism for estimating gradients of some kind."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "And that's what makes us efficient."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "So if you have an agent that consists of a model of the world, which in the human brain is basically the entire front half of your brain, an objective function, which in humans is a combination of two things."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "There is your sort of intrinsic motivation module, which is in the basal ganglia, the base of your brain."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "That's the thing that measures pain and hunger and things like that, like immediate feelings and emotions."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "And then there is the equivalent of what people in reinforcement learning call a critic, which is a sort of module that predicts ahead what the outcome of a situation will be."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "And so it's not a cost function, but it's sort of not an objective function, but it's sort of a train predictor of the ultimate objective function."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "And that also is differentiable."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "And so if all of this is differentiable, your cost function, your critic, your world model, then you can use gradient based type methods to do planning, to do reasoning, to do learning, to do all the things that we'd like an intelligent agent to do."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "And gradient based learning, like what's your intuition?"}, {"time": 1935, "text": "That's probably at the core of what can solve intelligence."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So you don't need like logic based reasoning in your view."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "I don't know how to make logic based reasoning compatible with efficient learning."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "Okay, I mean, there is a big question, perhaps a philosophical question."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "I mean, it's not that philosophical, but that we can ask is that all the learning algorithms we know from engineering and computer science proceed by optimizing some objective function."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "So one question we may ask is, does learning in the brain minimize an objective function?"}, {"time": 1974, "text": "I mean, it could be a composite of multiple objective functions, but it's still an objective function."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Second, if it does optimize an objective function, does it do it by some sort of gradient estimation?"}, {"time": 1989, "text": "It doesn't need to be a back prop, but some way of estimating the gradient in efficient manner whose complexity is on the same order of magnitude as actually running the inference."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "Because you can't afford to do things like perturbing a weight in your brain to figure out what the effect is."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "And then sort of, you can do sort of estimating gradient by perturbation."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "To me, it seems very implausible that the brain uses some sort of zeroth order black box gradient free optimization, because it's so much less efficient than gradient optimization."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "So it has to have a way of estimating gradient."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "Is it possible that some kind of logic based reasoning emerges in pockets as a useful, like you said, if the brain is an objective function, maybe it's a mechanism for creating objective functions."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "It's a mechanism for creating knowledge bases, for example, that can then be queried."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "Like maybe it's like an efficient representation of knowledge that's learned in a gradient based way or something like that."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "Well, so I think there is a lot of different types of intelligence."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "So first of all, I think the type of logical reasoning that we think about that we are maybe stemming from sort of classical AI of the 1970s and 80s."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "I think humans use that relatively rarely and are not particularly good at it."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "But we judge each other based on our ability to solve those rare problems."}, {"time": 2080, "text":

actually."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "With your heritage, I'm sure you're good at chess."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "No, stereotypes."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "Not all stereotypes are true."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "Well, I'm terrible at chess."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So, but I think perhaps another type of intelligence that I have is this ability of sort of building models to the world from reasoning obviously, but also data."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And those models generally are more kind of analogical."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "So it's reasoning by simulation, and by analogy, where you use one model to apply to a new situation."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "Even though you've never seen that situation, you can sort of connect it to a situation you've encountered before."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "And your reasoning is more akin to some sort of internal simulation."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "So you're kind of simulating what's happening when you're building, I don't know, a box out of wood or something, right?"}, {"time": 2144, "text": "You can imagine in advance what would be the result of cutting the wood in this particular way."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "Are you going to use screws or nails or whatever?"}, {"time": 2152, "text": "When you are interacting with someone, you also have a model of that person and sort of interact with that person, having this model in mind to kind of tell the person what you think is useful to them."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "So I think this ability to construct models to the world is basically the essence, the essence of intelligence."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "And the ability to use it then to plan actions that will fulfill a particular criterion, of course, is necessary as well."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "So I'm going to ask you a series of impossible questions as we keep asking, as I've been doing."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "So if that's the fundamental sort of dark matter of intelligence, this ability to form a background model, what's your intuition about how much knowledge is required?"}, {"time": 2201, "text": "You know, I think dark matter, you could put a percentage on it of the composition of the universe and how much of it is dark matter, how much of it is dark energy, how much information do you think is required to be a house cat?"}, {"time": 2219, "text": "So you have to be able to, when you see a box going in, when you see a human compute the most evil action, if there's a thing that's near an edge, you knock it off, all of that, plus the extra stuff you mentioned, which is a great self awareness of the physics of your own body and the world."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "How much knowledge is required, do you think, to solve it?"}, {"time": 2242, "text": "I don't even know how to measure an answer to that question."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "I'm not sure how to measure it, but whatever it is, it fits in about 800,000 neurons, 800 million neurons."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "What's the representation does?"}, {"time": 2256, "text": "Everything, all knowledge, everything, right?"}, {"time": 2260, "text": "You know, it's less than a billion."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "A dog is 2 billion, but a cat is less than 1 billion."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "And so multiply that by a thousand and you get the number of synapses."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "And I think almost all of it is learned through this, you know, a sort of self supervised running, although, you know, I think a tiny sliver is learned through reinforcement running and certainly very little through, you know, classical supervised running, although it's not even clear how supervised running actually works in the biological world."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "So I think almost all of it is self supervised running, but it's driven by the sort of ingrained objective functions that a cat or a human have at the base of their brain, which kind of drives their behavior."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "So, you know, nature tells us you're hungry."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "It doesn't tell us how to feed ourselves."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "That's something that the rest of our brain has to figure out, right?"}, {"time": 2315, "text": "What's interesting is there might be more like deeper objective functions than allowing the whole thing."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "So hunger may be some kind of, now you go to like neurobiology, it might be just the brain trying to maintain homeostasis."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "So hunger is just one of the human perceivable symptoms of the brain being unhappy with the way things are currently."}, {"time": 2341, "text": "It could be just like one really dumb objective function at the core."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "But that's how behavior is driven."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "The fact that, you know, or basal ganglia drive us to do things that are different from say an orangutan or certainly a cat is what makes, you know, human nature versus orangutan nature versus cat nature."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "So for example, you know, our basal ganglia drives us to seek the company of other humans."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "And that's because nature has figured out that we need to be social animals for our species to survive."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "And it's true of many primates."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "It's not true of orangutans."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "Orangutans are solitary animals."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "They don't seek the company of others."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "In fact, they avoid them."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "In fact, they scream at them when they come too close because they're territorial."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "Because for their survival, you know, evolution has figured out that's the best thing."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "I mean, they're occasionally social, of course, for, you know, reproduction and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "But they're mostly solitary."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "So all of those behaviors are not part of intelligence."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "You know, people say, oh, you're never gonna have intelligent machines because, you know, human intelligence is social."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "But then you look at orangutans, you look at octopus."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "Octopus never know their parents."}, {"time": 2418,

they're adults."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "In two years, they're dead."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "So there are things that we think, as humans, are intimately linked with intelligence, like social interaction, like language."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "We think, I think we give way too much importance to language as a substrate of intelligence as humans."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "Because we

could have, you could just have a cat sitting there looking at the waves, at the ocean waves, and figure a lot of it out."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "It needs to have sort of, you know, the right set

interesting."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "You're hardwired to want to walk."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "That's not, there's gotta be a deeper need for walking."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "I think it was

train this neural net, those two identical copies of this neural net to produce an output representation, a vector in such a way that the representation for those two images are as close to each other

make sure that when you show two images that are different, the system will produce different things?"}, {"time": 2901, "text": "Because if you don't have a specific provision for this, the system

collapse."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "Now, how do you avoid collapse?"}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So there's two ideas."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "One idea that I proposed in the early 90s with my

project of doing signature verification."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "So we would collect signatures from, like multiple signatures on the same person and then train a neural net to produce the same

encoding was then used to compare whether the signature matches or not."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "So then you would sign, you would run through the neural net and then you would compare the output

mask part of the image and you train a system, which in this case is a transformer because the transformer represents the image as non overlapping patches, so it's easy to mask patches and things like that."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "Okay, but then my question transfers to that problem, the masking, like why should the mask be square or rectangle?"}, {"time": 3820, "text": "So it doesn't matter,

no, but like something that's challenging, like optimally challenging."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "So like, I mean, maybe it's a metaphor that doesn't apply, but you're, it seems like there's a data augmentation or masking, there's an interactive element with it."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "Like you're almost like playing with an image."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "And like, it's like the way we

time you see a percept, you also, you can perturb it in some way."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "And then the principle of the training procedure is to minimize the difference of the output or the

is basically the same thing, right?"}, {"time": 3915, "text": "You're training a system to reproduce the input, the complete inputs and filling the input and filling the blanks, regardless of which parts are missing, and that's really the underlying principle."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "And you could imagine sort of, even in the brain, some sort of neural principle where, you know, neurons kind of oscillate, right?"}, {"time": 3932, "text": "So they take their activity and then temporarily they kind of shut off to, you know, force the rest of the system to basically reconstruct the input without their help, you know?"}, {"time": 3944, "text": "And, I mean, you could imagine, you know, more or less biologically possible processes."}, {"time": 3951, "text": "And I guess with this

time."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "Because I was thinking, like, you might want to be clever about the way you do all these procedures, you know, but that's only, it's somehow costly to do every iteration, but it's not really."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "And then there is, you know, data augmentation without explicit data augmentation."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "This data augmentation by

that if you want, and you certainly need a causal model of the world that allows you to predict the consequences of your actions, to train that model, you need to take actions, right?"}, {"time": 4622, "text": "You need to be able to act in a world and see the effect for you to be, to learn causal models of the world."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "So that's not obvious because you can observe others."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "You can observe others."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "And you can infer that they're similar to you and then you can learn from that."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "Yeah,

machine."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "So I think the action part would be necessary for having causal models of the world."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "The second reason it may be necessary, or at least more efficient, is that active learning basically, you know, goes for the jugular of what you don't know, right?"}, {"time": 4664, "text": "Is, you know, obvious areas of uncertainty about your world

make the process exist."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "The, so what process, what learning process is it that active learning makes more efficient?"}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And I'm asking that first question, you know, you know, we haven't answered that question yet."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "So, you know, I worry about active learning once this question is..."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "So it's the more fundamental question to ask."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "And if active learning or interaction increases the efficiency of the learning, see, sometimes it becomes very different if the

orthodox folk speculative hypothesis about consciousness."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "So we're talking about the study of a world model."}, {"time": 4832, "text": "And I think, you know, our entire

a task that we do repeatedly, it goes from the sort of deliberate reasoning using model of the world and prediction and perhaps something like model predictive control, which I was talking about

to stop talking."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "So that suggests you only have one model in your head."}, {"time": 4944, "text": "And it might suggest the idea that consciousness basically is the module

there's some kind of chemicals in biology that's creating a feeling, like it feels to experience some of these things."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "That's kind of like the hard question is, what the heck is that and why is that useful?"}, {"time": 5004, "text": "Maybe the more pragmatic question, why is it useful to feel like this is really you experiencing this versus just like information being processed?"}, {"time": 5014, "text": "It could be just a very nice side effect of the way we evolved."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "That's just very useful to feel a sense of ownership to the decisions

fine to do a lot of those things or explore, you know, dangerous areas and things like that."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "It would kind of change your relationship."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "So now it's very likely that robots would be like that because, you know, they'll be based on perhaps technology that is somewhat similar to today's technology and you can always have a backup."}, {"time":

back, what has been the successes, the failures, the lessons learned from the eight years of FAIR?"}, {"time": 6614, "text": "And maybe you can also give context of where does the newly minted meta AI

exactly eight years ago."}, {"time": 6630, "text": "It wasn't called FAIR yet."}, {"time": 6631, "text": "It took that name a few months later."}, {"time": 6634, "text": "And at the time I joined Facebook, there was a group called the AI group that had about 12 engineers and a few scientists, like, you know, 10 engineers and two scientists or something like that."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "I ran it for three and a half years as a director, you know, hired the first few scientists and kind of set up the culture and organized it, you know, explained to the Facebook leadership what fundamental research was about and how it can work within industry and how it needs to be open and everything."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "And so if you were to take out, you know, deep learning out of Facebook services now and Meta more generally, I mean, the company would literally crumble."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "I mean, it's completely built around AI these days."}, {"time": 6721, "text": "And it's really essential to the operations."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "So what happened after three and a half years is that I changed role, I became chief scientist."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "So I'm not doing day to day management of FAIR anymore."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "I'm more of a kind of, you know, think about strategy and things like that."}, {"time": 6738, "text": "And I carry my, I conduct my own research."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "I have, you know, my own kind of research group working on self supervised learning and things like this, which I didn't have time to do when I was director."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "So now FAIR is run by Joel Pinot and Antoine Bord together because FAIR is kind of split in two now."}, {"time": 6756, "text": "There's something called FAIR Labs, which is sort of bottom up science driven research and FAIR Excel, which is slightly more organized for bigger projects that require a little more kind of focus and more engineering support and things like that."}, {"time": 6769, "text": "So Joel needs FAIR Lab and Antoine Bord needs FAIR Excel."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "Where are they located?"}, {"time": 6774, "text": "It's delocalized all over."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "So there's no question that the leadership of the company believes that this was a very worthwhile investment."}, {"time": 6786, "text": "And what that means is that it's there for the long run."}, {"time": 6793, "text": "So if you want to talk in these terms, which I don't like, this is a business model, if you want, where FAIR, despite being a very fundamental research lab brings a lot of value to the company, either mostly indirectly through other groups."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "Now what happened three and a half years ago when I stepped down was also the creation of Facebook AI, which was basically a larger organization that covers FAIR, so FAIR is included in it, but also has other organizations that are focused on applied research or advanced development of AI technology that is more focused on the products of the company."}, {"time": 6834, "text": "So less emphasis on fundamental research."}, {"time": 6836, "text": "Less fundamental, but it's still research."}, {"time": 6838, "text": "I mean, there's a lot of papers coming out of those organizations and the people are awesome and wonderful to interact with."}, {"time": 6846, "text": "But it serves as kind of a way to kind of scale up if you want sort of AI technology, which, you know, may be very experimental and sort of lab prototypes into things that are usable."}, {"time": 6860, "text": "So FAIR is a subset of Meta AI."}, {"time": 6863, "text": "Is FAIR become like KFC?"}, {"time": 6864, "text": "It'll just keep the F.

That's a good call."}, {"time": 6894, "text": "I would keep FAIR and change the meaning of the F. That would be my preference."}, {"time": 6897, "text": "I would turn the F into fundamental AI research."}, {"time": 6902, "text": "Oh, that's really good."}, {"time": 6903, "text": "Within Meta AI."}, {"time": 6904, "text": "So this would be meta FAIR, but people will call it FAIR, right?"}, {"time": 6910, "text": "And now Meta AI is part of the Reality Lab."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "So Meta now, the new Facebook is called Meta and it's kind of divided into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Reality Lab."}, {"time": 6932, "text": "And Reality Lab is about AR, VR, telepresence, communication technology and stuff like that."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "It's kind of the, you can think of it as the sort of, a combination of sort of new products and technology part of Meta."}, {"time": 6951, "text": "Is that where the touch sensing for robots, I saw that you were posting about that."}, {"time": 6956, "text": "Touch sensing for robot is part of FAIR actually."}, {"time": 6958, "text": "That's a FAIR project."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "Yeah, this is also the, no, but there is the other way, the haptic glove, right?"}, {"time": 6965, "text": "Yes, that's more Reality Lab."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "That's Reality Lab research."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "Reality Lab research."}, {"time": 6971, "text": "By the way, the touch sensors are super interesting."},

"What do you think about this whole kind of expansion of the view of the role of Facebook and Meta in the world?"}, {"time": 6990, "text": "Well, Metaverse really should be thought of as the next step in the internet, right?"}, {"time": 6995, "text": "Sort of trying to kind of make the experience more compelling of being connected either with other people or with content."}, {"time": 7009, "text": "And we are evolved and trained to evolve in 3D environments where we can see other people."}, {"time": 7018, "text": "We can talk to them when we're near them or an other viewer far away can't hear us, things like that, right?"}, {"time": 7025, "text": "So there's a lot of social conventions that exist in the real world that we can try to transpose."}, {"time": 7030, "text": "Now, what is going to be eventually the, how compelling is it going to be?"}, {"time": 7036, "text": "Like, is it going to be the case that people are going to be willing to do this if they have to wear a huge pair of goggles all day?"}, {"time": 7046, "text": "But then again, if the experience is sufficiently compelling, maybe so."}, {"time": 7050, "text": "Or if the device that you have to wear is just basically a pair of glasses, and technology makes sufficient progress for that."}, {"time": 7058, "text": "AR is a much easier concept to grasp that you're going to have augmented reality glasses that basically contain some sort of virtual assistant that can help you in your daily lives."}, {"time": 7070, "text": "But at the same time with the AR, you have to contend with reality."}, {"time": 7073, "text": "With VR, you can completely detach yourself from reality."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "So it gives you freedom."}, {"time": 7077, "text": "It might be easier to design worlds in VR."}, {"time": 7080, "text": "Yeah, but you can imagine the metaverse being a mix, right?"}, {"time": 7086, "text": "Or like, you can have objects that exist in the metaverse that pop up on top of the real world, or only exist in virtual reality."}, {"time": 7094, "text": "Okay, let me ask the hard question."}, {"time": 7097, "text": "Oh, because all of this was easy so far."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "This was easy."}, {"time": 7100, "text": "The Facebook, now Meta, the social network has been painted by the media as a net negative for society, even destructive and evil at times."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "You've pushed back against this, defending Facebook."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "Can you explain your defense?"}, {"time": 7116, "text": "Yeah, so the description, the company that is being described in some media is not the company we know when we work inside."}, {"time": 7127, "text": "And it could be claimed that a lot of employees are uninformed about what really goes on in the company, but I'm a vice president."}, {"time": 7136, "text": "I mean, I have a pretty good vision of what goes on."}, {"time": 7138, "text": "I don't know everything, obviously."}, {"time": 7140, "text": "I'm not involved in everything, but certainly not in decision about content moderation or anything like this, but I have some decent vision of what goes on."}, {"time": 7150, "text": "And this evil that is being described, I just don't see it."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "And then I think there is an easy story to buy, which is that all the bad things in the world and the reason your friend believe crazy stuff, there's an easy scapegoat in social media in general, Facebook in particular."}, {"time": 7174, "text": "But you have to look at the data."}, {"time": 7175, "text": "Is it the case that

less if they use Instagram more?"}, {"time": 7192, "text": "Is it the case that people get more riled up against opposite sides in a debate or political opinion if they are more on Facebook or if they are less?"}, {"time": 7205, "text": "And study after study show that none of this is true."}, {"time": 7210, "text": "This is independent studies by academic."}, {"time": 7212, "text": "They're not

polarization in the US."}, {"time": 7276, "text": "And it's been going on for 40 years before Mark Zuckerberg was born continuously."}, {"time": 7282, "text": "And so if there is a cause, it's not Facebook or social media."}, {"time": 7287, "text": "So you could say if social media just accelerated, but no, I mean, it's basically a continuous evolution by some measure of polarization in the US."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "And then you compare this with other countries like the West half of Germany because you can go 40 years in the East side or Denmark or other countries."}, {"time": 7307, "text": "And they use Facebook just as much and they're not getting more polarized, they're getting less polarized."}, {"time": 7312, "text": "So if you want to look for a causal relationship there, you can find a scapegoat, but you can't find a cause."}, {"time": 7319, "text": "Now, if you want to fix the problem, you have to find the right cause."}, {"time": 7323, "text": "And what rise me up is that people now are accusing Facebook of bad deeds that are done by others and those others are we're not doing anything about them."}, {"time": 7332, "text": "And by the way, those others

themselves and probably form like complex structure, you know, spontaneously."}, {"time": 8755, "text": "You know, that could be an example of self organization, but you know, you have lots of examples, neural nets are an example of self organization too, you know, in many respect."}, {"time": 8763, "text": "And it's a bit of a mystery, you know, how like what is possible with this, you

happen?"}, {"time": 8779, "text": "So it's a big puzzle for physicists as well."}, {"time": 8782, "text": "It feels like understanding this, the mathematics of emergence in some constrained situations

it's something also I've been fascinated by since my undergrad days, and it's how you measure complexity, right?"}, {"time": 8823, "text": "So we don't actually have good ways of measuring, or at

of something is the negative log of its probability, essentially, right?"}, {"time": 8868, "text": "And you have a complete equivalence between the two things."}, {"time": 8871, "text": "And there you would think, you know, the probability is something that's well defined mathematically, which means complexity is well defined."}, {"time": 8878, "text": "You need to have a model of the

large."}, {"time": 8899, "text": "And so, you know, how can we come up with a good theory of how things become more complex if we don't have a good measure of complexity?"}, {"time": 8906, "text":
