in that book for months, far away from human civilization."}, {"time": 419, "text": "Anyway, check out BetterHelp at betterhelp.com slash lex to get a discount and to support this podcast."}, {"time": 427, "text": "And now, finally, here's my conversation with David Fravor."}, {"time": 433, "text": "You're a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School."}, {"time": 438, "text": "Better known as Top Gun."}, {"time": 441, "text": "Let me ask the most ridiculous question, how realistic is the movie Top Gun?"}, {"time": 446, "text": "So it's funny, we used to joke, and a friend of mine who was a Top Gun instructor said this, there's two things in the original Top Gun that are true, that are very realistic."}, {"time": 456, "text": "One, there is a place called Top Gun, and number two is they do fly airplanes there."}, {"time": 463, "text": "Other than that, I went through in 97, class 497, and there's actually a log of every single person that's went through, kind of like a SEAL training."}, {"time": 473, "text": "There's a list."}, {"time": 474, "text": "Because there's a lot of posers out there, oh, I was a Navy SEAL."}, {"time": 477, "text": "No, you weren't."}, {"time": 478, "text": "Well, I went to Top Gun."}, {"time": 479, "text": "You can actually go to Top Gun, and matter of fact, just to get a Top Gun patch, the real patch, you have to have gone there."}, {"time": 487, "text": "So a lot of the patches you see running around are not real."}, {"time": 491, "text": "The real ones are controlled."}, {"time": 493, "text": "The people that make them honor that."}, {"time": 496, "text": "And when you go in, they look up your name."}, {"time": 497, "text": "If you want to get one, they look up your name."}, {"time": 499, "text": "You just tell them, they go, okay, here, and they'll sell them to you."}, {"time": 501, "text": "If you are not on the list, you ain't get no patch."}, {"time": 504, "text": "Because it is, it's a pretty big deal to go through, but for me, probably one of the best experiences of flying, because everyone there is extremely competent."}, {"time": 516, "text": "It's very, very challenging, but it's what we all signed up to do."}, {"time": 521, "text": "So it's, it's just the entire group that is, when you want to be that, you know, that level, you know, where you go, everyone really cares, and everyone really wants to be good."}, {"time": 533, "text": "Is it competitive?"}, {"time": 534, "text": "Like, what was it, in the movie?"}, {"time": 536, "text": "No, it's, when you go through, it's, you know, it's, if anything, it's more of the students, you know, and then there's the instructor side, then the instructor sides are really, you know, they're guys that, you know, they just chose to stay up in Fallon."}, {"time": 549, "text": "And it's extremely difficult job, because they have, they have a very small tolerance for not being good."}, {"time": 560, "text": "So they're briefs, the guys when they give a lecture, so let's just say there's a fighter employment lecture, which is one of the hardest ones."}, {"time": 566, "text": "It takes about two days to give the fighter employment lecture."}, {"time": 570, "text": "The guy who gives the lecture goes through multiple, what they call them murder boards, where he's scrutinized by his peers, and he practices, by the time they actually stand in front of a class, they pretty much have their 250 PowerPoint slides memorized, and they don't even turn around, they just click and they know them in order."}, {"time": 586, "text": "And they repeat the same thing over, it's, and it's standardized."}, {"time": 590, "text": "So they are extremely, extremely standardized when you go through the school, and there's a reason for that, because what they're doing is they're training, so when you come out of Top Gun, you're called a Strike Fighter Weapons and Tactics Instructor, okay?"}, {"time": 601, "text": "So you're SFTI."}, {"time": 603, "text": "When you come out of that, your job is to go usually to one of the weapons schools on the East or West Coast and train the fleet squadrons, and then you visit the squadrons and train and do upgrade rides and all that."}, {"time": 613, "text": "So there's a, there's a reason that they are extremely particular when you go through the course."}, {"time": 620, "text": "It's, it is literally one of the best things, and it's not, it's not a rank based thing, just think, oh, Navy, you can come in as a, you know, like an 04 Lieutenant Commander."}, {"time": 630, "text": "The lieutenants, the hierarchy, or at least to be, I don't know how it is exactly today, but I imagine it's the same."}, {"time": 636, "text": "The hierarchy is actually based on seniority at the school, not necessarily rank."}, {"time": 640, "text": "So when the tactical decisions are made, which are based on fact and trying things out in the Fallon Ranges, they set the top X number of folks that have been there seniority wise, and I mean time wise, are the ones that actually make the decision."}, {"time": 656, "text": "And when the door, you may not agree, but when the door opens and everyone comes out from the staff, they all speak the same language."}, {"time": 665, "text": "It's and it has to be that way, which is why the school has been so effective since it was founded."}, {"time": 671, "text": "So it's just a, it's an incredible group of individuals."}, {"time": 674, "text": "So there's a bar of excellence that, that the instructors demand."}, {"time": 679, "text": "Oh, very much so, and they're held to it."}, {"time": 682, "text": "So it's not a, hey, I'm now an instructor, so I can do what I want."}, {"time": 686, "text": "There is a standard and they have to live up to that standard."}, {"time": 689, "text": "They have to, and I mean every moment of every day."}, {"time": 693, "text": "So if they go someplace, if they go from Fallon and they come down and do, they're called site visits where they come down and they'll come to Lemoore, California, which is where the West Coast Fighter Wing is at for the Navy."}, {"time": 702, "text": "And they go around and start flying sorties with the fleet squadrons to kind of pass on some of that knowledge, that's that same high level of standard."}, {"time": 711, "text": "It's they can't just drop your guard because you wear the Top Gun patch."}, {"time": 715, "text": "And people know that."}, {"time": 716, "text": "And they wear light blue shirts."}, {"time": 717, "text": "So it's pretty easy to identify them when they're out there."}, {"time": 720, "text": "And you know, and then everyone else who's been through the school, including them, have the patch on their sleeve."}, {"time": 724, "text": "So there's a standard that's expected when you come out of there."}, {"time": 727, "text": "So you were a Navy pilot for 18 years."}, {"time": 731, "text": "Can you briefly tell the story of your career as a pilot?"}, {"time": 736, "text": "So, you know, first I was in, I was enlisted, I was a Marine."}, {"time": 741, "text": "And then the Marines actually sent me, recommended me to go to the Naval Academy."}, {"time": 747, "text": "So it's always better to be lucky than good."}, {"time": 749, "text": "But I got to go to the Naval Academy and I finished and I've had that dream to fly."}, {"time": 753, "text": "So when I got selected, You've always dreamed of flying."}, {"time": 757, "text": "Since 1969, when I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon."}, {"time": 761, "text": "I was at that point, I asked my mom, I remember watching it, I was just prior to being five."}, {"time": 766, "text": "And I said, wow, yeah, it's so cool, mom."}, {"time": 770, "text": "And she said, well, you know, they were all pilots."}, {"time": 773, "text": "And then at that point it was like, I'm going to be a pilot."}, {"time": 776, "text": "And if you knew me growing up, cause I was a little bit of a delinquent, people are just like, yeah, right."}, {"time": 782, "text": "I used to joke, I'm going to fly, I'm going to fly jets, I'm going to drop bombs."}, {"time": 787, "text": "And if people that knew me as a kid, they'd be like, yeah, and they'd be like, ah, not a chance."}, {"time": 791, "text": "And then when I did, I actually had a, it's a funny story and I'll get to it, I'll finish my career."}, {"time": 796, "text": "But I was at my cousin's wedding and we all grew up in the same neighborhood."}, {"time": 801, "text": "We kind of, they had Italian side of the family."}, {"time": 804, "text": "That's how we grew up."}, {"time": 805, "text": "So it was my house right down the street."}, {"time": 806, "text": "It was my cousin, Chad."}, {"time": 807, "text": "And then right around the corner is my cousin Ray and my aunts and uncles and stuff."}, {"time": 811, "text": "The guy two doors down from my house, the paper boy in the neighborhood, so they all knew me."}, {"time": 815, "text": "And I went to my cousin's wedding and Mr. Race looks at me and he says, David Fravor."}, {"time": 820, "text": "I go, Mr. Race, how you doing?"}, {"time": 822, "text": "He goes, you fly jets, Top Gun and all that."}, {"time": 824, "text": "I go, yes, sir."}, {"time": 825, "text": "He goes, man, I figured you'd be in jail by now."}, {"time": 828, "text": "And it was kind of a, to me, it was a little bit of a badge of honor going on and I kind of overcame that."}, {"time": 835, "text": "But... What do you attribute that to?"}, {"time": 837, "text": "So you, I've heard you before and just now say that it's better to be lucky than good and you talk modestly about just being lucky, but if you were to describe your trajectory maybe in a way of advice, like retrospectively, how'd you pull it off to be like, to be truly a special person?"}, {"time": 863, "text": "The easiest way is one, never, never take no."}, {"time": 866, "text": "Don't let anyone put you down and say you can't do it or those."}, {"time": 870, "text": "I mean, I knew, I knew what I was capable of inside, you know, and if I really believe if you want something and you want to do something, then you can achieve it."}, {"time": 879, "text": "Not in all cases, like if I loved basketball and I really wanted to be in the NBA, there's a realism that says I'm five foot eight and I got like a really short vertical leap and I'm really not that good at basketball, it's probably not ever going to happen no matter how hard I try and practice."}, {"time": 893, "text": "It's just the way it is."}, {"time": 894, "text": "Or for me to be in the NFL, I'm not fast, you know, I'm not that big, it's just physically I'm incapable of doing that."}, {"time": 904, "text": "But there's things that don't really tie to a true physical ability as far as size and strength, but it's, it's mental and I'm not saying you have to be a genius and super smart to be a fighter pilot."}, {"time": 916, "text": "Matter of fact, you don't."}, {"time": 917, "text": "It really comes down to the ability to think very quickly, 80% solution is typically good enough because if you overthink it, you're, you're behind and then in an air to air fight, that's what happens."}, {"time": 929, "text": "People try and overthink it and before you know it, because it's happening so fast, you don't have, you can't get to the nth degree, you know, six decimal places, 80% solution is good enough."}, {"time": 938, "text": "You have a really strong gut for the 80% solution, just yeah, I'm a big believer in the 80% solution."}, {"time": 969, "text": "So my mind, I don't have to be perfect, you know, I don't have to go, I need to go to 47 degrees, nose high."}, {"time": 974, "text": "If I just kind of get above 40, then I'm good and I can watch how it reacts and then I can adjust for that."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And you, and you continually work that problem and you chip away because if you start neutral, you're just basically chipping away and gaining advantage, advantage, advantage till eventually, you know, and if you're really, you know, fighting, you know, just guns only rear quarter where you got to get behind the guy, kind of world war II dog fight and type stuff."}, {"time": 998, "text": "Then it's, it's literally, it's a, it's a very, very fast chess game that happens at, you know, 400 knots, 300 knots depends."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So to get to be one of the rare individuals that are able to do that, he just had the dream and didn't take no for an answer."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "Well, you know, you know, part of it is family, you know, my dad was, I used to call him a fire ready aim guy, you know, he'd smack me and then asked me what I did wrong."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "Good parenting."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "Um, back then, you know, I, I joke and people look, cause you know, at times it was kind of tough, you know, cause he can be pretty demanding, but on the other side, you know, I probably needed to be reined in a little bit at times."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "Uh, but then everyone else in my family, you know, my mom was really awesome when I was a kid."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "Uh, my, uh, my grandfather who is a big, big part of it."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "My mom's dad, uh, who he taught me a lot and you have a question there that we'll talk about, uh, about him, but, uh, huge, huge influence."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "Very, very positive."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "And a lot of the stuff that I do today and decisions are based on things that he taught me."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Um, and, uh, you know, and I figured, you know, it was the first funeral I ever went to and it was, uh, it was about three miles long and church was overfilling and people were out."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "It was a big guy, dead serious."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "And you go, there's someone asked who died the Pope."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "Um, uh, so, so a lot of people love them."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "So back to, back to my career question, cause I'm getting down at rabbit hole."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "Uh, no, I, when I was at the, I was going to, I was going to stay in the Marines."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "I really wanted to go, man."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "I love the core."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "I think it's, uh, of all services, it's that one, everything is in a ball and they're very, very professional and it was a great, great organization to join."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Uh, but I went out to the Nimitz on my, uh, freshman cruise after your freshman year at the Naval Academy, you go out on a ship and you, you're an enlisted person."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "You get to experience that half when I already was enlisted."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "So it was fine with me."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "Because it comes up a lot."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "You mind saying what the Nimitz is, what a ship is, what like, yeah."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "So Nimitz is, uh, an aircraft carrier."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "So it's, uh, four and a half acres of sovereign us territory that floats around the us oceans giant thing."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "Does it have weapons on it?"}, {"time": 1130, "text": "Uh, the air wing is really the weapons."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "It does have defensive weapons, but for the most part it's a giant moving airport is what it is."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "So I was out there watching the airplanes land and take off."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "Um, and I'm like, Oh, and the squadrons that were out there, one of the squadrons was a VF 41 and a 14 squadron, VF 84, uh, an F 14 squadron and then a couple of a six squadrons."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "And we actually ended up part pairing up and hanging out with some of the a six pilots and BNs."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "So it was really a neat experience."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "And I said, I want to do that."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "And the way to do it was to not, to, to go in the Navy because there are Marine squadrons that go out to the aircraft carriers, but most of them are land based, you know, to support the Marines."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "Cause there are that, that unit, that whole unit, you know, the Marine Corps is that one surface has it all."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "And, um, so when I graduated and I got to, uh, you know, I, I worked hard through primary and that's where, you know, I knew Missy, uh, we were in, actually went through together, Missy Cummings, uh, we went through primary together and then, uh, I went to Kingsville."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "We all selected the same time."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "I went to Kingsville."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "There was another guy, Scott Weidemeyer, uh, the three of us."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "So I went to Kingsville, Scott went to Beeville and Missy went to Meridian."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "So the three of us that we had all went through, we got, we selected out of primary together."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "We all ended up going jets and that's, that's how, besides from school, I knew her at school too."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "The long story."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "I got done, uh, got winged."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "It took me two years to the day from the time I graduated the Naval Academy until I got my wings and, uh, through some luck, uh, I ended up getting A6s, uh, on the West coast, which is a side by side, uh, bomber."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "So it's a pilot on the left seat and the Bombardier navigators on the right seat."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "It was built in the sixties."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "It is all weather, uh, and it flies low at night and it's got a terrain mapping radar."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "How many, I guess, is that a good term to use fighter jets as a broad category for, for the public?"}, {"time": 1239, "text": "Yeah, that's fine."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "How many fighter jets are side by side like that?"}, {"time": 1243, "text": "That was, uh, in the Navy, that was the only one, uh, the Air Force, the F111 was a side by side, but the Navy, it was the A6 and then there's the EA6B, which is a derivative of that."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And now that those are all gone, the EA6B is just went away a few years ago."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "And now the, uh, E18G Growler, um, is the replacement for the A6B."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "There was never a replacement for the A6, uh, that I flew."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "It really became the F18, which, uh, the A6 could go quite a bit further distance wise by fuel, uh, then the Hornet and, uh, the Hornet is the F18."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "Is there usually two people in the plane, but they're usually like in front and behind?"}, {"time": 1281, "text": "In a, the modern two seaters, yes."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Uh, but most of the tactical airplanes in the world today are single seat."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "Single seat, just one person?"}, {"time": 1287, "text": "One person, with the exception of, I'll probably, someone will yell at me, but really with the exception of the F15E Strike Eagle and the F18F Super Hornet, which is the F is a two seater and the G is also a two seater, but it's more of an electronic attack by say full up fighter bomber."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "So most of the time that you've flown in your, like I said, 18 year career is, was it two seater?"}, {"time": 1312, "text": "That was about half and half."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "So I started off in A6 was a two seater."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Then I went to single seat F18s and I flew those, uh, all the way up until 2000 and let me think 2001 to the end of 2001."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "And then I shifted over and started flying the Super Hornets and I've flown both of those, the E's and the S, but I deployed when I had command of VFA 41, I had the two seat, they were F squadron."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "So you eventually ended up commanding the, the Strike Fighter Squadron 41."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "I love the, the name, the Black Aces."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "What, uh, is there some parts of that journey that are amazing, parts of it that are tough that kind of stand out?"}, {"time": 1357, "text": "To me, it was one, it was a huge honor."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "Uh, and I got to serve with, uh, you know, I got pulled up because the, the guy, the, the people that are exos, cause we fleet up, you go from the number two guy to the number one guy."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "So the XO becomes the CEO."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "So the executive officer becomes the commanding officer."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "So I had worked with, uh, now soon to be vice Admiral Weitzel, uh, was the, he was commander Weitzel at the time was the XO and he really wanted, because he knew there was a little bit of a problem when the Super Hornets came into L'more, L'more had been a single seat, a fighter community, uh, since the forever."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "And now all of a sudden you've got the F18F coming in, which has the weapon systems operators in the back that are not pilots, they're weapon systems operators."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And there's a difference."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "Um, and Kenny is a weapon systems operator and, uh, Kenny knew because of my A6 background that I have a switch that I can go one seat, two seat, one seat, two seat."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "Because when you fly two seat, there's a lot of stuff that the pilot will offload and take the advantage of the weapon systems operator."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And it's not that one plus one equals two in that environment because it really, there's a huge amount of capabilities that the single seat has and the autonomy that comes for the ability to make decisions quickly and how well the airplane flies."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "But it does, it does equal more than one."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "I would say that one plus one with two people as well as a minimum of 1.5 because you've got an extra head, you've got extra eyes, you've got someone that can monitor systems."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "The airplanes can do two things at once."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "I mean, there's an incredible amount of capability that we add when we do that."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "Can we just pause on that just for me, from like a human factors perspective and also an AI perspective, what's, how difficult, uh, so there's like when there's two people, there's also a third person that's the AI part, the some level of automation like autopilot maybe."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Maybe you can kind of talk about the psychology of like, you said making decisions really quick, 80%, how do you deal with another brain working with you?"}, {"time": 1486, "text": "And then also the automation, is there an interesting interplay that you get to learn?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "And also as that changed throughout your career, I imagine it got, it gotten better in terms of the automation or perhaps not?"}, {"time": 1499, "text": "Well, I can tell you, so let's, let's start just, no, this is, this is good."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "This is good."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And this is, I'm enjoying this because now we actually get to talk about something other than a Tic Tac."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "So, um, so let's start with the A6."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "The A6 was really an analog airplane, uh, that was built in the sixties."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "And there's been studies done on the crew coordination, which is the interaction between the pilot and the bombardier navigator."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "So we would fly low at night in the mountains."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "So I was stationed up in Whidbey Island, Washington."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "So you've got the Cascades and incredible amount of time."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "And we would get in the simulators because unlike normally people think terrain following and there's the radars, the 111, the B1 has a system like this, but it'll, the radar can see and it'll fly."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "It basically flies a straight line."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "So it goes up and over mountains and back down and up and over mountains where the A6 was really manual."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "So you do this low level routes where you're going to, you're going to fly in the mountains at night."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "You're going to be at, you know, 500 to a thousand feet above the ground, ripping through like fog layers, cause you don't need to see outside."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "You're literally flying a little TV screen and radar."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "What are you looking at most of the time?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "So you're just at a screen."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "It's this really primitive."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "If you look at it now, what we did, you'd think, wow, that was crazy, but it was really fun."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "So is it similar to like the FLIR stuff?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Is that, is, no, this thing is totally radar based."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "Now the airplane had a FLIR ball as a target recognition and multi sensor was called a tram."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "You're looking at like basically like dots of hard objects."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "No, actually what it is is the, the bomb of your navigator had a radar and he was getting raw feed off of a pulse radar in front."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "So it's just basically mapping the mountain."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "So if you look at a mountain on a radar and you're coming up on it, the front side is going to be, it's going to give you a really bright return."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "And then the backside, it's just going to be a giant shadow because you can't see on the other side."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "So the Bombardier navigators would do that and we, they would have charts and they could shade their charts knowing that, Hey, if we turn a little bit left here, we can get in this valley."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "We can sneak up this valley and then go around the backside of the mountain, which is what the airplane would do."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "And so, and sorry to interrupt, I'm going to just keep asking dumb questions, I apologize."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "But the pilot, can you, can you at a high level say what the pilot does versus the Bombardier?"}, {"time": 1630, "text": "So you're, you're actually just control."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "I'm flying the jet."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "The throttle's the stick and I have a, it's about a, probably a four inch or six inch wide by maybe four inches, five inches high."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "It looks like it's literally a CRT."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "That's how old it is."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "A CRT screen."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "And what it would do, what the radar would do is the, the, the Bombardier navigator is looking at his radar and he's looking out about 12 and a half miles in front of the airplane."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "So he has the range really scoped down cause the radar can see a lot further."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "He's looking at about 12 and a half miles when we're in the terrain mode where we're dodging mountains and stuff."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And what the pilot has is there's, they're called range bins and there's eight of them."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "So the very far range bin is the 12 and a half mile, you know, and the closest range bin, it's a thing and it'll be like between like a half a mile and or a quarter mile to three quarters of a mile."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "And the next one might be three quarters of a mile to two miles."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "And then it just keeps going out like that."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "So if there's a mountain in front, let's say we're on a flat plane and there's a mountain out in the distance at 15 miles."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "And we were just driving right at it."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "So when we get to the point where it hits 12 and a half miles where the radar is going to see it on his scope, my 12th, my range bin for that would pop up and it would show like a big bump, like a mountain."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "And then as I got closer to it, the next range bin would pop up and show it."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "And I could see that that bump was moving towards me."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "And then if I turned a little bit, you know, to go over here, I'd see the mountain go over to the right hand side and I could do that, but it wasn't like a video game."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "It's literally like, if you think of the original Atari's."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "But you build up, I imagine that you start to get a really deep sense of like the actual 3D environment based on that little Atari's solid display."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "You're exactly right."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And you have to, you have to train."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "So there's been studies, as a matter of fact, a lot of the basis and people probably argue with me, but it's true."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "There were studies done watching A6 crews in our simulators, we call it the WIST, the systems trainer, and it was not even a motion, it just kind of sat there and you just, you could fly these things and they had terrain that they would inject into the system."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "But the crew coordination, so you get, so my first fleet bombardier navigator, who I'll name him, his name's Chris Sato, he works at Apple, pretty high up, MIT grad, I think computer engineering, he's scary smart."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "So Chris could really work, as a matter of fact, all the guys I flew with, so there's another guy, Matt, who also worked at Apple, who's now at SAP, we did our first night traps together."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "The bond between us, I mean, it's one of those things that you just, you're never going to forget, but Chris and I, when we started flying together, we were actually the most junior crew in the squadron."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "We'd spent a lot of time training and Chris was amazing at how he could work the system, one because he was extremely brilliant and he had that inquisitive mind of, oh, we can do all these different things and there's all these degradation modes."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "But we spent a lot of time to see how good we could actually get, because, and it's, you almost talk in partials."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "So as the BN is looking at his radar scope, Chris would say, I've got rising terrain, that's just what they say, showing rising terrain at 12 miles."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "And I'd see the little bump and I'd say, got it."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "This is going to go to your question on the autonomy and how you work with two heads."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "So when you first get together, the interaction, it's almost like you have to rehearse it, you have to know, and you talk in full sentences."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "The more and more we fly together, Chris could go, I'm showing and he'd get like rising out and before he finished, I'd say, I've got it."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "So you end up starting to talk in partials because I have to trust him like, I mean, there can be no, I can have no doubt that he knows how to do his job because I'm literally looking at this little scope that's not giving me this continuous picture of that mountain moving."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "Remember the mountain's here and then it's going to pop up here and then it's going to pop up here because there's gaps in the coverage on how the system was set up."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "Remember it's an analog system to where he is telling me, like, I can't see all the way to the left and he's got a wider scope on the radar, but my screen doesn't show that."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So he's telling me, start a left turn, start a hard turn, you know, and we would do that."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "So my truck."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "And this is all happening quick?"}, {"time": 1892, "text": "Very quick."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "Well, you're doing, we would typically fly between 420 and 480 knots of ground speed."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "How many miles an hour?"}, {"time": 1899, "text": "Well, 420 is seven miles a minute."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "Or eight, between seven and eight miles a minute is what you're flying."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "That's fast."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "At night."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "I mean, I broke out of clouds."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "I mean, I remember him and I flying, we were on, it's the IR, it's called an IR route, an instrument route that's low, they're all around the country."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "There's the IR 344 that we used to fly, which would coast in off of Oregon, you'd fly from the land, you go out over the ocean, turn around and then you could practice actually coming in on a coastline and we were flying and we ended up in the clouds."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "Keep in mind, we're between 500 and a thousand feet in the mountains and we're in the clouds."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "You can't see anything."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "And I had to turn off our red lights that flash, you know, they're called the anti collision lights because it was reflecting off the clouds and it starts to bother you, just gets annoying."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So I turned it off and we were flying, we're flying, we're flying."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "We break out of that coastal marine layer and poof, we break out and it's a decent night."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "And this is right by Mount St. Helens."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "This is kind of where we're coming in."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "So we're coming in from the east and we're just north of Mount St. Helens is where the route goes."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And you look up, you know, cause you can kind of see the silhouette of this mountain that's right next to you, but you're flying along."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "You're just like, you know, you got to trust and you can see houses, you can see the lights, they're above you."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "We're literally below people's houses flying down these valleys and stuff."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "So just incredible experience."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "So when you take that and then you move into an F18F."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "So now we're into modern technology that was actually built in this century and you're flying."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "So now, you know, the WIZO is behind us and we're not doing those night low levels, but that same type of crew coordination that has to happen because what you're doing is you're sharing the load."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "So most of the communications that go out of the airplane, the WIZO does all the talk and he's got actually, he uses his feet."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "That's the weapon systems operator in the back of an F18F."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "So he's going to run, well, the radar kind of runs itself now, but we have a situational awareness display and it's linked to all the other airplanes."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "Just out of curiosity, what's the situational awareness display?"}, {"time": 2011, "text": "Because that term comes up a lot."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "Think of it as a God's eye view."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "So if you have the back of the Super Hornet has, well, the Block IIs has about an eight by 10 display for the WIZOs that they can look at."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "The pilot's is smaller."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "It's down between his, it's a six by six between his legs and they're getting ready to redesign that Boeing is."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "But when you looked, it'd be like if you put your airplane and you're looking down."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "So all the stuff, like if your radar seeing bad guys out in front of you, it'd be like looking down and going, oh, I'm right here."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And now there's bad guys out here and my wingman is over here."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "And it shows everything."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "It's just like, it gives you, you can look at that display and go, oh, I can see where everything's at."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "I can see if one guy's trying to target another guy, it shows you all this."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "It's an incredible amount of knowledge that comes up for the crews to maintain the overall picture of what's going on because it's happening so fast and this is where that autonomy piece, this is the third brain."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "So we're all looking at it and the third brain is doing fusion."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "It's pulling stuff together going, oh, this is all this guy."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "This is this guy."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "It's sending it out through the link."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "So all the airplanes are talking to each other through this digital network that we don't even see."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "It just says, that airplane says, hey, I'm over here."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "And it tells us and we go, oh, he's right there."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "And then we can go, his airplane says, oh, I'm looking at this airplane, this bad guy."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "And it shows us, oh, he's over there and he's looking at this guy."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "I mean, it's an incredible amount of visual intake because your eye, you can hear a lot, but when you look down at stuff, it's, you know, you can sell the picture really quick."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "The third brain is doing the sensor fusion, the integration of the different sensors and gives you a big picture view."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "What about the control?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "Like, is there, and I apologize as if this is a dumb question, but you know, people use the high level term of autopilot."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "How much is there, let's use a loose term of AI."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "How much automation is there?"}, {"time": 2124, "text": "How much AI is there in helping you control there?"}, {"time": 2127, "text": "The AI piece would be more of a control loop because of the digital flight controls."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "So the airplane actually, they had to make the airplane easier to fly."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And when I say easy, it's relative because people go, I could do it because I did it on flight sim."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "Real life is a lot different."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "In flight sim, you have no apparent fear of death."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "You'll do things on a simulator that you would never do in real life."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "But the autonomy in the airplane to allow you to manage, I mean, because you think about it, you've got a radar that's feeding you data."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "You've got a targeting pod that's feeding you data."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "All that stuff is hooked to your head because you've got a joint helmet mounted cueing system on that basically maps the magnetic field in the cockpit so it can tell where your head's at looking."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "So if I turn my head to the right, the radar will actually look to the right."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "The targeting flare will look to the right."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "And oh, by the way, the backseater has a helmet on too, so he can look to the left and he can do things."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "So depending on what sensor he's controlling, so if he's got control of the targeting pod and he looks left, the targeting pod looks left."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "But if I have something where I want to lock a guy up that I don't see, that maybe the radar didn't see, but I can get over and now point the radar, you know, get the, because it's a phased array radar now, it doesn't really scan."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "There's all kinds of cool stuff that that technology brings."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "Because if you just, if you went back 30 years and said, hey, or 40 years ago and said, hey, we're gonna have this helmet and you're gonna be able to slew everything to your head."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "And I don't mean a mechanical setup, but I mean literally you're just gonna map magnetic resonance and go, oh, look, and I can literally slew my sensors this fast and then mash a button and transfer, you know, high quality coordinates from a system into a joint, you know, a JDAM, which is a joint direct attack munition that is the GPS bombs that you see all the time, and then let that thing fly."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "And I'm solving this problem in seconds, vice minutes, or, hey, I got it, we're gonna have to menstruate coordinates and, you know, you bring back the data and then they do all the targeting for it and then they send another group out to get it instead of all that."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "Now it's that fast."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "So there's a, okay, I mean, we probably don't have enough time to talk about the beautiful fusion of minds that happens when two people are flying, controlling the plane."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "But at a high level, this is a really interesting question for people who don't know what they're talking about, like me, which is, what is the difference between a human being and an AI system?"}, {"time": 2267, "text": "Like what can, what is the ceiling of a current AI technology for controlling the plane?"}, {"time": 2274, "text": "Like how much does the human contribute?"}, {"time": 2277, "text": "Is it possible to have automated flight, for example, like what is the hardest part about flying that a human does expertly that an AI system cannot in warfare situations in flying a fighter jet plane?"}, {"time": 2295, "text": "So I would say AI systems are usually black and white."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "When you write the algorithm for an AI system, it's really, it's basically you're taking thought and turning it into a giant math problem is really what you're doing, right?"}, {"time": 2310, "text": "So you've got this logical math problem."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "Math problems are, there's a line that says I can or I can't."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And it's a very finite line, but you can go up to the line where a human, we all have gray areas where we go, eh, maybe, eh, I'll try it."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "So humans can operate within that gray."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "So if you took, if you take an airplane and say, and I'll just take a Hornet for a while, a Super Hornet, it doesn't matter, any airplane, and you go, here is the flight performance model of the airplane."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So if you know what an EM diagram is, the energy, so it basically says the airplane can fly as slow as this, it can go as fast as this, it can pull this many Gs, force of gravity, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and then based on the airfoil design and everything else and how it can pull, here's how it's going to fly, because it's really physics based."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "Well, if you, depending on how you write the AI, but typically AI, you don't want the airplane to leave controlled flight, right?"}, {"time": 2365, "text": "You want to maintain it so that it is flying in a controlled envelope."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "Where there are times, and you can go back to World War I, where people intentionally departed the airplane from controlled flight in order to obtain an advantage, which is, that's where the human goes, can I do this?"}, {"time": 2382, "text": "I know it's outside of where I would normally go, but I can do that."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "So you can do some crazy things now, especially since the flight control logic in modern airplanes with digital flight controls, they're extremely forgiving."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "So you can literally, I've done things in Super Hornets that literally, even as a pilot inside the airplane, you're just like, wow, I cannot believe it just did that."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "Like it'll flop ends, which defies most logic, and I guess in a way you could probably program it, but I still think when you get to the edges that may or may not give you an advantage, there are things that a human will do that AI won't."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "And I don't think we've got to the point, because how do you map illogical solutions?"}, {"time": 2429, "text": "Most AI is logical."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "It's based on some type of premise when you write the algorithm to control it."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "There's bounds."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "Yeah, there's this giant mess, like you said, the difference between the simulator and real life also gets at that somehow."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "That there is somehow the fear of death, all of that beautiful mess comes into play."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "Is there a comment you can make on commercial flight, like with Sully landing that plane famously versus the simulator, all of those discussions, is there some?"}, {"time": 2464, "text": "Well, it's very similar to what I was talking about earlier with the A6."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "So one is when you're flying with a crew, there's standardization."}, {"time": 2473, "text": "So you got to remember when Sully flew, when his first officer, that's the co pilot, showed up the first time they'd met, and this happens all the time in the commercial world."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "There's six, 7,000 pilots at United Airlines, your chance of flying with the same guy all the time is slim and none."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "Where in the Navy, we were crewed."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "So I had a primary and a secondary whizzo that flew with me."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "For months?"}, {"time": 2494, "text": "Oh yeah, for like all of the deployment."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "Because you want to get to know, trust and all of those things."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "It increases the capability of the airplane."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "It's not to say we can't swap out, but for true effectiveness, especially in very complex missions like a forward air controller, we're in the air actually controlling ground assets and supporting ground troops."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "If you're in a high threat area, which is crazy busy, you have to be melded when you do that."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "You have to have trained to do that job, otherwise you're going to be ineffective."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "So when you get to the commercial world, and I've got tons of friends that fly commercial, there is a standardization."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "Like we know that at this point, I'm going to put this switch, you're going to do that."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "And everyone, they know their roles."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "Captain's going to do this, first officer's going to do this."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "And they know that when the emergency breaks out, so in Sully's case, when they take the birds and they know they've got a problem, and if you've listened to the cockpit recordings of the two of them talking, you got to remember, they're talking to each other when you hear the full tapes, but they're also talking to the air traffic controllers in the New York area."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "And it's like, we got a bird strike and the first officer already knows, hey, silence the alarm."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "They silence the alarm."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "The first officer is pulling out the book, he's going through the procedures while Sully's actually flying the airplane, knowing that they've lost their motors."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And you got to think his decision process, like they're trying to get him to go into an airport in New Jersey, and he realizes, not happening, we're going to put this thing."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "And he made a decision soon enough so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane that he was going to put this thing in the Hudson River."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "And he did it flawlessly."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "I mean, every single person walked away from that wreck."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "The only thing that didn't survive was the airplane, and it got fished out of the Hudson."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "What is it about those human decisions you had to make?"}, {"time": 2597, "text": "Is that something you put into words or is that just deep down some instinct that you develop as a pilot over time?"}, {"time": 2605, "text": "When you train, and aviation is a self cleaning oven."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "So if you make bad decisions, and the list is long and distinguished of those who have died by making bad decisions."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "So when you look at what he did or the way we train, because the commercial industry and the Navy and the Air Force, for all that, we have what's called, we have emergency procedures that we have to know."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "Like engines on fire, the first three steps, you just have to know what they are, right?"}, {"time": 2632, "text": "So they know."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "The airline, same type, they go, hey, I know this is, they pull the book out because the airplanes are designed, they're built to have some time."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "But there's a point where you have to make a decision and you can't second guess it."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "So when he decided I'm putting this in the Hudson River, he couldn't all of a sudden halfway through it go, well, maybe I can get over to that airport."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "He looked, he made a quick assessment."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "This is that 80% solution where you go, these are not, it's like a multiple choice test when you go, oh my God, I don't really know the answer, but I know A and D are wrong, gone."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "So the Jersey airport and

other piece is, is I can trade some of that kinetic energy for performance."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Because I know if I do a nice, easy turn, the airplane will make it at what doesn't bleed

ships just kind of barely be moving when we land on it."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "It makes it actually easier."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "If the ship has to move or it's got a big weight because it has to make its own wind when we land, which is the day that it was this day, you go, oh, okay."}, {"time": 4802, "text": "And it creates what's called, we call the burble, but when the air flows across the flight deck, it drops behind the ship, you know, and then it kicks back up."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "So when you're coming board to land, it's going to make you go up a little bit and then you're going to fall and you got to anticipate that to stay on glideslope."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "So we're pretty conscious of what's going on out there with the waves and the wind."}, {"time": 4821, "text": "So there's no waves, there's no wind, there's no whitecaps, and we look down and we see whitewater."}, {"time": 4828, "text": "So if you put a piece of land, a seamount below the surface, like, you know, even 20 feet below the surface, it's big enough."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "As the waves come in, you know, waves have height and length."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "When they come in, that's what happens on the shore, when a wave comes in, it hits and then it starts to collapse and it pushes the wave height up because it can't go anymore and then it breaks over the top and that's where you get the weight."}, {"time": 4849, "text": "So what happens is at sea, when you get a seamount, you'll see stuff come in, the wave will crash and you'll get whitewater."}, {"time": 4855, "text": "You can go out when it's high tide in any one of the coasts, you can go out here off of Boston and go, hey, at low tide, I can see those rocks and at high tide, I can't see the rocks are covered, but there'll be whitewater around those rocks."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "You'll be able to tell there's something underneath the surface."}, {"time": 4869, "text": "So that's what it was."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "We don't see an object because there's all kinds of, oh, they saw another craft below the wave."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "We didn't see anything below the water."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "We just saw whitewater."}, {"time": 4878, "text": "But the whitewater, and I like to shape it, you can say it was a cross."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "I say it's about the size of a 737."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "So it looks like if you took a 737, put it about 15, 20 feet below the water so the wave is breaking over the top and you're going to get whitewater where the plane is at, you'd see this kind of shape."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "So it looks like a cross."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "So as we're looking down off the right side, the backseater in the other airplane, Jim, says this is that talking in partials again."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "He says, hey, Skipper, do you?"}, {"time": 4903, "text": "And that's about what he gets out of his mouth."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "And I go, what the hell is that?"}, {"time": 4907, "text": "In a nice way."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "Do you see that essentially is what he's saying?"}, {"time": 4909, "text": "So we see the whitewater and that's what draws our eyes down there."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "Otherwise we'd have never seen it."}, {"time": 4913, "text": "So we see this whitewater."}, {"time": 4914, "text": "I would have loved to see the look on your face when you see that."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "And then we see this little white tic tac because we're about 20,000 feet above it and it's doing, it's going basically north, south, and then east, west, north, and it's abrupt."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "It's very abrupt."}, {"time": 4926, "text": "So it's not like a helicopter, if a helicopter is going sideways and it goes once, it's going sideways left and it goes right, what it'll do is it'll go, it's got a speed, it slows down because there's inertia and it stops and then it goes back the other way."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "This thing's not, it's like left, right, left, right with no."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "So moving in ways that doesn't feel intuitive to you of the things you've seen in the past."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "So as a pilot, the first thing you think is it's a helicopter, right?"}, {"time": 4951, "text": "So you go, oh, what is, cause when we see it's moving, we're like, oh, helicopter."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "So the first thing you look for to see if it's a helicopter when they're doing that, because usually when they get down there towards that 50 feet, you'll get rotor wash. You see it in the movies when the helicopter's by the water, it kicks, the water comes up the sides cause the downdraft, you know, like a thunderstorm will do that."}, {"time": 4970, "text": "It pushes the air down and then it has to come up the sides."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "So you see it and you go, well, there's no, there's no rotor wash. What is that thing?"}, {"time": 4978, "text": "So by this time we're driving around."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "So as we're, if we were at the six oclock, we're driving around towards that nine oclock position and we're just watching this thing."}, {"time": 4984, "text": "And it's just, it's still pointing north, south, and it's going left, right, and it's kind of moving around the object."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "And if it had, if I had to say it biased itself, it was biased towards the bottom half."}, {"time": 4993, "text": "So if you've got the east, west, and then the north, south kind of across, it's hanging out on the southern thing that's hanging out."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "It's just kind of moving around up, down, left, and it's crossing over it and it's going up."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "It's just kind of, so now we're like, what the hell is that?"}, {"time": 5005, "text": "So then I go, hey, I'm going to go check it out."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "And the other pilot says, I'm going to stay up here."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "And I said, yeah, stay up high."}, {"time": 5012, "text": "Because now we get, we get a different perspective."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "So she's up here and I'm down here as I'm descending."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "She can watch, because right now all I'm watching is the Tic Tac."}, {"time": 5023, "text": "She can watch me and the Tic Tac."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "So she gets a God's eye view of everything that's going on, which is really important."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "You know, you can hear people say it's high cover, whatever."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "She's watching me, which is, it's perfect as the story goes on, because it gives us two perspectives, you know, of a perspective that's about 8,000 feet above us when that thing disappears."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "And they don't, you know, because if it's just like, oh, I lost it and they go, no, it's over to the right."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "We can still see it."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "We all lost it at the same time."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "So as we come down, we get to about 12 oclock and I'm descending and it's an easy descent."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "I'm doing about 300 knots, which is a really good airspeed for the airplane for maneuvering because I have, I have everything available to me at that speed."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "So I'm coming down and as I get to 12 oclock, as the Tic Tac's doing this, it literally, it's like, it's aware of us and it just goes bloop and it kind of points out towards the West and starts coming up."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "So now it's obviously knows that we're there."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "Whatever this thing is, it knows that we're there."}, {"time": 5073, "text": "So as we drive around, it's coming up and I'm just coming down."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "We're just, I'm just watching it."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "Now, you gotta remember this whole thing is like, this is like five minutes."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "This is not like we saw it and it was gone or, oh, I saw lights in the sky and they were gone."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "We watched this thing on a crystal clear day with four trained observers, watch this thing fly around."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "So we're like, okay."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "So I get over to the eight oclock position and I'm a little, I'm a couple thousand feet above it and it's about, so I'm probably at about 15 K I think it is."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "I think that's my story is about 15."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "It's just estimating."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "So you can see it's just a really easy descent because."}, {"time": 5105, "text": "So what's 15 K?"}, {"time": 5106, "text": "15,000 feet."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "I thought it was 8,000."}, {"time": 5108, "text": "No, the other plane ends up about that."}, {"time": 5112, "text": "So they're still at about 20,000 feet."}, {"time": 5114, "text": "So they're driving around and I'm descending."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "They're staying up there."}, {"time": 5117, "text": "So I'm kind of doing this as they drive around."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "So I'm looking at this thing and it's about the two oclock position."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "We're about the eight oclock position and I'm like, oh, I've got, I've got enough altitudes."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "I'm going to, I'm going to cut across the circle."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "I tell the guy in my back seat, dude, I'm going to, I'm going to do this."}, {"time": 5131, "text": "He's like, go for it."}, {"time": 5132, "text": "Skip."}, {"time": 5133, "text": "Cause I was a skipper."}, {"time": 5134, "text": "So I cut across the bottom."},

about a half mile away, which you think, well, a half mile is pretty far."}, {"time": 5147, "text": "Half mile in aviation isn't, it's nothing."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "It's I mean, you can tell there's a pilot in an airplane."}, {"time": 5152, "text": "You can see all kinds of stuff at a half mile."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "You can see pretty good detail."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "So I'm like right there and it's coming across my nose."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "So now I'm basically pointing back towards east."}, {"time": 5160, "text": "So I'm cutting across cause I'm going to the three oclock position."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "It's at two oclock and I'm going to meet it at three oclock."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "So as I do this, it goes, it just accelerates and disappears."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "So this happens at around, estimating about 12,000 feet."}, {"time": 5171, "text": "So they're at 20."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "So they've got about 8,000 foot of altitude above us when this happens."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "And it just, as it crosses our nose, it just, it accelerates and literally in less than, you know, probably less than a half second, it just goes and it's gone."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "And so we're like, and I had the first thing is, dude, did you guys see it?"}, {"time": 5188, "text": "The other airplane's like, it's gone."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "We don't, we have no idea where it's at."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "So we kind of spin around real quick."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "I go, well, let's see what's down here."}, {"time": 5195, "text": "And I turn around and we're looking for the whitewater and we can't even, the whitewater's gone."}, {"time": 5200, "text": "It's literally all blue."}, {"time": 5201, "text": "So now you go."}, {"time": 5202, "text": "And I remember telling the guy in my backseat, like a dude, I'm, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty weirded out because this is, I mean, you know, I had at the time like 30 some hundred hours of flying."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "I'd been doing it for 18 years."}, {"time": 5213, "text": "It's nothing like anything you've seen."}, {"time": 5216,

"text": "So we got to get our training done."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "So that's my mindset, especially as a CEO, cause I got to get, I got to get training out of the flight time because I'm responsible to do that."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "So, Hey, let's go back."}, {"time": 5234, "text": "And the, the, the guy who's going to be the bad guys is the CEO of the Marine squadron."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "And so Cheeks is at the, he's listening to all this happen, you know, cause he's just like, cause he, they, when he first went out, they were going to do him, but the little Hornets, the legacy Hornets, the F18Cs don't have as much gas as the Super Hornets."}, {"time": 5250, "text": "So he had launched first and they were going to do him."}, {"time": 5253, "text": "And

a cap point by the way?"}, {"time": 5263, "text": "That's where we hold."}, {"time": 5264, "text": "So it's called a combat air patrol point."}, {"time": 5266, "text": "So we're just going to hold at one end."}, {"time": 5268, "text": "He's going to hold at the other end."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "It's kind of like, Hey, you guys are going to get, it's, it's, if it's a football field, we're going to sit on one goal line."}, {"time": 5274, "text": "He's going to sit on the other goal line."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "And when they say go, we're going to run at each other and then try and do something in the middle of the field and then go back to our set reset points."}, {"time": 5282, "text": "So you're talking to him."}, {"time": 5283, "text": "He's, he's, he's listening to the, he's just listening."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "We don't talk to him at all."}, {"time": 5286, "text": "He's just listening."}, {"time": 5287, "text": "He just dials up."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "Cause they know that we all know the frequencies."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "So he's listening to what's going on because he's like, cause they canceled training."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "So what else is he going to do?"}, {"time": 5293, "text": "He's just going to hang out there and do circles while he's waiting for him and his wingman."}, {"time": 5296, "text": "So they just, they're listening to all this go on."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "And then at this point you move on."}, {"time": 5301, "text": "We come back up to train."}, {"time": 5302, "text": "We go back as we're flying back the controller."}, {"time": 5304, "text": "Cause we're talking to the kid on the Princeton, the, the, uh, the, uh, they're called OSs or operations specialists."}, {"time": 5309, "text": "They're the ones that run the radars and we're talking to him and he's like, Hey, sir, you're not going to believe this."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "He's like, that thing is at your cap."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "It showed back up."}, {"time": 5318, "text": "It just popped up."}, {"time": 5320, "text": "This is like 60 miles away."}, {"time": 5321, "text": "It just reappears."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "We're like, Oh, okay."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "So we got the radars out."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "We're looking for it."}, {"time": 5325, "text": "Uh, we get out there."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "We never see it."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "We never see it again."}, {"time": 5328, "text": "Uh, we do what we need to do."}, {"time": 5329, "text": "We come back to the ship."}, {"time": 5330, "text": "Of course, now we're like, Oh, this is going to be, we're going to, you know, I told him, I told him, I go, dude, you know, we're going to catch, we're going to catch shit for this."}, {"time": 5336,

so the ship plays movies, we have movies on the boat and they do 12 hours of movies."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "So they repeat cause there's a day check and a night check."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "So the same movies in the morning and night play."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "So you never get to ever get to watch a whole movie on the boat, which drives my wife crazy cause I'll watch stuff on TV that way too."}, {"time": 5356, "text": "I'll be like, Oh, Hey, I've seen this and it, I'll jump into a movie in the middle and then I'll pick it up later and I'll see the beginning and I'll put it all together, uh, because that's how we have to do it."}, {"time": 5364, "text": "Cause we're so busy."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "Well, the movies became, and I, it was men in black, aliens, uh, uh, independence day."}, {"time": 5374, "text": "Definitely going to catch some shit, but let, let, uh, let me just ask some dumb questions."}, {"time": 5380, "text": "So just take him, cause it's whatever, whatever the heck you saw, whatever the heck happened, it's, you know, one of the most fascinating things, um, events in recent history."}, {"time": 5395, "text": "So whatever it was, it's interesting to talk about it, different kinds of angles."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "There's no good answers, but it's interesting to ask some dumb questions here."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "Uh, so first of all, you mentioned, see, you saw at some point X, Y, and then, uh, somebody in the Princeton said, you're not going to believe this, sir."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "It's at your cap point that that's a different place."}, {"time": 5416, "text": "How the heck did it know what your cap point is?"}, {"time": 5419, "text": "And that's the one of you to no one, you know, you don't, we don't tell it, we don't broadcast it, we have a waypoint in the system, but I don't know."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "Maybe it knew where we were going."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "Cause we use the same one day after day after day, but it, it obviously knew, but you never saw it there."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "Never saw it there."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "Chad, when he took off, when he got the video, we landed, we told them, Hey, look, we just, we just chased this thing."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "They're like, what?"}, {"time": 5441, "text": "I got to chase it."}, {"time": 5442, "text": "And they're like, well, I go, dude, and I go, and I told him, I said, dude, get video."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "And he goes, and so, and that's how he is."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "He's like, I'm going to go."}, {"time": 5449, "text": "And he, he was, he, he was determined that he was going to find this thing."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "So when you look at his video, and this is the stuff that isn't out, that they don't see because not all the, all you see is the FLIR tape."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "That's the targeting pod, the forward looking infrared receiver."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "I'll probably overlay the video for people to see."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "When he goes out, it's you know, what he's looking at on his displays is he has basically two radar displays up."}, {"time": 5472, "text": "He has azimuth and range on the right one, and he has azimuth and elevation on the left one."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "So this is called the Azel display."}, {"time": 5478, "text": "And this is called, this is basically the PPI, which is the, you're at the bottom of it."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "You're at the bottom of the square."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "It's really taken this."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "It's taken a cone because a radar really looks left and right from a point and it squares it out."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "So the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us because they do this."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "They square it off."}, {"time": 5495, "text": "So, so he goes out and when he first sees it, he gets a radar return on it because when he's not trying to lock it."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "So the radar is just throwing energy out and getting it, you know, it's a Doppler radar."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "So when it's in search mode, that's all it's doing."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "It's going, oh, I can see you."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "And it's looking for return."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So he gets a return."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "So he wants to see what it is because all you get is a little green square, unless it builds a track file on it, but a little green square is just sitting there."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "It's not moving because it's, it's sitting in one spot in space."}, {"time": 5520, "text": "He locks it up when he goes to lock it up."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "Now he's putting a bunch of energy on it, but he's telling the radar, stare down that line of sight and whatever's there, I want you to grab it and build a track file on it, which will tell us how high it is, how fast it is and the direction that it's going."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "So the radar is smart enough that when the signal comes back, if it's been messed with, it will tell you, it'll give you indications that I'm being jammed."}, {"time": 5541, "text": "So that's all it is, is you send a signal out, something, it manipulates the signal either in range and velocity or whatever, and it sends it back and the radar was smart enough to go, that is not a return that I'm expecting."}, {"time": 5553, "text": "Something's messing with me."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "I'm being jammed."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "And it shows you and it puts strobes up, it gives these lines on the radar and it does some stuff."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "So you can mean, well, it does, it goes full into, it's being jammed at about every mode you can possibly see because everything comes up and this aspect gets along, it's all kinds of, I don't want to get into details, but you can tell it's being jammed."}, {"time": 5570, "text": "So and it's what it does."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "As you said on Rogan, by the way, that jamming is an act of war, right?"}, {"time": 5574, "text": "Active jamming is, when you actively jam another platform, yes, it's technically an act of war."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "It feels like you should be freaking out at this point, I mean."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "So well, he does it and then in the back seat, so they don't have a stick and throttle, they have their side stick controllers so they can control all the sensors and they can just toggle around and do stuff."}, {"time":

hooked together."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "You can decouple them, but they're going to automatically couple up."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "So when he castles over, it's a switch, it looks like a

the modes, so there's a narrow, medium and wide."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "So wide is far away, medium and then narrow."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "And then there's the TV mode and he goes from IR mode to the TV mode."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "The cool thing with the TV mode is narrow IR mode is only medium TV mode."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "So you can actually get closer with narrow TV mode."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "It's got a better zoom capability when you go into TV mode."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "So he goes through all those things and that's when you see it going from a black background to a white background."}, {"time": 5676, "text": "So you can figure out what the heck is this?"}, {"time": 5677, "text": "Well, yeah, and he wants to get as much data as he can on it

the hell did that get on strangeland.com?"}, {"time": 5729, "text": "So next thing you know, it ends up on YouTube, which was cool because you can send a YouTube link to someone."}, {"time": 5736,

was on Strangeland and YouTube, someone pulled off of a secret, it looks like a rack."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "There's tape machines in there and it gets converted to digital and stored on a hard drive and they pulled it off that hard drive and they put it on YouTube."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "No, it's just like, anytime, even a digital media, the more you copy digital media, there's some quality that gets, it degrades."}, {"time": 6207, "text": "So this, you don't know how many times this has been copied."}, {"time": 6209, "text": "So we were looking, the videos I've seen are right off the original, they're Hi8 tapes, it's basically pulled off the back of the display, so it's not filmed with cameras, it's literally a digital feed that's pulled off the back and put onto a Hi8 tape."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "That's how the recorders work."}, {"time": 6220, "text": "Now it's actually digital to digital, it's not even on tapes anymore, it's a digital recording system, but we were still in that process of slowly, because originally we had little cameras here that shine, so if the light hit, it would wash out the displays."}, {"time": 6232, "text": "So it's a pretty good feed, when you put it on, so instead of looking at it on your tiny little computer monitor or whatever, I'm looking at it on like a 19 inch, because it was still normal TVs back there, we had just put flat screens in the ready room that I had bought, so we could watch movies."}, {"time": 6247, "text": "A nice, huge 19 inch screen."}, {"time": 6251, "text": "It's maybe 20, it was nice."}, {"time":

2005."}, {"time": 6263, "text": "So you look at it as this big thing."}, {"time": 6265, "text": "You could see, so when you get to the TV mode, when I say there's little things coming out of the bottom of it, you could see those."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "It was very clear."}, {"time": 6272, "text": "But in terms of the actual visual on the Tic Tac, did you get much more information from the

everybody's converged towards this local minima or local maxima, whatever you think about it."}, {"time": 8974, "text": "And it's again, same as with the TICTAC, thinking outside the box is not accepted and it probably should be."}, {"time": 8985, "text": "But it's hard because if you go back, go back to Einstein, back to the original, he was out of the box."}, {"time": 8993, "text": "He did not think the norm."}, {"time": 8994, "text": "That's true genius."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "Had he not thought out of the box and came up with some of his theories, where would we be?"}, {"time": 9000, "text": "Okay, we're jumping around a little bit."}, {"time": 9003, "text": "So we've talked a little bit about Elon and Mars and space, but let me jump back to a few questions that folks had."}, {"time": 9011, "text": "I have to kind of bring up some debunking stuff because I think not the actual facts of the debunking, but the nature of the true believers versus the debunkers hurts

preparing to talk to you about this world."}, {"time": 9037, "text": "And Mick West is one of the better known people who kind of makes a career out of trying to debunk."}, {"time": 9045, "text":

the approach he does."}, {"time": 9057, "text": "It's valuable."}, {"time": 9058, "text": "And I think no matter what, I think there's, I hope that people, quote unquote, true believers are a little bit more open minded to the work of Mick West."}, {"time": 9067, "text": "I think it's quite useful and brilliant work."}, {"time": 9071, "text": "So let me ask, he has a bunch of videos, a bunch of ideas where he kind of suggests possible other explanations of the things that were out there."}, {"time": 9081, "text": "He has some explanations of the things that you've seen in with the Tic Tac, like with your own eyes."}, {"time": 9088, "text": "He says that it's possible that you miscalculated the size and the distance of the thing and so on when you were flying around."}, {"time": 9097, "text": "I don't find that as, I mean, maybe you can comment on that."}, {"time": 9101, "text": "Let me do it right now."}, {"time": 9103, "text": "So, cause that comes up."}, {"time": 9104, "text": "Like how, how did you know it was about 40 feet long?"}, {"time": 9105, "text": "I go, okay, so 16 years flying against other airplanes, know what stuff looks like."}, {"time": 9113, "text": "You know, I've looked down on things."}, {"time": 9114, "text": "So if I know, I know, here's the known things."}, {"time": 9116, "text": "I know when we saw the Tic Tac, I was at 20,000 feet ish, right around there."}, {"time": 9122, "text": "So when I look down, I know what a Hornet looks like looking down on them cause I've done it for all those years."}, {"time": 9127, "text": "I mean, I got a good idea."}, {"time": 9128, "text": "So that's, that's why I said 40 feet cause it's about Hornet size."}, {"time": 9131, "text": "So and as I go around, you know, you get to the point where you have to be able to judge distance when we fly out of experience and you can tell if something small or big, you know."}, {"time": 9143, "text": "So I would argue the fact of, you know, peer experiences, you know, professional observers, which is what we're actually trained to do."}, {"time": 9153, "text": "And having done it for so long, no, it was, and everyone came back with the same thing."},

eyes, what you see is the incorrect state of things."}, {"time": 9173, "text": "So like how often do you make mistakes with vision?"}, {"time": 9177, "text": "You actually, you make vision issues a lot because you're, and the sad part is, is your brain believes what your eyes see."}, {"time": 9184, "text": "We are actually trained to do the opposite of that, especially when you instrument fly

that the runway and your brain assumes that the runway is fixed, but you know that the runway is moving."}, {"time": 9206, "text": "So if I try and do stuff visually, I would, you die every time, not every time, but you die close to every time trying to land on a boat."}, {"time": 9214, "text": "So we actually use instruments, which are counter to your brain."}, {"time": 9217, "text": "So, and there's actually all kinds of things that we go through in training."}, {"time": 9221, "text": "They have this thing, I think they still use it."}, {"time": 9223, "text": "It's called the MSDD multi

think the thing goes really fast and they can, you can make yourself think that I'm descending or climbing, but we were actually only going around in circles at a very slow rate, as fast as a human can talk."}, {"time": 9244, "text": "But as they spin you around in a little sub thing and slow it down and speed it up, your body does this and you, you know, and then by visuals of showing you like they can spin it sideways to the outside wall, but they can show like lines that are, they can make the line stand still because they're moving the same velocity."}, {"time": 9258, "text": "They can move the other way and you'll think you're screaming."}, {"time": 9260, "text": "You see it in amusement parks all the time."}, {"time": 9263, "text": "You do all that because it gives you a sense of the A, but you're really not doing, you're sitting there."}, {"time": 9269, "text": "So we get trained on all that stuff."}, {"time": 9270, "text": "So if you, if you want to look at it and go, well, you're, you're disoriented or this, I'd be like, I'd argue going, no, I'm not."}, {"time": 9275, "text": "Because you know, when I'm flying the airplane, even as I'm looking at the Tic Tac, I've got a heads up display that tells me what my airplane's doing."}, {"time": 9282, "text": "So I've got, I know what I'm doing."}, {"time": 9284, "text": "I can look outside."}, {"time": 9285, "text": "I've

saying."}, {"time": 9313, "text": "You'd be amazed at how good, so here's a, here's another example."}, {"time": 9315, "text": "So if we go out over the water, so there's no land in sight and we're going to fight."}, {"time": 9320, "text": "So when we fight, you know, two airplanes, we're going to dog fight."}, {"time": 9325, "text": "As an instructor and I was for all, most of my time, you have to come back and you have to recreate it."}, {"time": 9331, "text": "So we call it drawing arrows."}, {"time": 9333, "text": "So you have to recreate that stuff."}, {"time": 9337, "text": "So you get pretty good at going, you know, like I would take off and say, all right, we're starting heading due east and I know where the sun is at because in the short couple minutes that we're going to fight,

ended heading 355."}, {"time": 9374, "text": "And then you recreate the turns and the amount of turns and use the sun relative."}, {"time": 9378, "text": "So you can create this entire battle that

trained to do all that."}, {"time": 9396, "text": "And I take all the notes, why I'm flying, you can do it."}, {"time": 9399, "text": "But usually it's, you memorize it all and you get done and then

when I learned, because I had come out of A6 and we really don't fight because it was a bomber."}, {"time": 9517, "text": "So I get in F18s and I want to learn how to fight because it's a whole other

that's inspiring to me and should be inspiring to a lot of scientists out there on so many levels, just like we said, an engineering level that maybe there's propulsion systems we can actually build

"text": "But on the video side, it's like it's the videos for the Flir video, the go fast and the gimbal video."}, {"time": 9645, "text": "They are only interesting to me to me in the context of your story."}, {"time": 9653, "text": "Like without that, they're kind of low resolution."}, {"time": 9656, "text": "It's like it it's easier to build a debunking story to be skeptical."}, {"time": 9662,

video and he says that one of the most amazing video parts of the Flir video for people haven't seen it is at the end of it, the Tic Tac flies or appears to fly very quickly to the left off the screen."}, {"time": 9691, "text": "And what Mick West says is that, you know, Mick West, probably others, that the way to explain that is the tracking system."}, {"time": 9702, "text": "Like we said, this vision based tracking simply loses the like the object."}, {"time": 9708, "text": "The tracking loses it."}, {"time": 9710, "text": "And so it simply allows the object to float off screen because it's no longer tracking it."}, {"time": 9718, "text": "So I find that at least a plausible explanation of that video."}, {"time": 9724, "text": "Looking at your face, you do not."}, {"time": 9727,

could have done this with the car and you'd have won the race."}, {"time": 9747, "text": "You know, and Lewis Hamilton right now is, you know, defending world champion two time ways, four time, four

driving a Formula One car."}, {"time": 9763, "text": "So I can't tell you how many times I've watched."}, {"time": 9765, "text": "You got to remember when we looked at this thing, when when Chad came back with the video, we sat there and watched that."}, {"time": 9770, "text": "I mean, I can't tell you how many times I watched it off the original tapes going, all right, right."}, {"time": 9775,

9780, "text": "And if you actually watch all that stuff, it doesn't do that."}, {"time": 9782, "text": "It actually when the vehicle starts to move, the bars, the tracking gate starts to open up and the people at Raytheon could probably add to this because they built the pod."}, {"time": 9791, "text": "The tracking gate will start to open up."}, {"time": 9792, "text": "And but the thing when it leaves so fast off the screen, the pod can't move fast enough."}, {"time": 9797, "text": "It has gimbal rates on how fast that thing can move around because there's another theory that, oh, the pods looking forward when the pod passes underneath the airplane."}, {"time": 9804, "text": "So if I'm looking at you and you pass underneath me as it does this, the ball will actually flip around to kind of finish off and it'll it'll it swaps ends because it has, you know, it's a gimbal."}, {"time": 9814, "text": "It can't just it's not free floating."}, {"time": 9818, "text": "But there's a theory on one of them."}, {"time": 9819, "text": "Oh, it's here and it flipped over."}, {"time": 9820, "text": "It doesn't do that when it's looking out in front."}, {"time": 9821, "text": "It stays like this."}, {"time": 9823, "text": "So yet another another debunker who doesn't know this."}, {"time": 9825, "text": "So, you know, and Mick has had several theories on other of some of the other videos like one of them, the go fast as a bird."}, {"time": 9833, "text": "And Jeremy Corbell actually did a nice job of saying, no, it's not because he's on he's on black hot."}, {"time": 9838, "text": "So the white object is actually colder than the ocean."}, {"time": 9843, "text": "If they were colder than the ocean, they'd be dead."}, {"time": 9845, "text": "So the gimbal video to comment on the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation, the apparent rotation of the object."}, {"time": 9855, "text": "That is something that is not possible to do with systems that we know of."}, {"time": 9862, "text": "And Mick West suggests that a flare like reflections or whatever can explain."}, {"time": 9870, "text": "Now, because what Mick West doesn't see is so when they take because I've talked

friend actually shot the video, one of his best friends for the video, the movie and both of them that go fast in the game were shot by the same person."}, {"time": 9891, "text": "OK, so and they were in each other's wedding."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "So that's how well they know each other."}, {"time": 9895, "text": "OK, so what you don't see is."}, {"time": 9898, "text": "So the airplanes, airplanes still super hornets, but they have the APG 79, which is the new phased array radar that's made by Raytheon, things incredible, OK?"}, {"time": 9908, "text": "It doesn't usually if it's if it's out there and it sees it, it's real."}, {"time": 9911, "text": "So at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing stuff."}, {"time": 9913, "text": "And then they actually threw one of the targeting pods out there."}, {"time": 9916, "text": "Well, the targeting pod, there's heat signature and you go, hey, dot heat signature, something's there."}, {"time": 9921, "text": "It's not you're not picking up some extraneous thing."}, {"time": 9922, "text": "So what you see in the gimbal video of the thing and it rotates and you go, holy shit, look at that thing."}, {"time": 9928, "text": "And it's in the wind and it's going against the wind while it's doing this."}, {"time": 9932, "text": "You know, someone goes, oh, it's an airplane."}, {"time": 9933, "text": "No, if an airplane does this, it's eventually going to start to change aspect because it's in a turn."}, {"time": 9937, "text": "This thing doesn't change aspect."}, {"time": 9938, "text": "It just rotates."},

that they identify is their number one priority or their launch and steering."}, {"time": 9951, "text": "So when they designate that, that's where the targeting pod is going to look."}, {"time": 9954,
