{"time": 343, "text": "They wanted to get into this person's phone."}, {"time": 345, "text": "It had to be done in the next 24 hours."}, {"time": 348, "text": "They approached hackers and say, we'll pay you X millions of dollars if you can do this."}, {"time": 353, "text": "But then you look at, when we've discovered iOS zero day exploits in the wild, some of them have been targeting large populations like Uyghurs."}, {"time": 365, "text": "So a couple of years ago, there was a watering hole attack."}, {"time": 370, "text": "Okay, what's a watering hole attack?"}, {"time": 372, "text": "There's a website, it was actually had information aimed at Uyghurs and you could access it all over the world."}, {"time": 380, "text": "And if you visited this website, it would drop an iOS zero day exploit onto your phone."}, {"time": 389, "text": "And so anyone that visited this website that was about Uyghurs anywhere, I mean, Uyghurs, Uyghurs living abroad, basically the Uyghur diaspora would have gotten infected with this zero day exploit."}, {"time": 403, "text": "So in that case, they were targeting huge swaths of this one population or people interested in this one population, basically in real time."}, {"time": 414, "text": "So who are these attackers?"}, {"time": 419, "text": "From the individual level to the group level, psychologically speaking, what's their motivation?"}, {"time": 425, "text": "Is it purely money?"}, {"time": 427, "text": "Is it the challenge?"}, {"time": 429, "text": "Are they malevolent?"}, {"time": 430, "text": "Is it power?"}, {"time": 432, "text": "These are big philosophical human questions, I guess."}, {"time": 435, "text": "So these are the questions I set out to answer for my book."}, {"time": 440, "text": "I wanted to know, are these people that are just after money?"}, {"time": 446, "text": "If they're just after money, how do they sleep at night?"}, {"time": 449, "text": "Not knowing whether that zero day exploit they just sold to a broker is being used to basically make someone's life a living hell."}, {"time": 458, "text": "And what I found was there's kind of this long sorted history to this question."}, {"time": 463, "text": "It started out in the 80s and 90s when hackers were just finding holes and bugs and software for curiosity's sake, really as a hobby."}, {"time": 474, "text": "And some of them would go to the tech companies like Microsoft or Sun Microsystems at the time or Oracle."}, {"time": 481, "text": "And they'd say, hey, I just found this zero day in your software and I can use it to break into NASA."}, {"time": 488, "text": "And the general response at the time wasn't, thank you so much for pointing out this flaw and our software, we'll get it fixed as soon as possible."}, {"time": 497, "text": "It was, don't ever poke around our software ever again or we'll stick our general counsel on you."}, {"time": 504, "text": "And that was really sort of the common thread for years."}, {"time": 510, "text": "And so hackers who set out to do the right thing were basically told to shut up and stop doing what you're doing."}, {"time": 520, "text": "And what happened next was they basically started trading this information online."}, {"time": 526, "text": "Now, when you go back and interview people from those early days, they all tell a very similar story, which is they're curious, they're tinkerers."}, {"time": 537, "text": "They remind me of like the kid down the block that was constantly poking around the hood of his dad's car."}, {"time": 543, "text": "They just couldn't help themselves."}, {"time": 546, "text": "They wanted to figure out how a system is designed and how they could potentially exploit it for some other purpose."}, {"time": 553, "text": "It doesn't have to be good or bad."}, {"time": 555, "text": "But they were basically kind of beat down for so long by these big tech companies that they started just silently trading them with other hackers."}, {"time": 568, "text": "And that's how you got these really heated debates in the 90s about disclosure."}, {"time": 575, "text": "Should you just dump these things online because any script kitty can pick them up and use it for all kinds of mischief."}, {"time": 583, "text": "But don't you wanna just stick a middle finger to all these companies that are basically threatening you all the time."}, {"time": 590, "text": "So there was this really interesting dynamic at play."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And what I learned in the course of doing my book was that government agencies and their contractors sort of tapped into that frustration and that resentment."}, {"time": 606, "text": "And they started quietly reaching out to hackers on these forums."}, {"time": 611, "text": "And they said, hey, you know that zero day you just dropped online, could you come up with something custom for me?"}, {"time": 617, "text": "And I'll pay you six figures for it so long as you shut up and never tell anyone that I paid you for this."}, {"time": 627, "text": "So throughout the 90s, there was a bunch of boutique contractors that started reaching out to hackers on these forums and saying, hey, I'll pay you six figures for that bug you were trying to get Microsoft to fix for free."}, {"time": 641, "text": "And sort of so began or so catalyzed this market where governments and their intermediaries started reaching out to these hackers and buying their bugs for free."}, {"time": 653, "text": "And in those early days, I think a lot of it was just for quiet counterintelligence, traditional espionage."}, {"time": 660, "text": "But as we started baking the software, Windows software, Schneider Electric, Siemens industrial software into our nuclear plants and our factories and our power grid and our petrochemical facilities and our pipelines, those same zero days came to be just as valuable for sabotage and war planning."}, {"time": 685, "text": "Does the fact that the market sprung up and you can now make a lot of money change the nature of the attackers that came to the table or grow the number of attackers?"}, {"time": 694, "text": "I mean, what is, I guess, you told the psychology of the hackers in the 90s, what is the culture today and where is it heading?"}, {"time": 703, "text": "So I think there are people who will tell you they would never sell a zero day to a zero day broker or a government."}, {"time": 712, "text": "One, because they don't know how it's gonna get used when they throw it over the fence."}, {"time": 716, "text": "Most of these get rolled into classified programs and you don't know how they get used."}, {"time": 721, "text": "If you sell it to a zero day broker, you don't even know which nation state might use it or potentially which criminal group might use it if you sell it on the dark web."}, {"time": 731, "text": "The other thing that they say is that they wanna be able to sleep at night."}, {"time": 737, "text": "And they lose a lot of sleep if they found out their zero day was being used to make a dissident's life living hell."}, {"time": 745, "text": "But there are a lot of people, good people, who also say, no, this is not my problem."}, {"time": 752, "text": "This is the technology company's problem."}, {"time": 755, "text": "If they weren't writing new bugs into their software every day, then there wouldn't be a market."}, {"time": 761, "text": "Then there wouldn't be a problem."}, {"time": 762, "text": "But they continue to write bugs into their software all the time and they continue to profit off that software."}, {"time": 768, "text": "So why shouldn't I profit off my labor too?"}, {"time": 773, "text": "And one of the things that has happened, which is I think a positive development over the last 10 years, are bug bounty programs."}, {"time": 782, "text": "Companies like Google and Facebook and then Microsoft and finally Apple, which resisted it for a really long time, have said, okay, we are gonna shift our perspective about hackers."}, {"time": 795, "text": "We're no longer going to treat them as the enemy here."}, {"time": 798, "text": "We're going to start paying them for what it's essentially free quality assurance."}, {"time": 803, "text": "And we're gonna pay them good money in some cases, six figures in some cases."}, {"time": 808, "text": "We're never gonna be able to bid against a zero day broker who sells to government agencies."}, {"time": 814, "text": "But we can reward them and hopefully get to that bug earlier where we can neutralize it so that they don't have to spend another year developing the zero day exploit."}, {"time": 824, "text": "And in that way, we can keep our software more secure."}, {"time": 828, "text": "But every week I get messages from some hacker that says, you know, I tried to see this zero day exploit that was just found in the wild, being used by this nation state."}, {"time": 840, "text": "I tried to tell Microsoft about this two years ago and they were gonna pay me peanuts so it never got fixed."}, {"time": 848, "text": "There are all sorts of those stories that can continue on."}, {"time": 852, "text": "And I think just generally, hackers are not very good at diplomacy."}, {"time": 859, "text": "They tend to be pretty snipey, technical crowd."}, {"time": 864, "text": "And very philosophical in my experience."}, {"time": 868, "text": "But diplomacy is not their strong suit."}, {"time": 871, "text": "Oh, there almost has to be a broker between companies and hackers."}, {"time": 875, "text": "We can translate effectively, just like you have a zero day broker between governments and hackers."}, {"time": 881, "text": "You have to speak their language."}, {"time": 883, "text": "Yeah, and there have been some of those companies who've risen up to meet that demand."}, {"time": 887, "text": "And HackerOne is one of them."}, {"time": 890, "text": "Bugcrowd is another."}, {"time": 892, "text": "Cynak has an interesting model, so that's a company that you pay for a private bug bounty program essentially."}, {"time": 899, "text": "So you pay this company, they tap hackers all over the world to come hack your software, hack your system."}, {"time": 907, "text": "And then they'll quietly tell you what they found."}, {"time": 910, "text": "And I think that's a really positive development."}, {"time": 913, "text": "And actually, the Department of Defense hired all three of those companies I just mentioned to help secure their systems."}, {"time": 922, "text": "Now I think they're still a little timid in terms of letting those hackers into the really sensitive, high side classified stuff."}, {"time": 930, "text": "But you know, baby steps."}, {"time": 933, "text": "Just to understand what you were saying, you think it's impossible for companies to financially compete with the zero day brokers, with governments."}, {"time": 942, "text": "So like the defense can't outpay the hackers?"}, {"time": 947, "text": "It's interesting, they shouldn't outpay them."}, {"time": 951, "text": "Because what would happen if they started offering $2.5 million at Apple for any zero day exploit that governments would pay that much for, is their own engineers would say, why the hell am I working for less than that and doing my nine to five every day?"}, {"time": 972, "text": "So you would create a perverse incentive."}, {"time": 974, "text": "And I didn't think about that until I started this research and I realized, okay, yeah, that makes sense."}, {"time": 980, "text": "You don't want to incentivize offense so much that it's to your own detriment."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And so I think what they have though, what the companies have on government agencies, is if they pay you, you get to talk about it."}, {"time": 996, "text": "You know, you get the street cred."}, {"time": 998, "text": "You get to brag about the fact you just found that $2.5 million, you know, iOS zero day that no one else did."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "And if you sell it to a broker, you never get to talk about it."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And I think that really does eat at people."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "Can I ask you a big philosophical question about human nature here?"}, {"time": 1017, "text": "So if you have, I mean, what you've seen, if a human being has a zero day, they found a zero day vulnerability that can hack into, I don't know, what's the worst thing you can hack into?"}, {"time": 1031, "text": "Something that could launch nuclear weapons."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Which percentage of the people in the world that have the skill would not share that with anyone, with any bad party?"}, {"time": 1043, "text": "I guess how many people are completely devoid of ethical concerns in your sense?"}, {"time": 1051, "text": "So my belief is all the ultra competent people or very, very high percentage of ultra competent people are also ethical people."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "That's been my experience."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "But then again, my experience is narrow."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "What's your experience been like?"}, {"time": 1068, "text": "So this was another question I wanted to answer."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "Who are these people who would sell a zero day exploit that would neutralize a Schneider Electric safety lock at a petrochemical plant?"}, {"time": 1083, "text": "Basically the last thing you would need to neutralize before you trigger some kind of explosion."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "Who would sell that?"}, {"time": 1091, "text": "And I got my answer, well, the answer was different."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "A lot of people said, I would never even look there because I don't even wanna know."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "I don't even wanna have that capability."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "I don't even wanna have to make that decision about whether I'm gonna profit off of that knowledge."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "I went down to Argentina and this whole kind of moral calculus I had in my head was completely flipped around."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "So just to back up for a moment."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "So Argentina actually is a real hacker's paradise."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "People grew up in Argentina and I went down there, I guess I was there around 2015, 2016, but you still couldn't get an iPhone."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "They didn't have Amazon Prime."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "You couldn't get access to any of the apps we all take for granted."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "To get those things in Argentina as a kid, you have to find a way to hack them."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "And the whole culture is really like a hacker culture."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "They say it's really like a MacGyver culture."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "You have to figure out how to break into something with wire and tape."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "And that means that there are a lot of really good hackers in Argentina who specialize in developing zero to exploits."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "And I went down to this Argentina conference called Echo Party."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "And I asked the organizer, okay, can you introduce me to someone who's selling zero to exploits to governments?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And he was like, just throw a stone."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Throw a stone anywhere and you're gonna hit someone."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "And all over this conference, you saw these guys who were clearly from these Gulf States who only spoke Arabic."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "What are they doing at a young hacking conference in Buenos Aires?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "And so I went out to lunch with kind of this godfather of the hacking scene there."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "And I asked this really dumb question and I'm still embarrassed about how I phrased it."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "But I said, so will these guys only sell these zero to exploits to good Western governments?"}, {"time": 1220, "text": "And he said, Nicole, last time I checked, the United States wasn't a good Western government."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "The last country that bombed another country into oblivion wasn't China or Iran, it was the United States."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "So if we're gonna go by your whole moral calculus, just know that we have a very different calculus down here and we'd actually rather sell to Iran or Russia or China maybe than the United States."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And that just blew me away."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "Like, wow, he's like, we'll just sell to whoever brings us the biggest bag of cash."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "Have you checked into our inflation situation recently?"}, {"time": 1257, "text": "So I had some of those like reality checks along the way."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "We tend to think of things as is this moral, is this ethical, especially as journalists."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "And we kind of sit on our high horse sometimes and write about a lot of things that seem to push the moral bounds."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "But in this market, which is essentially an underground market that the one rule is like fight club."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "No one talks about fight club."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "First rule of the zero day market, nobody talks about the zero day market on both sides because the hacker doesn't wanna lose their $2.5 million bounty."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "And governments roll these into classified programs and they don't want anyone to know what they have."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "So no one talks about this thing."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And when you're operating in the dark like that, it's really easy to put aside your morals sometimes."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "Can I, as a small tangent, ask you, by way of advice, you must have done some incredible interviews."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "And you've also spoken about how serious you take protecting your sources."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "If you were to give me advice for interviewing when you're recording on mic with a video camera, how is it possible to get into this world?"}, {"time": 1333, "text": "Like is it basically impossible?"}, {"time": 1336, "text": "So you've spoken with a few people, what is it like the godfather of cyber war, cyber security?"}, {"time": 1343, "text": "So people that are already out."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "And they still have to be pretty brave to speak publicly."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "But is it virtually impossible to really talk to anybody who is a current hacker?"}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Are you always like 10, 20 years behind?"}, {"time": 1358, "text": "And this is why I'm a print journalist."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "But when I've seen people do it, it's always the guy who's behind the shadows, whose voice has been altered."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "When they've gotten someone on camera, that's usually how they do it."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "Very, very few people talk in this space."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "And there's actually a pretty well known case study in why you don't talk publicly in this space and you don't get photographed."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And that's the gruck."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "So the gruck is or was this zero day broker, South African guy, lives in Thailand."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And right when I was starting on this subject at the New York Times, he'd given an interview to Forbes."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "And he talked about being a zero day broker."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "And he even posed next to this giant duffel bag filled with cash, ostensibly."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And later he would say he was speaking off the record."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "He didn't understand the rules of the game."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "But what I heard from people who did business with him was that the minute that that story came out, he became PNG'd."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "No one did business with him."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "His business plummeted by at least half."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "No one wants to do business with anyone who's going to get on camera and talk about how they're selling zero days to governments."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "It puts you at danger."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And I did hear that he got some visits from some security folks."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And that's another thing for these people to consider."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "If they have those zero day exploits at their disposal, they become a huge target for nation states all over the world."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "Talk about having perfect opsec."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "You better have some perfect opsec if people know that you have access to those zero day exploits."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "Which sucks because, I mean, transparency here would be really powerful for educating the world and also inspiring other engineers to do good."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "It just feels like when you operate in the shadows, it doesn't help us move in the positive direction in terms of getting more people on the defense side versus on the attack side."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "But of course, what can you do?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "I mean, the best you can possibly do is have great journalists, just like you did, interview and write books about it, and integrate the information you get while hiding the sources."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "Yeah, and I think what HackerOne has told me was, OK, let's just put away the people that are finding and developing zero day exploits all day long."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "What about however many millions of programmers all over the world who've never even heard of a zero day exploit?"}, {"time": 1523, "text": "Why not tap into them and say, hey, we'll start paying you if you can find a bug in United Airlines software or in Schneider Electric or in Ford or Tesla?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And I think that is a really smart approach."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "Let's go find this untapped army of programmers to neutralize these bugs before the people who will continue to sell these to governments can find them and exploit them."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "OK, I have to ask you about this."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "From a personal side, it's funny enough, after we agreed to talk, I've gotten, for the first time in my life, was a victim of a cyber attack."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "So this is ransomware."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "It's called Deadbolt."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "People can look it up."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "I have a QNAP device for basically kind of coldish storage."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "So it's about 60 terabytes with 50 terabytes of data on it in RAID 5."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "And apparently, about 4,000 to 5,000 QNAP devices were hacked and taken over with this ransomware."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And what ransomware does there is it goes file by file, almost all the files on the QNAP storage device, and encrypts them."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And then there's this very eloquently and politely written page that pops up, describes what happened."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "All your files have been encrypted."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "This includes but is not limited to photos, documents, and spreadsheets."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "This is a lot of people commented about how friendly and eloquent this is."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "And I have to commend them."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "It is, and it's pretty user friendly."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "This is not a personal attack."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "You have been targeted because of the inadequate security provided by your vendor, QNAP."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "What now?"}, {"time": 1636, "text": "You can make a payment of exactly 0.03 Bitcoin, which is about $1,000, to the following address."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "Once the payment has been made, we'll follow up with transaction to the same address, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "They give you instructions of what happens next, and they'll give you a decryption key that you can then use."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "And then there's another message for QNAP that says, all your affected customers have been targeted using a zero day vulnerability in your product."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "We offer you two options to mitigate this and future damage."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "One, make a Bitcoin payment of 5 Bitcoin to the following address, and that will reveal to QNAP the, I'm summarizing things here, what the actual vulnerability is."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "Or you can make a Bitcoin payment of 50 Bitcoin to get a master decryption key for all your customers."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "50 Bitcoin is about $1.8 million."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "So first of all, on a personal level, this one hurt for me."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "There's, I mean, I learned a lot because I wasn't, for the most part, backing up much of that data because I thought I can afford to lose that data."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "It's not horrible."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "I mean, I think you've spoken about the crown jewels, like making sure there's things you really protect."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "And I have, you know, I'm very conscious, security wise, on the crown jewels."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "But there's a bunch of stuff, like, you know, personal videos that are not, like, I don't have anything creepy, but just, like, fun things I did that because they're very large or 4K or something like that, I kept them on there, thinking RAID 5 will protect it."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "You know, just I lost a bunch of stuff, including raw footage from interviews and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "So it's painful."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "And I'm sure there's a lot of painful stuff like that for the 4,000 to 5,000 people that use QNAP."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And there's a lot of interesting ethical questions here."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Do you pay them?"}, {"time": 1760, "text": "Does QNAP pay them?"}, {"time": 1763, "text": "Do the individuals pay them, especially when you don't know if it's going to work or not?"}, {"time": 1769, "text": "Do you wait?"}, {"time": 1770, "text": "So QNAP said that, please don't pay them."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "We're working very hard day and night to solve this."}, {"time":

LastPass, worst case example, actually LastPass."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "But you get one and then you go test it on their email account."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "And you go test it on their brokerage account and you test it on their cold storage account."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "But if you have multi factor authentication, then they can't get in because they might have your password, but they don't have your phone, they don't have your Fido key."}, {"time": 3341, "text": "So you keep them out."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "And I get a lot of alerts that tell me someone is trying to

"And yeah, I mean, it's not gonna get us away from the password and using multifactor authentication, but the technology is out there and we just have to figure out how to use it in a really seamless
