believes that there's always a cause, you know, there are no miracles of a supernatural nature, okay?"}, {"time": 399, "text": "So I mean, there are two broad categories, either it's the vacuum zero point energy, or it's some sort of a new energy field that pervades the universe."}, {"time": 410, "text": "The latter could change with time, the former, the vacuum energy cannot."}, {"time": 415, "text": "So if it turns out that it's one of these new fields, and there are many, many possibilities, they go by the name of quintessence and things like that, but there are many categories of those sorts of fields, we try with data to rule them out by comparing the actual measurements with the predictions."}, {"time": 436, "text": "And some have been ruled out, but many, many others remain to be tested."}, {"time": 442, "text": "And the data just have to become a lot better before we can rule out most of them and become reasonably convinced that this is a vacuum energy."}, {"time": 451, "text": "So there is hypotheses for different fields, like with names and stuff like that?"}, {"time": 455, "text": "Yeah, you know, generically quintessence, like the Aristotelian fifth essence, but there are many, many versions of quintessence."}, {"time": 462, "text": "There's K essence, there's even ideas that, you know, this isn't something from within this dark energy, but rather, there are a bunch of, say, bubble universes surrounding our universe, and this whole idea of the multiverse is not some crazy madman type idea anymore."}, {"time": 480, "text": "It's, you know, real card carrying physicists are seriously considering this possibility of a multiverse."}, {"time": 486, "text": "And some types of multiverses could have, you know, a bunch of bubbles on the outside, which gravitationally act outward on our bubble because gravity or gravitons, the quantum particle that is thought to carry gravity, is thought to traverse the bulk, the space between these different little bubble membranes and stuff."}, {"time": 507, "text": "And so it's conceivable that these other universes are pulling outward on us."}, {"time": 511, "text": "That's not a favored explanation right now, but really, nothing has been ruled out."}, {"time": 518, "text": "No class of models has been ruled out completely."}, {"time": 521, "text": "Certain examples within classes of models have been ruled out."}, {"time": 561, "text": "Maybe these are our 20th and 21st century Ptolemaic epicycles."}, {"time": 568, "text": "So Ptolemy had a geocentric and Aristotelian view of the world."}, {"time": 572, "text": "Everything goes around Earth."}, {"time": 574, "text": "But in order to explain the backward motion of planets among the stars that happens every year or two, or sometimes several times a year for Mercury and Venus, you needed the planets to go around in little circles called epicycles, which themselves then went around Earth."}, {"time": 592, "text": "And in this part of the epicycle where the planet is going in the direction opposite to the direction of the overall epicycle, it can appear in projection to be going backward among the stars, so called retrograde motion."}, {"time": 608, "text": "And it was a brilliant mathematical scheme."}, {"time": 610, "text": "In fact, he could have added epicycles on top of epicycles and reproduced the observed positions of planets to arbitrary accuracy."}, {"time": 619, "text": "And this is really the beginning of what we now call Fourier analysis, right?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "Any periodic function can be represented by a sum of sines and cosines of different periods, amplitudes, and phases."}, {"time": 633, "text": "So it could have worked arbitrarily well."}, {"time": 636, "text": "But other data show that, in fact, Earth is going around the sun."}, {"time": 642, "text": "So our dark energy and dark matter, just these band aids that we now have to try to explain the data, but they're just completely wrong."}, {"time": 653, "text": "That's a possibility as well."}, {"time": 654, "text": "And as a scientist, I have to be open to that possibility as an open minded scientist."}, {"time": 660, "text": "How do you put yourself in the mindset of somebody that, or majority of the scientific community or majority of people believe that the Earth, everything rotates around Earth?"}, {"time": 670, "text": "How do you put yourself in that mindset and then take a leap to propose a model that the sun is, in fact, at the center of the solar system?"}, {"time": 686, "text": "I mean, so that puts us back in the shoes of Copernicus, right, 500 years ago, where he had this philosophical preference for the sun being the dominant body in what we now call the solar system."}, {"time": 701, "text": "The observational evidence in terms of the measured positions of planets was not better explained by the heliocentric, sun centered system."}, {"time": 713, "text": "It's just that Copernicus saw that the sun is the source of all our light and heat, and he knew from other studies that it's far away."}, {"time": 723, "text": "So the fact that it appears as big as the moon means it's actually way, way bigger because even at that time, it was known that the sun is much farther away than the moon."}, {"time": 732, "text": "So he just felt, wow, it's big, it's bright."}, {"time": 736, "text": "What if it's the central thing?"}, {"time": 738, "text": "But the observed positions of planets at the time in the early to mid 16th century under the heliocentric system was not a better match, at least not a significantly better match than Ptolemy's system, which was quite accurate and lasted 1500 years."}, {"time": 757, "text": "That's so fascinating to think that the philosophical predispositions that you bring to the table are essential."}, {"time": 766, "text": "So like you have to have a young person come along that has a weird infatuation with the sun."}, {"time": 772, "text": "That like almost philosophically is like however their upbringing is, they're more ready for whatever the more the simpler answer is."}, {"time": 783, "text": "Oh, that's kind of sad."}, {"time": 787, "text": "It's a sad from an individual descendant of eight perspective because then that means like me, you as a scientist, you're stuck with whatever the heck philosophies you brought to the table and you might be almost completely unable to think outside this particular box you've built."}, {"time": 807, "text": "This is why I'm saying that, you know, as an objective scientist, one needs to have an open mind to crazy sounding new ideas."}, {"time": 814, "text": "And even Copernicus was very much a man of his time and dedicated his work to the Pope."}, {"time": 820, "text": "He still used circular orbits."}, {"time": 823, "text": "The sun was a little bit off center, it turns out, and a slightly off center circle looks like a slightly eccentric elliptical orbit."}, {"time": 832, "text": "So then when Kepler, in fact, showed that the orbits are actually in general ellipses, not circles, the reason that he needed Tuco Brahe's really great data to show that distinction was that a slightly off center circle is not much different from a slightly eccentric ellipse."}, {"time": 853, "text": "And so there wasn't much difference between Kepler's view and Copernicus's view and Kepler needed the better data, Tuco Brahe's data."}, {"time": 864, "text": "And so that's, again, a great example of science and observations and experiments working together with hypotheses and they kind of bounce off each other."}, {"time": 876, "text": "They play off of each other and you continually need more observations."}, {"time": 880, "text": "And it wasn't until Galileo's work around 1610 that actual evidence for the heliocentric hypothesis emerged."}, {"time": 891, "text": "It came in the form of Venus, the planet Venus, going through all of the possible phases from new to crescent to quarter to gibbous to full to waning gibbous, third quarter waning crescent, and then new again."}, {"time": 905, "text": "It turns out in the Ptolemaic system with Venus between Earth and the sun, but always roughly in the direction of the sun, you could only get the new and crescent phases of Venus."}, {"time": 917, "text": "But the observations showed a full set of phases."}, {"time": 921, "text": "And moreover, when Venus was gibbous or full, that meant it was on the far side of the sun."}, {"time": 926, "text": "That meant it was farther from Earth than when it's crescent, so it should appear smaller and indeed it did."}, {"time": 933, "text": "So that was the nail in the coffin in a sense."}, {"time": 936, "text": "And then Galileo's other great observation was that Jupiter has moons going around it, the four Galilean satellites."}, {"time": 944, "text": "And even though Jupiter moves through space, so too do the moons go with it."}, {"time": 949, "text": "So first of all, Earth is not the only thing that has other things going around it."}, {"time": 953, "text": "And secondly, Earth could be moving as Jupiter does and things would move with it."}, {"time": 961, "text": "We wouldn't fly off the surface and our moon wouldn't be left behind and all this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 965, "text": "So that was a big breakthrough as well, but it wasn't as definitive in my opinion as the phases of Venus."}, {"time": 973, "text": "Sometimes I'm revealing my ignorance, but I didn't realize how much data they were working with."}, {"time": 980, "text": "So it wasn't Einstein or Freud thinking in theories."}, {"time": 987, "text": "It was a lot of data and you're playing with it and seeing how to make sense of it."}, {"time": 991, "text": "So it isn't just coming up with completely abstract thought experiments."}, {"time": 996, "text": "It's looking at the data."}, {"time": 998, "text": "And you look at Newton's great work, right?"}, {"time": 1000, "text": "The Principia, it was based in part on Galileo's observations of balls rolling down inclined planes, supposedly falling off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but that's probably apocryphal."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "In any case, the Roman Catholic Church did history a favor, not that I'm condoning them, but they placed Galileo under house arrest and that gave Galileo time to publish, to assemble and publish the results of his experiments that he had done decades earlier."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "It's not clear he would have had time to do that, had he not been under house arrest."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "And so Newton, of course, very much used Galileo's observations."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "Let me ask the old Russian overly philosophical question about death."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "So we're talking about the expanding universe."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "How do you think human civilization will come to an end if we avoid the near term issues we're having?"}, {"time": 1065, "text": "Will it be our sun burning out?"}, {"time": 1067, "text": "Will it be comets?"}, {"time": 1069, "text": "Will it be, what is it?"}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Do you think we have a shot at reaching the heat death of the universe?"}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So we're going to leave out the anthropogenic causes of our potential destruction, which I actually think are greater than the celestial causes."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "So if we get lucky and intelligent, I don't know."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "So no way will we as humans reach the heat death of the universe."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "It's conceivable that machines, which I think will be our evolutionary descendants, might reach that, although even they will have less and less energy with which to work as time progresses because eventually even the lowest mass stars burn out, although it takes them trillions of years to do so."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So the point is that certainly on Earth, there are other celestial threats, existential threats, comets, exploding stars, the sun burning out."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "So we will definitely need to move away from our solar system to other solar systems."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And then the question is, can they keep on propagating to other planetary systems sufficiently long?"}, {"time": 1151, "text": "In our own solar system, the sun burning out is not the immediate existential threat."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "That'll happen in about five billion years when it becomes a red giant, although I should hasten to add that within the next one or two billion years, the sun will have brightened enough that unless there are compensatory atmospheric changes, the oceans will evaporate away."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "They're going to need much less carbon dioxide for the temperatures to be maintained roughly at their present temperature, and plants wouldn't like that very much."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "So you can't lower the carbon dioxide content too much."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "So within one or two billion years, probably the oceans will evaporate away."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "Now it's true that we can find and track the orbits of asteroids that might be headed toward Earth, and if we find them 50 or 100 years before they impact us, then clever applied physicists and engineers can figure out ways to deflect them."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "But at some point, some comet will come in from the deep freeze of the solar system, and there we have very little warning, months to a year."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "What's the deep freeze, sorry to interrupt."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "The deep freeze is sort of out beyond Neptune."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "There's this thing called the Kuiper Belt, and it consists of a bunch of dirty ice balls or icy dirt balls."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "It's the source of the comets that occasionally come close to the Sun."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "And then there's an even bigger area called the Scattered Disk, which is sort of a big doughnut surrounding the solar system way out there from which other comets come."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "By the time we can see them, they're only a year or two away from us."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "And moreover, not only is it hard to determine their trajectories sufficiently accurately to know whether they'll hit a tiny thing like Earth, but outgassing from the comet of gases when the ices sublimate, that outgassing can change the trajectory just because of conservation of momentum, right?"}, {"time": 1334, "text": "It's the rocket effect."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "Gases go out in one direction, the object moves in the other direction."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And so since we can't predict how much outgassing there will be and in exactly what direction because these things are tumbling and rotating and stuff, it's hard to predict the trajectory with sufficient accuracy to know that it will hit."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "And you certainly don't want to deflect a comet that would have missed but you thought it was going to hit and end up having it hit."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "That would be like the ultimate Charlie Brown goat instead of trying to be the hero, right?"}, {"time": 1367, "text": "He ended up being the goat."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "What would you do if it seemed like in a matter of months that there is some nonzero probability, maybe a high probability that there will be a collision?"}, {"time": 1382, "text": "So from a scientific perspective, from an engineering perspective, I imagine you would actually be in the room of people deciding what to do."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "What uh, philosophically too."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "It's a tough one, right?"}, {"time": 1393, "text": "Because if you only have a few months, that's not much time in which to deflect it."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "Early detection and early action are key because when it's far away, you only have to deflect it by a tiny little angle."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "And then by the time it reaches us, the perpendicular motion is big enough to miss Earth."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "All you need is one radius or one diameter of the Earth, right?"}, {"time": 1421, "text": "That actually means that all you would need to do is slow it down so it arrives four minutes later or speed it up so it arrives four minutes earlier and Earth will have moved through one radius in that time."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "So it doesn't take much."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "But you can imagine if a thing is about to hit you, you have to deflect it 90 degrees or more, right?"}, {"time": 1443, "text": "You know, and you don't have much time to do so and you have to slow it down or speed it up a lot if that's what you're trying to do to it."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "And so decades is sufficient time, but months is not sufficient time."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "So at that point, I would think the name of the game would be to try to predict where it would hit."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And if it's in a heavily populated region, try to start an orderly evacuation perhaps."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "But you know, that might cause just so much panic that I'm, how would you do with New York City or Los Angeles or something like that, right?"}, {"time": 1481, "text": "I might have a different opinion a year ago, I'm a bit disheartened by, you know, in the movies, there's always extreme competence from the government."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "But we expect extreme incompetence, if anything, right?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "So I'm quite disappointed."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Yeah, monitoring the asteroid belt is very important and 99% of the so called near earth objects ultimately come from the asteroid belt."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "And so there we can track the trajectories and even if there's a close encounter between two asteroids which deflects one of them toward earth, it's unlikely to be on a collision course with earth in the immediate future, it's more like tens of years, so that gives us time."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "But we would need to improve our ability to detect the objects that come in from a great distance."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And those are much rarer, the comets come in, 1% of the collisions perhaps are with comets that come in without any warning hardly."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "So that might be more like a billion or two billion years before one of those hits us."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "So maybe we have to worry about the sun getting brighter on that time scale."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "I mean, there's the possibility that a star will explode near us in the next couple of billion years."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "But even there, the evidence is circumstantial."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "So those kinds of existential threats are reasonably rare."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "The greater danger I think is civilization changing events where it's a much smaller asteroid, which those are harder to detect, or a giant solar flare that shorts out the grid in all of North America, let's say."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "So if we can warn the power companies and they can shut down the grid before the big bundle of particle hits, then we will have mitigated much of this."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Now for a big enough bundle of particles, you can get short circuits even over small distance scales, so not everything will be saved, but at least the whole grid might not go out."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "So again, astronomers, I like to say, support your local astronomer, they may help someday save humanity by telling the power companies to shut down the grid, finding the asteroid 50 or 100 years before it hits, then having clever physicists and engineers deflect it."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So many of these cosmic threats, cosmic existential threats, we can actually predict and do something about or observe before they hit and do something about."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "So it's terrifying to think that people would listen to this conversation."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "It's like when you listen to Bill Gates talk about pandemics in his Ted talk a few years ago and realizing we should have supported our local astronomer more."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "Well, I don't know whether it's more because as I said, I actually think human induced threats or things that occur naturally on earth, either a natural pandemic or perhaps a bioengineering type pandemic or something like a super volcano."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "There was one event towed by I think it was 70 plus thousand years ago that caused a gigantic decrease in temperatures on earth because it sent up so much soot that it blocked the sun."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "It's the nuclear winter type disaster scenario that some people including Carl Sagan talked about decades ago."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "What we can see in the history of volcanic eruptions even more recently in the 19th century, Tambora and other ones, you look at the record and you see rather large dips in temperature associated with massive volcanic eruptions."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "Well these super volcanoes, one of which by the way exists under Yellowstone in the central US, it's not just one or two states, it's a gigantic region and there's controversy as to whether it's likely to blow anytime in the next 100,000 years or so."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "But that would be perhaps not a mass extinction or perhaps not a complete existential threat because you have to get rid of the very last humans for that, but at least getting rid of killing off so many humans, truly billions and billions of humans."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "There have been ones tens of thousands of years ago including this one, Toba I think it's called, where it's estimated that the human population was down to 10,000 or 5,000 individuals, something like that."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "If you have a 15 degree drop in temperature over quite a short time, it's not clear that even with today's advanced technology, we would be able to adequately respond at least for the vast majority of people."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "Maybe some would be in these underground caves where you'd keep the president and a bunch of other important people, but the typical person is not going to be protected when all of agriculture is cut off."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "It could be hundreds of millions or billions of people starving to death."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "They don't all die immediately, but they use up their supplies or again, this electrical grid."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "First of toilet paper."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "Dash that toilet paper or the electrical grid."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "Imagine North America without power for a year."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "We've become so dependent, we're no longer the cave people."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "They would do just fine."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "What do they care about the electrical grid?"}, {"time": 1922, "text": "What do they care about agriculture, their hunters and gatherers?"}, {"time": 1926, "text": "But we now have become so used to our way of life that the only real survivors would be those rugged individualists who live somewhere out in the forest or in a cave somewhere, completely independent of anyone else."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "Recently I recommended, it's totally new to me, this kind of survivalist folks, but there's a few shows."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "There's a lot of shows of those, but I saw one on Netflix and I started watching them and they make a lot of sense."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "They reveal to you how dependent we are on all aspects of this beautiful systems we human have built and how fragile they are."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "Incredibly fragile."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "And this whole conversation is making me realize how lucky we are."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "Oh, we're incredibly lucky, but we've set ourselves up to be very, very fragile and we are intrinsically complex biological creatures that except for the fact that we have brains and minds with which we can try to prevent some of these things or respond to them."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "We as a living organism require quite a narrow set of conditions in order to survive."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "We're not cockroaches."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "We're not going to survive a nuclear war."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "So we're kind of this beautiful dance between, we've been talking about astronomy, that astronomy, the stars like inspires everybody and at the same time, there's this pragmatic aspect that we're talking about."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "And so I see space exploration as the same kind of way that it's reaching out to other planets, reaching out to the stars, this really beautiful idea."}, {"time": 2028, "text": "But if you listen to somebody like Elon Musk, he talks about space exploration as very pragmatic."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "Like we have to be, he has this ridiculous way of sounding like an engineer about it, which is like, it's obvious we need to become a multi planetary species if we were to survive long term."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "So maybe both philosophically in terms of beauty and in terms of practical, what's your thoughts on space exploration, on the challenges of it, on how much we should be investing in it and on a personal level, like how excited you are by the possibility of going to Mars, colonizing Mars and maybe going outside the solar system."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "You know, great question."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "There's a lot to unpack there of course."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "Humans are by their very nature explorers, pioneers."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "They want to go out, climb the next mountain, see what's behind it, explore the option depths, explore space."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "This is our destiny to go out there."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "And of course, from a pragmatic perspective, yes, we need to plant our seeds elsewhere really because things could go wrong here on Earth."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "Now some people say that's an excuse to not take care of our planet."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "Well, we say we're elsewhere and so we don't have to take good care of our planet."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "No, we should take the best possible care of our planet."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "We should be cognizant of the potential impact of what we're doing."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "Nevertheless, it's prudent to have us be elsewhere as well."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "So in that regard, I actually agree with Elon."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "It'd be good to be on Mars."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "That would be yet another place for us from which to explore further."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "Would that be a good next step?"}, {"time": 2139, "text": "Well, it's a good next step."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "I happen to disagree with him as to how quickly it will happen."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "I think he's very optimistic."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "Now you need visionary people like Elon to get people going and to inspire them."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "I mean, look at the success he's had with multiple companies."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "So maybe he gives this very optimistic timeline in order to be inspirational to those who are going out there."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "And certainly his success with the rocket that is reusable because it landed upright and all that."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "I mean, that's a game changer."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "It's sort of like every time you flew from San Francisco to Los Angeles, you discard the airplane, right?"}, {"time": 2177, "text": "I mean, that's crazy, right?"}, {"time": 2180, "text": "So that's a game changer."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "But nevertheless, the timescale over which he thinks that there could be a real thriving colony on Mars, I think is far too optimistic."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "What's the biggest challenges to you?"}, {"time": 2193, "text": "One is just getting rockets, not rockets, but people out there and two

beings that can ask these questions about our very origins and with our intellect and with the machines we make, come to a reasonable understanding of our origins."}, {"time": 8355, "text": "What a beautiful story."}, {"time": 8356, "text": "I mean, if that does not put you at least in awe, if not in love with science and its power of deduction, I don't know what will, right?"}, {"time": 8370, "text": "It's one of the greatest stories, if not the greatest story."}, {"time": 8373, "text": "Obviously, that's personality dependent and all that, it's a subjective opinion, but it's perhaps the greatest story ever told."}, {"time": 8381, "text": "I mean, you could link it to the Big Bang and go even farther, right, to make an even more complete story, but as a subset, that's even in some ways a greater story than even the existence of the universe in some ways, because you could just imagine some really boring universe that never leads to sentient creatures such as ourselves."}, {"time": 8401, "text": "And is a supernova usually the introduction to that story?"}, {"time": 8406, "text": "So are they usually the thing that launches the, is there other engines of creation?"}, {"time": 8412, "text": "Well, the supernova is the one, I mean, I touch upon the subject earlier in my course, in fact, right about now in my lectures, because I talk about how our sun right now is fusing hydrogen to form helium nuclei and later it'll form carbon and oxygen nuclei, but that's where the process will stop for our sun, it's not massive enough, some stars that are more massive can go somewhat beyond that."}, {"time": 8437, "text": "So that's the beginning of this idea of the birth of the heavy elements, since they couldn't have been born at the time of the Big Bang, conditions of temperature and pressure weren't sufficient to make any significant quantities of the heavier elements."}, {"time": 8451, "text": "And so that's the beginning, but then you need some of these stars to explode, right?"}, {"time": 8457, "text": "Because if those heavy elements remained forever trapped in the cores of stars, then they would not be available for the production of new stars, planets, and ultimately life."}, {"time": 8468, "text": "So indeed the supernova, my main area of interest, plays a leading role in this whole story."}, {"time": 8477, "text": "I saw that you got a chance to call Richard Feynman a mentor of yours when you were at Caltech."}, {"time": 8484, "text": "Do you have any fond memories of Feynman, any lessons that stick with you?"}, {"time": 8488, "text": "Oh yeah, he was quite a character and one of the deepest thinkers of all time probably, and at least in my life, the physicist who had the single most intuitive understanding of how nature works of anyone I've met."}, {"time": 8508, "text": "I learned a number of things from him, he was not my thesis advisor, I worked with Wallace Sargent at Caltech on what are called active galaxies, big black holes in the centers of galaxies that are accreting or swallowing material, a little bit like the stuff of this year's Nobel Prize in Physics 2020."}, {"time": 8526, "text": "But Feynman I had for two courses, one was general theory of relativity at the graduate level and one was applications of quantum physics to all kinds of interesting things."}, {"time": 8538, "text": "And he had this very intuitive way of looking at things that he tried to bring to his students and he felt that if you can't explain something in a reasonably simple way to a non scientist or at least someone who is versed a little bit with science but is not a professional scientist then you probably don't understand it very well yourself very thoroughly."}, {"time": 8569, "text": "So that in me made a desire to be able to explain science to the general public and I've often found that in explaining things, yeah, there's a certain part that I didn't really understand myself, that's one reason I like to teach the introductory courses to the lay public is that I sometimes find that my explanations are lacking in my own mind."}, {"time": 8592, "text": "So he did that for me."}, {"time": 8594, "text": "Is there a, if I could just pause for a second, you said he had one of the most intuitive understanding of nature."}, {"time": 8600, "text": "What if you could break apart what intuitive means, like is that on the philosophical level?"}, {"time": 8606, "text": "No, sort of physical."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "How do you draw a mental picture or a picture on paper of what's going on?"}, {"time": 8613, "text": "And he's perhaps most famous in this regard for his Feynman diagrams, which in what's called quantum electrodynamics, a quantum field theory of electricity and magnetism."}, {"time": 8624, "text": "What you have are actually an exchange of photons between charged particles and they might even be virtual photons if the particles are at rest relative to one another."}, {"time": 8635, "text": "And there are ways of doing calculations that are brute force that take pages on pages and pages of calculations."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "And Julian Schwinger developed some of the mathematics for that and won the Nobel prize for it."}, {"time": 8647, "text": "But Feynman had these diagrams that he made and he had a set of rules of what to do at the vertex."}, {"time": 8653, "text": "You'd have two particles coming together and then a particle going out and then two particles coming out again."}, {"time": 8658, "text": "And he'd have these rules associated when there were vertices and when there were particles splitting off from one another and all that."}, {"time": 8664, "text": "And it looked a little bit like a bunch of a hodgepodge at first."}, {"time": 8667, "text": "But to those who learned the rules and understood them, they saw that you could do these complex calculations in a much simpler way."}, {"time": 8677, "text": "And indeed, in some ways, Freeman Dyson had an even better knack for explaining really what quantum electrodynamics actually was."}, {"time": 8686, "text": "But I didn't know Freeman Dyson."}, {"time": 8688, "text": "I knew Feynman."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "Maybe he did have a more intuitive view of the world than Feynman did."}, {"time": 8692, "text": "But of the people I knew, Feynman was the most intuitive, most sort of, is there a picture?"}, {"time": 8698, "text": "Is there a simple way you can understand this?"}, {"time": 8701, "text": "In the path that a particle follows even, you can get the classical path, at least for a baseball or something like that, by using quantum physics if you want."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "But in a sense, the baseball sniffs out all possible paths."}, {"time": 8719, "text": "It goes out to the Andromeda galaxy and then goes to the batter."}, {"time": 8723, "text": "But the probability of doing that is very, very small because tiny little paths next door to any given path cancel out that path."}, {"time": 8732, "text": "And the ones that all add together, they're the ones that are more likely to be followed."}, {"time": 8738, "text": "And this actually ties in with Fermat's principle of least action and there are ideas in optics that go into this as well and just sort of beautifully brings everything together."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "But the particle sniffs out all possible paths."}, {"time": 8754, "text": "What a crazy idea."}, {"time": 8755, "text": "But if you do the mathematics associated with that, it ends up being actually useful, a useful way of looking at the world."}, {"time": 8762, "text": "So you're also, I mean, you're widely acknowledged as, I mean, outside of your science work as being one of the greatest educators in the world."}, {"time": 8772, "text": "And Feynman is famous for being that."}, {"time": 8776, "text": "Is there something about being a teacher that you... Well, it's very, very rewarding when you have students who are really into it."}, {"time": 8783, "text": "You know, going back to Feynman, at Caltech, I was taking these graduate courses and there were two of us, myself and Jeff Richmond, who's now a professor of physics at University of California, Santa Barbara, who asked lots of questions."}, {"time": 8798, "text": "And a lot of the Caltech students are nervous about asking questions."}, {"time": 8802, "text": "They want to save face."}, {"time": 8803, "text": "They seem to think that if they ask a question, their peers might think it's a stupid question."}, {"time": 8809, "text": "Well, I didn't really care what people thought and Jeff Richmond didn't either."}, {"time": 8812, "text": "We asked all these questions and in fact, in many cases, they were quite good questions and Feynman said, well, the rest of you should be having questions like this."}, {"time": 8820, "text": "And I remember one time in particular when he said to the rest of the class, why is it always these two?"}, {"time": 8829, "text": "Aren't the rest of you curious about what I'm saying?"}, {"time": 8832, "text": "Do you really understand it all that well?"}, {"time": 8834, "text": "If so, why aren't you asking the next most logical question?"}, {"time": 8837, "text": "No, you guys are too scared to ask these questions that these two are asking."}, {"time": 8843, "text": "So he actually invited us to lunch a couple of times where just the three of us sat and had lunch with one of the greatest thinkers of 20th century physics."}, {"time": 8853, "text": "And so, yeah, he rubbed off on me and, you know, you encourage questions as well, encourage questions, you know, and yeah, you know, definitely, I mean, you know, I encourage questions."}, {"time": 8865, "text": "I like it when students ask questions."}, {"time": 8866, "text": "I tell them that they shouldn't feel shy about asking a question."}, {"time": 8871, "text": "Probably half the students in the class would have that same question if they even understood the material enough to ask that question."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "Curiosity is the first step of seeing the beauty of something."}, {"time": 8884, "text": "So yeah, and the question is the ultimate form of curiosity."}, {"time": 8890, "text": "Let me ask, what is the meaning of life?"}, {"time": 8894, "text": "The meaning of life, you know, from a cosmologist's perspective or from a human perspective, personal, you know, life is what you make of it, really, right?"}, {"time": 8903, "text": "It's each of us has to have our own meaning and it doesn't have to be."}, {"time": 8911, "text": "Well, I think that in many cases, meaning is to some degree associated with goals."}, {"time": 8916, "text": "You set some goals or expectations for yourself, things you want to accomplish, things you want to do, things you want to experience, and to the degree that you experience those and do those things, it can give you meaning."}, {"time": 8930, "text": "You don't have to change the world the way Newton or Michelangelo or da Vinci did."}, {"time": 8936, "text": "I mean, people often say, you changed the world, but look, come on, there's seven and a half, close to eight billion of us now."}, {"time": 8942, "text": "Most of us are not going to change the world and does that mean that most of us are leading meaningful lives?"}, {"time": 8947, "text": "No, it just has to be something that gives you meaning, that gives you satisfaction, that gives you a good feeling about what you did."}, {"time": 8957, "text": "And often, based on human nature, which can be very good and also very bad, but often it's the things that help others that give us meaning and a feeling of satisfaction."}, {"time": 8971, "text": "You taught someone to read, you cared for someone who was terminally ill, you brought up a nice family, you brought up your kids, you did a good job, you put your heart and soul into it, you read a lot of books if that's what you wanted to do, had a lot of perspectives on life, you traveled the world if that's what you wanted to do."}]}]
