[{"title": "Zev Weinstein: The Next Generation of Big Ideas and Brave Minds | Lex Fridman Podcast #158", "id": "QSPtSNqUCUw", "quotes": [{"time": 518, "text": "We've never seen anything like this."}, {"time": 521, "text": "And I think a lot of our promises rest on this sort of thing continuing."}, {"time": 531, "text": "I think that's very dangerous."}, {"time": 533, "text": "But the one thing that can get us out of this is philosophy and being ready to radically restructure all of our notions about what should be, what is."}, {"time": 545, "text": "I think that's very important."}, {"time": 546, "text": "So you think deeply about this world."}, {"time": 548, "text": "You are clearly the embodiment of a thinker, of a philosopher."}, {"time": 552, "text": "Your dad is also one such guy, Eric Weinstein."}, {"time": 556, "text": "Do you have big disagreements with him on this topic in particular?"}, {"time": 561, "text": "I think, now people should know, he also happens to be in the room, but the mics can't pick him up so he can heckle."}, {"time": 569, "text": "It doesn't even matter."}, {"time": 572, "text": "But do you have disagreements with him on this point?"}, {"time": 574, "text": "Let me try to summarize his argument that we are actually based a lot of our American society on the belief that things will keep growing."}, {"time": 585, "text": "And yet it seems that however you break it apart, maybe from an economics perspective, that they're not growing currently."}, {"time": 595, "text": "And so that's where a lot of our troubles are at."}, {"time": 597, "text": "Do you have the same sense that there's a stagnation period that we're living through over the past couple of decades?"}, {"time": 603, "text": "I think stagnation, modern stagnation is completely undeniable, particularly scientifically."}, {"time": 611, "text": "And I think there have been a few fields where tremendous progress has been made very recently."}, {"time": 617, "text": "I think my dad might feel that there is sort of an inevitability to the ending of this period."}, {"time": 629, "text": "And I'm not so certain that the fall of this great time is completely inevitable because I don't know what thoughts we're capable of producing, what we're able to reconsider."}, {"time": 645, "text": "I think we really have to be open to the possibility that all of our standard frameworks where, like he will talk about embedded growth obligations."}, {"time": 657, "text": "If we continue within the same framework, then we're very susceptible to the dangers of whatever these embedded growth obligations are."}, {"time": 665, "text": "I think if we break the frameworks, we have no reason to believe that the problems we're experiencing with our current frameworks will follow us."}, {"time": 673, "text": "And I think that's the importance of radical thought is we don't know what the solution is, but if there is a solution, it will be born from some very fundamental thinking."}, {"time": 682, "text": "And so I have great hope."}, {"time": 684, "text": "So you have optimism about sort of the power of a single radical idea or a single radical thinker to break our frameworks and break us out of this, like, spiral down due to whatever the economic forces that are creating this current stagnation."}, {"time": 705, "text": "Yeah, I'm very, very hopeful."}, {"time": 707, "text": "The optimism of youth."}, {"time": 708, "text": "Well, I share your optimism."}, {"time": 712, "text": "So let me come back to something you've also talked about."}, {"time": 716, "text": "You have very little stuff out there currently, but the things you have out there, your thoughts, you could just tell how deeply you think about this world."}, {"time": 725, "text": "And one of the things you mentioned is as you learn about this world, as you read, as you sort of go through different experiences, that you're open to changing your mind."}, {"time": 740, "text": "How often do you find yourself changing your mind?"}, {"time": 743, "text": "Do you think Zev from 10 years into the future will look back at this conversation we're having now and disagree completely with everything you just said?"}, {"time": 753, "text": "It's entirely possible."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And that's one of the things that scares me so much about appearing publicly."}, {"time": 759, "text": "I think that the internet can be very intolerant of inconsistency."}, {"time": 764, "text": "And I am entirely prepared to be very inconsistent because I know that whatever beliefs I have when subjected to scrutiny may change because that's really the only way to form your truest, most fundamental conceptions about the world around you."}, {"time": 786, "text": "And it would take an infinite amount of time to subject every single one of your beliefs to scrutiny."}, {"time": 792, "text": "And so that's a process that must follow me throughout my entire life."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And I know that means that my opinions and perspectives are always to be changing."}, {"time": 808, "text": "I'm prepared to accept that about myself."}, {"time": 811, "text": "Whether other people are prepared to accept that my public opinions may change and vary greatly over time is something I don't know."}, {"time": 825, "text": "I don't know how tolerant the world will be, but I'm very prepared to change anything I believe in if I think deeply enough about it or a good enough argument is made so that I might reconsider."}, {"time": 839, "text": "Well, there certainly is currently an intolerance and that's one of the problems of our age."}, {"time": 844, "text": "There's an intolerance towards change."}, {"time": 846, "text": "And I'll also ask you about labels."}, {"time": 848, "text": "You talked about sort of we like to bin each other into different categories, the blue or red or whatever the different categorization is."}, {"time": 856, "text": "But it seems like the task before you as a young person defining our future is to make a tolerance of change the norm."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Doing this podcast, for example, and then changing your mind one or two years later and doing so publicly without a big dramatic thing or maybe changing it on a daily basis and just being open about it and being transparent about your thought process."}, {"time": 883, "text": "Maybe that is the beacon of hope for the philosophical way, the path of the philosopher."}, {"time": 892, "text": "So that's your task in a sense is to change your mind openly and bravely."}, {"time": 898, "text": "You know, you're right."}, {"time": 899, "text": "And maybe I will just have to endure some sort of criticism for doing that, but I think that's very important."}, {"time": 905, "text": "I think this ties back to this previous facet of our conversation where we were discussing if thinkers would win over systems that are devoted to preventing radical thought or if who will win the systems or the thinkers."}, {"time": 925, "text": "I think it's crucial that my generation take up a hand in this fight."}, {"time": 934, "text": "And I think it's important that I'm a part of that because I know that I have some opportunity to, there is, I think it is my obligation as a member of a generation whose only real hope is to think outside of a system because whatever systems exist are collapsing."}, {"time": 957, "text": "I think it is really my obligation to try to play some role, whatever role I can and being an instrument in that change."}, {"time": 966, "text": "Are you, as a young mind, do you have a sense of fear about just like how afraid were you to do this podcast conversation?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "Do you have a sense of fear of thinking publicly?"}, {"time": 979, "text": "Yeah, I don't even think that that fear is irrational."}, {"time": 983, "text": "It's very difficult to exist publicly in any form now because it's very easy for anyone to take cheap shots at something which is difficult and as I said, the people who are trying to have the difficult ideas and conversations are perhaps putting others in actual danger because everyone is so desperate that they might be willing to try anything."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "So there's a certain amount of responsibility which one has to take going before the public and there is a certain amount of ridicule which will be completely unwarranted that anyone must endure for it."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And I think that means that one has to be afraid because they could both ruin the world and be ruined by the world in an unwarranted and undeserved fashion."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "I would like to believe in myself enough to try to accept this as a task because I think people need to try or there's no getting out of this and we will end in some kind of crazy, brilliant war."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "Awfully put."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "You've said also that in these times we can't have labels because it holds us back."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "Maybe we've already talked about it a little bit but this idea of labels is really interesting."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "Why do you think labels hold us back?"}, {"time": 1079, "text": "Well, I think many underestimate the extent to which language and communication really impacts and shapes the ideas and thoughts which are being communicated."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "And I think if we're willing to accept imperfect labels to categorize particular people or thoughts, in some sense, we are corrupting an abstraction in order to represent it and communicate about it."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And I think as we've discussed, those abstractions are particularly important when everything is on fire."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "We should not be sacrificing grand thoughts for the ability to express it."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "I think everyone should work much harder, including myself, to really be thinking abstractly in abstract terms instead of using concrete terms to discuss abstraction while ruining it slightly."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "Yeah, it's kind of a skill actually."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "So one really difficult example in the recent time that maybe you can comment on if you have been thinking about it is just politics."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "And there's a lot of labels in politics that it takes a lot of skill to be able to communicate difficult ideas without labels being attached to you."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "That's something that I've been sort of thinking about a lot in trying to express, for example, how much I love various aspects of the foundational ideas of this country, like freedom, and just saying, I love America, a simple statement."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "I love the ideas that we're finding to America."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Are you cognizant of the skill required there of being able to communicate without being branded a Republican or a Democrat in this particular set of conversations?"}, {"time": 1234, "text": "I'm sure there's other dangerous labels that could be attached."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "I don't think there's any way of avoiding that right now."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "It might not be anyone's best effort to really try."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "I think the thing I can say, which will most speak to that, which I truly believe, is that participating in modern conventional politics is not being inherently political in a generative sense."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "It's this repeated trope where politics now is not about creating new political ideologies."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "It's about defending ideologies which already exist so that everyone can keep what they have."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "And that's where all of the name calling and the labeling really comes in."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "It's an attempt to constrict whatever may be generated to standard conversations and discussions so that arguments can be straw manned and defeated and people can keep what they have because everyone's very, very scared."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "I want to be very political, but not in a standard political sense where I'm defending a particular party or place on a spectrum."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "I would like to play some role in inventing new spectrums and I think that's most important politically because above most else, politics is about real power and conventional politicians have real power and that power will find terrible outlets if new spectrums for that power to live are not invented."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "So you're not afraid of politics."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "You're afraid of political discourse at the deepest, richest level of what political discourse is supposed to mean."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "Actually, I'm very afraid of it, but once again, we have no."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "That's not paralyzing for you."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "You feel like it's a responsibility, you're ready to take it on."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "This is a good sign."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "This is, you're a special human."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "Okay, let's talk maybe fun, maybe profound."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "We talked about philosophers, philosophy."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "Who's your favorite philosopher?"}, {"time": 1377, "text": "Like somebody in your current time but neither influential or you just enjoy his, her ideas or writing or anything like that?"}, {"time": 1388, "text": "Weirdly, I'll give an answer which sort of doesn't have much to do with whom I might imagine myself to be."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "I like Thomas Aquinas at the moment."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "I think he's very inspirational to me given what we're going through and that's not because his particular ideas of religion or God or unmoved movers are particularly inspirational to me and I don't even think they were necessarily right."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "But he was introducing aspects of the scientific method during one of the darkest periods in human history when we had lost all hope and reason and ability to think logically."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "So I think he was really something of a light in the dark and I think we need to look to people like that at the moment."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "The other reason why I think I need to learn from him is that even though he was doing something which really needed to be done and introducing scientific thought and reason to a time that lacked it, he was not saying anything that would have been offensive to whatever powers were in play during his time."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "He was writing about the importance of faith in God and how we could prove it."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And so it's important to remember, I suppose, that having ideas that shape the world and which bring the world closer to what we can prove it's supposed to be and how it's supposed to work does not always take some sort of grand contradiction of whatever's in play."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "And the most courageous thing to do may not always be the most helpful thing to do."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "And I think it's very easy for anyone with ideas about how everything is broken to become very cynical and say, oh, the system, man, they're all wrong."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "I think it takes another kind of discipline to be a person with real ideas and to make the world better without stepping on anyone's toes or contradicting anyone."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "I have real respect for that."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "So being able to be, when it's within your principles to operate, within the current system of thought."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "Yeah, and not offend anyone, not say anything outlandish, but introduce the method by which progress must be achieved."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "I think that takes a kind of maturity, which is found very rarely now."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "And I really look to him for inspiration despite whatever disagreements I may have with the minute details of his philosophy."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "Yeah, it takes a lot of skill, a lot of character, and yeah, deep thinking to be able to operate within the system when needed and having the fortitude and just the boldness to step outside and to burn the system down when needed, but rarely, and opportune moments that would actually have impact."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "I mean, it's ultimately about impact within the society that you live in, not just making a statement that has no impact."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Yeah, and we were talking about how dangerous it is to do real philosophy at dangerous broken times."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "He was going through the most broken time in history and he questioned the methods which made a broken system able to survive."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "And he was so skilled and so graceful that he became a saint in that tradition."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "And there's something for me to really learn from there."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "Do you draw any inspiration, have any interest in the sort of more modern philosophers, maybe the existentialists?"}, {"time": 1645, "text": "I mean, Nietzsche is one of the early ones."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Do you have thoughts on the guy in general or any of the other existentialists?"}, {"time": 1654, "text": "Well, with regard to Nietzsche, I think Yates might've said that he's the worst."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "He was certainly filled with passionate intensity."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "I think... Was that a compliment?"}, {"time": 1668, "text": "He was the worst or a criticism or both?"}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Yates had this big line, that the best lack all conviction, the worst are filled with passionate intensity."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "So I think Nietzsche was destroyed by the horrors of everything that went on around him."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "And I think he never really recovered from it."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "I think that's because if you think about Nietzsche's philosophy, he was very opposed to any sort of acceptance of what one had."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "One should always envy those who have more and use that envy to fuel their ideas."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "To fuel their growth and accept whatever the human condition and desires are and use those desires to want more and more and make use of your greed."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "I think it's very difficult to be truly happy if the thing which you pride yourself most on is never being satisfied."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "And I think Nietzsche was never satisfied and that was the danger of his philosophy."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "I think also with his amoralism, there is no good or evil."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "I sort of disagree with that on a pretty fundamental basis."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "I think that our notion of morality is by no means subjective."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "It's really the proxy for the fitness of a society."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "I think whatever we consider ethical, like don't steal, don't murder, don't do this, societies have a very difficult time running."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "It's very hard to run a civilization when everyone is stealing from everyone else and people are murdering each other and committing these things, which we would consider atrocities."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "So I think we also, we know this because I think very similar notions of morality have evolved convergently from different traditions."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "I think good is a proxy for a civilization's fitness and the good news is that that means that evil in being anathema to that good must therefore be the opposite of stable in whatever way that it's evil."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And that means that good will always be more stable than evil and the only way evil can really win is like if everyone dies."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "Everyone dies, so."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "So wait, can you say that again?"}, {"time": 1851, "text": "Good is a proxy for society's what?"}, {"time": 1854, "text": "Good is a proxy for the stability and fitness of a civilization and evil."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "Damn, that's a good definition."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "So you're throwing some bombs today."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "Okay, this is exciting."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "Sorry, sorry to interrupt your flow there, but it's just a damn good line."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "So in that sense, that's a kind of optimistic view that if by definition good is a proxy for stability, then it's going to be stable unless the entire world just blows itself up."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So good wins in the end by definition."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "Or no, well, good wins unless it all goes to complete destruction."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "On a topic of sort of good and evil being human illusions, you've said that more broadly than that about truth, that it is easier in some ways to be unified under truth because it is universal than it is to be unified under belief, which at times can be completely subjective."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "So what is the nature of truth to you?"}, {"time": 1926, "text": "Can we understand the world objectively or is most of what we can understand about the world is just a subjective opinions that we kind of all agree on in these little collectives and over time it kind of evolves completely detached from objective reality."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "I think this is the greatest argument for objectivity is that something that is objectively true cannot be true to me and untrue to you."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "You can feel that it's untrue, but that would be unproductive and create unnecessary tension and conflict."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "I think this is one reason for the importance of science as a tool for stability."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "If science is the search for truth and truth can never really be, I shouldn't say that, truth should never be an engine of conflict because no two people should disagree on something which is objectively true, then in some sense, search for truth is searching for a common ground where we can all exist and live without contradicting or attacking each other."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "Do you have a hope that there is a lot of common ground to be discovered?"}, {"time": 2016, "text": "Sure, I mean, if we continue scientifically, we are discovering truth and in that discovering common ground on which we can all agree."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "That's one reason why I think caring about science, if you have a culture which cares very deeply about science, that's a culture which is not necessarily bound to injure unwarranted internal conflict."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "I think that's one reason that I'm so passionate about science is it's search for universal ground."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "Let me just throw out an example of a modern day philosophical thinker."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "We'll keep your dad, Eric Weinstein out of the picture for a sec, but he does happen to be an example of one, but Jordan Peterson is an example of another, somebody who thinks deeply about this world."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "His ideas are by a certain percent of the population, sort of speaking of truth, are labeled as dangerous."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "Why do you think his ideas or just ideas of these kinds of deep thinkers in general are labeled as dangerous in our modern world?"}, {"time": 2083, "text": "Is it similar to what you've been discussing that in difficult times, philosophers become dangerous?"}, {"time": 2090, "text": "Or is there something specific about these particular thinkers in our time?"}, {"time": 2094, "text": "Well, I think Jordan Peterson is very anti establishment in a lot of his beliefs."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "He's an unconventional thinker."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "And I think we need, regardless of whatever Jordan's particular views and beliefs are, and if they bring about more danger than truth, or if they don't, it's very important to have fundamental thinkers who exist outside of a conventional framework."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "So do I think that he's dangerous?"}, {"time": 2133, "text": "I think by existing outside of a system which is known, he is dangerous."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "And I think we have to, in some sense, in some sense, we have to welcome danger in that capacity because it will be our only way out of this."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "So regardless of whether his beliefs are right or wrong, I'm pretty adamant about the fact that we need to support thought which may rescue us."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "And that thought can appear radical or dangerous at times."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "But ultimately, if you allow for it, this is kind of the difficult discussion of free speech and so on, is ultimately difficult ideas will pave the way for progress."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "Yeah, and I'd actually, I'd like to slow you down there because I think like one of the issues we were discussing previously was the fact that language often destroys our ability to think."}, {"time": 2208, "text": "When we're talking about whether his ideas are radical, I don't know if we mean radical in the traditional sense of having to do with the root of a problem or in the more modern sense of being very extreme."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "And I think that's completely by design, I think fundamental thought, which semantically would once be considered radical thought became very dangerous."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "And now it's become synonymous with extreme or dangerous thought, which means that anyone who considers themselves a radical thinker is semantically also a dangerous or extreme thinker."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "These are not helpful labels in a sense that the moment you say radical or extremist thinker, then you're just, well, how do I put it?"}, {"time": 2266, "text": "You're not helping the public discourse, exchange of ideas."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "But through no fault of our own, the concept of radical as having to do with a root is it's an obvious concept for which there must be language and a lot of the attack on thought has to do with attacking language, which communicates conceptually."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "So like this is an example of how our world is becoming increasingly Orwellian."}, {"time": 2298, "text": "It's just language is being used to destroy our ability to think."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "I think I can't remember exactly what the numbers are, but I read some statistic about how greatly the average English vocabulary has been used and the vocabulary has decreased since 1960."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "It was like some incredible number."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "It really baffled me."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "It's like, how are people less able to think in a time when the world is supposed to be growing at a never before seen rate?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "It's like, we can't keep on, we can't sustain this growth if we destroy everyone's ability to think because the growth requires thinking and we're ruining the tools for it."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "I watched your podcast with Noam Chomsky and I think one interesting thing which he discussed was how language is more used to develop thoughts within our own head than it is used to communicate those thoughts with others."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "If the language doesn't change, even if its usage changes, when language is destroyed in communication, it also stymies our ability to think reasonably and I'm very, very worried."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "But the language in communication requires a medium and there's a lot of different mediums."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "So there's social media, there's Twitter, there's writing books, there's blog posts, there's podcasts, there's YouTube videos, all of things you have dipped a toe in in your exploration of different mediums of communication."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "Which do you see yourself, this might be just a poetic way of asking are you gonna do a podcast, but broader picture, what do you think as an intellectual in this world for you personally would be the path for communicating your ideas to the world?"}, {"time": 2426, "text": "What are the mediums you are currently drawn to out of the ones I mentioned or maybe something I didn't?"}, {"time": 2433, "text": "To answer your question concretely before abstractly, I'm scared but I need to do a podcast."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "It's important, it is my obligation as a member of my generation."}, {"time": 2447, "text": "I really hope that more people my age start to do this because we will be the people in charge of new ideas which either sink or swim."}, {"time":

a layer of indirection."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "Because I think if you're trying to learn one piece that was written 400 years ago and you're playing it over and over again, there is nothing
