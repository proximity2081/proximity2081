can do but send them my love, and in the meantime, try to be a better person and a better interviewer."}, {"time": 389, "text": "Let me also say that I like humor, especially dark humor."}, {"time": 394, "text": "I like being silly and not taking myself seriously."}, {"time": 398, "text": "I will keep taking risks with that, all with the goal of having fun and celebrating humanity at its most absurd and most beautiful."}, {"time": 406, "text": "I will occasionally dress up in strange and weird outfits to celebrate the absurdity of life."}, {"time": 413, "text": "I will hang out, break bread, and joke with all kinds of people."}, {"time": 417, "text": "I don't have to agree with them to laugh with them, in order to escape for a brief moment the tension, the conflict, the hatred in the world."}, {"time": 425, "text": "Humor just might save this little chaotic little civilization of ours."}, {"time": 430, "text": "I love the Ukrainian people."}, {"time": 432, "text": "I love the Russian people."}, {"time": 435, "text": "And of course, I love my fellow Americans, Californians and Midwesterners, New Yorkers and Texans."}, {"time": 442, "text": "I love humans."}, {"time": 444, "text": "And I want to share that love with others."}, {"time": 448, "text": "With you."}, {"time": 449, "text": "If I mess it up, I'm really, really sorry."}, {"time": 452, "text": "I'm trying my best."}, {"time": 453, "text": "I have no agenda and no one telling me what to do."}, {"time": 456, "text": "I feel like the luckiest guy in the world to have all these opportunities, and I'm deeply grateful to be alive and to share that joy with other amazing people around me."}, {"time": 466, "text": "Thank you for your support."}, {"time": 468, "text": "For all the love you've sent my way, I will work my ass off to not disappoint you."}, {"time": 475, "text": "This is the Lex Friedman Podcast."}, {"time": 481, "text": "And now, here's my conversation with David Welby."}, {"time": 486, "text": "Let's start with a big question."}, {"time": 487, "text": "According to Judaism, who is God?"}, {"time": 490, "text": "It's difficult because Judaism, like any tradition that is thousands of years old and encompasses so many different lands and languages and thinkers, it doesn't give a single answer to even simple questions."}, {"time": 505, "text": "And to large questions, it certainly doesn't give a single answer."}, {"time": 508, "text": "Although Judaism was responsible for introducing the monotheistic idea to the world, it doesn't mean that it's one idea."}, {"time": 515, "text": "So if you take Maimonides, the greatest sage in the Jewish tradition, a medieval philosopher, he would say that God is an omnipotent, benevolent, intangible, unimaginable God."}, {"time": 529, "text": "In fact, he said, you can't say what God is, only what God is not, because you have to emphasize, could talk more about that, but basically you have to emphasize the unknowability of God."}, {"time": 540, "text": "You have a modern philosopher like Heschel, who says that God is a God of pathos, a God of deep feeling, which probably would make Maimonides shiver if he heard such a description."}, {"time": 552, "text": "And if you look in the Bible, God is always regretting or having human emotions."}, {"time": 559, "text": "So there are so many different kinds of depictions and ideas, and there is this tremendous tension between transcendence and imminence."}, {"time": 567, "text": "That is, in the Jewish tradition, God is exquisitely close, God is imminent."}, {"time": 573, "text": "In the Talmud's words, God is as close as your mouth is to your ear."}, {"time": 578, "text": "In other words, whatever you say, God hears it."}, {"time": 580, "text": "And yet at the same time, God is unfathomably distant."}, {"time": 585, "text": "Sometimes when I speak to high schoolers, I will say, in the Jewish tradition, think of it this way."}, {"time": 592, "text": "When you were two years old, you had no idea what it was to be a 15 year old."}, {"time": 596, "text": "Not only did you not know, but you didn't know what you didn't know."}, {"time": 602, "text": "We conceive of God as being more, the distance between God and human beings is far greater than the distance between a two year old and a 15 year old."}, {"time": 610, "text": "So when we speak about God, we have to acknowledge how limited we really are."}, {"time": 615, "text": "So okay, you laid out a lot of fascinating things on the table."}, {"time": 618, "text": "So one, the nobility of God, then this idea of deep feeling, which again, can God operate in the space of feelings too, so not just the mouth and the ear of the senses, can God be known?"}, {"time": 635, "text": "Can God be felt by this three year old in the analogy versus the teenager?"}, {"time": 644, "text": "So I will take refuge in a beautiful phrase from Martin Buber, another Jewish theologian."}, {"time": 649, "text": "He said, God cannot be expressed, God can only be addressed."}, {"time": 653, "text": "In other words, you can speak to God, you can feel a sense of God, but can you begin to comprehend or know God?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "Yosef Kaspi, I'm pulling in a couple of early Jewish philosophers, he said, to know God, I would have to be God."}, {"time": 668, "text": "But can we get close?"}, {"time": 672, "text": "Is it useful or is it a distraction to visualize things, to embody, to create, to attach to the stories some kind of visualizations in our mind?"}, {"time": 684, "text": "For example, gender, he versus she, things like this, or old man in the sky kind of feeling."}, {"time": 691, "text": "So it's almost inevitable, but I think ultimately you try to transcend it."}, {"time": 696, "text": "This was the great, we just read this actually in synagogue, the story of the golden calf."}, {"time": 703, "text": "And the story is that human beings found it impossible to not have a visualization because they had just come from Egypt and in the world of pagan worship, everything is..."}, {"time": 718, "text": "It's not that pagans thought that idol was actually God, but it represented visually what God was."}, {"time": 724, "text": "And along comes this idea that God is actually not capable of being visualized, which is very difficult and it stretches the bounds of human comprehension, maybe even breaks them."}, {"time": 738, "text": "So would you say that the proper way to operate as a human in relation to God is humility in that you're screwed, you're not able to basically know anything, almost anything?"}, {"time": 751, "text": "Well, the reason that the salvation of this is that you can't, I was going to say the reason you're not screwed, but then I thought somebody might be upset at a rabbi saying that."}, {"time": 764, "text": "So I didn't say it and have not said it."}, {"time": 767, "text": "But the reason you're not is that you don't have to have a comprehension of God."}, {"time": 775, "text": "You have to have a relationship to God and those are not the same."}, {"time": 779, "text": "I mean, to draw an analogy that is not far from perfect as most analogies are, but this one especially, you have relationships with people who are mysteries to you."}, {"time": 790, "text": "You're a mystery to yourself."}, {"time": 793, "text": "You can live and love somebody for 50 years and they can say something that surprises you because ultimately we are trapped in here."}, {"time": 801, "text": "And when a child first says I, we call that individuation."}, {"time": 805, "text": "But what that really means is I now know that I am cut off from the minds of all other children and all other people."}, {"time": 816, "text": "And so you have with God a more intimate relationship because you can believe that God is, you are known by God and you have a relationship to God despite the fact that you can't know God just as you can't know others."}, {"time": 832, "text": "And some would say to have a good relationship, you want to be constantly surprised."}, {"time": 838, "text": "You don't want to know the thing."}, {"time": 839, "text": "Well, the world, yes, the world that God created is constantly surprising."}, {"time": 842, "text": "And by the way, the caveat to this, you know, when I had all these debates with Christopher Hitchens and he would always say that God is a greater tyrant than North Korea because it continues after your death."}, {"time": 853, "text": "And the idea of being known by God is after all frightening if you think God knows what I think and so on, if your image of God is unloving."}, {"time": 862, "text": "Can we jump to this?"}, {"time": 863, "text": "You had friendships and conversations with a lot of the fascinating figures of the past 20, 30 years of the great intellectuals, one of which perhaps one of the greats is Christopher Hitchens."}, {"time": 877, "text": "What have you learned from your conversation, your friendship?"}, {"time": 882, "text": "So there are a lot of views he held that I really did not agree with, but he was a remarkable person."}, {"time": 888, "text": "That was a good line about North Korea."}, {"time": 889, "text": "He was full of incredibly good lines."}, {"time": 891, "text": "Well, one of the things I learned was you can't win a debate with Christopher Hitchens."}, {"time": 894, "text": "One of the reasons you can't win is because he has this British baritone and this ready wit that you can't triumph over laughter."}, {"time": 906, "text": "It doesn't matter if your argument is better, if your quip is better, you win."}, {"time": 910, "text": "And so I remember once we were arguing about free will and he said, well, I choose to believe in it."}, {"time": 915, "text": "And everybody laughed and that was despite the fact that that's not really an argument."}, {"time": 920, "text": "Or like I have free will because I don't have a choice or whatever."}, {"time": 925, "text": "And people should watch your conversation with him."}, {"time": 927, "text": "I mean, it's a kind of David versus Goliath situation and you're quite masterful at using charisma and sweet talking Christopher Hitchens."}, {"time": 937, "text": "I also genuinely liked him."}, {"time": 939, "text": "I mean, I spent a three hour limousine ride with him from one debate to another, from LA to San Diego."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And the entire time he said, we just can't talk about religion."}, {"time": 953, "text": "So we talked about literature and he gave me a long lecture about scotch."}, {"time": 959, "text": "He was inexhaustible."}, {"time": 962, "text": "I mean, not only did he, I began, I wrote a couple of obituaries about him and one I began with the historian Keith Thomas said, there are two ways of achieving immortality by doing things worth remembering or saying things worth remembering."}, {"time": 976, "text": "And by that standard, he did both."}, {"time": 977, "text": "I mean, he went all around the world to all sorts of danger zones."}, {"time": 981, "text": "He knew like the best bars everywhere from Kuala Lumpur, you know, to Beirut, to LA."}, {"time": 988, "text": "And he could drink all night and write a 2000 word essay on the poetry of Yates and go to sleep."}, {"time": 996, "text": "I remember before one of our debates in Boston, he was at the bar and he said, come have a drink."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "And I said, I'm not going to have a drink before I go to debate with you."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "What are you crazy?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "And he said, just have a beer, it's water."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "So he was, he really was a constant, inexhaustible fountain of intrigue and interest."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "What kind of things, if you can remember, if you can mention, if you can admit, to have him enlightening you or helping you change your mind about something in this world."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So I think, unrelated to Scotch, yeah, unrelated to Scotch."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "He convinced me that the idea, I mean, I had my doubts about it and have my doubts about it, but he convinced me through many debates and not only he, that the idea that religion makes people better is not, it's not ipso facto wrong, but it's a much, much more complicated argument than I wished it to be."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "So he is, however you conceive of the term beauty, he's one of those, one of the more beautiful humans, this weird little earth produced."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So how do you explain the atheism combined with such a beautiful mind?"}, {"time": 1080, "text": "So from your perspective of a man of faith, how do you think about that?"}, {"time": 1087, "text": "So of the atheists that I have debated, I think about all of them somewhat differently."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "So I think that in some deep way, for example, Sam Harris is a religious personality."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "I don't even think that he would, he wouldn't like the word religious, but I don't even think that he would take issue with that."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "I think that he would say his is a purely material based spirituality."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "But I mean, his orientation towards meditation and appreciation of Buddhism, there's something deeply seeking spiritual about him."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "With Hitchens, I honestly, and I know that some of his fans will really not like this."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "It's not that he was any kind of closet believer, certainly not at all, but I almost feel as though he was less a passionate arguer against religion than he was, first of all, extremely upset by the forms that religion took in this world."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "And then once he trained his intellectual howitzers on a target, he had so much fun inventing new arguments and attacking it that I really believe he gets carried away sometimes by his own eloquence and intellectual range."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "So for example, the idea that you would call a book that religion poisons everything, I think he did that deliberately provocatively so that he could defend a proposition that obviously is indefensible, that it poisons everything."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "So I don't know, I think he had tremendous joie de vivre."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "That's really what, that's what sums him up."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "This guy loved life in all of its manifestations and arguing against something that someone else believed was one of his greatest joys."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "Yeah, and of course the practical aspect of that, he just saw the powerful and he challenged them with humor and so on."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "And you know, you could argue perhaps that humor is the highest form of what humanity can achieve."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "Like sometimes maybe us little humans take things a little too seriously, then sometimes we need to just laugh at it all, laugh at ourselves, and that's probably the purest form of wisdom."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "You know, Auden, the poet, said, among the people that I like or admire, I can find no common quality, but among those I love, I can."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "All of them make me laugh."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "There you have it."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Speaking of people that make you laugh, Sam Harris, because he actually has a really great sense of humor."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "With a very cold and monotone delivery."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "He's another one that you had, you're friends with, you have good conversations with."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "What's your fundamental disagreements and agreements with Sam?"}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Sam believes that religion is intellectually indefensible."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "He really believes it, like deep in his soul."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "And he gets angry at the idea that a proposition should be unchallenged if it offends his sense of logic."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So he cannot move on until this is dealt with."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "In fact, I did a podcast with Eric Weinstein, and then Sam did one."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "And Sam said, when I heard your podcast with David Wolpe, I learned stuff about what he thinks that I never learned in my conversations with him because I can never let him make those unfounded assertions without challenging them, and you just let them go."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "And I think that there was something to that was like, he finds it hard to have a conversation about religion that doesn't arouse his real ire about the harm that he thinks religion does in the world."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "So it's more about the implementation of religion in the world as it is versus the really fundamental..."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "I think he also thinks it's fundamentally intellectually shoddy and disreputable."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "Faith."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "Yeah, faith."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "I don't know how to put this."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "I mean, they're both capable of separating their contempt for religion from the people that they have sitting in front of them."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "You mean Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris?"}, {"time": 1341, "text": "So let me... You mentioned Eric Weinstein."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "People should listen to your conversation with Eric."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "It's a fascinating one."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "It's nonstandard."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "It just goes all over the place in this humor and wit."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "There's one interesting aspect that I also learned, perhaps not about you but about Eric, about both."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "But Eric has a similar thing as with Jordan Peterson, which is if you ask them, do they believe in God, I think the answer..."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "They're not comfortable answering that question, or they might say no, but they're usually just not comfortable answering that question."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "But there's a kind of sense that they would like to live life, a religious life, as if God exists."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "I think, first of all, Eric has a really deep appreciation of the Jewish tradition."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "I don't know Peterson."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "I've read his stuff and I've reviewed his stuff and so on."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "But I think that Jungians are in their very approach."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "They believe that myth is the way the world works."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And so it's not that big a leap to God, but there's still a distance there."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "Is it possible to have your cake and eat it too?"}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Is it possible to have the depth of a religious life without believing in God?"}, {"time": 1419, "text": "How do you make sense of Eric Weinstein's devout life within the tradition?"}, {"time": 1426, "text": "I honestly think he believes in God, but doesn't believe in God and it's oscillating like it's a quantum mechanical system of some sort."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "Schrodinger's God."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "So I think that he would probably agree with what Elie Wiesel said, that a Jew can be angry at God or be disbelieving of God, but is not allowed to be indifferent to God."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "And I think Eric's not indifferent to God."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "And it's different than Christianity."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "I've had this conversation many times because you can be very Jewish and have deep doubts about theological questions because Judaism isn't a religion, it's a religious family."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "And so you're born Jewish."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "Like if I said to you tomorrow, if I was Christian and I said, oh, I believe in Jesus today and then tomorrow I didn't, I'm not Christian anymore."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "But if tomorrow I said, oh, I don't believe all this stuff, I'm still Jewish."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "So it's a more complicated system."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "Having said that though, I think it's very hard to sustain over generations without some belief that the source of it is beyond ourselves."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "And in that sense, as in many others, Eric is unique."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "Well, he was actually making that claim that we need faith to propagate this tradition through the generations."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "So without that, the traditions crumble."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "It's a very interesting idea and very interesting argument for devout faith, which is it's a thing, it's a glue that holds a tradition together."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "Otherwise like traditions fall apart because you can't have the intensity of that tradition."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "I mean, on the other hand, you do see tradition, I mean, Thanksgiving, one of my favorite."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "So I would say traditions that are demanding fall apart, traditions that require Turkey might not fall apart, but traditions that make demands of you that are countercultural or are hard, they fall apart."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "I think I need to introduce you to some Thanksgiving dinners that are quite demanding, getting the family together."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "You know, there's a, first of all, I'm a vegetarian, so I'm tough to have at Thanksgiving dinner, but there's a comedian, Cathy Landsman, who one year I heard this on the radio and it stuck with me."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "She said that holidays are a chance to renew your resentments afresh, you know, and that's basically what people do with their families."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "It's like, I'm going to go home and fight with the uncle again this year."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "I apologize to take a dark turn, but you mentioned Elie Wiesel."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "I recently saw a picture of Elie Wiesel when he was in the camp, when he was liberated."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "For some reason that hit hard, like, you know, I've seen pictures in concentration camps of people I don't know or whose words I haven't really felt and gone through, but for some reason like here's just a normal person, like a normal body laying there, that just, that was him."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "It's a, and, and you see, you can see his face, but at the same time you see that this is an amazing, and I think what's so disturbing about it is exactly what you were saying is I've seen a thousand people like this and I know this one and I know what he became."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "So what about all those other people who look exactly like him who didn't make it out of the camp?"}, {"time": 1639, "text": "I don't see his projection, but it seemed like this perhaps is also just combining with man's search for meaning is it seemed like it was a regular day for them in the picture."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "It didn't seem like, I mean, I'm not sure what I expect to see what suffering looks like, but it's almost like there's no celebration."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "I've never seen a picture of actually liberation be celebratory."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "So what do you make sense, and I apologize to take a step into that moment in history."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "How does, how do you make sense of the Holocaust that, of Nazi Germany that such things could be committed by human beings to each other?"}, {"time": 1687, "text": "Is it religion?"}, {"time": 1689, "text": "Is it the thirst for power?"}, {"time": 1693, "text": "Is it the madness of crowds somehow carrying us forward?"}, {"time": 1698, "text": "I mean, for me it's multi causal."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "I don't think there's one reason."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "So one of the things especially there has to do with the special nature of antisemitism, which is let's put that to one side for the moment."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "The second is I think human beings are fundamentally split."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "They are mostly good except when put under certain pressures."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "My first explanation for hatreds is as follows, go to a playground."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "What happens when a new kid comes on the playground?"}, {"time": 1725, "text": "Do the other kids say, oh, let's go share our toys with the new kid?"}, {"time": 1730, "text": "They say, oh, who's that stranger and let's go get them because otherness is built into our genetic, I mean, we're tribal by nature and we see people form tribes all the time of different kinds."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "I asked you before if you were a chess player and when I was a kid and playing in tournaments and I didn't do it for that long and I didn't do it that well, but when I was, it was like the whole world was divided into people who could play chess and people who couldn't play chess, which is ridiculous if you think about it as though that's the way you divide the world."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "But we tend to do that and the Jews were always the identifiable other."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "There were Frenchmen and Jews, there were Russians and Jews, there were Germans and Jews and the great blessing of America is that there's no identifiable other quite that way is that there's all these minorities and no, there's not an American and a something."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "But once you have that identifiable other and you have a long history of blaming that identifiable other for all the ills that befall you."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "Of course, people still do try to form, you said America, they still try to form other, I mean, immigrant versus been here for a generation."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "There's so many ways to slice it."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "We still try to find ways."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "It's just more difficult in America because there's so many sub tribes, hierarchies of tribes and upon tribes."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "And I was moving fast because I didn't want to get bogged down in all the very difficult."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "You're hoping I wouldn't mention that tribalism happens in America."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Skating, you know, when you're on thin ice, your safety is in your speed."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "So I was trying to move fast."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "But for most of history in Eastern Western Europe, not obviously in the, in Asia, but in Eastern Western Europe, Jews were the ones who like, they're not like us."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "They're clearly not like us."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "And so, and in addition, there was, there's a peculiar quality and I don't know, I wonder what you'll think of this explanation."},
