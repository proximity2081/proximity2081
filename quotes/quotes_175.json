philosophical gap at all."}, {"time": 307, "text": "To me, there is a big technical gap."}, {"time": 312, "text": "There's a huge technical gap, but I don't see any reason why it's more than a technical gap."}, {"time": 319, "text": "So, when you mentioned AI, you mentioned SRI, and maybe can you describe to me when you first fell in love with robotics, with robots or inspired, so you mentioned Flaky or Shaky Flaky, and what was the robot that first captured your imagination, what's possible?"}, {"time": 342, "text": "Well, so the first robot I worked with was Flaky."}, {"time": 342, "text": "Shaky was a robot that the SRI people had built, but by the time, I think when I arrived, it was sitting in a corner of somebody's office dripping hydraulic fluid into a pan, but it's iconic and really everybody should read the Shaky Tech Report because it has so many good ideas in it."}, {"time": 360, "text": "I mean, they invented ASTAR search and symbolic planning and learning macro operators."}, {"time": 366, "text": "They had low level kind of configuration space planning for their robot."}, {"time": 374, "text": "They had vision."}, {"time": 374, "text": "That's the basic ideas of a ton of things."}, {"time": 379, "text": "Can you take a step back?"}, {"time": 379, "text": "Shaky have arms."}, {"time": 379, "text": "What was the job?"}, {"time": 379, "text": "Shaky was a mobile robot, but it could push objects, and so it would move things around."}, {"time": 386, "text": "With which actuator?"}, {"time": 386, "text": "With itself, with its base."}, {"time": 392, "text": "And they had painted the baseboards black, so it used vision to localize itself in a map."}, {"time": 403, "text": "It detected objects."}, {"time": 403, "text": "It could detect objects that were surprising to it."}, {"time": 409, "text": "It would plan and replan based on what it saw."}, {"time": 409, "text": "It reasoned about whether to look and take pictures."}, {"time": 415, "text": "I mean, it really had the basics of so many of the things that we think about now."}, {"time": 423, "text": "How did it represent the space around it?"}, {"time": 423, "text": "So it had representations at a bunch of different levels of abstraction."}, {"time": 428, "text": "So it had, I think, a kind of an occupancy grid of some sort at the lowest level."}, {"time": 434, "text": "At the high level, it was abstract symbolic kind of rooms and connectivity."}, {"time": 434, "text": "So where does flaky come in?"}, {"time": 441, "text": "So I showed up at SRI and we were building a brand new robot."}, {"time": 441, "text": "As I said, none of the people from the previous project were kind of there or involved anymore."}, {"time": 448, "text": "So we were kind of starting from scratch and my advisor was Stan Rosenstein."}, {"time": 453, "text": "He ended up being my thesis advisor and he was motivated by this idea of situated computation or situated automata."}, {"time": 460, "text": "And the idea was that the tools of logical reasoning were important, but possibly only for the engineers or designers to use in the analysis of a system, but not necessarily to be manipulated in the head of the system itself."}, {"time": 484, "text": "So I might use logic to prove a theorem about the behavior of my robot, even if the robot's not using logic in its head to prove theorems."}, {"time": 490, "text": "So that was kind of the distinction."}, {"time": 494, "text": "And so the idea was to kind of use those principles to make a robot do stuff."}, {"time": 494, "text": "But a lot of the basic things we had to kind of learn for ourselves because I had zero background in robotics."}, {"time": 509, "text": "I didn't know anything about control."}, {"time": 509, "text": "I didn't know anything about sensors."}, {"time": 509, "text": "So we reinvented a lot of wheels on the way to getting that robot to do stuff."}, {"time": 513, "text": "Do you think that was an advantage or a hindrance?"}, {"time": 517, "text": "Oh no, I mean, I'm big in favor of wheel reinvention actually."}, {"time": 517, "text": "I mean, I think you learn a lot by doing it."}, {"time": 524, "text": "It's important though to eventually have the pointers to, so that you can see what's really going on."}, {"time": 529, "text": "But I think you can appreciate much better the good solutions once you've messed around a little bit on your own and found a bad one."}, {"time": 540, "text": "I think you mentioned reinventing reinforcement learning and referring to rewards as pleasures, pleasure."}, {"time": 544, "text": "Or I think, which I think is a nice name for it."}, {"time": 551, "text": "It's more fun almost."}, {"time": 551, "text": "Do you think you could tell the history of AI machine learning reinforcement learning and how you think about it from the fifties to now?"}, {"time": 563, "text": "One thing is that it's oscillates, right?"}, {"time": 563, "text": "So things become fashionable and then they go out and then something else becomes cool and that goes out and so on."}, {"time": 569, "text": "And I think there's, so there's some interesting sociological process that actually drives a lot of what's going on."}, {"time": 578, "text": "Early days was kind of cybernetics and control, right?"}, {"time": 578, "text": "And the idea that of homeostasis, right?"}, {"time": 586, "text": "People have made these robots that could, I don't know, try to plug into the wall when they needed power and then come loose and roll around and do stuff."}, {"time": 591, "text": "And then I think over time, the thought, well, that was inspiring, but people said, no, no, no, we want to get maybe closer to what feels like real intelligence or human intelligence."}, {"time": 603, "text": "And then maybe the expert systems people tried to do that, but maybe a little too superficially, right?"}, {"time": 610, "text": "So, oh, we get the surface understanding of what intelligence is like, because I understand how a steel mill works and I can try to explain it to you and you can write it down in logic and then we can make a computer and for that."}, {"time": 629, "text": "And then that didn't work out."}, {"time": 629, "text": "But what's interesting, I think, is when a thing starts to not be working very well, it's not only do we change methods, we change problems, right?"}, {"time": 636, "text": "So it's not like we have better ways of doing the problem of the expert systems people were trying to do."}, {"time": 643, "text": "We have no ways of trying to do that problem."}, {"time": 647, "text": "Oh, yeah, no, I think maybe a few, but we kind of give up on that problem and we switched to a different problem and we worked that for a while and we make progress."}, {"time": 660, "text": "As a broad community."}, {"time": 660, "text": "As a community, yeah."}, {"time": 660, "text": "And there's a lot of people who would argue, you don't give up on the problem, it's just you decrease the number of people working on it."}, {"time": 669, "text": "You almost kind of like put it on the shelf, say, we'll come back to this 20 years later."}, {"time": 673, "text": "Or you might decide that it's malformed."}, {"time": 673, "text": "Like you might say, it's wrong to just try to make something that does superficial symbolic reasoning behave like a doctor."}, {"time": 686, "text": "You can't do that until you've had the sensory motor experience of being a doctor or something."}, {"time": 693, "text": "So there's arguments that say that that problem was not well formed."}, {"time": 693, "text": "Or it could be that it is well formed, but we just weren't approaching it well."}, {"time": 698, "text": "So you mentioned that your favorite part of logic and symbolic systems is that they give short names for large sets."}, {"time": 708, "text": "So there is some use to this."}, {"time": 708, "text": "They use symbolic reasoning."}, {"time": 708, "text": "So looking at expert systems and symbolic computing, what do you think are the roadblocks that were hit in the 80s and 90s?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "So the fact that I'm not a fan of expert systems doesn't mean that I'm not a fan of some kinds of symbolic reasoning, right?"}, {"time": 727, "text": "So let's see, roadblocks."}, {"time": 727, "text": "Well, the main road block, I think, was that the idea that humans could articulate their knowledge effectively into some kind of logical statements."}, {"time": 746, "text": "So it's not just the cost, the effort, but really just the capability of doing it."}, {"time": 751, "text": "Because we're all experts in vision, right?"}, {"time": 751, "text": "But totally don't have introspective access into how we do that."}, {"time": 756, "text": "And it's true that, I mean, I think the idea was, well, of course, even people then would know, of course, I wouldn't ask you to please write down the rules that you use for recognizing a water bottle."}, {"time": 768, "text": "And everyone understood that."}, {"time": 772, "text": "But we might ask you to please write down the rules you use for deciding, I don't know, what tie to put on or how to set up a microphone or something like that."}, {"time": 784, "text": "But even those things, I think people maybe, I think what they found, I'm not sure about this, but I think what they found was that the so called experts could give explanations that sort of post hoc explanations for how and why they did things, but they weren't necessarily very good."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And then they depended on maybe some kinds of perceptual things, which again, they couldn't really define very well."}, {"time": 808, "text": "So I think fundamentally, I think the underlying problem with that was the assumption that people could articulate how and why they make their decisions."}, {"time": 820, "text": "So it's almost encoding the knowledge from converting from expert to something that a machine could understand and reason with."}, {"time": 831, "text": "No, no, no, no, not even just encoding, but getting it out of you."}, {"time": 836, "text": "Not, not, not writing it."}, {"time": 836, "text": "I mean, yes, hard also to write it down for the computer, but I don't think that people can produce it."}, {"time": 842, "text": "You can tell me a story about why you do stuff, but I'm not so sure that's the why."}, {"time": 848, "text": "So there are still on the hierarchical planning side, places where symbolic reasoning is very useful."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So as you've talked about, so where's the gap?"}, {"time": 864, "text": "So saying that humans can't provide a description of their reasoning processes."}, {"time": 874, "text": "But that doesn't mean that it's not good to do reasoning of various styles inside a computer."}, {"time": 881, "text": "Those are just two orthogonal points."}, {"time": 881, "text": "So then the question is what kind of reasoning should you do inside a computer?"}, {"time": 892, "text": "And the answer is, I think you need to do all different kinds of reasoning inside a computer, depending on what kinds of problems you face."}, {"time": 896, "text": "I guess the question is what kind of things can you encode symbolically so you can reason about?"}, {"time": 902, "text": "I think the idea about, and even symbolic, I don't even like that terminology because I don't know what it means technically and formally."}, {"time": 917, "text": "I do believe in abstractions."}, {"time": 917, "text": "So abstractions are critical, right?"}, {"time": 917, "text": "You cannot reason at completely fine grain about everything in your life, right?"}, {"time": 924, "text": "You can't make a plan at the level of images and torques for getting a PhD."}, {"time": 929, "text": "So you have to reduce the size of the state space and you have to reduce the horizon if you're going to reason about getting a PhD or even buying the ingredients to make dinner."}, {"time": 942, "text": "And so how can you reduce the spaces and the horizon of the reasoning you have to do?"}, {"time": 949, "text": "And the answer is abstraction, spatial abstraction, temporal abstraction."}, {"time": 949, "text": "I think abstraction along the lines of goals is also interesting, like you might, well, abstraction and decomposition."}, {"time": 953, "text": "Goals is maybe more of a decomposition thing."}, {"time": 960, "text": "So I think that's where these kinds of, if you want to call it symbolic or discrete models come in."}, {"time": 965, "text": "You talk about a room of your house instead of your pose."}, {"time": 972, "text": "You talk about doing something during the afternoon instead of at 2.54."}, {"time": 972, "text": "And you do that because it and you do that because it makes your reasoning problem easier."}, {"time": 980, "text": "And also because you have, you don't have enough information to reason in high fidelity about your pose of your elbow at 2.35 this afternoon anyway."}, {"time": 994, "text": "When you're trying to get a PhD."}, {"time": 999, "text": "Or when you're doing anything really."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "Except for at that moment, at that moment, you do have to reason about the pose of your elbow, maybe, but then you, maybe you do that in some continuous joint space kind of model."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And so again, I, my biggest point about all of this is that there should be the dogma is not the thing, right?"}, {"time": 1018, "text": "We shouldn't, it shouldn't be that I'm in favor against symbolic reasoning and you're in favor against neural networks."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "It should be that just, just computer science tells us what the right answer to all these questions is."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "If we were smart enough to figure it out."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "When you try to actually solve the problem with computers, the right answer comes out."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "But you mentioned abstractions."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "I mean, neural networks form abstractions or rather there's, there's automated ways to form abstractions and there's expert driven ways to form abstractions and expert human driven ways."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "And humans just seem to be way better at forming abstractions currently and certain problems."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "So when you're referring to 2.45 PM versus afternoon, how do we construct that taxonomy?"}, {"time": 1064, "text": "Is there any room for automated construction of such abstractions?"}, {"time": 1070, "text": "Oh, I think eventually, yeah."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "I mean, I think when we get to be better and machine learning engineers, we'll build algorithms that build awesome abstractions."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "That are useful in this kind of way that you're describing."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "So let's then step from the, the abstraction discussion and let's talk about POMM MDPs."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Partially observable Markov decision processes."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "So uncertainty."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "So first, what are Markov decision processes?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "What are Markov decision processes?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And maybe how much of our world can be models and MDPs?"}, {"time": 1100, "text": "How much, when you wake up in the morning and you're making breakfast, how do you, do you think of yourself as an MDP?"}, {"time": 1110, "text": "So how do you think about MDPs and how they relate to our world?"}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Well, so there's a stance question, right?"}, {"time": 1116, "text": "So a stance is a position that I take with respect to a problem."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "So I, as a researcher or a person who designs systems, can decide to make a model of the world around me in some terms."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "So I take this messy world and I say, I'm going to treat it as if it were a problem of this formal kind, and then I can apply solution concepts or algorithms or whatever to solve that formal thing, right?"}, {"time": 1142, "text": "So of course the world is not anything."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "It's not an MDP or a POMM DP."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "I don't know what it is, but I can model aspects of it in some way or some other way."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "And when I model some aspect of it in a certain way, that gives me some set of algorithms I can use."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "You can model the world in all kinds of ways."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "Some have, some are, some are, some are more accepting of uncertainty, more easily modeling uncertainty of the world."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "Some really force the world to be deterministic."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "And so certainly MDPs model the uncertainty of the world."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Model some uncertainty."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "They model not present state uncertainty, but they model uncertainty in the way the future will unfold."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "So what are Markov decision processes?"}, {"time": 1187, "text": "So Markov decision process is a model."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "It's a kind of a model that you could make that says, I know completely the current state of my system."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And what it means to be a state is that I, that all the, I have all the information right now that will let me make predictions about the future as well as I can."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "So that remembering anything about my history wouldn't make my predictions any better."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "And, but then it also says that then I can take some actions that might change the state of the world."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "And that I don't have a deterministic model of those changes."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "I have a probabilistic model of how the world might change."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "It's a, it's a useful model for some kinds of systems."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "I think it's a, I mean, it's certainly not a good model for most problems, I think, because for most problems you don't actually know the state."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "For most problems you, it's partially observed."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "So that's now a different problem class."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "That's where the POMDPs, the part that we observe with the Markov decision processes step in."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "So how do they address the fact that you can't observe most incomplete information about most of the world around you?"}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So now the idea is we still kind of postulate that there exists a state."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "We think that there is some information about the world out there such that if we knew that we could make good predictions, but we don't know the state."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "And so then we have to think about how, but we do get observations."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Maybe I get images or I hear things or I feel things, and those might be local or noisy."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "And so therefore they don't tell me everything about what's going on."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "And then I have to reason about given the history of actions I've taken and observations I've gotten, what do I think is going on in the world?"}, {"time": 1299, "text": "And then given my own kind of uncertainty about what's going on in the world, I can decide what actions to take."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "And so how difficult is this problem of planning under uncertainty in your view and your long experience of modeling the world, trying to deal with this uncertainty in especially in real world systems?"}, {"time": 1317, "text": "Optimal planning for even discrete POMDPs can be undecidable depending on how you set it up."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "And so lots of people say, I don't use POMDPs because they are intractable."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "And I think that that's kind of a very funny thing to say because the problem you have to solve is the problem you have to solve."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "So if the problem you have to solve is intractable, that's what makes us AI people, right?"}, {"time": 1344, "text": "So we solve, we understand that the problem we're solving is wildly intractable that we can't, we will never be able to solve it optimally, at least I don't."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "So later we can come back to an idea about bounded optimality and something."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "But anyway, we can't come up with optimal solutions to these problems."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "So we have to make approximations, approximations in modeling, approximations in the solution algorithms and so on."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And so I don't have a problem with saying, yeah, my problem actually, it is POMDP in continuous space with continuous observations."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "And it's so computationally complex, I can't even think about it's, you know, big O whatever."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "But that doesn't prevent me from, it helps me, gives me some clarity to think about it that way and to then take steps to make approximation after approximation to get down to something that's like computable in some reasonable time."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "When you think about optimality, the community broadly has shifted on that, I think a little bit in how much they value the idea of optimality, of chasing an optimal solution."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "How has your views of chasing an optimal solution changed over the years when you work with robots?"}, {"time": 1420, "text": "I think we have a little bit of a methodological crisis actually from the theoretical side."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "I mean, I do think that theory is important and that right now we're not doing much of it."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "So there's lots of empirical hacking around and training this and doing that and reporting numbers, but is it good?"}, {"time": 1440, "text": "Is it bad?"}, {"time": 1440, "text": "We don't know."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "It's very hard to say things."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "And if you look at like computer science theory, so people talked for a while, everyone was about solving problems optimally or completely."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And then there were interesting relaxations."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "So people look at, oh, are there regret bounds or can I do some kind of approximation?"}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Can I prove something that I can approximately solve this problem or that I get closer to the solution as I spend more time and so on?"}, {"time": 1474, "text": "What's interesting I think is that we don't have good approximate solution concepts for very difficult problems."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "I like to say that I'm interested in doing a very bad job of very big problems."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "So very bad job, very big problems."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "I like to do that, but I wish I could say something."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "I wish I had a, I don't know, some kind of a formal solution concept that I could use to say, oh, this algorithm actually, it gives me something."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "Like I know what I'm going to get."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "I can do something other than just run it and get out."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So that, that notion is still somewhere deeply compelling to you."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "The notion that you can say, you can drop thing on the table says this, you can expect this, this algorithm will give me some good results."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "I hope there's, I hope science will, I mean, there's engineering and there's science."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "I think that they're not exactly the same."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "And I think right now we're making huge engineering, like leaps and bounds."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "So the engineering is running away ahead of the science, which is cool."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And often how it goes, right?"}, {"time": 1547, "text": "So we're making things and nobody knows how and why they work roughly, but we need to turn that into science."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "There's some form."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "It's a, yeah, there's some room for formalizing."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "We need to know what the principles are."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Why does this work?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Why does that not work?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "I mean, for a while, people built bridges by trying, but now we can often predict whether it's going to work or not without building it."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Can we do that for learning systems or for robots?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "So your hope is from a materialistic perspective that intelligence, artificial intelligence systems, robots are just fancier bridges."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Belief space."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "What's the difference between belief space and state space?"}, {"time": 1587, "text": "So you mentioned MDPs, FOMDPs, reasoning about, you sense the world, there's a state."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "Uh, what, what's this belief space idea?"}, {"time": 1599, "text": "That sounds so good."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "It sounds good."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "So belief space, that is instead of thinking about what's the state of the world and trying to control that as a robot, I think about what is the space of beliefs that I could have about the world."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "What's, if I think of a belief as a probability distribution of our ways the world could be, a belief state is a distribution."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "And then my control problem, if I'm reasoning about how to move through a world I'm uncertain about, my control problem is actually the problem of controlling my beliefs."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So I think about taking actions, not just what effect they'll have on the world outside, but what effect they'll have on my own understanding of the world outside."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "And so that might compel me to ask a question or look somewhere to gather information, which may not really change the world state, but it changes my own belief about the world."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "That's a powerful way to, to empower the agent, to reason about the world, to explore the world."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "So what kind of problems does it allow you to solve to, to consider belief space versus just state space?"}, {"time": 1672, "text": "Well, any problem that requires deliberate information gathering, right?"},

breakfast."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "You show this presentation of the WTF, where's the fork of robot looking at a sink."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "And can you describe how we plan in this world of

pretty important."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "And a lot of people won't give you that to start with."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "So almost like a convolution in the, uh, uh, in the object, semantic

representations."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "And so, so I think there are, so you, I've come I've come far field from perception, but I think, um, I think the thing that's going to make perception that kind of the next step is actually understanding better what it should produce."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "So what are we going to do with the output of it?"}, {"time": 2436, "text": "It's fine when

okay."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "So do you think a robot needs to have a self awareness, consciousness, fear of mortality, or is it, is it simpler than that?"}, {"time": 2496, "text": "Or is

of the use of self awareness."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "Well, but I, okay, but then what does self awareness mean?"}, {"time": 2529, "text": "I mean, that you need to have some part of the system that can observe other parts of the system and tell whether they're working well or not."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "That seems critical."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "So does that count as, I mean, does that count as self awareness or not?"}, {"time": 2541, "text": "Well, it depends on whether you think that there's somebody at home who can articulate whether they're self aware."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "But clearly, if I have like, you know, some piece of code that's counting how many times this procedure gets executed, that's a kind of self awareness, right?"}, {"time": 2557, "text": "So

research that's most compelling to you for, you know, trying to achieve human level intelligence in our robots?"}, {"time": 2574, "text": "Well, to me, I guess the thing that seems most compelling to me at the moment is this question of what to build in and what to learn."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "Um, I think we're, we don't, we're missing a bunch of ideas and, and we, you know, people, you know, don't you dare ask me how many years it's going to be until that happens because I won't even participate in the conversation because I think we're missing ideas and I don't know how long it's going to take to find them."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "So I won't ask you how many years, but, uh, maybe I'll ask you what it, when you'll be sufficiently impressed that we've achieved it."}, {"time": 2614,

together and tries to build a better robot cause they want to out compete each other."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "Like the DARPA challenge with the autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "Do you see the value of that or it can get in the way?"}, {"time": 2658, "text": "I think it can get in the way."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "I mean, some people, many people find it motivating."},

cycle where for a contest, a bunch of smart people get super motivated and they hack their brains out and much of what gets done is just hacks, but sometimes really cool ideas emerge."}, {"time":

board of, uh, machine learning resigned and we founded the new journal, but it was sort of, it was more open."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "So it's completely open."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "It's open access."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "Actually, uh, uh, I had a postdoc, George Conidaris who wanted to call these journals free for all, uh, because there were, I mean, it both has no page charges and

papers and maybe eventually if, if we, our opinion was sufficiently valued, like the opinion of JMLR is valued, then you'd say on your CV that Leslie's friends gave my paper a five star rating."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And that would be just as good as saying, I got it, so, you know, accepted into this journal."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "So I think, I think we should have good public commentary and organize it in some way, but I don't really know how to do it."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "It's interesting times."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "The way you describe it actually is really interesting."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "I mean, we do it for movies, imdb.com."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "There's experts, critics come in, they write reviews, but there's also regular non critics, humans write reviews and they're separated."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "I like open review."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "The iClear process I think is interesting."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "It's a step in the right direction, but it's still not as compelling as reviewing movies or video games."}, {"time": 3095, "text": "I mean, it sometimes almost, it might be silly, at least from my perspective to say, but it boils down to the user interface, how fun and easy it is to actually perform the reviews, how efficient, how much you as a reviewer get street cred for being a good reviewer."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "Those elements, those human elements come into play."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "No, it's a big investment to do a good review of a paper and the flood of papers is out of control."},

how many machine learning papers are in a year now."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "And I'm worried, you know, I, right."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "So I'm like an old person."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "So of course, I'm going to say, things are moving too fast."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "I'm a stick in the mud."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "So I can say that, but my particular flavor of that is I think the horizon for researchers has gotten very short, that students want to publish a lot of papers and there's a huge, there's value."}, {"time": 3155, "text": "And there's value in that and you get patted on the head for it and so on."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "But, and some of that is fine, but I'm worried that we're driving out people who would spend two years thinking about something."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "Back in my day, when we worked on our thesis, we did not publish papers."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "You did your thesis for years."}, {"time": 3186, "text": "You picked a hard problem and then you worked and chewed on it and did stuff and wasted time and for a long time."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "And when it was roughly, when it was done, you would write papers."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "And so I don't know how to, and I don't think that everybody has to work in that mode, but I think there's some problems that are hard enough that it's important to have a long research horizon."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "And I'm worried that we don't incentivize that at all at this point."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "In this current structure."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "So what do you see as, what are your hopes and fears about the future of AI and continuing on this theme?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "So AI has gone through a few winters, ups and downs."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "Do you see another winter of AI coming?"}, {"time": 3230, "text": "Are you more hopeful about making robots work, as you said?"}, {"time": 3238, "text": "I think the cycles are inevitable, but I think each time we get higher, right?"}, {"time": 3238, "text": "I mean, so, you know, it's like climbing some kind of landscape with a noisy optimizer."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "So it's clear that the, you know, the deep learning stuff has made deep and important improvements."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "And so the high water mark is now higher."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "There's no question."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "But of course, I think people are overselling and eventually investors, I guess, and other people will look around and say, well, you're not quite delivering on this grand claim and that wild hypothesis."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "It's probably, it's going to crash some amount and then it's okay."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "I mean, but I don't, I can't imagine that there's like some awesome monotonic improvement from here to human level AI."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "So in, you know, I have to ask this question, I probably anticipate answers, the answers, but do you have a worry short term or long term about the existential threats of AI and maybe short term, less existential, but more robots taking away jobs?"}, {"time": 3317, "text": "Well, actually, let me talk a little bit about utility."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "Actually, I had an interesting conversation with some military ethicists who wanted to talk to me about autonomous weapons."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "And they're, they were interesting, smart, well educated guys who didn't know too much about AI or machine learning."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "And the first question they asked me was, has your robot ever done something you didn't expect?"}, {"time": 3341, "text": "And I like burst out laughing because anybody who's ever done something on the robot right knows that they don't do it."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "And what I realized was that their model of how we program a robot was completely wrong."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "Their model of how we can program a robot was like Lego mind storms, like, Oh, go forward a meter, turn left, take a picture, do this, do that."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "And so if you have that model of programming, then it's true."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "It's kind of weird that your robot would do something that you didn't anticipate."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "But the fact is, and actually, so now this is my new educational mission."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "If I have to talk to non experts, I try to teach them the idea that we don't operate, we operate at least one or maybe many levels of abstraction about that."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "And we say, Oh, here's a hypothesis class, maybe it's a space of plans, or maybe it's a space of classifiers or whatever."}, {"time": 3391, "text": "But there's some set of answers and an objective function."}, {"time": 3391, "text": "And then we work on some optimization method that tries to optimize a solution solution in that class."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "And we don't know what solution is going to come out."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "So I think it's important to communicate that."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "So I mean, of course, probably people who listen to this, they, they know that lesson."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "But I think it's really critical to communicate that lesson."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "And then lots of people are now talking about, you know, the value alignment problem."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "So you want to be sure as robots or software systems get more competent, that their objectives are aligned with your objectives, or that our objectives are compatible in some way, or we have a good way of mediating when they have different objectives."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "And so I think it is important to start thinking in terms like, you don't have to be freaked out by the robot apocalypse, to accept that it's important to think about objective functions of value alignment."}, {"time": 3445, "text": "And that you have to really everyone who's done optimization knows that you have to be careful what you wish for that, you know, sometimes you get the optimal solution, and you realize, man, that was that objective was wrong."}, {"time": 3458, "text": "So pragmatically, in the shortest term, it seems to me that that that those are really interesting and critical questions."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "And the idea that we're going to go from being people who engineer algorithms to being people who engineer objective functions."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "I think that's, that's definitely going to happen."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "And that's going to change our thinking and methodology."}]}]
