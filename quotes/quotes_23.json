identified that they do certain things to cells."}, {"time": 452, "text": "And from there, the process started."}, {"time": 454, "text": "And, you know, like historically saying, yeah, this is fascinating that they managed to make the connection and look under the microscope and do all this discovery."}, {"time": 462, "text": "But as you continue reading about it and you read about how chemotherapy drugs which were developed in Boston, and some of them were developed."}, {"time": 472, "text": "And Farber, Dr. Farber from Dana Farber, you know, how the experiments were done that, you know, there was some miscalculation, let's put it this way."}, {"time": 484, "text": "And they tried it on the patients and they just, and those were children with leukemia and they died."}, {"time": 489, "text": "And then they tried another modification."}, {"time": 491, "text": "You look at the process, how imperfect is this process?"}, {"time": 495, "text": "And, you know, like, if we're again looking back like 60 years ago, 70 years ago, you can kind of understand it."}, {"time": 500, "text": "But some of the stories in this book which were really shocking to me were really happening, you know, maybe decades ago."}, {"time": 507, "text": "And we still don't have a vehicle to do it much more fast and effective and, you know, scientific the way I'm thinking computer science scientific."}, {"time": 518, "text": "So from the perspective of computer science, you've gotten a chance to work the application to cancer and to medicine in general."}, {"time": 524, "text": "From a perspective of an engineer and a computer scientist, how far along are we from understanding the human body, biology of being able to manipulate it in a way we can cure some of the maladies, some of the diseases?"}, {"time": 539, "text": "So this is very interesting question."}, {"time": 543, "text": "And if you're thinking as a computer scientist about this problem, I think one of the reasons that we succeeded in the areas we as a computer scientist succeeded is because we don't have, we are not trying to understand in some ways."}, {"time": 558, "text": "Like if you're thinking about like eCommerce, Amazon, Amazon doesn't really understand you."}, {"time": 564, "text": "And that's why it recommends you certain books or certain products, correct?"}, {"time": 570, "text": "And, you know, traditionally when people were thinking about marketing, you know, they divided the population to different kind of subgroups, identify the features of this subgroup and come up with a strategy which is specific to that subgroup."}, {"time": 585, "text": "If you're looking about recommendation system, they're not claiming that they're understanding somebody, they're just managing to, from the patterns of your behavior to recommend you a product."}, {"time": 597, "text": "Now, if you look at the traditional biology, and obviously I wouldn't say that I at any way, you know, educated in this field, but you know what I see, there's really a lot of emphasis on mechanistic understanding."}, {"time": 610, "text": "And it was very surprising to me coming from computer science, how much emphasis is on this understanding."}, {"time": 617, "text": "And given the complexity of the system, maybe the deterministic full understanding of this process is, you know, beyond our capacity."}, {"time": 627, "text": "And the same ways in computer science when we're doing recognition, when you do recommendation and many other areas, it's just probabilistic matching process."}, {"time": 635, "text": "And in some way, maybe in certain cases, we shouldn't even attempt to understand or we can attempt to understand, but in parallel, we can actually do this kind of matchings that would help us to find key role to do early diagnostics and so on."}, {"time": 654, "text": "And I know that in these communities, it's really important to understand, but I'm sometimes wondering, you know, what exactly does it mean to understand here?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "Well, there's stuff that works and, but that can be, like you said, separate from this deep human desire to uncover the mysteries of the universe, of science, of the way the body works, the way the mind works."}, {"time": 677, "text": "It's the dream of symbolic AI, of being able to reduce human knowledge into logic and be able to play with that logic in a way that's very explainable and understandable for us humans."}, {"time": 690, "text": "I mean, that's a beautiful dream."}, {"time": 691, "text": "So I understand it, but it seems that what seems to work today and we'll talk about it more is as much as possible, reduce stuff into data, reduce whatever problem you're interested in to data and try to apply statistical methods, apply machine learning to that."}, {"time": 709, "text": "On a personal note, you were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014."}, {"time": 715, "text": "What did facing your mortality make you think about?"}, {"time": 718, "text": "How did it change you?"}, {"time": 720, "text": "You know, this is a great question and I think that I was interviewed many times and nobody actually asked me this question."}, {"time": 725, "text": "I think I was 43 at a time."}, {"time": 729, "text": "And the first time I realized in my life that I may die and I never thought about it before."}, {"time": 734, "text": "And there was a long time since you're diagnosed until you actually know what you have and how severe is your disease."}, {"time": 740, "text": "For me, it was like maybe two and a half months."}, {"time": 743, "text": "And I didn't know where I am during this time because I was getting different tests and one would say it's bad and I would say, no, it is not."}, {"time": 753, "text": "So until I knew where I am, I really was thinking about all these different possible outcomes."}, {"time": 758, "text": "Were you imagining the worst or were you trying to be optimistic or?"}, {"time": 761, "text": "It would be really, I don't remember what was my thinking."}, {"time": 767, "text": "It was really a mixture with many components at the time speaking in our terms."}, {"time": 774, "text": "And one thing that I remember, and every test comes and then you're saying, oh, it could be this or it may not be this."}, {"time": 783, "text": "And you're hopeful and then you're desperate."}, {"time": 784, "text": "So it's like, there is a whole slew of emotions that goes through you."}, {"time": 789, "text": "But what I remember is that when I came back to MIT, I was kind of going the whole time through the treatment to MIT, but my brain was not really there."}, {"time": 799, "text": "But when I came back, really finished my treatment and I was here teaching and everything, I look back at what my group was doing, what other groups was doing."}, {"time": 808, "text": "And I saw these trivialities."}, {"time": 810, "text": "It's like people are building their careers on improving some parts around two or 3% or whatever."}, {"time": 816, "text": "I was, it's like, seriously, I did a work on how to decipher ugaritic, like a language that nobody speak and whatever, like what is significance?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "When all of a sudden, I walked out of MIT, which is when people really do care what happened to your ICLR paper, what is your next publication to ACL, to the world where people, you see a lot of suffering that I'm kind of totally shielded on it on daily basis."}, {"time": 844, "text": "And it's like the first time I've seen like real life and real suffering."}, {"time": 849, "text": "And I was thinking, why are we trying to improve the parser or deal with trivialities when we have capacity to really make a change?"}, {"time": 860, "text": "And it was really challenging to me because on one hand, I have my graduate students really want to do their papers and their work, and they want to continue to do what they were doing, which was great."}, {"time": 871, "text": "And then it was me who really kind of reevaluated what is the importance."}, {"time": 877, "text": "And also at that point, because I had to take some break, I look back into like my years in science and I was thinking, like 10 years ago, this was the biggest thing, I don't know, topic models."}, {"time": 892, "text": "We have like millions of papers on topic models and variation of topics models."}, {"time": 896, "text": "Now it's totally like irrelevant."}, {"time": 898, "text": "And you start looking at this, what do you perceive as important at different point of time and how it fades over time."}, {"time": 908, "text": "And since we have a limited time, all of us have limited time on us, it's really important to prioritize things that really matter to you, maybe matter to you at that particular point."}, {"time": 922, "text": "But it's important to take some time and understand what matters to you, which may not necessarily be the same as what matters to the rest of your scientific community and pursue that vision."}, {"time": 934, "text": "So that moment, did it make you cognizant?"}, {"time": 938, "text": "You mentioned suffering of just the general amount of suffering in the world."}, {"time": 944, "text": "Is that what you're referring to?"}, {"time": 945, "text": "So as opposed to topic models and specific detailed problems in NLP, did you start to think about other people who have been diagnosed with cancer?"}, {"time": 956, "text": "Is that the way you started to see the world perhaps?"}, {"time": 960, "text": "And it actually creates, because like, for instance, there is parts of the treatment where you need to go to the hospital every day and you see the community of people that you see and many of them are much worse than I was at a time."}, {"time": 976, "text": "And you all of a sudden see it all."}, {"time": 980, "text": "And people who are happier someday just because they feel better."}, {"time": 985, "text": "And for people who are in our normal realm, you take it totally for granted that you feel well, that if you decide to go running, you can go running and you're pretty much free to do whatever you want with your body."}, {"time": 997, "text": "Like I saw like a community, my community became those people."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "And I remember one of my friends, Dina Katabi, took me to Prudential to buy me a gift for my birthday."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And it was like the first time in months that I went to kind of to see other people."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "And I was like, wow, first of all, these people, they are happy and they're laughing and they're very different from these other my people."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "And second of thing, I think it's totally crazy."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "They're like laughing and wasting their money on some stupid gifts."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "And they may die."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "They already may have cancer and they don't understand it."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "So you can really see how the mind changes that you can see that, before that you can ask, didn't you know that you're gonna die?"}, {"time": 1044, "text": "Of course I knew, but it was a kind of a theoretical notion."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "It wasn't something which was concrete."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And at that point, when you really see it and see how little means sometimes the system has to have them, you really feel that we need to take a lot of our brilliance that we have here at MIT and translate it into something useful."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "Yeah, and you still couldn't have a lot of definitions, but of course, alleviating, suffering, alleviating, trying to cure cancer is a beautiful mission."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "So I of course know theoretically the notion of cancer, but just reading more and more about it's 1.7 million new cancer cases in the United States every year, 600,000 cancer related deaths every year."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "So this has a huge impact, United States globally."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "When broadly, before we talk about how machine learning, how MIT can help, when do you think we as a civilization will cure cancer?"}, {"time": 1112, "text": "How hard of a problem is it from everything you've learned from it recently?"}, {"time": 1117, "text": "I cannot really assess it."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "What I do believe will happen with the advancement in machine learning is that a lot of types of cancer we will be able to predict way early and more effectively utilize existing treatments."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "I think, I hope at least that with all the advancements in AI and drug discovery, we would be able to much faster find relevant molecules."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "What I'm not sure about is how long it will take the medical establishment and regulatory bodies to kind of catch up and to implement it."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "And I think this is a very big piece of puzzle that is currently not addressed."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "That's the really interesting question."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "So first a small detail that I think the answer is yes, but is cancer one of the diseases that when detected earlier that's a significantly improves the outcomes?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "So like, cause we will talk about there's the cure and then there is detection."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And I think where machine learning can really help is earlier detection."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "So does detection help?"}, {"time": 1188, "text": "Detection is crucial."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "For instance, the vast majority of pancreatic cancer patients are detected at the stage that they are incurable."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "That's why they have such a terrible survival rate."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "It's like just few percent over five years."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "It's pretty much today the sentence."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "But if you can discover this disease early, there are mechanisms to treat it."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And in fact, I know a number of people who were diagnosed and saved just because they had food poisoning."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "They had terrible food poisoning."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "They went to ER, they got scan."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "There were early signs on the scan and that would save their lives."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "But this wasn't really an accidental case."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "So as we become better, we would be able to help to many more people that are likely to develop diseases."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And I just want to say that as I got more into this field, I realized that cancer is of course terrible disease, but there are really the whole slew of terrible diseases out there like neurodegenerative diseases and others."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So we, of course, a lot of us are fixated on cancer because it's so prevalent in our society."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "And you see these people where there are a lot of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and the kind of aging diseases that we still don't have a good solution for."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "And I felt as a computer scientist, we kind of decided that it's other people's job to treat these diseases because it's like traditionally people in biology or in chemistry or MDs are the ones who are thinking about it."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "And after kind of start paying attention, I think that it's really a wrong assumption and we all need to join the battle."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "So how it seems like in cancer specifically that there's a lot of ways that machine learning can help."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "So what's the role of machine learning in the diagnosis of cancer?"}, {"time": 1315, "text": "So for many cancers today, we really don't know what is your likelihood to get cancer."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And for the vast majority of patients, especially on the younger patients, it really comes as a surprise."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "Like for instance, for breast cancer, 80% of the patients are first in their families, it's like me."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "And I never saw that I had any increased risk because nobody had it in my family."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "And for some reason in my head, it was kind of inherited disease."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "But even if I would pay attention, the very simplistic statistical models that are currently used in clinical practice, they really don't give you an answer, so you don't know."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "And the same true for pancreatic cancer, the same true for non smoking lung cancer and many others."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "And that's what we've seen with breast cancer and people are reporting it in other diseases as well."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "That really boils down to data, right?"}, {"time": 1408, "text": "And in the different kinds of sources of data."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "And you mentioned regulatory challenges."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "So what are the challenges in gathering large data sets in this space?"}, {"time": 1420, "text": "Again, another great question."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So it took me after I decided that I want to work on it two years to get access to data."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "Any data, like any significant data set?"}, {"time": 1430, "text": "Any significant amount, like right now in this country, there is no publicly available data set of modern mammograms that you can just go on your computer, sign a document and get it."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "It just doesn't exist."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "I mean, obviously every hospital has its own collection of mammograms."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "There are data that came out of clinical trials."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "What we're talking about here is a computer scientist who just wants to run his or her model and see how it works."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "This data, like ImageNet, doesn't exist."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And there is a set which is called like Florida data set which is a film mammogram from 90s which is totally not representative of the current developments."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "Whatever you're learning on them doesn't scale up."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "This is the only resource that is available."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And today there are many agencies that govern access to data."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Like the hospital holds your data and the hospital decides whether they would give it to the researcher to work with this data or not."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "Individual hospital?"}, {"time": 1495, "text": "I mean, the hospital may, you know, assuming that you're doing research collaboration, you can submit, you know, there is a proper approval process guided by RB and if you go through all the processes, you can eventually get access to the data."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "But if you yourself know our OEI community, there are not that many people who actually ever got access to data because it's very challenging process."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "And sorry, just in a quick comment, MGH or any kind of hospital, are they scanning the data?"}, {"time": 1528, "text": "Are they digitally storing it?"}, {"time": 1529, "text": "Oh, it is already digitally stored."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "You don't need to do any extra processing steps."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "It's already there in the right format is that right now there are a lot of issues that govern access to the data because the hospital is legally responsible for the data."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "And, you know, they have a lot to lose if they give the data to the wrong person, but they may not have a lot to gain if they give it as a hospital, as a legal entity has given it to you."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "And the way, you know, what I would imagine happening in the future is the same thing that happens when you're getting your driving license, you can decide whether you want to donate your organs."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "You can imagine that whenever a person goes to the hospital, they, it should be easy for them to donate their data for research and it can be different kind of, do they only give you a test results or only mammogram or only imaging data or the whole medical record?"}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Because at the end, we all will benefit from all this insights."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "And it's not like you say, I want to keep my data private, but I would really love to get it from other people because other people are thinking the same way."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So if there is a mechanism to do this donation and the patient has an ability to say how they want to use their data for research, it would be really a game changer."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "People, when they think about this problem, there's a, it depends on the population, depends on the demographics, but there's some privacy concerns generally, not just medical data, just any kind of data."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "It's what you said, my data, it should belong kind of to me."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "I'm worried how it's going to be misused."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "How do we alleviate those concerns?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "Because that seems like a problem that needs to be, that problem of trust, of transparency needs to be solved before we build large data sets that help detect cancer, help save those very people in the future."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "So I think there are two things that could be done."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "There is a technical solutions and there are societal solutions."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "So on the technical end, we today have ability to improve disambiguation."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "Like, for instance, for imaging, it's, you know, for imaging, you can do it pretty well."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "What's disambiguation?"}, {"time": 1676, "text": "And disambiguation, sorry, disambiguation, removing the identification, removing the names of the people."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "There are other data, like if it is a raw tax, you cannot really achieve 99.9%, but there are all these techniques that actually some of them are developed at MIT, how you can do learning on the encoded data where you locally encode the image, you train a network which only works on the encoded images and then you send the outcome back to the hospital and you can open it up."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "So those are the technical solutions."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "There are a lot of people who are working in this space where the learning happens in the encoded form."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "We are still early, but this is an interesting research area where I think we'll make more progress."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "There is a lot of work in natural language processing community how to do the identification better."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "But even today, there are already a lot of data which can be deidentified perfectly, like your test data, for instance, correct, where you can just, you know the name of the patient, you just want to extract the part with the numbers."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "The big problem here is again, hospitals don't see much incentive to give this data away on one hand and then there is general concern."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Now, when I'm talking about societal benefits and about the education, the public needs to understand that I think that there are situation and I still remember myself when I really needed an answer, I had to make a choice."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "There was no information to make a choice, you're just guessing."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "And at that moment you feel that your life is at the stake, but you just don't have information to make the choice."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "And many times when I give talks, I get emails from women who say, you know, I'm in this situation, can you please run statistic and see what are the outcomes?"}, {"time": 1797, "text": "We get almost every week a mammogram that comes by mail to my office at MIT, I'm serious."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "That people ask to run because they need to make life changing decisions."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "And of course, I'm not planning to open a clinic here, but we do run and give them the results for their doctors."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "But the point that I'm trying to make, that we all at some point or our loved ones will be in the situation where you need information to make the best choice."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "And if this information is not available, you would feel vulnerable and unprotected."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And then the question is, you know, what do I care more?"}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Because at the end, everything is a trade off, correct?"}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Just out of curiosity, it seems like one possible solution, I'd like to see what you think of it, based on what you just said, based on wanting to know answers for when you're yourself in that situation."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Is it possible for patients to own their data as opposed to hospitals owning their data?"}, {"time": 1861, "text": "Of course, theoretically, I guess patients own their data, but can you walk out there with a USB stick containing everything or upload it to the cloud?"}, {"time": 1870, "text": "Where a company, you know, I remember Microsoft had a service, like I try, I was really excited about and Google Health was there."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "I tried to give, I was excited about it."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "Basically companies helping you upload your data to the cloud so that you can move from hospital to hospital from doctor to doctor."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "Do you see a promise of that kind of possibility?"}, {"time": 1892, "text": "I absolutely think this is, you know, the right way to exchange the data."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "I don't know now who's the biggest player in this field, but I can clearly see that even for totally selfish health reasons, when you are going to a new facility and many of us are sent to some specialized treatment, they don't easily have access to your data."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "And today, you know, we might want to send this mammogram, need to go to the hospital, find some small office which gives them the CD and they ship as a CD."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "So you can imagine we're looking at kind of decades old mechanism of data exchange."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "So I definitely think this is an area where hopefully all the right regulatory and technical forces will align and we will see it actually implemented."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "It's sad because unfortunately, and I need to research why that happened, but I'm pretty sure Google Health and Microsoft Health Vault or whatever it's called both closed down, which means that there was either regulatory pressure or there's not a business case or there's challenges from hospitals, which is very disappointing."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "So when you say you don't know what the biggest players are, the two biggest that I was aware of closed their doors."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "So I'm hoping, I'd love to see why and I'd love to see who else can come up."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "It seems like one of those Elon Musk style problems that are obvious needs to be solved and somebody needs to step up and actually do this large scale data collection."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So I know there is an initiative in Massachusetts, I think, which you led by the governor to try to create this kind of health exchange system where at least to help people who kind of when you show up in emergency room and there is no information about what are your allergies and other things."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "So I don't know how far it will go."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "But another thing that you said and I find it very interesting is actually

that today goes in healthcare, we've seen so many attempts and so very little successes."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "And it's interesting to understand that I've by no means have knowledge to assess it, why we are in the position where we are."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "Yeah, it's interesting because data is really fuel for a lot of successful applications."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And when that data acquires regulatory approval, like the FDA or any kind of approval, it seems that the computer scientists are not quite there yet in being able to play the regulatory game, understanding the fundamentals of it."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "I think that in many cases when even people do have data, we still don't know what exactly do you need to demonstrate to change the standard of care."},

density, which determines the likelihood of a woman to get cancer."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "And this pretty much says, how much white do you see on the mammogram?"}, {"time": 2094, "text": "The

look back at women who were diagnosed and see what is special in their images."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "Can we look back and say that they're likely to develop?"}, {"time": 2114, "text": "So he come up with some patterns."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "And it was the best that his human eye can identify."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "Then it was kind of formalized and coded into four categories."},

you can actually get supplementary screening paid by your insurance because you're in this category."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "Now you can say, how much science do we have behind it?"}, {"time": 2156, "text": "Whatever, biological science or epidemiological evidence."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So it turns out that between 40 and 50% of women have dense breasts."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "So about 40% of patients are coming out of their screening and somebody tells them, you are in high risk."}, {"time": 2175, "text": "Now, what exactly does it mean if you as half of the population in high risk?"}, {"time": 2179, "text": "It's from saying, maybe I'm not, or what do I really need to do with it?"}, {"time": 2183, "text": "Because the system doesn't provide me a lot of the solutions because there are so many people like me, we cannot really provide very expensive solutions for them."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And the reason this whole density became this big deal, it's actually advocated by the patients who felt very unprotected because many women went and did the mammograms which were normal."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "And then it turns out that they already had cancer, quite developed cancer."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "So they didn't have a way to know who is really at risk and what is the likelihood that when the doctor tells you, you're okay, you are not okay."},

law."}, {"time": 2232, "text": "But now this is a standard."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "Now with a deep learning model, we can so much more accurately predict who is gonna develop breast cancer just because you're trained on a logical thing."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "And instead of describing how much white and what kind of white machine can systematically identify the patterns, which was the

what in general in your view are the open problems in this space?"}, {"time": 2480, "text": "Yeah, I just want to mention that beside detection, not the area where I am kind of quite active and I think it's really an increasingly important area in healthcare is drug design."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "Because it's fine if you detect something early, but you still need to get drugs and new drugs

were developed for other areas and you applying them with some adaptation, the area of drug design is really technically interesting and exciting area."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "You need to work a lot with graphs and capture various 3D properties."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "There are lots and lots of opportunities to be technically creative."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "And I think there are a lot of open questions in this area."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "We're already getting a lot of successes even with kind of the first generation of these models, but there is much more new creative

there is a place to innovate in machine learning in this area."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "And some of these techniques are really unique to, let's say, to graph generation and other things."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "So... What, just to interrupt really quick, I'm sorry, graph generation or graphs, drug discovery in general, how do you discover a drug?"}, {"time": 2611, "text": "Is this chemistry?"}, {"time": 2613, "text": "Is this trying to predict different chemical reactions?"}, {"time": 2617, "text": "Or is it some kind of...

there are many different types of drugs, but let's say you're gonna talk about small molecules because I think today the majority of drugs are small molecules."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "So small molecule is a graph."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "The molecule is just where the node in the graph is an atom and then you have the bonds."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "So it's really a graph representation."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "If you look at it in 2D, correct, you can do it 3D, but let's say, let's keep it simple and stick in 2D."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "So pretty much my understanding today, how it is done at scale in the companies, without machine learning, you have high throughput screening."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "So you know that you are interested to get certain biological activity of the compound."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "So you scan a lot of compounds, like maybe hundreds of thousands, some really big number of compounds."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "You identify some compounds which have the right activity and then at this point, the chemists come and they're trying to now to optimize this original heat to different properties that you want it to be maybe soluble, you want it to decrease toxicity, you want it to decrease the side effects."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "Are those, sorry again to interrupt, can that be done in simulation or just by looking at the molecules or do you need to actually run reactions in real labs with lab coats and stuff?"}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So when you do high throughput screening, you really do screening."}, {"time": 2706, "text": "It's in the lab."}, {"time": 2707, "text": "It's really the lab screening."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "You screen the molecules, correct?"}, {"time": 2710, "text": "I don't know what screening is."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "The screening is just check them for certain property."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "Like in the physical space, in the physical world, like actually there's a machine probably that's actually running the reaction."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "Actually running the reactions, yeah."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "So there is a process where you can run and that's why it's called high throughput that it become cheaper and faster to do it on very big number of molecules."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "You run the screening, you identify potential good starts and then when the chemists come in who have done it many times and then they can try to look at it and say, how can you change the molecule to get the desired profile in terms of all other properties?"}, {"time": 2753, "text": "So maybe how do I make it more bioactive and so on?"}, {"time": 2756, "text": "And there the creativity of the chemists really is the one that determines the success of this design because again, they have a lot of domain knowledge of what works, how do you decrease the CCD and so on and that's what they do."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "So all the drugs that are currently in the FDA approved drugs or even drugs that are in clinical trials, they are designed using these domain experts which goes through this combinatorial space of molecules or graphs or whatever and find the right one or adjust it to be the right ones."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "It sounds like the breast density heuristic from 67 to the same echoes."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "It's not necessarily that."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "It's really driven by deep understanding."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "It's not like they just observe it."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "I mean, they do deeply understand chemistry and they do understand how different groups and how does it changes the properties."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "So there is a lot of science that gets into it and a lot of kind of simulation, how do you want it to behave?"}, {"time": 2821, "text": "It's very, very complex."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "So they're quite effective at this design, obviously."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "Now effective, yeah, we have drugs."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "Like depending on how do you measure effective, if you measure it in terms of cost, it's prohibitive."}, {"time": 2833, "text": "If you measure it in terms of times, we have lots of diseases for which we don't have any drugs and we don't even know how to approach and don't need to mention few drugs or neurodegenerative disease drugs that fail."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "So there are lots of trials that fail in later stages, which is really catastrophic from the financial perspective."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "So is it the effective, the most effective mechanism?"}, {"time": 2859, "text": "Absolutely no, but this is the only one that currently works."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "And I was closely interacting with people in pharmaceutical industry."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "I was really fascinated on how sharp and what a deep understanding of the domain do they have."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "It's not observation driven."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "There is really a lot of science behind what they do."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "But if you ask me, can machine learning change it, I firmly believe yes, because even the most experienced chemists cannot hold in their memory and understanding everything that you can learn from millions of molecules and reactions."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "And the space of graphs is a totally new space."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "I mean, it's a really interesting space for machine learning to explore, graph generation."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "Yeah, so there are a lot of things that you can do here."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So we do a lot of work."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "So the first tool that we started with was the tool that can predict properties of the molecules."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So you can just give the molecule and the property."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "It can be by activity property, or it can be some other property."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "And you train the molecules and you can now take a new molecule and predict this property."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "Now, when people started working in this area, it is something very simple."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "They do kind of existing fingerprints, which is kind of handcrafted features of the molecule."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "When you break the graph to substructures and then you run it in a feed forward neural network."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "And what was interesting to see that clearly, this was not the most effective way to proceed."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "And you need to have much more complex models that can induce a representation, which can translate this graph into the embeddings and do these predictions."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "So this is one direction."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "Then another direction, which is kind of related is not only to stop by looking at the embedding itself, but actually modify it to produce better molecules."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "So you can think about it as machine translation that you can start with a molecule and then there is an improved version of molecule."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "And you can again, with encoder translate it into the hidden space and then learn how to modify it to improve the in some ways version of the molecules."}, {"time": 2989, "text": "So that's, it's kind of really exciting."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "We already have seen that the property prediction works pretty well."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And now we are generating molecules and there is actually labs which are manufacturing this molecule."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "So we'll see where it will get us."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Okay, that's really exciting."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "There's a lot of promise."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "Speaking of machine translation and embeddings, I think you have done a lot of really great research in NLP, natural language processing."}, {"time": 3019, "text": "Can you tell me your journey through NLP?"}, {"time": 3021, "text": "What ideas, problems, approaches were you working on?"}, {"time": 3025, "text": "Were you fascinated with, did you explore before this magic of deep learning reemerged and after?"}, {"time": 3034, "text": "So when I started my work in NLP, it was in 97."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "This was very interesting time."}, {"time": 3039, "text": "It was exactly the time that I came to ACL."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "And at the time I could barely understand English, but it was exactly like the transition point because half of the papers were really rule based approaches where people took more kind of heavy linguistic approaches for small domains and try to build up from there."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "And then there were the first generation of papers which were corpus based papers."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "And they were very simple in our terms when you collect some statistics and do prediction based on them."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "And I found it really fascinating that one community can think so very differently about the problem."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "And I remember my first paper that I wrote, it didn't have a single formula."}, {"time": 3084, "text": "It didn't have evaluation."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "It just had examples of outputs."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "And this was a standard of the field at the time."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "In some ways, I mean, people maybe just started emphasizing the empirical evaluation, but for many applications like summarization, you just show some examples of outputs."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "And then increasingly you can see that how the statistical approaches dominated the field and we've seen increased performance across many basic tasks."}, {"time": 3116, "text": "The sad part of the story maybe that if you look again through this journey, we see that the role of linguistics in some ways greatly diminishes."},

functions and it's okay to have machine which performs a function."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "Like when you're thinking about your calculator, correct?"}, {"time": 3173, "text": "Your calculator can do calculation very different from you would do the calculation, but it's very effective in it."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "And this is fine if we can achieve certain tasks with high accuracy, doesn't necessarily mean that it has to understand it the same way as we understand."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "In some ways, it's even naive to request because you have so many other sources of information that are absent when you are training your system."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "So it's okay."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "Is it delivered?"}, {"time": 3200, "text": "And I would tell you one application that is really fascinating."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "In 97, when it came to ACL, there were some papers on machine translation."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "They were like primitive."}, {"time": 3207,

years, we would already see the system working."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "And now, you know, nobody is even surprised to utilize the system on daily basis."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "So this was like a huge, huge progress, saying that people for very long time tried to solve using other mechanisms."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "And they were unable to solve it."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "That's why coming back to your question about biology, that, you know, in linguistics, people try to go this way and try to write the syntactic trees and try to abstract it and to find the right representation."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "And, you know, they couldn't get very far with this understanding while these models using, you know, other sources actually capable to make a lot of progress."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "Now, I'm not naive to think that we are in this paradise space in NLP."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "And sure as you know, that when we slightly change the domain and when we decrease the amount of training, it can do like really bizarre and funny thing."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "But I think it's just a matter of improving generalization capacity, which is just a technical question."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "Wow, so that's the question."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "How much of language understanding can be solved with deep neural networks?"}, {"time": 3299,

well, we can find information well, we can extract information."}, {"time": 3512, "text": "So there are many capacities in which it's doing very well."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "And you can ask me, would you trust the machine to translate for you and use it as a source?"}, {"time": 3519, "text": "I would say absolutely, especially if we're talking about newspaper data or other data which is in

would tell you something, talking about Turing tests and about all this kind of ELISA conversations, I remember visiting Tencent in China and they have this chat board and they claim there is really humongous amount of the local population which for hours talks to the chat board."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "To me it was, I cannot believe it, but apparently it's documented that there are some people who enjoy this conversation."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "And it brought to me another MIT story about ELISA and Weisenbaum."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "I don't know if you're familiar with the story."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "So Weisenbaum was a professor at MIT and when he developed this ELISA, which was just doing string matching, very trivial, like restating of what you said with very few rules, no syntax."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "Apparently there were secretaries at MIT that would sit for hours and converse with this trivial thing and at the time there was no beautiful interfaces so you actually need to go through the pain of communicating."}, {"time": 3593, "text": "And Weisenbaum himself was so horrified by this phenomenon that people can believe enough to the machine that you just need to give them the hint that machine understands you and you can complete the rest that he kind of stopped this research and went into kind of trying to understand what this artificial intelligence can do to our brains."}, {"time": 3612, "text": "So my point is, you know, how much, it's not how good is the technology, it's how ready we are to believe that it delivers the goods that we are trying to get."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "That's a really beautiful way to put it."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "I, by the way, I'm not horrified by that possibility, but inspired by it

in NLP, not just to translate or just to answer questions, but across many, many areas that we can achieve the functionalities that humans can achieve with their ability to learn and do other things."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "I think this is, and this we can actually measure how far we are."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "And that's what makes me excited that we, in my lifetime, at least so far what we've seen, it's like tremendous progress across these different functionalities."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "And I think it will be really exciting to see where we will be."}, {"time": 3875,

there."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "So you can already see that this direct measurement and the feedback is, you know, we're looking at video games and see why, you know, the addiction aspect of it, but

networks, anytime you learn from data, form representation from data in an automated way, it's not very explainable as to, or it's not introspective to us humans in terms of how this neural network

other hand, the explanation alone is not enough, right?"}, {"time": 1197, "text": "So we are used to dealing with people and with organizations and corporations and so on, and they can give you an explanation and you have no guarantee that that explanation relates to reality, right?"}, {"time": 1211, "text": "So the bank can tell me, well, you didn't get the loan because you didn't have enough

1244, "text": "And what would I need to change that?"}, {"time": 1248, "text": "So I think a conversation is a better way to think about it than just an explanation as a single output."}, {"time":

happen."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And so I think that's where we are and now we've got to deal with that."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "So it wasn't so much an explanation, but it was an understanding of what the models are and what they're doing and now we can start exploring, how do you fix that?"}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Yeah, validating the robustness of the system and so on, but take it back to this word trust."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Do you think we're a little too hard on our robots in terms of the standards we apply?"}, {"time": 1405, "text": "So, you know, there's a dance in

the emphasis is on AI but in many cases, AI is part of the technology but isn't really the main thing."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So a lot of what we've seen is more due to communications technology than AI technology."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "Yeah, you wanna make these good decisions but the reason we're able to have any kind of system at all is we've got the communication so that we're

reaching a lot of people around the world, on the side of education, one of the many things in terms of education you've done, you've taught the Intro to Artificial Intelligence course that signed up 160,000 students."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "There's one of the first successful example of a MOOC, Massive Open Online Course."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "What did you learn from that experience?"},

it was exciting and new but it also meant that we had less competition, right?"}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So one of the things you hear about, well, the problem with MOOCs is the completion rates are so low so there must be a failure and I gotta admit, I'm a prime contributor, right?"}, {"time": 1597, "text": "I probably started 50 different courses that I haven't finished but I got exactly what I wanted out of them because I had never intended to finish them."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "I just wanted to dabble in a little bit either to see the topic matter or just to see the pedagogy of how are they doing this class."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "So I guess the main thing I learned is when I came in, I thought the challenge was information, saying if I'm just, take the stuff I want you to know and I'm very clear and explain it well, then my job is done and good things are gonna happen."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And then in doing the course, I learned, well, yeah, you gotta have the information but really the motivation is the most important thing that if students don't stick with it, it doesn't matter how good the content is."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "And I think being one of the first classes, we were helped by sort of exterior motivation."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "So we tried to do a good job of making it enticing and setting up ways for the community to work with each other to make it more motivating but really a lot of it was, hey, this is a new thing and I'm really excited to be part of a new thing."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "And so the students brought their own motivation."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "And so I think this is great because there's lots of people around the world who have never had this before, would never have the opportunity to go to Stanford and take a class or go to MIT or go to one of the other schools but now we can bring that to them and if they bring their own motivation, they can be successful in a way they couldn't before."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "But that's really just the top tier of people that are ready to do that."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "The rest of the people just don't see or don't have the motivation and don't see how if they push through and were able to do it, what advantage that would get them."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "So I think we got a long way to go before we were able to do that."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "And I think some of it is based on technology but more of it's based on the idea of community."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "You gotta actually get people together."}, {"time": 1726, "text":

the brain is developing now and with people that have grown up with the internet, they have quite a short attention span."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "So, and I would say I had the same when I was growing up too, probably for different reasons."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "So I probably wouldn't have learned as much as I have if I wasn't forced to sit in a physical classroom, sort of bored, sometimes falling asleep, but sort of forcing myself through that process."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "So sometimes extremely difficult computer science courses."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "What's the difference in your view between in person education experience, which you, first of all, yourself had and you yourself taught and online education and how do we close that gap if it's even possible?"}, {"time": 1794, "text": "Yeah, so I think there's two issues."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "One is whether it's in person or online."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "So it's sort of the physical location and then the other is kind of the affiliation, right?"}, {"time": 1807, "text": "So you stuck with it in part because you were in the classroom and you saw everybody else was suffering the same way you were, but also because you were enrolled, you had paid tuition, sort of everybody was expecting you to stick with it."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "Society, parents, peers."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "And so those are two separate things."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "I mean, you could certainly imagine I pay a huge amount of tuition and everybody signed up and says, yes, you're doing this, but then I'm in my room and my classmates are in different rooms, right?"}, {"time": 1843, "text": "We could have things set up that way."}, {"time": 1845, "text": "So it's not just the online versus offline."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "I think what's more important is the commitment that you've made."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "And certainly it is important to have that kind of informal, you know, I meet people outside of class, we talk together because we're all in it together."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "I think that's really important, both in keeping your motivation and also that's where some of the most important learning goes on."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "So you wanna have that."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "Maybe, you know, especially now we start getting into higher bandwidths and augmented reality and virtual reality, you might be able to get that without being in the same physical place."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "Do you think it's possible we'll see a course at Stanford, for example, that for students, enrolled students is only online in the near future or literally sort of it's part of the curriculum and there is no... Yeah, so you're starting to see that."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "I know Georgia Tech has a master's that's done that way."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "Oftentimes it's sort of, they're creeping in in terms of a master's program or sort of further education, considering the constraints of students and so on."}, {"time": 1916, "text": "But I mean, literally, is it possible that we, you know, Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, all these places go online only in the next few decades?"}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Yeah, probably not, because, you know, they've got a big commitment to a physical campus."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "Sure, so there's a momentum that's both financial and culturally."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "Right, and then there are certain things that's just hard to do virtually, right?"}, {"time": 1945, "text": "So, you know, we're in a field where, if you have your own computer and your own paper, and so on, you can do the work anywhere."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "But if you're in a biology lab or something, you know, you don't have all the right stuff at home."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "Right, so our field, programming, you've also done a lot of programming yourself."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "In 2001, you wrote a great article about programming called Teach Yourself Programming in 10 Years, sort of response to all the books that say teach yourself programming in 21 days."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "So if you were giving advice to someone getting into programming today, this is a few years since you've written that article, what's the best way to undertake that journey?"}, {"time": 1990, "text": "I think there's lots of different ways, and I think programming means more things now."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "And I guess, you know, when I wrote that article, I was thinking more about becoming a professional software engineer, and I thought that's a, you know, sort of a career long field of study."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "But I think there's lots of things now that people can do where programming is a part of solving what they wanna solve without achieving that professional level status, right?"}, {"time": 2024, "text": "So I'm not gonna be going and writing a million lines of code, but, you know, I'm a biologist or a physicist or something, or even a historian, and I've got some data, and I wanna ask a question of that data."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And I think for that, you don't need 10 years, right?"}, {"time": 2042, "text": "So there are many shortcuts to being able to answer those kinds of questions."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "And, you know, you see today a lot of emphasis on learning to code, teaching kids how to code."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "I think that's great, but I wish they would change the message a little bit, right, so I think code isn't the main thing."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "I don't really care if you know the syntax of JavaScript or if you can connect these blocks together in this visual language."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "But what I do care about is that you can analyze a problem, you can think of a solution, you can carry out, you know, make a model, run that model, test the model, see the results, verify that they're reasonable, ask questions and answer them, right?"}, {"time": 2095, "text": "So it's more modeling and problem solving, and you use coding in order to do that, but it's not just learning coding for its own sake."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "So it's actually almost, in many cases, it's learning to work with data, to extract something useful out of data."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "So when you say problem solving, you really mean taking some kind of, maybe collecting some kind of data set, cleaning it up, and saying something interesting about it, which is useful in all kinds of domains."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "And, you know, and I see myself being stuck sometimes in kind of the old ways, right?"}, {"time": 2130, "text": "So, you know, I'll be working on a project, maybe with a younger employee, and we say, oh, well, here's this new package that could help solve this problem."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "And I'll go and I'll start reading the manuals, and, you know, I'll be two hours into reading the manuals, and then my colleague comes back and says, I'm done."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "You know, I downloaded the package, I installed it, I tried calling some things, the first one didn't work, the second one worked, now I'm done."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "And I say, but I have a hundred questions about how does this work and how does that work?"}, {"time": 2162, "text": "And they say, who cares, right?"}, {"time": 2164, "text": "I don't need to understand the whole thing."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "I answered my question, it's a big, complicated package, I don't understand the rest of it, but I got the right answer."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "And I'm just, it's hard for me to get into that mindset."}, {"time": 2175, "text": "I want to understand the whole thing."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "And, you know, if they wrote a manual, I should probably read it."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "And, but that's not necessarily the right way."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "I think I have to get used to dealing with more, being more comfortable with uncertainty and not knowing everything."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "Yeah, so I struggle with the same, instead of the spectrum between Donald and Don Knuth."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "It's kind of the very, you know, before he can say anything about a problem, he really has to get down to the machine code assembly."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "And that forces exactly what you said of several students in my group that, you know, 20 years old, and they can solve almost any problem within a few hours."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "That would take me probably weeks because I would try to, as you said, read the manual."}, {"time": 2220, "text": "So do you think the nature of mastery, you're mentioning biology, sort of outside disciplines, applying programming, but computer scientists."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "So over time, there's higher and higher levels of abstraction available now."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "So with this week, there's the TensorFlow Summit, right?"}, {"time": 2243, "text": "So if you're not particularly into deep learning, but you're still a computer scientist, you can accomplish an incredible amount with TensorFlow without really knowing any fundamental internals of machine learning."}, {"time": 2257, "text": "Do you think the nature of mastery is changing, even for computer scientists, like what it means to be an expert programmer?"}, {"time": 2265, "text": "Yeah, I think that's true."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "You know, we never really should have focused on programmer, right, because it's still, it's the skill, and what we really want to focus on is the result."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "So we built this ecosystem where the way you can get stuff done is by programming it yourself."}, {"time": 2284, "text": "At least when I started, you know, library functions meant you had square root, and that was about it, right?"}, {"time": 2290, "text": "Everything else you built from scratch."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "And then we built up an ecosystem where a lot of times, well, you can download a lot of stuff that does a big part of what you need."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And so now it's more a question of assembly rather than manufacturing."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "And that's a different way of looking at problems."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "From another perspective in terms of mastery and looking at programmers or people that reason about problems in a computational way."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "So Google, you know, from the hiring perspective, from the perspective of hiring or building a team of programmers, how do you determine if someone's a good programmer?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "Or if somebody, again, so I want to deviate from, I want to move away from the word programmer, but somebody who could solve problems of large scale data and so on."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "What's, how do you build a team like that through the interviewing process?"}, {"time": 2343, "text": "Yeah, and I think as a company grows, you get more expansive in the types of people you're looking for, right?"}, {"time": 2354, "text": "So I think, you know, in the early days, we'd interview people and the question we were trying to ask is how close are they to Jeff Dean?"}, {"time": 2362, "text": "And most people were pretty far away, but we take the ones that were not that far away."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "And so we got kind of a homogeneous group of people who were really great programmers."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "Then as a company grows, you say, well, we don't want everybody to be the same, to have the same skill set."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "And so now we're hiring biologists in our health areas and we're hiring physicists, we're hiring mechanical engineers, we're hiring, you know, social scientists and ethnographers and people with different backgrounds who bring different skills."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "So you have mentioned that you still may partake in code reviews, given that you have a wealth of experience, as you've also mentioned."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "What errors do you often see and tend to highlight in the code of junior developers of people coming up now, given your background from Blisp to a couple of decades of programming?"},

"text": "Who else is gonna wanna call this?"}, {"time": 2441, "text": "And, you know, are you making it easier for them to do that?"}, {"time": 2446, "text": "That's a matter of design, is it documentation, is it sort of an amorphous thing you can't really put into words?"}, {"time": 2455, "text": "It's just how it feels."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "If you put yourself in the shoes of a developer, would you use this kind of thing?"}, {"time": 2459, "text": "I think it is how you feel, right?"}, {"time": 2461, "text": "And so yeah, documentation is good, but it's more a design question, right?"}, {"time": 2466, "text": "If you get the design right, then people will figure it out, whether the documentation is good or not."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "And if the design's wrong, then it'd be harder to use."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "How have you yourself changed as a programmer over the years?"}, {"time": 2482, "text": "In a way, you already started to say sort of, you want to read the manual, you want to understand the core of the syntax to how the language is supposed to be used and so on."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "But what's the evolution been like from the 80s, 90s to today?"}, {"time": 2500, "text": "I guess one thing is you don't have to worry about the small details of efficiency as much as you used to, right?"}, {"time": 2508, "text": "So like I remember I did my list book in the 90s, and one of the things I wanted to do was say, here's how you do an object system."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "And basically, we're going to make it so each object is a hash table, and you look up the methods, and here's how it works."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "And then I said, of course, the real Common Lisp object system is much more complicated."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "It's got all these efficiency type issues, and this is just a toy, and nobody would do this in real life."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "And it turns out Python pretty much did exactly what I said and said objects are just dictionaries."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And yeah, they have a few little tricks as well."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "But mostly, the thing that would have been 100 times too slow in the 80s is now plenty fast for most everything."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "So you had to, as a programmer, let go of perhaps an obsession that I remember coming up with of trying to write efficient code."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "Yeah, to say what really matters is the total time it takes to get the project done."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "And most of that's gonna be the programmer time."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "So if you're a little bit less efficient, but it makes it easier to understand and modify, then that's the right trade off."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "So you've

language."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "The favorite language they never use these days."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "So what part of Lisp do you find most beautiful and powerful?"}, {"time": 2608, "text": "So I think the beautiful part is the simplicity that in half a page, you can define the whole language."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "And other languages don't have that."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "So you feel like you can hold everything in your head."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "And then a lot of people say, well, then that's too simple."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "Here's all these things I wanna do."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "And my Java or Python or whatever has 100 or 200 or 300 different syntax rules and don't I need all those?"}, {"time": 2640, "text": "And Lisp's answer was, no, we're only gonna give you eight or so syntax rules, but we're gonna allow you to define your own."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "And so that was a very powerful idea."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "And I think this idea of saying, I can start with my problem and with my data, and then I can build the language I want for that problem and for that data."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "And then I can make Lisp define that language."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "So you're sort of mixing levels and saying, I'm simultaneously a programmer in a language and a language designer."}, {"time": 2678, "text": "And that allows a better match between your problem and your eventual code."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "And I think Lisp had done that better than other languages."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "Yeah, it's a very elegant implementation of functional programming."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "But why do you think Lisp has not had the mass adoption and success of languages like Python?"}, {"time": 2697, "text": "Is it the parentheses?"}, {"time": 2699, "text": "Is it all the parentheses?"}, {"time": 2702, "text": "Yeah, so I think a couple things."}, {"time": 2705, "text": "So one was, I think it was designed for a single programmer or a small team and a skilled programmer who had the good taste to say, well, I am doing language design and I have to make good choices."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "And if you make good choices, that's great."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "If you make bad choices, you can hurt yourself and it can be hard for other people on the team to understand it."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "So I think there was a limit to the scale of the size of a project in terms of number of people that Lisp was good for."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "And as an industry, we kind of grew beyond that."},

in the nineties, we had pseudocode in the book, but then we said, well, we'll have Lisp online because that's the language of AI at the time."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "And I remember some of the students complaining because they hadn't had Lisp before and they didn't quite understand what was going on."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "And I remember one student complained, I don't understand how this pseudocode corresponds to this Lisp."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "And there was a one to one correspondence between the symbols in the code and the pseudocode."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "And the only thing difference was the parentheses."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "So I said, it must be that for some people, a certain number of left parentheses shuts off their brain."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "Yeah, it's very possible in that sense and Python just goes the other way."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "So that was the point at which I said, okay, can't have only Lisp as a language."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "Cause I don't wanna, you know, you only got 10 or 12 or 15 weeks or whatever it is to teach AI and I don't want to waste two weeks of that teaching Lisp."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "So I say, I gotta have another language."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "Java was the most popular language at the time."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "I started doing that."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "And then I said, it's really hard to have a one to one correspondence between the pseudocode and the Java because Java is so verbose."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "So then I said, I'm gonna do a survey and find the language that's most like my pseudocode."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "And it turned out Python basically was my pseudocode."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "Somehow I had channeled Guido, designed a pseudocode that was the same as Python, although I hadn't heard of Python at that point."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "And from then on, that's what I've been using cause it's been a good match."},

"text": "It was basically problem solving using Python and looking at different problems."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "Does PyTudes feed that class in terms of the exercises?"}, {"time": 2891, "text": "I was wondering what the... Yeah, so the class came first."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "Some of the stuff that's in PyTudes was write ups of what was in the class and then some of it was just continuing to work on new problems."},

learning approach of ranking comments based on whatever, based on how much they contribute to the healthy conversation."}, {"time": 940, "text": "Let's put it that way."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Then the other is almost an interface question of how do you, how does the creator filter?"}, {"time": 948, "text": "So block or how does, how do humans themselves, the users of YouTube manage their own conversation?"}, {"time": 956, "text": "Do you have hope that these two tools will create a better society without limiting freedom of speech too much, without sort of attacking, even like saying that people, what do you mean limiting, sort of curating speech?"}, {"time": 972, "text": "I mean, I think that that overall is our whole project here at YouTube."}, {"time": 977, "text": "Like we fundamentally believe and I personally believe very much that YouTube can be great."}, {"time": 984, "text": "It's been great for my kids."}, {"time": 986, "text": "I think it can be great for society."}, {"time": 989, "text": "But it's absolutely critical that we get this responsibility part right."}, {"time": 994, "text": "And that's why it's our top priority."}, {"time": 997, "text": "Susan Wojcicki, who's the CEO of YouTube, she says something that I personally find very inspiring, which is that we want to do our jobs today in a manner so that people 20 and 30 years from now will look back and say, YouTube, they really figured this out."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "They really found a way to strike the right balance between the openness and the value that the openness has and also making sure that we are meeting our responsibility to users in society."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "So the burden on YouTube actually is quite incredible."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "And the one thing that people don't give enough credit to the seriousness and the magnitude of the problem, I think."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "So I personally hope that you do solve it because a lot is in your hand, a lot is riding on your success or failure."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "So it's besides, of course, running a successful company, you're also curating the content of the internet and the conversation on the internet."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "That's a powerful thing."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "So one thing that people wonder about is how much of it can be solved with pure machine learning."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "So looking at the data, studying the data and creating algorithms that curate the comments, curate the content, and how much of it needs human intervention, meaning people here at YouTube in a room sitting and thinking about what is the nature of truth, what are the ideals that we should be promoting, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "So algorithm versus human input, what's your sense?"}, {"time": 1098, "text": "I mean, my own experience has demonstrated that you need both of those things."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "Algorithms, I mean, you're familiar with machine learning algorithms and the thing they need most is data and the data is generated by humans."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "And so, for instance, when we're building a system to try to figure out which are the videos that are misinformation or borderline policy violations, well, the first thing we need to do is get human beings to make decisions about which of those videos are in which category."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "And then we use that data and basically take that information that's determined and governed by humans and extrapolate it or apply it to the entire set of billions of YouTube videos."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "And we couldn't get to all the videos on YouTube well without the humans, and we couldn't use the humans to get to all the videos of YouTube."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "So there's no world in which you have only one or the other of these things."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "And just as you said, a lot of it comes down to people at YouTube spending a lot of time trying to figure out what are the right policies, what are the outcomes based on those policies, are they the kinds of things we want to see?"}, {"time": 1186, "text": "And then once we kind of get an agreement or build some consensus around what the policies are, well, then we've got to find a way to implement those policies across all of YouTube."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And that's where both the human beings, we call them evaluators or reviewers, come into play to help us with that."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "And then once we get a lot of training data from them, then we apply the machine learning techniques to take it even further."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "Do you have a sense that these human beings have a bias in some kind of direction?"}, {"time": 1220, "text": "I mean, that's an interesting question."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "We do sort of in autonomous vehicles and computer vision in general, a lot of annotation, and we rarely ask what bias do the annotators have."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Even in the sense that they're better at annotating certain things than others."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "For example, people are much better at, for example, at writing, they're much better at or much better at annotating segmentation at segmenting cars in a scene versus segmenting bushes or trees."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "There's specific mechanical reasons for that, but also because it's semantic gray area."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And just for a lot of reasons, people are just terrible at annotating trees."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "Okay, so in the same kind of sense, do you think of, in terms of people reviewing videos or annotating the content of videos, is there some kind of bias that you're aware of or seek out in that human input?"}, {"time": 1284, "text": "Well, we take steps to try to overcome these kinds of biases or biases that we think would be problematic."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "So for instance, like we ask people to have a bias towards scientific consensus."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "That's something that we instruct them to do."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "We ask them to have a bias towards demonstration of expertise or credibility or authoritativeness."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "But there are other biases that we want to make sure to try to remove."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "And there's many techniques for doing this."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "One of them is you send the same thing to be reviewed to many people."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "And so, that's one technique."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "Another is that you make sure that the people that are doing these sorts of tasks, that these sorts of tasks are from different backgrounds and different areas of the United States or of the world."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "But then, even with all of that, it's possible for certain kinds of what we would call unfair biases to creep into machine learning systems, primarily, as you said, because maybe the training data itself comes in in a biased way."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "So, we also have worked very hard on improving the machine learning systems to remove and reduce unfair biases when it goes against or involves some protected class, for instance."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "Thank you for exploring with me some of the more challenging things."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "I'm sure there's a few more that we'll jump back to."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "But let me jump into the fun part, which is maybe the basics of the quote, unquote, YouTube algorithm."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "What does the YouTube algorithm look at to make recommendation for what to watch next?"}, {"time": 1391, "text": "And it's from a machine learning perspective."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Or when you search for a particular term, how does it know what to show you next?"}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Because it seems to, at least for me, do an incredible job of both."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "Well, that's kind of you to say."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "It didn't used to do a very good job, but it's gotten better over the years."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "Even I observed that it's improved quite a bit."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Those are two different situations."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Like when you search for something, YouTube uses the best technology we can get from Google to make sure that the YouTube search system finds what someone's looking for."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "And of course, the very first things that one thinks about is, okay, well, does the word occur in the title, for instance?"}, {"time": 1440, "text": "But there are much more sophisticated things where we're mostly trying to do some syntactic match or maybe a semantic match based on words that we can add to the document itself."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "For instance, maybe is this video watched a lot after this query?"}, {"time": 1461, "text": "That's something that we can observe and then as a result, make sure that that document would be retrieved for that query."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "Now, when you talk about what kind of videos would be recommended to watch next, that's something, again, we've been working on for many years and probably the first real attempt to do that well was to use collaborative filtering."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "Can you describe what collaborative filtering is?"}, {"time": 1498, "text": "It's just basically what we do is we observe which videos get watched close together by the same person."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And what's amazing about that is that it puts all the videos that are in the same language together, for instance, and we didn't even have to think about language."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "It just does it, right?"}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And it puts all the videos that are about sports together and it puts most of the music videos together and it puts all of these sorts of videos together just because that's sort of the way the people using YouTube behave."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "So that already cleans up a lot of the problem."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "It takes care of the lowest hanging fruit, which happens to be a huge one of just managing these millions of videos."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "I remember a few years ago I was talking to someone who was trying to propose that we do a research project concerning people who are bilingual, and this person was making this proposal based on the idea that YouTube could not possibly be good at recommending videos well to people who are bilingual."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "And so she was telling me about this and I said, well, can you give me an example of what problem do you think we have on YouTube with the recommendations?"}, {"time": 1617, "text": "And so she said, well, I'm a researcher in the US and when I'm looking for academic topics, I want to see them in English."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "And so she searched for one, found a video, and then looked at the watch next suggestions and they were all in English."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And so she said, oh, I see."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "YouTube must think that I speak only English."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "And so she said, now I'm actually originally from Turkey and sometimes when I'm cooking, let's say I want to make some baklava, I really like to watch videos that are in Turkish."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "And so she searched for a video about making the baklava and then selected it and it was in Turkish and the watch next recommendations were in Turkish."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "And she just couldn't believe how this was possible and how is it that you know that I speak both these two languages and put all the videos together?"}, {"time": 1664, "text": "And it's just as a sort of an outcome of this related graph that's created through collaborative filtering."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "So for me, one of my huge interests is just human psychology, right?"}, {"time": 1674, "text": "And that's such a powerful platform on which to utilize human psychology to discover what people, individual people want to watch next."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "But it's also be just fascinating to me."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "You know, I've, Google search has ability to look at your own history and I've done that before, just, just what I've searched three years for many, many years."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And it's fascinating picture of who I am actually."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "And I don't think anyone's ever summarized."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "I personally would love that."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "A summary of who I am as a person on the internet to me, because I didn't get a reply of who I am as a person on the internet to me, because I think it reveals, I think it puts a mirror to me or to others."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "You know, that's actually quite revealing and interesting, you know, just the, maybe in the number of, it's a joke, but not really is the number of cat videos I've watched or videos of people falling, you know, stuff that's absurd, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "It's really interesting."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And of course it's really good for the machine learning aspect to, to show, to figure out what to show next."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "But it's interesting."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "Have you just as a tangent played around with the idea of giving a map to people sort of, as opposed to just using this information to show what's next, showing them here are the clusters you've loved over the years kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1765, "text": "Well, we do provide the history of all the videos that you've watched."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "So you can definitely search through that and look through it and search through it to see what it is that you've been watching on YouTube."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "We have actually in various times experimented with this sort of cluster idea, finding ways to demonstrate or show people what topics they've been interested in or what clusters they've watched from."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "It's interesting that you bring this up because in some sense, the way the recommendation system of YouTube sees a user is exactly as the history of all the videos they've watched on YouTube."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "And so you can think of yourself or any user on YouTube as kind of like a DNA strand of all your videos, right?"}, {"time": 1818, "text": "That sort of represents you, you can also think of it as maybe a vector in the space of all the videos on YouTube."}, {"time": 1826, "text": "And so now once you think of it as a vector in the space of all the videos on YouTube, then you can start to say, okay, well, which other vectors are close to me and to my vector?"}, {"time": 1839, "text": "And that's one of the ways that we generate some diverse recommendations is because you're like, okay, well, these people seem to be close with respect to the videos they've watched on YouTube, but here's a topic or a video that one of them has watched and enjoyed, but the other one hasn't, that could be an opportunity to make a good recommendation."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "I got to tell you, I mean, I know I'm going to ask for things that are impossible, but I would love to cluster than human beings."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "I would love to know who has similar trajectories as me, because you probably would want to hang out, right?"}, {"time": 1874, "text": "There's a social aspect there, like actually finding some of the most fascinating people I find on YouTube, but have like no followers and I start following them and they create incredible content and on that topic, I just love to ask, there's some videos that just blow my mind in terms of quality and depth and just in every regard are amazing videos and they have like 57 views, okay?"}, {"time": 1900, "text": "How do you get videos of quality to be seen by many eyes?"}, {"time": 1906, "text": "So the measure of quality, is it just something, yeah, how do you know that something is good?"}, {"time": 1913, "text": "Well, I mean, I think it depends initially on what sort of video we're talking about."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "So in the realm of, let's say you mentioned politics and news, in that realm, you know, quality news or quality journalism relies on having a journalism department, right?"}, {"time": 1936, "text": "Like you have to have actual journalists and fact checkers and people like that and so in that situation and in others, maybe science or in medicine, quality has a lot to do with the authoritativeness and the credibility and the expertise of the people who make the video."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "Now, if you think about the other end of the spectrum, you know, what is the highest quality prank video or what is the highest quality Minecraft video, right?"}, {"time": 1969, "text": "That might be the one that people enjoy watching the most and watch to the end or it might be the one that when we ask people the next day after they watched it, were they satisfied with it?"}, {"time": 1984, "text": "And so we in, especially in the realm of entertainment, have been trying to get at better and better measures of quality or satisfaction or enrichment since I came to YouTube."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "And we started with, well, you know, the first approximation is the one that gets more views."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "But you know, we both know that things can get a lot of views and not really be that high quality, especially if people are clicking on something and then immediately realizing that it's not that great and abandoning it."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "And that's why we moved from views to thinking about the amount of time people spend watching it with the premise that like, you know, in some sense, the time that someone spends watching a video is related to the value that they get from that video."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "It may not be perfectly related, but it has something to say about how much value they get."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "But even that's not good enough, right?"}, {"time": 2045, "text": "Because I myself have spent time clicking through channels on television late at night and ended up watching Under Siege 2 for some reason I don't know."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "And if you were to ask me the next day, are you glad that you watched that show on TV last night?"}, {"time": 2062, "text": "I'd say, yeah, I wish I would have gone to bed or read a book or almost anything else, really."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "And so that's why some people got the idea a few years ago to try to survey users afterwards."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "And so we get feedback data from those surveys and then use that in the machine learning system to try to not just predict what you're going to click on right now, what you might watch for a while, but what when we ask you tomorrow, you'll give four or five stars to."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "So just to summarize, what are the signals from a machine learning perspective that a user can provide?"}, {"time": 2100, "text": "So you mentioned just clicking on the video views, the time watched, maybe the relative time watched, the clicking like and dislike on the video, maybe commenting on the video."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And then the one I wasn't actually quite aware of, even though I might have engaged in it is a survey afterwards, which is a brilliant idea."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "Is there other signals?"}, {"time": 2126, "text": "I mean, that's already a really rich space of signals to learn from."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "Is there something else?"}, {"time": 2131, "text": "Well, you mentioned commenting, also sharing the video."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "If you think it's worthy to be shared with someone else you know."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "Within YouTube or outside of YouTube as well?"}, {"time": 2142, "text": "Let's see, you mentioned like, dislike."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "Like and dislike."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "How important is that?"}, {"time": 2147, "text": "It's very important, right?"}, {"time": 2148, "text": "We want, it's predictive of satisfaction."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "But it's not perfectly predictive."}, {"time": 2156, "text": "Subscribe."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "If you subscribe to the channel of the person who made the video, then that also is a piece of information and it signals satisfaction."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "Although over the years, we've learned that people have a wide range of attitudes about what it means to subscribe."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "We would ask some users who didn't subscribe very much, but they watched a lot from a few channels."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "We'd say, well, why didn't you subscribe?"}, {"time": 2186, "text": "And they would say, well, I can't afford to pay for anything."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "We tried to let them understand like, actually it doesn't cost anything."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "It just helps us know that you are very interested in this creator."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "But then we've asked other people who subscribe to many things and don't really watch any of the videos from those channels."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "And we say, well, why did you subscribe to this if you weren't really interested in any more videos from that channel?"}, {"time": 2216, "text": "And they might tell us, well, I just, you know, I thought the person did a great job and I just want to kind of give them a high five."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "That's where I sit."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "I go to channels where I just, this person is amazing."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "I like this person."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "But then I like this person and I really want to support them."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "That's how I click subscribe."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "Even though I mean never actually want to click on their videos when they're releasing it."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "I just love what they're doing."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "And it's maybe outside of my interest area and so on, which is probably the wrong way to use the subscribe button."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "But I just want to say congrats."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "This is great work."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "Well, so you have to deal with all the space of people that see the subscribe button is totally different."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "And so, you know, we can't just close our eyes and say, sorry, you're using it wrong."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "You know, we're not going to pay attention to what you've done."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "We need to embrace all the ways in which all the different people in the world use the subscribe button or the like and the dislike button."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "So in terms of signals of machine learning, using for the search and for the recommendation, you've mentioned title."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "So like metadata, like text data that people provide description and title and maybe keywords."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "Maybe you can speak to the value of those things in search and also this incredible fascinating area of the content itself."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "So the video content itself, trying to understand what's happening in the video."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So YouTube released a data set that, you know, in the machine learning computer vision world, this is just an exciting space."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "How much is that currently?"}, {"time": 2315, "text": "How much are you playing with that currently?"}, {"time": 2317, "text": "How much is your hope for the future of being able to analyze the content of the video itself?"}, {"time": 2322, "text": "Well, we have been working on that also since I came to YouTube."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "Analyzing the content."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "Analyzing the content of the video, right?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "And what I can tell you is that our ability to do it well is still somewhat crude."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "We can tell if it's a music video, we can tell if it's a sports video, we can probably tell you that people are playing soccer."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "We probably can't tell whether it's Manchester United or my daughter's soccer team."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "So these things are kind of difficult and using them, we can use them in some ways."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "So for instance, we use that kind of information to understand and inform these clusters that I talked about."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "And also maybe to add some words like soccer, for instance, to the video, if it doesn't occur in the title or the description, which is remarkable that often it doesn't."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "One of the things that I ask creators to do is please help us out with the title and the description."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "For instance, we were a few years ago having a live stream of some competition for World of Warcraft on YouTube."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "And it was a very important competition, but if you typed World of Warcraft in search, you wouldn't find it."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "World of Warcraft wasn't in the title?"}, {"time": 2407, "text": "World of Warcraft wasn't in the title."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "It was match 478, you know, A team versus B team and World of Warcraft wasn't in the title."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "I'm just like, come on, give me."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "Being literal on the internet is actually very uncool, which is the problem."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "Oh, is that right?"}, {"time": 2423, "text": "Well, I mean, in some sense, well, some of the greatest videos, I mean, there's a humor to just being indirect, being witty and so on."}, {"time": 2431, "text": "And actually being, you know, machine learning algorithms want you to be, you know, literal, right?"}, {"time": 2438, "text": "You just want to say what's in the thing, be very, very simple."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "And in some sense that gets away from wit and humor."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "So you have to play with both, right?"}, {"time": 2448, "text": "But you're saying that for now, sort of the content of the title, the content of the description, the actual text is one of the best ways for the algorithm to find your video and put them in the right cluster."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "And I would go further and say that if you want people, human beings to select your video in search, then it helps to have, let's say World of Warcraft in the title."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "Because why would a person, you know, if they're looking at a bunch, they type World of Warcraft and they have a bunch of videos, all of whom say World of Warcraft, except the one that you uploaded."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "Well, even the person is going to think, well, maybe this isn't somehow search made a mistake."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "This isn't really about World of Warcraft."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "So it's important not just for the machine learning systems, but also for the people who might be looking for this sort of thing."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "They get a clue that it's what they're looking for by seeing that same thing prominently in the title of the video."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "Let me push back on that."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "So I think from the algorithm perspective, yes, but if they typed in World of Warcraft and saw a video that with the title simply winning and the thumbnail has like a sad orc or something, I don't know, right?"}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Like I think that's much, it gets your curiosity up."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "And then if they could trust that the algorithm was smart enough to figure out somehow that this is indeed a World of Warcraft video, that would have created the most beautiful experience."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "I think in terms of just the wit and the humor and the curiosity that we human beings naturally have."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "But you're saying, I mean, realistically speaking, it's really hard for the algorithm to figure out that the content of that video will be a World of Warcraft video."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "And you have to accept that some people are going to skip it."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "I mean, and so you're right."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "The people who don't skip it and select it are going to be delighted, but other people might say, yeah, this is not what I was looking for."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "And making stuff discoverable, I think is what you're really working on and hoping."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "So from your perspective, put stuff in the title description."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "And remember the collaborative filtering part of the system starts by the same user watching videos together, right?"}, {"time": 2589, "text": "So the way that they're probably going to do that is by searching for them."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "That's a fascinating aspect of it."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "It's like ant colonies."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "That's how they find stuff."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "So I mean, what degree for collaborative filtering in general is one curious ant, one curious user, essential?"}, {"time": 2608, "text": "So just a person who is more willing to click on random videos and sort of explore these cluster spaces."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "In your sense, how many people are just like watching the same thing over and over and over and over?"}, {"time": 2620, "text": "And how many are just like the explorers and just kind of like click on stuff and then help the other ant in the ant's colony discover the cool stuff?"}, {"time": 2629, "text": "Do you have a sense of that at all?"}, {"time": 2631, "text": "I really don't think I have a sense for the relative sizes of those groups."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "But I would say that people come to YouTube with some certain amount of intent."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "And as long as they, to the extent to which they try to satisfy that intent, that certainly helps our systems, right?"}, {"time": 2649, "text": "Because our systems rely on kind of a faithful amount of behavior, right?"}, {"time": 2657, "text": "And there are people who try to trick us, right?"}, {"time": 2659, "text": "There are people and machines that try to associate videos together that really don't belong together, but they're trying to get that association made because it's profitable for them."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "And so we have to always be resilient to that sort of attempt at gaming the systems."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "So speaking to that, there's a lot of people that in a positive way, perhaps, I don't know, I don't like it, but like to want to try to game the system to get more attention."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "Everybody creators in a positive sense want to get attention, right?"}, {"time": 2691, "text": "So how do you work in this space when people create more and more sort of click baity titles and thumbnails?"}, {"time": 2702, "text": "Sort of very to ask him, Derek has made a video where basically describes that it seems what works is to create a high quality video, really good video, where people would want to watch it once they click on it, but have click baity titles and thumbnails to get them to click on it in the first place."}, {"time": 2719, "text": "And he's saying, I'm embracing this fact, I'm just going to keep doing it."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "And I hope you forgive me for doing it and you will enjoy my videos once you click on them."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "So in what sense do you see this kind of click bait style attempt to manipulate, to get people in the door to manipulate the algorithm or play with the algorithm or game the algorithm?"}, {"time": 2743, "text": "I think that you can look at it as an attempt to game the algorithm."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "But even if you were to take the algorithm out of it and just say, okay, well, all these videos happen to be lined up, which the algorithm didn't make any decision about which one to put at the top or the bottom, but they're all lined up there, which one are the people going to choose?"}, {"time": 2764, "text": "And I'll tell you the same thing that I told Derek is, I have a bookshelf and they have two kinds of books on them, science books."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "I have my math books from when I was a student and they all look identical except for the titles on the covers."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "They're all yellow, they're all from Springer and they're every single one of them."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "The cover is totally the same."}, {"time": 2790, "text": "On the other hand, I have other more pop science type books and they all have very interesting covers and they have provocative titles and things like that."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "I wouldn't say that they're click baity because they are indeed good books."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "And I don't think that they cross any line, but that's just a decision you have to make."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "Like the people who write classical recursion theory by Piero di Freddie, he was fine with the yellow title and nothing more."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "Whereas I think other people who wrote a more popular type book understand that they need to have a compelling cover and a compelling title."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "And I don't think there's anything really wrong with that."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "We do take steps to make sure that there is a line that you don't cross."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "And if you go too far, maybe your thumbnail is especially racy or it's all caps with too many exclamation points, we observe that users are sometimes offended by that."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "And so for the users who are offended by that, we will then depress or suppress those videos."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "And which reminds me, there's also another signal where users can say, I don't know if it was recently added, but I really enjoy it."}, {"time": 2878, "text": "Just saying, something like, I don't want to see this video anymore or something like, like this is a, like there's certain videos that just cut me the wrong way."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "Like just, just jump out at me, it's like, I don't want to, I don't want this."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "And it feels really good to clean that up, to be like, I don't, that's not, that's not for me."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "I think that might've been recently added, but that's also a really strong signal."}, {"time": 2904, "text": "We don't want to make a recommendation that people are unhappy with."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "And that makes me, that particular one makes me feel good as a user in general and as a machine learning person."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "Cause I feel like I'm helping the algorithm."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "My interactions on YouTube don't always feel like I'm helping the algorithm."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "Like I'm not reminded of that fact."}, {"time": 2923, "text": "Like for example, Tesla and Autopilot and Elon Musk create a feeling for their customers, for people that own Teslas, that they're helping the algorithm of Tesla vehicles."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "Like they're all, like are really proud they're helping the fleet learn."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "I think YouTube doesn't always remind people that you're helping the algorithm get smarter."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "And for me, I love that idea."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "Like we're all collaboratively, like Wikipedia gives that sense that we're all together creating a beautiful thing."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "YouTube is a, doesn't always remind me of that."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "It's a, this conversation is reminding me of that, but."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "Well that's a good tip."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "We should keep that fact in mind when we design these features."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "I'm not sure I really thought about it that way, but that's a very interesting perspective."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "It's an interesting question of personalization that I feel like when I click like on a video, I'm just improving my experience."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "It would be great."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "It would make me personally, people are different, but make me feel great if I was helping also the YouTube algorithm broadly say something."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "You know what I'm saying?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "Like there's a, that I don't know if that's human nature, but you want the products you love, and I certainly love YouTube, like you want to help it get smarter, smarter, smarter because there's some kind of coupling between our lives together being better."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "If YouTube is better than I will, my life will be better."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "And there's that kind of reasoning."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "I'm not sure what that is and I'm not sure how many people share that feeling."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "That could be just a machine learning feeling."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "But on that point, how much personalization is there in terms of next video recommendations?"}, {"time": 3022, "text": "So is it kind of all really boiling down to clustering?"}, {"time": 3028, "text": "Like if I'm the nearest clusters to me and so on and that kind of thing, or how much is personalized to me, the individual completely?"}, {"time": 3036, "text": "It's very, very personalized."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "So your experience will be quite a bit different from anybody else's who's watching that same video, at least when they're logged in."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And the reason is that we found that users often want two different kinds of things when they're watching a video."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "Sometimes they want to keep watching more on that topic or more in that genre."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "And other times they just are done and they're ready to move on to something else."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "And so the question is, well, what is the something else?"}, {"time": 3073, "text": "And one of the first things one can imagine is, well, maybe something else is the latest video from some channel to which you've subscribed."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "And that's going to be very different for you than it is for me."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And even if it's not something that you subscribe to, it's something that you watch a lot."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "And again, that'll be very different on a person by person basis."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And so even the Watch Next, as well as the homepage, of course, is quite personalized."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "So what, we mentioned some of the signals, but what does success look like?"}, {"time": 3107, "text": "What does success look like in terms of the algorithm creating a great long term experience for a user?"}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Or to put another way, if you look at the videos I've watched this month, how do you know the algorithm succeeded for me?"}, {"time": 3123, "text": "I think, first of all, if you come back and watch more YouTube, then that's one indication that you found some value from it."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "So just the number of hours is a powerful indicator."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "Well, I mean, not the hours themselves, but the fact that you return on another day."}, {"time": 3142, "text": "So that's probably the most simple indicator."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "People don't come back to things that they don't find value in, right?"}, {"time": 3149, "text": "There's a lot of other things that they could do."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "But like I said, ideally, we would like everybody to feel that YouTube enriches their lives and that every video they watched is the best one they've ever watched since they've started watching YouTube."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "And so that's why we survey them and ask them, is this one to five stars?"}, {"time": 3172, "text": "And so our version of success is every time someone takes that survey, they say it's five stars."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "And if we ask them, is this the best video you've ever seen on YouTube?"}, {"time": 3183, "text": "They say, yes, every single time."}, {"time": 3185, "text": "So it's hard to imagine that we would actually achieve that."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "Maybe asymptotically we would get there, but that would be what we think success is."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "I've recently said somewhere, I don't know, maybe tweeted, but that Ray Dalio has this video on the economic machine, I forget what it's called, but it's a 30 minute video."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "And I said it's the greatest video I've ever watched on YouTube."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "It's like I watched the whole thing and my mind was blown as a very crisp, clean description of how the, at least the American economic system works."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "It's a beautiful video."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "And I was just, I wanted to click on something to say this is the best thing."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "This is the best thing ever."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "Please let me, I can't believe I discovered it."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "I mean, the views and the likes reflect its quality, but I was almost upset that I haven't found it earlier and wanted to find other things like it."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "I don't think I've ever felt that this is the best video I've ever watched."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "That was that."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "And to me, the ultimate utopia, the best experiences were every single video."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "Where I don't see any of the videos I regret and every single video I watch is one that actually helps me grow, helps me enjoy life, be happy and so on."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "So that's a heck of a, that's one of the most beautiful and ambitious, I think, machine learning tasks."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "So when you look at a society as opposed to the individual user, do you think of how YouTube is changing society when you have these millions of people watching videos, growing, learning, changing, having debates?"}, {"time": 3285, "text": "Do you have a sense of, yeah, what the big impact on society is?"}, {"time": 3291, "text": "I think it's huge, but do you have a sense of what direction we're taking this world?"}, {"time": 3295, "text": "Well, I mean, I think openness has had an impact on society already."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "There's a lot of... What do you mean by openness?"}, {"time": 3305, "text": "Well, the fact that unlike other mediums, there's not someone sitting at YouTube who decides before you can upload your video, whether it's worth having you upload it or worth anybody seeing it really, right?"}, {"time": 3323, "text": "And so there are some creators who say, like, I wouldn't have this opportunity to reach an audience."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "Tyler Oakley often said that he wouldn't have had this opportunity to reach this audience if it weren't for YouTube."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "And so I think that's one way in which YouTube has changed society."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "I know that there are people that I work with from outside the United States, especially from places where literacy is low, and they think that YouTube can help in those places because you don't need to be able to read and write in order to learn something important for your life, maybe how to do some job or how to fix something."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "And so that's another way in which I think YouTube is possibly changing society."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "So I've worked at YouTube for eight, almost nine years now."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "And it's fun because I meet people and you tell them where you work, you say you work on YouTube and they immediately say, I love YouTube, right?"}, {"time": 3396, "text": "Which is great, makes me feel great."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "But then of course, when I ask them, well, what is it that you love about YouTube?"}, {"time": 3403, "text": "Not one time ever has anybody said that the search works outstanding or that the recommendations are great."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "What they always say when I ask them, what do you love about YouTube is they immediately start talking about some channel or some creator or some topic or some community that they found on YouTube and that they just love."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "And so that has made me realize that YouTube is really about the video and connecting the people with the videos."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "And then everything else kind of gets out of the way."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "So beyond the video, it's an interesting, because you kind of mentioned creator."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "What about the connection with just the individual creators as opposed to just individual video?"}, {"time": 3455, "text": "So like I gave the example of Ray Dalio video that the video itself is incredible, but there's some people who are just creators that I love."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "One of the cool things about people who call themselves YouTubers or whatever is they have a journey."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "They usually, almost all of them, they suck horribly in the beginning and then they kind of grow and then there's that genuineness in their growth."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "So YouTube clearly wants to help creators connect with their audience in this kind of way."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "So how do you think about that process of helping creators grow, helping them connect with their audience, develop not just individual videos, but the entirety of a creator's life on YouTube?"}, {"time": 3498, "text": "Well, I mean, we're trying to help creators find the biggest audience that they can find."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "And the reason why that's, you brought up creator versus video, the reason why creator channel is so important is because if we have a hope of people coming back to YouTube, well, they have to have in their minds some sense of what they're going to find when they come back to YouTube."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "If YouTube were just the next viral video and I have no concept of what the next viral video could be, one time it's a cat playing a piano and the next day it's some children interrupting a reporter and the next day it's some other thing happening, then it's hard for me to, when I'm not watching YouTube, say, gosh, I really would like to see something from someone or about something, right?"}, {"time": 3557, "text": "And so that's why I think this connection between fans and creators is so important for both, because it's a way of sort of fostering a relationship that can play out into the future."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "Let me talk about kind of a dark and interesting question in general, and again, a topic that you or nobody has an answer to."}, {"time": 3582, "text": "But social media has a sense of, it gives us highs and it gives us lows in the sense that sort of creators often speak about having sort of burnout and having psychological ups and downs and challenges mentally in terms of continuing the creation process."}, {"time": 3602, "text": "There's a momentum, there's a huge excited audience that makes creators feel great."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "And I think it's more than just financial."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "I think it's literally just, they love that sense of community."}, {"time": 3616, "text": "It's part of the reason I upload to YouTube."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "I don't care about money, never will."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "What I care about is the community, but some people feel like this momentum, and even when there's times in their life when they don't feel, you know, for some reason don't feel like creating."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "So how do you think about burnout, this mental exhaustion that some YouTube creators go through?"}, {"time": 3638, "text": "Is that something we have an answer for?"}, {"time": 3640, "text": "Is that something, how do we even think about that?"}, {"time": 3642, "text": "Well, the first thing is we want to make sure that the YouTube systems are not contributing to this sense, right?"}, {"time": 3649, "text": "And so we've done a fair amount of research to demonstrate that you can absolutely take a break."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "If you are a creator and you've been uploading a lot, we have just as many examples of people who took a break and came back more popular than they were before as we have examples of going the other way."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "Can we pause on that for a second?"}, {"time": 3671, "text": "So the feeling that people have, I think, is if I take a break, everybody, the party will leave, right?"}, {"time": 3679, "text": "So if you could just linger on that."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "So in your sense that taking a break is okay."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "Yes, taking a break is absolutely okay."}, {"time": 3687, "text": "And the reason I say that is because we have, we can observe many examples of being, of creators coming back very strong and even stronger after they have taken some sort of break."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "And so I just want to dispel the myth that this somehow necessarily means that your channel is going to go down or lose views."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "That is not the case."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "We know for sure that this is not a necessary outcome."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "And so we want to encourage people to make sure that they take care of themselves."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "That is job one, right?"}, {"time": 3726, "text": "You have to look after yourself and your mental health."}, {"time": 3730, "text": "And I think that it probably, in some of these cases, contributes to better videos once they come back, right?"}, {"time": 3740, "text": "Because a lot of people, I mean, I know myself, if I burn out on something, then I'm probably not doing my best work, even though I can keep working until I pass out."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "And so I think that the taking a break may even improve the creative ideas that someone has."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "I think that's a really important thing to sort of dispel."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "I think that applies to all of social media, like literally I've taken a break for a day every once in a while."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "Sorry if that sounds like a short time, but even like, sorry, email, just taking a break from email, or only checking email once a day, especially when you're going through something psychologically in your personal life or so on, or really not sleeping much because of work deadlines, it can refresh you in a way that's profound."}, {"time": 3790, "text": "And so the same applies."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "It was there when you came back, right?"}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And it looks different, actually, when you come back."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "You're sort of brighter eyed with some coffee, everything, the world looks better."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "So it's important to take a break when you need it."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "So you've mentioned kind of the YouTube algorithm that isn't E equals MC squared, it's not the single equation, it's potentially sort of more than a million lines of code."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "Is it more akin to what successful autonomous vehicles today are, which is they're just basically patches on top of patches of heuristics and human experts really tuning the algorithm and have some machine learning modules?"}, {"time": 3838, "text": "Or is it becoming more and more a giant machine learning system with humans just doing a little bit of tweaking here and there?"}, {"time": 3847, "text": "First of all, do you even have a sense of what is the YouTube algorithm at this point?"}, {"time": 3851, "text": "And however much you do have a sense, what does it look like?"}, {"time": 3855, "text": "Well, we don't usually think about it as the algorithm because it's a bunch of systems that work on different services."}, {"time": 3864, "text": "The other thing that I think people don't understand is that what you might refer to as the YouTube algorithm from outside of YouTube is actually a bunch of code and machine learning systems and heuristics, but that's married with the behavior of all the people who come to YouTube every day."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "So the people part of the code, essentially."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "If there were no people who came to YouTube tomorrow, then the algorithm wouldn't work anymore."}, {"time": 3893, "text": "That's the whole part of the algorithm."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "And so when people talk about, well, the algorithm does this, the algorithm does that, it's sometimes hard to understand, well, it could be the viewers are doing that."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "And the algorithm is mostly just keeping track of what the viewers do and then reacting to those things in sort of more fine grain situations."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "And I think that this is the way that the recommendation system and the search system and probably many machine learning systems evolve is you start trying to solve a problem and the first way to solve a problem is often with a simple heuristic."}, {"time": 3934, "text": "And you want to say, what are the videos we're going to recommend?"}, {"time": 3936, "text": "Well, how about the most popular ones?"}, {"time": 3939, "text": "That's where you start."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "And over time, you collect some data and you refine your situation so that you're making less heuristics and you're building a system that can actually learn what to do in different situations based on some observations of those situations in the past."}, {"time": 3960, "text": "And you keep chipping away at these heuristics over time."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "And so I think that just like with diversity, I think the first diversity measure we took was, okay, not more than three videos in a row from the same channel."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "It's a pretty simple heuristic to encourage diversity, but it worked, right?"}, {"time": 3980, "text": "Who needs to see four, five, six videos in a row from the same channel?"}, {"time": 3985, "text": "And over time, we try to chip away at that and make it more fine grain and basically have it remove the heuristics in favor of something that can react to individuals and individual situations."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "So how do you, you mentioned, you know, we know that something worked."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "How do you get a sense when decisions are kind of A, B testing that this idea was a good one, this was not so good?"}, {"time": 4015, "text":

the experience for viewers?"}, {"time": 4058, "text": "That's the question we're trying to answer."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "And an experiment is one way because we can see certain things go up and down."}, {"time": 4065, "text": "So for instance, if we noticed in the experiment, people are dismissing videos less frequently, or they're saying that they're more satisfied, they're giving more

look at other things, like we might do user studies, where we invite some people in and ask them, like, what do you think about this?"}, {"time": 4097, "text": "How do you feel about this?"}, {"time":

don't know how you make a viral video."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "I know that we have in the past tried to figure out if we could detect when a video was going to go viral."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "And those were, you take the first and second derivatives of the view count and maybe use that to do some prediction."}, {"time": 4147, "text": "But I can't say we ever got very good at that."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "Oftentimes we look at where the traffic was coming from."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "If a lot of the viewership is coming from something like Twitter, then maybe it has a higher chance of becoming viral than if it were coming from search or something."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "But that was just trying to detect a video that might be viral."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "How to make one, I have no idea."}, {"time": 4173, "text": "You get your kids to interrupt you while you're on the news or something."}, {"time": 4179, "text": "But after the fact, on one individual video, sort of ahead of time predicting is a really hard task."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "But after the video went viral, in analysis, can you sometimes understand why it went viral?"}, {"time": 4193,

people?"}, {"time": 4205, "text": "Well, I think people expect that if a video is going viral and it's something they would be interested in, then I think they would expect YouTube to recommend it to them."}, {"time": 4217, "text": "So if something's going viral, it's good to just let the wave, let people ride the wave of its violence."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "Well, I mean, we want to meet people's expectations in that way, of course."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "So like I mentioned, I hung out with Derek Mueller a while ago, a couple of months back."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "He's actually the person who suggested I talk to you on this podcast."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "Well, thank you, Derek."}, {"time": 4240, "text": "At that time, he just recently posted an awesome science video titled, why are 96 million black balls on this reservoir?"}, {"time": 4250, "text": "And in a matter of, I don't know how long, but like a few days, he got 38 million views and it's still growing."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "Is this something you can analyze and understand why it happened, this video and you want a particular video like it?"}, {"time": 4266, "text": "I mean, we can surely see where it was recommended, where it was found, who watched it and those sorts of things."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "So it's actually, sorry to interrupt, it is the video which helped me discover who Derek is."}, {"time": 4281, "text": "I didn't know who he is before."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "So I remember, you know, usually I just have all of these technical, boring MIT Stanford talks in my recommendation because that's how I watch."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "And then all of a sudden there's this black balls and reservoir video with like an excited nerd with like just, why is this being recommended to me?"}, {"time": 4300, "text": "So I clicked on it and watched the whole thing and it was awesome."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "And then a lot of people had that experience, like why was I recommended this?"}, {"time": 4308, "text": "But they all of course watched it and enjoyed it, which is, what's your sense of this just wave of recommendation that comes with this viral video that ultimately people get enjoy after they click on it?"}, {"time": 4319, "text": "Well, I think it's the system, you know, basically doing what anybody who's recommending something would do, which is you show it to some people and if they like it, you say, okay, well, can I find some more people who are a little bit like them?"}, {"time": 4332, "text": "Okay, I'm going to try it with them."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "Oh, they like it too."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "Let me expand the circle some more, find some more people."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "Oh, it turns out they like it too."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "And you just keep going until you get some feedback that says that, no, now you've gone too far."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "These people don't like it anymore."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "And so I think that's basically what happened."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "And you asked me about how to make a video go viral or make a viral video."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "I don't think that if you or I decided to make a video about 96 million balls that it would also go viral."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "It's possible that Derek made like the canonical video about those black balls in the lake."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "He did actually."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "And I don't know whether or not just following along is the secret."}, {"time": 4380, "text": "But it's fascinating."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "I mean, just like you said, the algorithm sort of expanding that circle and then figuring out that more and more people did enjoy it and that sort of phase shift of just a huge number of people enjoying it and the algorithm quickly, automatically, I assume, figuring that out."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "I don't know, the dynamics of psychology of that is a beautiful thing."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "So what do you think about the idea of clipping?"}, {"time": 4405, "text": "Too many people annoyed me into doing it, which is they were requesting it."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "They said it would be very beneficial to add clips in like the coolest points and actually have explicit videos."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "Like I'm re uploading a video, like a short clip, which is what the podcasts are doing."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "Do you see as opposed to, like I also add timestamps for the topics, do you want the clip?"}, {"time": 4430, "text": "Do you see YouTube somehow helping creators with that process or helping connect clips to the original videos or is that just on a long list of amazing features to work towards?"}, {"time": 4441, "text": "I mean, it's not something that I think we've done yet, but I can tell you that I think clipping is great and I think it's actually great for you as a creator."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "And here's the reason."}, {"time": 4455, "text": "If you think about, I mean, let's say the NBA is uploading videos of its games."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "Well, people might search for warriors versus rockets or they might search for Steph Curry."}, {"time": 4471, "text": "And so a highlight from the game in which Steph Curry makes an amazing shot is an opportunity for someone to find a portion of that video."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "And so I think that you never know how people are going to search for something that you've created."}, {"time": 4489, "text": "And so you want to, I would say you want to make clips and add titles and things like that so that they can find it as easily as possible."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "Do you have a dream of a future, perhaps a distant future when the YouTube algorithm figures that out?"}, {"time": 4505, "text": "Sort of automatically detects the parts of the video that are really interesting, exciting, potentially exciting for people and sort of clip them out in this incredibly rich space."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "Cause if you talk about, if you talk, even just this conversation, we probably covered 30, 40 little topics and there's a huge space of users that would find, you know, 30% of those topics really interesting."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "And that space is very different."}, {"time": 4533, "text": "It's something that's beyond my ability to clip out, right?"}, {"time": 4537, "text": "But the algorithm might be able to figure all that out, sort of expand into clips."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Do you have a, do you think about this kind of thing?"}, {"time": 4546, "text": "Do you have a hope or dream that one day the algorithm will be able to do that kind of deep content analysis?"}, {"time": 4550, "text": "Well, we've actually had projects that attempt to achieve this, but it really does depend on understanding the video well and our understanding of the video right now is quite crude."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "And so I think it would be especially hard to do it with a conversation like this."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "One might be able to do it with, let's say a soccer match more easily, right?"}, {"time": 4578, "text": "You could probably find out where the goals were scored."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "And then of course you, you need to figure out who it was that scored the goal and, and that might require a human to do some annotation."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "But I think that trying to identify coherent topics in a transcript, like, like the one of our conversation is, is not something that we're going to be very good at right away."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "And I was speaking more to the general problem actually of being able to do both a soccer match and our conversation without explicit sort of almost my, my hope was that there exists an algorithm that's able to find exciting things in video."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "So Google now on Google search will help you find the segment of the video that you're interested in."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "So if you search for something like how to change the filter in my dishwasher, then if there's a long video about your dishwasher and this is the part where the person shows you how to change the filter, then, then it will highlight that area."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "And provide a link directly to it."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "And do you know if, from your recollection, do you know if the thumbnail reflects, like, what's the difference between showing the full video and the shorter clip?"}, {"time": 4652,

it's based on creator annotations."}, {"time": 4661, "text": "Ah, got it."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "So it's not the thing we're talking about."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "But folks are working on the

people looked at."}, {"time": 4737, "text": "It's not always what you were expecting."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "In the case of the lecture, it's pretty boring, it is what we were expecting, but we did a few funny videos where there's a bunch of people doing things, and everybody tracks those people."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "You know, in the beginning, they all look at the main person and they start spreading around and looking at the other people."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "So that kind of, that's a really strong signal of what people found exciting in the video."}, {"time": 4761, "text":

know."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "And the Wright brothers thought they're never, they're not going to fly for 50 years, three years before they flew."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "So what are the biggest

interesting moment as you said, or is that not an interesting moment?"}, {"time": 4911, "text": "These things can be pretty hard."}, {"time": 4914, "text": "So Yann LeCun, I'm not sure if you're familiar sort of with his current thinking and work."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "So he believes that self, what he's referring to as self supervised learning will be the solution sort of to achieving this kind of greater level of intelligence."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "In fact, the thing he's focusing on is watching video and predicting the next frame."}, {"time": 4934, "text": "So predicting the future of video, right?"}, {"time": 4938, "text": "So for now we're very far from that, but his thought is because it's unsupervised or as he refers to as self supervised, you know, if you watch enough video, essentially if you watch YouTube, you'll be able to learn about the nature of reality, the physics, the common sense reasoning required by just teaching a system to predict the next frame."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "So he's confident this is the way to go."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "So for you, from the perspective of just working with this video, how do you think an algorithm that just watches all of YouTube, stays up all day and night watching YouTube would be able to understand enough of the physics of the world about the way this world works, be able to do common sense reasoning and so on?"}, {"time": 4985, "text": "Well, I mean, we have systems that already watch all the videos on YouTube, right?"}, {"time": 4990, "text": "But they're just looking for very specific things, right?"}, {"time": 4993, "text": "They're supervised learning systems that are trying to identify something or classify something."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "And I don't know if, I don't know if predicting the next frame is really going to get there because I'm not an expert on compression algorithms, but I understand that that's kind of what compression video compression algorithms do is they basically try to predict the next frame and then fix up the places where they got it wrong."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "And that leads to higher compression than if you actually put all the bits for the next frame there."}, {"time": 5028, "text": "So I don't know if I believe that just being able to predict the next frame is going to be enough because there's so many frames and even a tiny bit of error on a per frame basis can lead to wildly different videos."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "So the thing is, the idea of compression is one way to do compression is to describe through text what's contained in the video."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "That's the ultimate high level of compression."}, {"time": 5052, "text": "So the idea is traditionally when you think of video image compression, you're trying to maintain the same visual quality while reducing the size."}, {"time": 5062, "text": "But if you think of deep learning from a bigger perspective of what compression is, is you're trying to summarize the video."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "And the idea there is if you have a big enough neural network, just by watching the next, trying to predict the next frame, you'll be able to form a compression of actually understanding what's going on in the scene."}, {"time": 5082, "text": "If there's two people talking, you can just reduce that entire video into the fact that two people are talking and maybe the content of what they're saying and so on."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "That's kind of the open ended dream."}, {"time": 5095, "text": "So I just wanted to sort of

better than 20 news groups."}, {"time": 860, "text": "And so I started out, I think just by wanting to do something that was more, I don't know, societally useful and technically interesting."},

away about 12 years ago."}, {"time": 902, "text": "He had an autoimmune disease that settled in his lungs and the doctors basically said, well, there's only one thing that we could do, which is give

thing we can give him."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And I had friends who were rheumatologists who said the FDA would never approve prednisone today because the ratio of side effects to benefit is probably not large enough."}, {"time": 939, "text": "Today, we're in a state where there's probably four or five, maybe even more, well, it depends for which autoimmune disease, but there are multiple drugs that can help people with autoimmune disease, many of which didn't exist 12 years ago."}, {"time": 956, "text": "And I think we're at a golden time in some ways in drug discovery where there's the ability to create drugs that are much more safe and much more effective than we've ever been able to before."}, {"time": 973, "text": "And what's lacking is enough understanding of biology and mechanism to know where to aim that engine."}, {"time": 982, "text": "And I think that's where machine learning can help."}, {"time": 985, "text": "So in 2018, you started and now lead a company in Citro, which is, like you mentioned, perhaps the focus is drug discovery and the utilization of machine learning for drug discovery."}, {"time": 998, "text": "So you mentioned that, quote, we're really interested in creating what you might call a disease in a dish model, disease in a dish models, places where diseases are complex, where we really haven't had a good model system, where typical animal models that have been used for years, including testing on mice, just aren't very effective."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "So can you try to describe what is an animal model and what is a disease in a dish model?"}, {"time": 1026, "text": "So an animal model for disease is where you create effectively, it's what it sounds like."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "It's oftentimes a mouse where we have introduced some external perturbation that creates the disease and then we cure that disease."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "And the hope is that by doing that, we will cure a similar disease in the human."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "The problem is that oftentimes the way in which we generate the disease in the animal has nothing to do with how that disease actually comes about in a human."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "It's what you might think of as a copy of the phenotype, a copy of the clinical outcome, but the mechanisms are quite different."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "And so curing the disease in the animal, which in most cases doesn't happen naturally, mice don't get Alzheimer's, they don't get diabetes, they don't get atherosclerosis, they don't get autism or schizophrenia."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "Those cures don't translate over to what happens in the human."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "And that's where most drugs fails just because the findings that we had in the mouse don't translate to a human."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "The disease in the dish models is a fairly new approach."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "It's been enabled by technologies that have not existed for more than five to 10 years."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "So for instance, the ability for us to take a cell from any one of us, you or me, revert that say skin cell to what's called stem cell status, which is what's called the pluripotent cell that can then be differentiated into different types of cells."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "So from that pluripotent cell, one can create a Lex neuron or a Lex cardiomyocyte or a Lex hepatocyte that has your genetics, but that right cell type."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "And so if there's a genetic burden of disease that would manifest in that particular cell type, you might be able to see it by looking at those cells and saying, oh, that's what potentially sick cells look like versus healthy cells and then explore what kind of interventions might revert the unhealthy looking cell to a healthy cell."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "Now, of course, curing cells is not the same as curing people."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "So that's really what we're hoping to do."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "That step, that backward step, I was reading about it, the Yamanaka factor."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "So it's like that reverse step back to stem cells."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "Seems like magic."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "Honestly, before that happened, I think very few people would have predicted that to be possible."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Can you maybe elaborate, is it actually possible?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Like where, like how stable?"}, {"time": 1227, "text": "So this result was maybe like, I don't know how many years ago, maybe 10 years ago was first demonstrated, something like that."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Is this, how hard is this?"}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Like how noisy is this backward step?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "It seems quite incredible and cool."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "It is, it is incredible and cool."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "It was much more, I think finicky and bespoke at the early stages when the discovery was first made."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "But at this point, it's become almost industrialized."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "There are what's called contract research organizations, vendors that will take a sample from a human and revert it back to stem cell status."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And it works a very good fraction of the time."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "Now there are people who will ask, I think good questions."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "Is this really truly a stem cell or does it remember certain aspects of what, of changes that were made in the human beyond the genetics?"}, {"time": 1282, "text": "It's passed as a skin cell, yeah."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "It's passed as a skin cell or it's passed in terms of exposures to different environmental factors and so on."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "So I think the consensus right now is that these are not always perfect and there is little bits and pieces of memory sometimes, but by and large, these are actually pretty good."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "So one of the key things, well, maybe you can correct me, but one of the useful things for machine learning is size, scale of data."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "How easy it is to do these kinds of reversals to stem cells and then disease in a dish models at scale."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "Is that a huge challenge or not?"}, {"time": 1326, "text": "So the reversal is not as of this point something that can be done at the scale of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "I think total number of stem cells or IPS cells that are what's called induced pluripotent stem cells in the world I think is somewhere between five and 10,000 last I looked."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "Now again, that might not count things that exist in this or that academic center and they may add up to a bit more, but that's about the range."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "So it's not something that you could at this point generate IPS cells from a million people, but maybe you don't need to because maybe that background is enough because it can also be now perturbed in different ways."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "And some people have done really interesting experiments in for instance, taking cells from a healthy human and then introducing a mutation into it using one of the other miracle technologies that's emerged in the last decade which is CRISPR gene editing and introduced a mutation that is known to be pathogenic."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "And so you can now look at the healthy cells and the unhealthy cells, the one with the mutation and do a one on one comparison where everything else is held constant."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "And so you could really start to understand specifically what the mutation does at the cellular level."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "So the IPS cells are a great starting point and obviously more diversity is better because you also wanna capture ethnic background and how that affects things, but maybe you don't need one from every single patient with every single type of disease because we have other tools at our disposal."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "Well, how much difference is there between people I mentioned ethnic background in terms of IPS cells?"}, {"time": 1434, "text": "So we're all like, it seems like these magical cells that can do to create anything between different populations, different people."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Is there a lot of variability between cell cells?"}, {"time": 1447, "text": "Well, first of all, there's the variability, that's driven simply by the fact that genetically we're different."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "So a stem cell that's derived from my genotype is gonna be different from a stem cell that's derived from your genotype."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "There's also some differences that have more to do with for whatever reason, some people's stem cells differentiate better than other people's stem cells."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "We don't entirely understand why."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "So there's certainly some differences there as well, but the fundamental difference and the one that we really care about and is a positive is that the fact that the genetics are different and therefore recapitulate my disease burden versus your disease burden."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "What's a disease burden?"}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Well, a disease burden is just if you think, I mean, it's not a well defined mathematical term, although there are mathematical formulations of it."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "If you think about the fact that some of us are more likely to get a certain disease than others because we have more variations in our genome that are causative of the disease, maybe fewer that are protective of the disease."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "People have quantified that using what are called polygenic risk scores, which look at all of the variations in an individual person's genome and add them all up in terms of how much risk they confer for a particular disease."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "And then they've put people on a spectrum of their disease risk."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "And for certain diseases where we've been sufficiently powered to really understand the connection between the many, many small variations that give rise to an increased disease risk, there's some pretty significant differences in terms of the risk between the people, say at the highest decile of this polygenic risk score and the people at the lowest decile."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "Sometimes those differences are factor of 10 or 12 higher."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "So there's definitely a lot that our genetics contributes to disease risk, even if it's not by any stretch the full explanation."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "And from a machine learning perspective, there's signal there."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "There is definitely signal in the genetics and there's even more signal, we believe, in looking at the cells that are derived from those different genetics because in principle, you could say all the signal is there at the genetics level."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "So we don't need to look at the cells, but our understanding of the biology is so limited at this point than seeing what actually happens at the cellular level is a heck of a lot closer to the human clinical outcome than looking at the genetics directly."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "And so we can learn a lot more from it than we could by looking at genetics alone."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "So just to get a sense, I don't know if it's easy to do, but what kind of data is useful in this disease in a dish model?"}, {"time": 1616, "text": "Like what's the source of raw data information?"}, {"time": 1619, "text": "And also from my outsider's perspective, so biology and cells are squishy things."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "And then how do you connect the computer to that?"}, {"time": 1635, "text": "Which sensory mechanisms, I guess."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "So that's another one of those revolutions that have happened in the last 10 years in that our ability to measure cells very quantitatively has also dramatically increased."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "So back when I started doing biology in the late 90s, early 2000s, that was the initial era where we started to measure biology in really quantitative ways using things like microarrays, where you would measure in a single experiment the activity level, what's called expression level of every gene in the genome in that sample."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "And that ability is what actually allowed us to even understand that there are molecular subtypes of diseases like cancer, where up until that point, it's like, oh, you have breast cancer."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "But then when we looked at the molecular data, it was clear that there's different subtypes of breast cancer that at the level of gene activity look completely different to each other."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "So that was the beginning of this process."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "Now we have the ability to measure individual cells in terms of their gene activity using what's called single cell RNA sequencing, which basically sequences the RNA, which is that activity level of different genes for every gene in the genome."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "And you could do that at single cell level."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "So that's an incredibly powerful way of measuring cells."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "I mean, you literally count the number of transcripts."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "So it really turns that squishy thing into something that's digital."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "Another tremendous data source that's emerged in the last few years is microscopy and specifically even super resolution microscopy, where you could use digital reconstruction to look at subcellular structures, sometimes even things that are below the diffraction limit of light by doing a sophisticated reconstruction."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "And again, that gives you a tremendous amount of information at the subcellular level."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "There's now more and more ways that amazing scientists out there are developing for getting new types of information from even single cells."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And so that is a way of turning those squishy things into digital data."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "Into beautiful data sets."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "But so that data set then with machine learning tools allows you to maybe understand the developmental, like the mechanism of a particular disease."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "And if it's possible to sort of at a high level describe, how does that help lead to a drug discovery that can help prevent, reverse that mechanism?"}, {"time": 1805, "text": "So I think there's different ways in which this data could potentially be used."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Some people use it for scientific discovery and say, oh, look, we see this phenotype at the cellular level."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "So let's try and work our way backwards and think which genes might be involved in pathways that give rise to that."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So that's a very sort of analytical method to sort of work our way backwards using our understanding of known biology."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Some people use it in a somewhat more, sort of forward, if that was a backward, this would be forward, which is to say, okay, if I can perturb this gene, does it show a phenotype that is similar to what I see in disease patients?"}, {"time": 1856, "text": "And so maybe that gene is actually causal of the disease."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "So that's a different way."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "And then there's what we do, which is basically to take that very large collection of data and use machine learning to uncover the patterns that emerge from it."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "So for instance, what are those subtypes that might be similar at the human clinical outcome, but quite distinct when you look at the molecular data?"}, {"time": 1881, "text": "And then if we can identify such a subtype, are there interventions that if I apply it to cells that come from this subtype of the disease and you apply that intervention, it could be a drug or it could be a CRISPR gene intervention, does it revert the disease state to something that looks more like normal, happy, healthy cells?"}, {"time": 1904, "text": "And so hopefully if you see that, that gives you a certain hope that that intervention will also have a meaningful clinical benefit to people."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "And there's obviously a bunch of things that you would wanna do after that to validate that, but it's a very different and much less hypothesis driven way of uncovering new potential interventions and might give rise to things that are not the same things that everyone else is already looking at."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "That's, I don't know, I'm just like to psychoanalyze my own feeling about our discussion currently."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "It's so exciting to talk about sort of a machine, fundamentally, well, something that's been turned into a machine learning problem and that says can have so much real world impact."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "That's how I feel too."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "That's kind of exciting because I'm so, most of my day is spent with data sets that I guess closer to the news groups."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "So this is a kind of, it just feels good to talk about."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "In fact, I almost don't wanna talk about machine learning."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "I wanna talk about the fundamentals of the data set, which is an exciting place to be."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "It's what gets me up in the morning."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "It's also what attracts a lot of the people who work at InCetro to InCetro because I think all of the, certainly all of our machine learning people are outstanding and could go get a job selling ads online or doing eCommerce or even self driving cars."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "But I think they would want, they come to us because they want to work on something that has more of an aspirational nature and can really benefit humanity."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "What, with these approaches, what do you hope, what kind of diseases can be helped?"}, {"time": 2011, "text": "We mentioned Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "Can you just describe the various kinds of diseases that this approach can help?"}, {"time": 2018, "text": "Well, we don't know."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "And I try and be very cautious about making promises about some things that, oh, we will cure X."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "People make that promise."}, {"time": 2028, "text": "And I think it's, I tried to first deliver and then promise as opposed to the other way around."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "There are characteristics of a disease that make it more likely that this type of approach can potentially be helpful."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "So for instance, diseases that have a very strong genetic basis are ones that are more likely to manifest in a stem cell derived model."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "We would want the cellular models to be relatively reproducible and robust so that you could actually get enough of those cells and in a way that isn't very highly variable and noisy."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "You would want the disease to be relatively contained in one or a small number of cell types that you could actually create in an in vitro, in a dish setting."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "Whereas if it's something that's really broad and systemic and involves multiple cells that are in very distal parts of your body, putting that all in the dish is really challenging."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "So we want to focus on the ones that are most likely to be successful today with the hope, I think, that really smart bioengineers out there are developing better and better systems all the time so that diseases that might not be tractable today might be tractable in three years."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "So for instance, five years ago, these stem cell derived models didn't really exist."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "People were doing most of the work in cancer cells and cancer cells are very, very poor models of most human biology because they're, A, they were cancer to begin with and B, as you passage them and they proliferate in a dish, they become, because of the genomic instability, even less similar to human biology."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "Now we have these stem cell derived models."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "We have the capability to reasonably robustly, not quite at the right scale yet, but close, to derive what's called organoids, which are these teeny little sort of multicellular organ, sort of models of an organ system."}, {"time": 2156, "text": "So there's cerebral organoids and liver organoids and kidney organoids and."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "Yeah, brain organoids."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "That's organoids."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "It's possibly the coolest thing I've ever seen."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "Is that not like the coolest thing?"}, {"time": 2168, "text": "And then I think on the horizon, we're starting to see things like connecting these organoids to each other so that you could actually start, and there's some really cool papers that start to do that where you can actually start to say, okay, can we do multi organ system stuff?"}, {"time": 2182, "text": "There's many challenges to that."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "It's not easy by any stretch, but it might, I'm sure people will figure it out."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "And in three years or five years, there will be disease models that we could make for things that we can't make today."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "Yeah, and this conversation would seem almost outdated with the kind of scale that could be achieved in like three years."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "That's the hope."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "That would be so cool."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "So you've cofounded Coursera with Andrew Ng and were part of the whole MOOC revolution."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "So to jump topics a little bit, can you maybe tell the origin story of the history, the origin story of MOOCs, of Coursera, and in general, your teaching to huge audiences on a very sort of impactful topic of AI in general?"}, {"time": 2232, "text": "So I think the origin story of MOOCs emanates from a number of efforts that occurred at Stanford University around the late 2000s where different individuals within Stanford, myself included, were getting really excited about the opportunities of using online technologies as a way of achieving both improved quality of teaching and also improved scale."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "And so Andrew, for instance, led the Stanford Engineering Everywhere, which was sort of an attempt to take 10 Stanford courses and put them online just as video lectures."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "And so those efforts eventually sort of started to interplay with each other and created a tremendous sense of excitement and energy within the Stanford community about the potential of online teaching and led in the fall of 2011 to the launch of the first Stanford MOOCs."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "By the way, MOOCs, it's probably impossible that people don't know, but it's, I guess, massive."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "Open online courses."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "We did not come up with the acronym."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "I'm not particularly fond of the acronym, but it is what it is."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "It is what it is."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "Big bang is not a great term for the start of the universe, but it is what it is."}, {"time": 2341, "text": "Probably so."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "So anyway, so those courses launched in the fall of 2011, and there were, within a matter of weeks, with no real publicity campaign, just a New York Times article that went viral, about 100,000 students or more in each of those courses."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "And I remember this conversation that Andrew and I had."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "We were just like, wow, there's this real need here."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "And I think we both felt like, sure, we were accomplished academics and we could go back and go back to our labs, write more papers."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "But if we did that, then this wouldn't happen."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "And it seemed too important not to happen."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "And so we spent a fair bit of time debating, do we wanna do this as a Stanford effort, kind of building on what we'd started?"}, {"time": 2396, "text": "Do we wanna do this as a for profit company?"}, {"time": 2399, "text": "Do we wanna do this as a nonprofit?"}, {"time": 2400, "text": "And we decided ultimately to do it as we did with Coursera."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "And so, you know, we started really operating as a company at the beginning of 2012."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "And the rest is history."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "But how did you, was that really surprising to you?"}, {"time": 2419, "text": "How did you at that time and at this time make sense of this need for sort of global education you mentioned that you felt that, wow, the popularity indicates that there's a hunger for sort of globalization of learning."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "I think there is a hunger for learning that, you know, globalization is part of it, but I think it's just a hunger for learning."}, {"time": 2447, "text": "The world has changed in the last 50 years."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "It used to be that you finished college, you got a job, by and large, the skills that you learned in college were pretty much what got you through the rest of your job history."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "And yeah, you learn some stuff, but it wasn't a dramatic change."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "Today, we're in a world where the skills that you need for a lot of jobs, they didn't even exist when you went to college."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "And the jobs, and many of the jobs that existed when you went to college don't even exist today or are dying."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "So part of that is due to AI, but not only."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "And we need to find a way of keeping people, giving people access to the skills that they need today."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "And I think that's really what's driving a lot of this hunger."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "So I think if we even take a step back, for you, all of this started in trying to think of new ways to teach or to, new ways to sort of organize the material and present the material in a way that would help the education process, the pedagogy, yeah."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "So what have you learned about effective education from this process of playing, of experimenting with different ideas?"}, {"time": 2520, "text": "So we learned a number of things."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "Some of which I think could translate back and have translated back effectively to how people teach on campus."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "And some of which I think are more specific to people who learn online, more sort of people who learn as part of their daily life."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "So we learned, for instance, very quickly that short is better."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "So people who are especially in the workforce can't do a 15 week semester long course."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "They just can't fit that into their lives."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "Sure, can you describe the shortness of what?"}, {"time": 2555, "text": "The entirety, so every aspect, so the little lecture, the lecture's short, the course is short."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "We started out, the first online education efforts were actually MIT's OpenCourseWare initiatives."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "And that was recording of classroom lectures and, Hour and a half or something like that, yeah."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "And that didn't really work very well."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "I mean, some people benefit."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "I mean, of course they did, but it's not really a very palatable experience for someone who has a job and three kids and they need to run errands and such."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "They can't fit 15 weeks into their life and the hour and a half is really hard."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "So we learned very quickly."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "I mean, we started out with short video modules and over time we made them shorter because we realized that 15 minutes was still too long."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "If you wanna fit in when you're waiting in line for your kid's doctor's appointment, it's better if it's five to seven."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "We learned that 15 week courses don't work and you really wanna break this up into shorter units so that there is a natural completion point, gives people a sense of they're really close to finishing something meaningful."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "They can always come back and take part two and part three."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "We also learned that compressing the content works really well because if some people that pace works well and for others, they can always rewind and watch again."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "And so people have the ability to then learn at their own pace."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "And so that flexibility, the brevity and the flexibility are both things that we found to be very important."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "We learned that engagement during the content is important and the quicker you give people feedback, the more likely they are to be engaged."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "Hence the introduction of these, which we actually was an intuition that I had going in and was then validated using data that introducing some of these sort of little micro quizzes into the lectures really helps."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "Self graded as automatically graded assessments really helped too because it gives people feedback."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "See, there you are."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "So all of these are valuable."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "And then we learned a bunch of other things too."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "We did some really interesting experiments, for instance, on gender bias and how having a female role model as an instructor can change the balance of men to women in terms of, especially in STEM courses."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "And you could do that online by doing AB testing in ways that would be really difficult to go on campus."}, {"time": 2707, "text": "Oh, that's exciting."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "But so the shortness, the compression, I mean, that's actually, so that probably is true for all good editing is always just compressing the content, making it shorter."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "So that puts a lot of burden on the creator of the, the instructor and the creator of the educational content."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "Probably most lectures at MIT or Stanford could be five times shorter if the preparation was put enough."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "So maybe people might disagree with that, but like the Christmas, the clarity that a lot of the, like Coursera delivers is, how much effort does that take?"}, {"time": 2750, "text": "So first of all, let me say that it's not clear that that crispness would work as effectively in a face to face setting because people need time to absorb the material."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "And so you need to at least pause and give people a chance to reflect and maybe practice."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And that's what MOOCs do is that they give you these chunks of content and then ask you to practice with it."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "And that's where I think some of the newer pedagogy that people are adopting in face to face teaching that have to do with interactive learning and such can be really helpful."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "But both those approaches, whether you're doing that type of methodology in online teaching or in that flipped classroom, interactive teaching."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "What's that, sorry to pause, what's flipped classroom?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "Flipped classroom is a way in which online content is used to supplement face to face teaching where people watch the videos perhaps and do some of the exercises before coming to class."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "And then when they come to class, it's actually to do much deeper problem solving oftentimes in a group."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "But any one of those different pedagogies that are beyond just standing there and droning on in front of the classroom for an hour and 15 minutes require a heck of a lot more preparation."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "And so it's one of the challenges I think that people have that we had when trying to convince instructors to teach on Coursera."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "And it's part of the challenges that pedagogy experts on campus have in trying to get faculty to teach differently is that it's actually harder to teach that way than it is to stand there and drone."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "Do you think MOOCs will replace in person education or become the majority of in person of education of the way people learn in the future?"}, {"time": 2861, "text": "Again, the future could be very far away, but where's the trend going do you think?"}, {"time": 2866, "text": "So I think it's a nuanced and complicated answer."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "I don't think MOOCs will replace face to face teaching."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "I think learning is in many cases a social experience."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "And even at Coursera, we had people who naturally formed study groups, even when they didn't have to, to just come and talk to each other."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "And we found that that actually benefited their learning in very important ways."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "So there was more success among learners who had those study groups than among ones who didn't."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "So I don't think it's just gonna, oh, we're all gonna just suddenly learn online with a computer and no one else in the same way that recorded music has not replaced live concerts."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "Briefly, it might be a difficult question to ask, but there's a lot of people fascinated by artificial intelligence, by machine learning, by deep learning."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "Is there a recommendation for the next year or for a lifelong journey of somebody interested in this?"}, {"time": 2961, "text": "How do they begin?"}, {"time": 2963, "text": "How do they enter that learning journey?"}, {"time": 2967, "text": "I think the important thing is first to just get started."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "And there's plenty of online content that one can get for both the core foundations of mathematics and statistics and programming."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "And then from there to machine learning, I would encourage people not to skip to quickly pass the foundations because I find that there's a lot of people who learn machine learning, whether it's online or on campus without getting those foundations."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And they basically just turn the crank on existing models in ways that A, don't allow for a lot of innovation and an adjustment to the problem at hand, but also B, are sometimes just wrong and they don't even realize that their application is wrong because there's artifacts that they haven't fully understood."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "So I think the foundations, machine learning is an important step."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Practice."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "Perhaps a bit of a romanticized question, but what idea in deep learning do you find, have you found in your journey the most beautiful or surprising or interesting?"}, {"time": 3067, "text": "Perhaps not just deep learning, but AI in general, statistics."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "I'm gonna answer with two things."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "One would be the foundational concept of end to end training, which is that you start from the raw data and you train something that is not like a single piece, but rather towards the actual goal that you're looking to."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "From the raw data to the outcome, like no details in between."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "Well, not no details, but the fact that you, I mean, you could certainly introduce building blocks that were trained towards other tasks."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "I'm actually coming to that in my second half of the answer, but it doesn't have to be like a single monolithic blob in the middle."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "Actually, I think that's not ideal, but rather the fact that at the end of the day, you can actually train something that goes all the way from the beginning to the end."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "And the other one that I find really compelling is the notion of learning a representation that in its turn, even if it was trained to another task, can potentially be used as a much more rapid starting point to solving a different task."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "And that's, I think, reminiscent of what makes people successful learners."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "It's something that is relatively new in the machine learning space."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "I think it's underutilized even relative to today's capabilities, but more and more of how do we learn sort of reusable representation?"}, {"time": 3165, "text": "And so end to end and transfer learning."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "Is it surprising to you that neural networks are able to, in many cases, do these things?"}, {"time": 3176, "text": "Is it maybe taken back to when you first would dive deep into neural networks or in general, even today, is it surprising that neural networks work at all and work wonderfully to do this kind of raw end to end and end to end learning and even transfer learning?"}, {"time": 3196, "text": "I think I was surprised by how well when you have large enough amounts of data, it's possible to find a meaningful representation in what is an exceedingly high dimensional space."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "And so I find that to be really exciting and people are still working on the math for that."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "There's more papers on that every year."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "And I think it would be really cool if we figured that out, but that to me was a surprise because in the early days when I was starting my way in machine learning and the data sets were rather small, I think we believed, I believed that you needed to have a much more constrained and knowledge rich search space to really make, to really get to a meaningful answer."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "And I think it was true at the time."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "What I think is still a question is will a completely knowledge free approach where there's no prior knowledge going into the construction of the model, is that gonna be the solution or not?"}, {"time": 3271, "text": "It's not actually the solution today in the sense that the architecture of a convolutional neural network that's used for images is actually quite different to the type of network that's used for language and yet different from the one that's used for speech or biology or any

back into the land of philosophy and speaking of AI systems providing uncertainty, somebody like Stuart Russell believes that as we create more and more intelligence systems, it's really important for

we get in trouble with much dumber systems?"}, {"time": 3728, "text": "Yes, and that is exactly where I was going."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "So just to wrap up on the threats of AGI, I think that it

more televised."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "So in those types of systems, you usually have a fuel on an oxidizer and they react and combust and release stored chemical energy."}, {"time": 1038, "text":

that the release of energy from those bonds essentially."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "So a solid fuel works the same way."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "And the other main category is electric propulsion."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "So instead of chemical energy, you're using electrical energy, usually from batteries or solar panels."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "And in this case, the stuff you're pushing out the back would be charged particles."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "So instead of combustion and heat, you end up with charged particles and you force them out the back of the

well understood in its simplest form, it's like a firework."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "So it's been around since 400 BC or something like that."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "So that even the big engines are quite well understood."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "I think one of the last gaps there is probably what exactly are the products of combustion?"}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Our modeling abilities kind of fall apart there because it's hot and gases are moving and you end up kind of having to venture into lots of different interdisciplinary fields of science to try to solve that."}, {"time": 1187,

unsolved pieces."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "And really the kind of what people care about there is making it more fuel efficient."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So the chemical stuff, you can get a lot of instantaneous thrusts, but it's not very fuel efficient."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "It's much more fuel efficient to go with the electric type of propulsion."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "So that's where people spend a lot of their time is trying to make that more efficient in terms of thrust per unit of fuel."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "And then there's always considerations like heating and cooling."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "It's very hot, which is good if it heats the gases, but bad if it melts the rocket and things like that."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "So there's always a lot of work on heating and cooling and the engine cycles and things like that."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And then on electric propulsion, I find it like much more refreshingly poorly understood."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Lots more mysteries."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "One of the classes I took in college, we spent 90% of the class on chemical propulsion and then the last 10% on electric."}, {"time":

material science and fluid dynamics and electrostatics."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "And it's just very intriguing to me."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "First of all, can you actually zoom out even more?"}, {"time": 1304, "text": "Like, cause you mentioned ion propulsion engine is a subset of electric."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "So like maybe, is there a categories of electric engines and then we can zoom in on ion propulsion?"}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Yes, so sure."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "There's the two most kind of conventional types that have been around since the sixties are ion engines and hall thrusters."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "And ion engines are a little bit simpler because they don't use a magnetic field for generating thrust."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "And then there are also some other types of plasma engines, but that don't fit into those two categories."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "So just kind of other plasma, like a VASMIR engine, which we could get into."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And then those are probably the main three categories that would be fun to talk about."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "Oh, and then of course, the category of engine that I work on, which has a lot of similarities to an ion engine, but could be considered its own class called a colloid thruster."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "Colloid, cool."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "Okay, so what is an ion propulsion, I imagine?"}, {"time": 1368, "text": "Okay, so in an ion engine, you have an ionization chamber and you inject the propellant into that chamber."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And this is usually a neutral gas like xenon or argon."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "So you inject that into the chamber and you also inject a stream of really high energy electrons and everything's just moving around very randomly in there."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "And the whole goal is to have one of those electrons collide with one of those neutral atoms and turn it into an ion."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "So kick off a secondary electron and now you have..."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "Plasma."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And now you have a charged xenon or argon ion and more electrons and so on."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And then some fraction of those ions will happen to make it to this downstream electric field that we set up between two grids with holes in them."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "And in terms of area, the same amount of those ions also runs into the walls and lose their charge and that's where some of the inefficiencies come in."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "But the very lucky few make it to the downstream and the very lucky few make it to those holes in that grid and there are two grids actually and you apply a voltage differential between them and that sets up an electric field."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "And a charged particle in an electric field creates a force."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "And so those ions are accelerated out the back of the engine and the reaction force is what pushes the spacecraft forward."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "If you're following along and tallying these charges, now we've just sent a positive beam of ions out the back of the spacecraft and for our purposes here, the spacecraft is neutral."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "So eventually those ions will come back and hit the spacecraft because it's a positive beam."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "So you also have to have an external cathode producer of electrons outside the engine that pumps electrons into that beam and neutralizes that."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "So now it's net neutral everywhere and it won't come back to the spacecraft."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "So that's an ion engine."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "What temperature are we talking about here?"}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So in terms of like the chemical based engines, those are super hot."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "You mentioned plasma here."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "How hot does this thing get?"}, {"time": 1520, "text": "I mean, is that an interesting thing to talk about in a sense that is that an interesting distinction or is the heat, I mean, it's all gonna be hot."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "No, so it's important especially for some of these smaller satellites people are into launching these days."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "So it's important because you have the plasma but also those high energy electrons are hot and if you have a lot of those that are going into the walls you do have to care about the temperature."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "So I'm having trouble remembering off the top of my head."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "I think they're at like a hundred electron volts in terms of the electron energy and then I'd have to remember how to convert that into Kelvin."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "Can you stick your hand in it?"}, {"time": 1562, "text": "Not move the temperature."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Not recommended, yeah."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "So what's a colloid engine?"}, {"time": 1567, "text": "So the same rocket people that came up with these ideas for electric propulsion probably in the middle of last century also realized that there's one more place to get charged particles from if you're going to be using electric propulsion."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "So you can take a gas and you can ionize it but there are also some liquids particularly ionic liquids which is what we use that you also can use as a source of ions and if you have ions and you put them in a field you generate a force."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "So they recognize that but part of being able to leverage that technique is being able to kind of manipulate those liquids on a scale of nanometers or very few microns."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "So the diameter of a human hair or something like that and in the 50s there was no way to do that."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So they wrote about it in some books and then it kind of died for a little bit and then with silicon mems, computer processors and when foundry started becoming more ubiquitous and my advisor started at MIT kind of put those ideas back together and was like, hey actually there's now a way to build this and bring this other technique to life."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "And so the way that you actually get the ions out of those liquids is you put the liquid in again a strong electric field and the electric field stresses the liquid and you keep increasing the field and eventually the liquid will assume a conical shape."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "It's when the electric field pressure that's pulling on it exactly balances the liquid's own restoring force which is its surface tension."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "So the field becomes strong enough there that you can pull ions out of the liquid."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "What is the liquid?"}, {"time": 1731, "text": "We're talking about, there's a bunch of different ones."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "You can do it with different types of liquids."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "It depends on how easily you can free ions from their neighbors and if it has enough surface tension so that you can build up a high enough electric field but what we use are called ionic liquids and they're really just positive."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "They're very similar to salts but they happen to be liquid over a really wide range of temperatures."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "This sounds like really cool."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "Okay, so how big is the cone we're talking about?"}, {"time": 1765, "text": "What's the size of this cone that generates the ions?"}, {"time": 1767, "text": "So if you have a cone that's emitting pure ions, I can't remember if it's the radius or diameter but that emission is happening from, of that cone is something like 20 nanometers."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "Oh, I was imagining something slightly bigger but so like this is tiny, tiny."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "Hence the only being able to do it recently."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "So this is all controlled by a computer, I guess."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "Like, or like, how do you create a cone that generates ions at a scale of nanometers exactly?"}, {"time": 1804, "text": "So the kind of main trick to making this work is that physically we manufacture hundreds or thousands of sharp structures and then supply the liquid to the tips."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "So that does a few things."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "It makes sure that we know where the ion beams are forming."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "So we can put holes in the grid above them to let them actually leave instead of hitting, right?"}, {"time": 1829, "text": "But it also reduces the actual field we have, the voltage we have to apply to create that field because the field will be much stronger if we can already give the liquid a tip to form on."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "And those tips we form have radii of curvature on the order of probably like single microns."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "So we are working at a little bit larger scale but once we create that support and the electric field can be focused at that tip, then the tiny little cone can form on top of that."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "So wait, so there's something in them, there's already like a hard material that like gives you the base for the cone and then you're pouring like liquid over it, whatever the heck."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "From the bottom, yeah."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "It's porous, so we actually supply it from the back of the chip and then it wicks."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "And then liquid forms on top on that structure."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "And then you somehow make it like super sharp, the liquid, so the ions can leave."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And then we've applied that field to get those ions and that same field then accelerates them."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "And there's like a bunch of these?"}, {"time": 1893, "text": "Yeah, I should have brought something."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "So we... You could just pretend that you have some nanometer cones on a table here."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "So actually, you know, kind of about this scale, we build, we call them thruster chips and it's just a convenient form factor and it's a square centimeter."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "And on each square centimeter today, we have about 500 of the actual physical, we call them emitters, those physical cones."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "And we're working on increasing that by a factor of four in the coming months."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "In size or in the density?"}, {"time": 1927, "text": "In number, in the density, the number of emitters within the same square centimeter chip."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "So that thing, cause I think I've seen pictures of you with like a tiny thing in your hand."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "That must be the..."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "Okay, so that's an engine."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "So that is kind of the ionization chamber and thrust producing part of it."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "What's not shown, you know, in that picture is the propellant tank."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "So we can keep supplying more and more of the liquid to those emission sites."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "And then we also provide a power electronic system that talks to the spacecraft and turns our device on and off."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "So that's the colloid engine."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "That's the core of the colloid engine."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "It's, the way I've been talking about it, it's more of ion electrospray colloid tends to mean like liquid droplets coming off of the jet."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "But if you make smaller and smaller cones, you get pure ions."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "So we're kind of like a subset of colloid, yes."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "What aspects of this, you said that it's been full of mysteries from the physics perspective."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "What aspects of this are understood and what are still full of mystery?"}, {"time": 1999, "text": "Yeah, recently we've been understanding the kind of instabilities and stable regimes of, you know, how much liquid do you supply and what field do you apply?"}, {"time": 2014, "text": "And why is it flickering on and off?"}, {"time": 2017, "text": "Or why does it have these weird behaviors?"}, {"time": 2019, "text": "So that's, in the past just couple of years, that's become much more understood."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "I think the two areas that come to mind as far as not as well understood are the boundary between, you know, you have, we actually use kind of big molecular ions."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "And if you're looking at the molecular scale, you have, you know, some ions that you've extracted and they're in this electric field."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "One ion, you know, it's a big molecule, it's getting energy from the electric field."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "And some of that energy is going into the bonds and making it vibrate and doing weird things to it."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "Sometimes it breaks them apart."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "And then zooming out to the whole beam, the beam has some behaviors as this beam of ions."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "And there's a big gap between what are those, how do you connect those?"}, {"time": 2080, "text": "And how do we understand that better so that we can understand the beam performance of the engine?"}, {"time": 2085, "text": "Is that a theory question or is it an engineering question?"}, {"time": 2088, "text": "Theory, definitely."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "We're, Axion is a startup and we're more in the business of building and testing and observing and characterizing."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "And we're not really diving much into that theory right now."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "Okay, zooming out a little bit on the physics, apologize for the way too big of a question, but to you from either, you mentioned Axion is, you know, more of sort of an engineering endeavor, right?"}, {"time": 2116, "text": "But from a perspective of physics in general, science in general, or the side of engineering, what do you think is the most, to you, like beautiful and captivating and inspiring idea in this space?"}, {"time": 2130, "text": "In this space, and then I'm gonna zoom out a little bit more, but in this space, I keep butting up against material science questions."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "So I, over the past 10 years, I feel like every problem or interesting thing I want to work on, if you dig deep enough, you end up in material science land, which I find kind of exciting and it makes me want to dig in more there."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "And I was just, you know, even for our technology, when we have to move the propellant from the tank to the tip of the emitters, we rely a lot on capillary action and you're getting into wetting and surface energies."}, {"time": 2175, "text": "At a scale of like nano scale."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it's, if you look further, it's quantum too, but it all is, you know, a capillary action at the quantum level."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "Yeah, so I would, it all comes back to me to, you know, material science, there's so much we don't understand at these sizes and I find that inspiring and exciting."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "Yeah, the patterns that mathematics reveals seems to echo in a bunch of different places."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "Yeah, there's just weirdness."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "It's like, it really makes you think, I think you're definitely living in a simulation, like whoever programmed it."}, {"time": 2249, "text": "I like that that's your conclusion."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "Is using like shortcuts to program it, like they didn't, they're just copying and pasting some codes for the different parts."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "Yeah, think of something new or just paste from over there."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "They won't notice."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "My conclusion from that was I'm gonna go interview for a finance job, so I had like a little detour."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "That's the backup option."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "So in terms of using call it engines, what's an interesting difference between a propulsion of a rocket from earth when you're standing on the ground to orbit and then the kind of propulsion necessary for once you get out to orbit or to like deep space to move around."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "Yes, the reason you can't use an engine like mine to get off the ground is, the thrust it generates is instantaneous thrust is very small, but if you have the time and can accumulate that acceleration, you can still reach speeds that are very interesting for exploration and even for missions with humans on them."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "An interesting direction I think we need to go as humans exploring space is the power supplies for electric propulsion are limiting us in that solar panels are really inefficient and bulky and batteries."}, {"time": 2341, "text": "I don't know when anybody's ever gonna improve battery technology."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "I know a lot of people that work on that."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "And nuclear power, we could have a lot more powerful electric propulsion system."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "So they would be extremely fuel efficient, but more instantaneous thrust to do more interesting missions if we could start launching more nuclear systems."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "So like something that's powered, nuclear powered, that's the right way to say it."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "But is in a small enough container that could be launched?"}, {"time": 2376, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, as a world we do launch spacecraft with nuclear power systems on board, but size is one consideration."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "It hasn't been a big focus."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "So the reactors and the heaters and everything are bulky."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "And so they're really only suitable for some of the much bigger interplanetary stuff."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "So that's one issue, but then it's a whole like rat's nest of political stuff as well."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "I heard, I think Elon described or somebody, I think it was Elon that described the EV to all like electrical, vertical takeoff and landing vehicles."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "So basically saying rockets, obviously Elon is interested in electric vehicles, right?"}, {"time": 2422, "text": "But he said that rockets can't, in the near term, it doesn't make sense for them to be electrical."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "What, do you see a world with the rockets that we use to get into orbit are also electric based?"}, {"time": 2439, "text": "It's possible, you can produce the thrust levels you need, but you need this, a much bigger power supply."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "And I think that would be nuclear."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "And the only way people have been able to launch them at all is that they're in a 100 times redundancy safe mode while they're being launched and they're not turned on until they're farther off."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "So if you were to actually try to use it on launch, I think a lot of people would still have an issue with that, but someday."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "It's an interesting concept, nuclear."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "It seems like people, like everybody that works on nuclear power has shown how safe it is as a source of energy."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "And yet we are, seem to be, I mean, based on the history, based on the excellent HBO series, I'm Russian with a Chernobyl."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "It seems like we have our risk estimation about this particular power source is drastically inaccurate, but that's a fascinating idea that we would use nuclear as a source for our vehicles and not just in outer space."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "I'm gonna have to look into that."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "That's super interesting."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "Well, just last year, Trump eased up a little bit on the regulations and NASA and hopefully others are starting to pick up on the development."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "So now is a good time to look into it because there's actually some movement."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "Is that a hope for you to explore different energy sources that the entirety of the vehicle uses something like the entirety of the propulsion systems for all aspects of the vehicle's life travel is the same or electric?"}, {"time": 2539, "text": "Is it possible for it to be the same?"}, {"time": 2540, "text": "Like the colloid engine being used for everything?"}, {"time": 2544, "text": "You could, and you would have to do it in the same way we do different stages of rockets now where once you've used up an engine or a stage, you let it go because there's really no point in holding onto it."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "So I wouldn't necessarily want to use the same engine for the whole thing, but the same technology I think would be interesting."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "Okay, so it's possible."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "All right, but in terms of."}, {"time": 2567, "text": "Yeah, it comes down to the power source."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "The power source, that's really interesting."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "But for the current power sources and its current use cases, what's the use case for electric, like the colloid engine?"}, {"time": 2578, "text": "Can you talk about where they're used today?"}, {"time": 2581, "text": "Sure, so chemical engines are still used quite a bit once you're in orbit, but that's also where you might choose instead to use an electric system and what people do with them."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "And this includes the ion engines and hall thrusters and our engine is basically any maneuvering you need to do once you're dropped off."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "Even if your only goal was to just stay in your orbit and not move for the life of your mission, you need propulsion to accomplish that because the Earth's gravity field changes as you go around in orbit and pulls you out of your little box."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "There are other perturbations that can throw you off a bit."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "And then most people want to do things a little bit more interesting like maneuver to avoid being hit by space debris or perhaps lower their orbit to take a higher resolution image of something and then return."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "At the end of your mission, you're supposed to responsibly get rid of your satellite, whether that's burning it up, but if you're in geo, you want to push it higher into graveyard orbit."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "What's geo and what's graveyard?"}, {"time": 2659, "text": "So low Earth orbit and then geosynchronous orbit or geostationary orbit."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "And there's a graveyard?"}, {"time": 2664, "text": "Yeah, so those satellites are at like 40,000 kilometers."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "So if they were to try to push their satellites back down to burn up in the atmosphere, they would need even more propulsion than they've had for the whole lifetime of their mission."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "So instead they push them higher where it'll take a million years for it to naturally deorbit."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "So we're also cluttering that higher bit up as well, but it's not as pressing as Leo, which is low Earth orbit where more of these commercial missions are going now."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "Well, so how hard is the collision avoidance problem there?"}, {"time": 2699, "text": "You said some debris and stuff."}, {"time": 2700, "text": "So like how much propulsion is needed?"}, {"time": 2703, "text": "Like how much is the life of a satellite is just like a crap trying to avoid like little things down there?"}, {"time": 2709, "text": "I think one of the recent rules of thumb I heard was per year some of these small satellites are doing like three collision avoidance maneuvers."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "So that's not, yeah, but it's not zero."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "And it takes a lot of planning and people on the ground and none of that really, I don't think right now is autonomous."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "Oh, that's not good."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Yeah, and then we have a lot of folks taking advantage of Moore's law and cheaper spacecraft."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "So they're launching them up without the ability to maneuver themselves."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "And they're like, well, I don't know, just don't hit me."}, {"time": 2749, "text": "And three times a year that could become affordable if it gets hit, maybe it won't be damaged kind of thing, that kind of logic."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "Affordable in that instead of launching one satellite, they'll launch 20 small ones."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "Yeah, so if one gets taken out, that's okay."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "But the problem is that one good sized satellite getting hit, that's like a ballistic event that turns into 10,000 pieces of debris that then are the things that go and hit the other satellites."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "So do you see a world where, like in your sense, in your own work and just in the space industry in general, do you see the people moving towards bigger satellites or smaller satellites?"}, {"time": 2789, "text": "Is there going to be a mix?"}, {"time": 2791, "text": "Like what's, and what do we talk, what does it mean for a satellite to be big and small?"}, {"time": 2796, "text": "What size are we talking about?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "So big, the space industry prior to, I don't know, 1990, I guess the bulk of, the majority of satellites were the size of a school bus and cost a couple billion dollars."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "And now our first launches were on satellites the size of shoe boxes that were built by high school students."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "So that's a very different, to give you the two ends of the spectrum."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "So big satellites will, I think they're here to stay, at least as far as I can see into the future for things like broadcasting."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "You want to be able to broadcast to as many people as possible."}, {"time": 2845, "text": "You also can't just go to small satellites and say Moore's law for things like optics."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "So if you have an aperture on your satellite, that just, that doesn't follow Moore's law."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "That's different."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "So it's always going to be the size that it will be, unless there's some new physics that comes out that I'm not aware of."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "But if you need a resolution and you're at an altitude, that kind of sets your, the size of your telescope."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "But because of Moore's law, we are able to do a lot more with smaller packages."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "And with that comes more affordability and opening up access to space to more and more people."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "Well, what's the smallest satellite you've seen go up there?"}, {"time": 2886, "text": "Like what are the smallest kind of, you said shoe boxes."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "Yeah, so I think the smallest common form factor can fit a softball inside."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "So that's 10 centimeters on each side."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "But then there are some companies working on fractions of that even."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "And they're doing things like IOT type application."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "So it's very low bandwidth type things, but they're finding some niches for those."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "Do you mean like there's a business, there's a thing to do with them?"}, {"time": 2920, "text": "Yes, either."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "What do you do with a small satellite like that?"}, {"time": 2924, "text": "You can track a ship going across the ocean."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "Like if you need to, if you're just pinging something, you can handle that amount of data and those latencies and so on."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "You have to have propulsion on that."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "You have to have a little engine."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "No, those are just letting fall out of the sky."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "Okay, so what kind of satellite would you equip a colloid engine on?"}, {"time": 2948, "text": "Anything that's bigger than probably about 20 kilograms, anything that needs to stay up for more than a year or anything somebody spent more than like 100K to build are kind of the ways I would think about it."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "That's a lot of use cases."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "What's a small sat?"}, {"time": 2966, "text": "Like what category?"}, {"time": 2966, "text": "Small sat is actually very big."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "I think it's like 700 kilograms, or I keep hitting my microphone, maybe 1,000 kilograms down to 200 kilograms."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "People have their own kind of definitions of how they break them up, but small sat is still quite large."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "And then it's kind of also applied as a blanket term for anything that's not a school bus size satellite."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "So we need to get our jargon straight in the industry."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "So do you see a possible future where, you know, there's a few thousand satellites up there now, a couple of thousand of them functioning."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Do you see a future where there's like millions of satellites up in orbit?"}, {"time": 3009, "text": "Or forget millions, tens of thousands, which just seems like where the natural trajectory of the way things are going now is going."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "The two buckets of applications, one is imaging and the other is communication."}, {"time": 3030, "text": "So imaging, I think that will plateau because one satellite or one constellation can take an image or a video and sell it to, you know, infinity customers."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "But if you're providing communications like broadband internet or satellite cell or something like that, satellite phone, you know, you're limited by your transponders and so on."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "So to serve more people, you actually need more satellites and perhaps at the rate, you know, our data

chemical based, that's doing pretty well."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "And then the electric based is, are there types of propulsion that might sound like science fiction right now, but are actually within the reach of science in the next 10, 20, 30, 50 years that you kind of think about, or maybe even within the space of even just like, like even ION engines, is there like breakthroughs that might 10 X the thing, like really improve it?"}, {"time": 3347, "text": "So, you know, the real game changer would be propellantless propulsion."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "And so every couple of years you see a new, now a startup or a researcher comes up with some contraption for producing thrust that didn't require, you know, we've been talking about conservation of momentum, mass times velocity

with you."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "So not having to do that would be, you know, one of the ultimate game changers."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "And I, you know, unless there are new types of physics, I don't know how we do it, but it comes up often, so it's something I do think about."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "And, you know, the one, I think it's called the Casimir effect."}, {"time": 3404,

would be the power source?"}, {"time": 3432, "text": "Yeah, the most recent engine like this that was just debunked this year, I think, in March or something was called the M drive."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "And supposedly you used a power source, so, you know, batteries or solar panels to generate microwaves into this resonant cavity."}, {"time": 3452, "text": "And people claimed it produced thrust."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "So they went straight from this really loose concept to building a device and testing it."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "And they said, we've measured thrust and sure on their thrust balance, they saw thrust and different researchers built it and tested it and got the same measurements."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "And so it was looking actually pretty good."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "No one could explain how it worked, but what they said was that this inside the cavity, the microwaves themselves didn't change, but the speed of light changed inside the cavity."},

at NASA built the device, tested it, got the same thrust, then unhooked it, flipped it backwards and turned it on, but got the same thrust in the same direction again."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "And so they're like, this is just an interaction with the test setup or, you know, some of the chamber or something like that."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "So forwarded again, but, you know, it would be so wonderful for everybody if we could figure out how to do it, but I don't know."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "That's an interesting twist on it because that's more about efficient travel, long distance

3537, "text": "But still in terms of speed, in terms of trying to, so there's recently, already I think been debunked or close to being debunked, but the signal, a weird signal from our nearby

do you then get enough power when you're there to send a signal back."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "No part of that project is possible right now, but I think it's really exciting."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "But do you see like human, like a spacecraft with a human on it, so it's like a heavy one, being like us inventing new propulsion systems entirely."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "Like, do you ever see that on the radar of propulsion systems like that or are they completely out there in the impossible?"}, {"time": 3657, "text": "Well, we're going to quickly leave the realm of what I can describe with any credibility, but I think because of special relativity, if we try to accelerate some mass close to the speed of light, it becomes infinitely heavy and then we just don't, we'd have to like harness a lot of suns to do that."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "Or, you know, it's just that math doesn't quite work out, but, you know, in my child's, my childlike heart, I believe that, you

3729, "text": "So there's, we're like really confident, like physicists are really confident that we've like got most of the picture down, but it feels like, oh boy, it feels like that we might not even be getting started on some of the essential things that would allow us to engineer systems that would allow us to travel to space much, much faster."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "Yeah, and there's even things that are much more commonplace that we can't explain, but we've started to take for granted, like quantum tunneling, you know, just things like, oh, the electron was here with this energy and now it's here with this energy and it's just tunneling."}, {"time": 3775, "text": "But so, you know, we're missing a lot of the picture."}, {"time": 3778, "text": "So yeah, I don't know, to, you

build a rocket company from like a propulsion company from one person, from two people to 10 people plus, and actually, you know, take it to a successful product?"}, {"time": 3821, "text": "Yeah, well, I think the early stage is quite, I'm not supposed to use the word easy when you work in rocket science, but straightforward when you're working on something, you know, sexy, like an ion engine, it's more straightforward to raise money and get people to come work for you because the vision's really exciting."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "And actually that's something I would say is very important throughout, is a really exciting vision because when everything, you know, goes to crap, you need that to get people getting themselves out of bed in the morning and thinking of the higher purpose there."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "And, you know, another thing along the way that I think is key in building any company is the right early employees that also have their own networks and can bring in a lot of people that, you know, really make the whole greater than just the sum of the early team."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "How do you build that?"}, {"time": 3887, "text": "Like, how do you find people?"}, {"time": 3889, "text": "It's like asking, like, how do you make friends?"}, {"time": 3892, "text": "But is there, is it luck?"}, {"time": 3895, "text": "Is there a system?"}, {"time": 3897, "text": "Like how, in terms of the people you've connected with, the people you built the company with, is there some thread, some commonality, some pattern that you find to be, to hold for what makes a great team?"}, {"time": 3915, "text": "I think, you know, personally, a thread for me has been my network and being able to draw on that a lot, but also giving back to it as much as possible in like an unsolicited sort of way, like making connections between people that, you know, maybe didn't ask, but that I think could be really fruitful."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "And even, you know, weirder than that is just really getting, you know, having weird, uncomfortable conversations with people like at a conference and getting over the small talk quickly and getting to know them quickly and having a relationship that stands out and then being able to call on them later because of that."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "And I think that's been because I'm introverted and I, you know, want to poke my eyes out instead of go and do small talk."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "And so I huddle in a corner with one person and, you know, we talk about aliens or things like that."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "And so, you know, that's all to say that, you know, having a strong network, I think is really important, but a genuine one."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "And let's see, other ways to build a rocket company, kind of making sure you're paying attention to the sweeping trends of the industry so everybody just cares about cost and being able to get out ahead of that and even more than we ever thought we'd need to as far as what we needed to price our systems at."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "You know, people for, since the start of the US space industry, they've been paying 20, 25 million in adjusted dollars for an ion engine."}, {"time": 4018, "text": "And seeing that now people are going to want to pay 10K for an ion engine and just staying out ahead of that and those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4030, "text": "So, you know, being out in the industry and talking to as many people as possible."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "So there's a drive."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "I mean, I suppose SpaceX really pushed that."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "Frustrating for me."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "So SpaceX really pushed this, the application of, I guess, capitalism of driving the price down, of basically forcing people to ask the question, can this be done cheaper?"}, {"time": 4055, "text": "This can lead to like big problems, I would say, in the following sense."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "I see this in the car industry, for example, that people have, it's such a small margin for profit."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "Like they've driven the cost of everything down so much that there's literally no room for innovation for taking risks."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "So like cars, which is funny because not until Tesla, really, which is one of the, in a long, long time, one of the first successful new car companies that's constantly innovating, every other car company is really pouring in terms of their technological innovation."}, {"time": 4101, "text": "They innovate on design and style and so on, that people fall in love with the look and so on, but it's not really innovation."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "In terms of the technology in it, it's really boringly the same thing, and they're really afraid of taking risks."}, {"time": 4115, "text": "And that's a big problem for rocket space, too, is like if you're cutting out costs, you can't afford to innovate, to try out new things, and that's definitely true with ion engines, right?"}, {"time": 4131, "text": "So how do you compete in this space?"}, {"time": 4134, "text": "Do you, by the way, see SpaceX as a competitor?"}, {"time": 4137, "text": "And what do you say in general about the competition in this space?"}, {"time": 4141, "text": "Is it really difficult as a business to compete here?"}, {"time": 4145, "text": "No, I don't see SpaceX as a competitor, and I see them as one day, not too long from now, a customer, hopefully."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "I mean, to compete against that, I think you just have to do things in an unconventional way."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "So bringing silicon MEMS manufacturing to propulsion, NASA doesn't make ion engines using a batch mass producible technique."}, {"time": 4174, "text": "They have one guy that's been making their ion engines for 20 years bespoke pieces of jewelry."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "So bringing things to what you're trying to innovate to make them, in our case, more cost effective was really key."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "I like the idea of somebody putting out ion engines on like Etsy."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "Yeah, my advisor at MIT would, the thruster chip I was holding up, he would wear one as a lapel pin."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "But in general, just on the topic of SpaceX, 2020 has seen some difficult things for human civilization."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "And it's been a lot of, first of all, it's an election year, there's been a lot of drama and division about that."}, {"time": 4220,

for me at least, super positive things, inspiring things, which is SpaceX and NASA doing the first commercial human flight, launching humans to space and did it twice successfully."}, {"time": 4250,

space exploration?"}, {"time": 4265, "text": "Yeah, I did watch it."}, {"time": 4266, "text": "We played it outside on a big screen at our place."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "And I was a little, they kept saying Bob and Doug, Bob and Doug, and astronauts usually are treated with a little bit more fanfare."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "So it felt very casual, but maybe that was a good, a good thing,

coming and going all the time, splashing back down."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "And it's just so common now, but that's quite magical, I think."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "So yes, we did watch that."},

"text": "Probably pulled back at the right time for commercial things and getting that started."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "But I'm really happy that it's even possible to do that with private money and companies."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "Do you like the kind of the model of competition of NASA funding?"}, {"time": 4381, "text": "I guess that's how it works, is like they're providing quite a bit of money from the government and then private companies compete to be the delivery vehicles for whichever the government missions, like NASA missions."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "Yes, I think for this type of mission is a little bit kind of straddles commercial and science."}, {"time": 4405, "text": "So I think it's good, but I do in general feel like we've pulled back too much on NASA's role in the science and exploration part."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "And I think our pace is too slow there, for my liking, I suppose."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "Okay, so did you have, I mean, on the cost thing, do you feel like NASA was a little too bureaucratic in a sense, like too slow, too heavy cost wise in their effort, like when they were running things purely without any commercial involvement?"}, {"time": 4443, "text": "So I suppose it's more that I just want the government to fund."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "And maybe NASA's not the best organization to do it rapidly."}, {"time": 4455, "text": "But I think that, again, depending on the goals, we're just kind of at the very starting point of space exploration and science and understanding."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "So we should be spending more money there and not less."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "And other countries are starting to spend more and more, and I think we'll fall behind because of that."}, {"time": 4478, "text": "So you have quite a bit of experience, first of all, starting a company yourself, but also I saw, maybe you can correct me, but you have quite a bit of knowledge of just in general the startup experience of building companies that you've interacted with people."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "Is there advice that you can give to somebody, to a founder or cofounder who wants to launch and grow a new company and do something big and impactful in this world?"}, {"time": 4508, "text": "Yes, I would say, like I mentioned earlier, but make sure the vision is something that will get you out of bed in the morning and that you can rally other people around you to achieve."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "Because I see a lot of folks that sort of cared about something or saw a window of opportunity to do something, and startups are hard, and more often than not, just being opportunistic isn't going to be enough to make it through all the really crappy things that are going to happen."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "So the vision just helps you psychologically to carry through the hardships, for you and the team."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "Yeah, you and the team, yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "So being able to think deeply, yeah."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "Yeah, have you been surprised about how much pivoting is involved, basically rethinking what you thought initially would be the right direction to go?"}, {"time": 4604, "text": "Or is there, if you think deeply enough, that you can stick in the same direction for long enough?"}, {"time": 4610,

build a first product that's well suited to maybe a smaller, less exciting segment of the market, or do you stay head down and focus on the big swing and trying to hit it out of the park right away?"}, {"time": 4645, "text": "And we've flip flopped between that, and there's not a blanket answer, and there are a lot of factors, but that's a hard one."}, {"time": 4694, "text": "And I think that it's starting to change, but just to be aware of it from the beginning is important."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "Right, I guess it should be part of the vision of what kind of place you want to

writing programs, but that's my particular brain, software engineer."}, {"time": 492, "text": "So like you can do all these kinds of visualizations and then there's the tools of visualization, like color, all of those kinds of things that you're absolutely right."}, {"time": 504, "text": "They're actually not taught very much."}, {"time": 507, "text": "Like the art of visualization."}, {"time": 508, "text": "Not taught."}, {"time": 510, "text": "And we love as well color coding."}, {"time": 513, "text": "Like when you represent something mathematically, you can show color to show the growth and kind of code that."}, {"time": 521, "text": "So if I have an algebraic expression for a pattern, maybe I show the X with a certain color, but also write in that color so you can see the relationship."}, {"time": 532, "text": "And yeah, particularly in our work with elementary teachers, many of them come to our workshops and they're literally in tears when they see things making sense visually because they've spent their whole lives not realizing you can really understand things with these visuals."}, {"time": 550, "text": "It's quite powerful."}, {"time": 552, "text": "You say that there's something valuable to learning when the thing that you're doing is challenging, is difficult."}, {"time": 561, "text": "So a lot of people say math is hard or math is too hard or too hard for me."}, {"time": 568, "text": "Do you think math should be easy or should it be hard?"}, {"time": 573, "text": "I think it's great when things are challenging, but there's something that's really key to being able to deal with challenging maths and that is knowing that you can do it."}, {"time": 586, "text": "And I think the problem in education is a lot of people have got this idea that you're either born with a maths brain or you're not."}, {"time": 594, "text": "So when they start to struggle, they think, oh, I don't have that maths brain."}, {"time": 598, "text": "And then they will literally sort of switch off in their brain and things will go downhill from that point."}, {"time": 604, "text": "So struggle becomes a lot easier and you're able to struggle if you don't have that idea, but you know that you can do it."}, {"time": 613, "text": "You have to go through this struggle to get there, but you're able to do that."}, {"time": 618, "text": "And so we're hampered in being able to struggle with these ideas we've been given about what we can do."}, {"time": 625, "text": "Can I ask a difficult question here?"}, {"time": 627, "text": "So there's kind of, I don't know what the right term is, but some people struggle with learning in different ways, like their brain is constructed in different ways."}, {"time": 642, "text": "And how much should, as educators, should we make room for that?"}, {"time": 649, "text": "So how do you know the difference between this is hard and I don't like doing hard things versus my brain is wired in a way where I need to learn in very different ways."}, {"time": 659, "text": "I can't learn it this way."}, {"time": 660, "text": "How do you find that line?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "How do you operate in that gray area?"}, {"time": 664, "text": "So this is why being a teacher is so hard and people really don't appreciate how difficult teaching is when you're faced with, I don't know, 30 students who think in different ways."}, {"time": 674, "text": "So, but this is also why I believe it's so important to have this multi dimensional approach to maths."}, {"time": 681, "text": "We've really offered it in one way, which is here's some numbers in a method."}, {"time": 687, "text": "You follow me, do what I just did and then reproduce it."}, {"time": 691, "text": "And so there are some kids who like doing that and they do well."}, {"time": 694, "text": "And a lot of kids who don't like doing it and don't do well."}, {"time": 699, "text": "But when you open up maths and you give, you let kids experience it in different ways, maybe visually with numbers, with words."}, {"time": 707, "text": "What happens is kids, there are many more kids who can access it."}, {"time": 712, "text": "So those different brain wirings you're talking about, where some people are just more able to do something in a particular way."}, {"time": 720, "text": "That's why we want to, that's one of the reasons we want to open it up so that there are different ways of accessing it."}, {"time": 728, "text": "And then that's not really a problem."}, {"time": 731, "text": "So I grew up in the Soviet Union and fell in love with math early."}, {"time": 737, "text": "I was forced into math early and fell in love through force."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Well, good that you fell in love about the force."}, {"time": 745, "text": "Well, but something we talked about a little bit is there is such a value for excellence."}, {"time": 753, "text": "It's competitive and it's also everybody kind of looks up the definition of success is being in a particular class is being really good at it."}, {"time": 767, "text": "And like, it's not improving."}, {"time": 769, "text": "It's like being really good."}, {"time": 770, "text": "I mean, we are much more like that with sports, for example."}, {"time": 773, "text": "We're not, it's like, it's understood, you're going to star on the basketball team if you're gonna start on the basketball team if you're going to be better than the other guys, the other girls on the team."}, {"time": 786, "text": "So that coupled with the belief, this could be partially a communist belief, I don't know, but the belief that everybody is capable of being great."}, {"time": 799, "text": "But if you're not great, that's your fault and you need to work harder."}, {"time": 803, "text": "And I remember I had a sense that probably delusional, but I could win a Nobel prize."}, {"time": 809, "text": "I don't even know what that entails."}, {"time": 811, "text": "But I thought, like my dad early on told me just offhand and it always stuck with me that if you can figure out how to build a time machine, how to travel back in time, it will probably give you a Nobel prize."}, {"time": 828, "text": "And I remember early in my life thinking I'm going to invent the time machine."}, {"time": 832, "text": "And like the tools of mathematics were in service of that dream of winning the Nobel prize."}, {"time": 840, "text": "It's silly."}, {"time": 840, "text": "I didn't really think in those concrete terms, but I just thought I could be great at feeling."}, {"time": 846, "text": "And then when you struggle, the belief that you could be great is like, struggle is good."}, {"time": 852, "text": "Right, pushes you on, yeah."}, {"time": 854, "text": "And so the other thing about the Soviet system that I'd love to hear your comments about is just the sheer like hours of math."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Like the number of courses, you're talking about a lot of geometry, a lot more geometry."}, {"time": 869, "text": "I think in the American system, you take maybe one year of geometry."}, {"time": 873, "text": "In high school, yeah."}, {"time": 873, "text": "In high school."},

remember just being nailed over and over with geometry."}, {"time": 883, "text": "It was just nonstop."}, {"time": 885, "text": "And then of course there's different perspectives on calculus and just the whole, the sense was that math is like fundamental to the development of the human mind."}, {"time": 898, "text": "So math, but also science and literature, by the way, was also hit very hard."},

"Do you think, do you find that interesting?"}, {"time": 926, "text": "Because it seems to have been successful."}, {"time": 928, "text": "Yeah, I think that's very interesting."}, {"time": 930, "text": "And there is a lot of success, people coming through the Soviet system."}, {"time": 934, "text": "I think something that's very different to the US and other countries in the world is that idea that excellence is important and you can get there if you work hard."}, {"time": 944, "text": "In the US, there's an idea that excellence is important, but then kids are given the idea in many ways that you can either do it or you're one of the people who can't."}, {"time": 956, "text": "So many students in the school system think they're one of the kids who can't."}, {"time": 959, "text": "So there's no point in trying hard because you're never going to get there."}, {"time": 964, "text": "So if you can switch that idea, it would be huge."}, {"time": 969, "text": "And it seems from what you've said that in the Soviet Union, that idea is really different."}, {"time": 976, "text": "Now, the downside of that idea that anybody can get there if you work hard is that thought that if

that change."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "As to doing lots of maths, if maths was interesting and open and creative and multi dimensional, I would be all for it."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "We actually run summer camps at Stanford where we invite kids in and we give them this maths that I love."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "And in our camp classrooms, they were three hours long."}, {"time": 1025,

like that, then I think having more of it would be a really good thing."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "So what age are you talking about?"}, {"time": 1050, "text": "Is there, could you comment on what age is like the most important when people quit math or give up on themselves or on math in general?"}, {"time": 1062, "text": "And perhaps that age or something earlier is really an important moment for them to discover, to be inspired to discover the magic of math."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "I think a lot of kids start to give up on themselves and maths around from about fifth grade."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "And then those middle school years are really important."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "And fifth grade can be pivotal for kids just because they're allowed to explore and think in good

the subject, but do you think teachers should almost do like one on one, you know, little Johnny, I believe in you kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1141, "text": "Like that energy of like."}, {"time": 1143,

many people think of maths in this way as a subject of like a few big ideas and really important connections between them."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "So you could think of it as like a network map of ideas and connections."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "And what standards do is they take that beautiful map and they chop it up like this into lots of little pieces and they deliver the pieces to schools."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And so teachers don't see the connections between ideas, nor do the kids."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "So anyway, this is a bit of a long way of saying that what we've done in this new initiative is we have set out maths as a set of big ideas and connections between them."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "So this is grade three."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "So instead of there being 60 standards, we've said, well, you can pull these different standards to get in with each other and also value the ways these are connected."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "And by the way, for people who are just listening, we're looking at a small number of like big concepts within mathematics, square towels, measuring fraction, shape and time, and then how they're interconnected."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "And so the goal, this is for grade three, for example."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "Yeah, and so we've set out for the state of California, the whole of mathematics K10 as a set of big ideas and connections."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "So we know that teachers, it works really well if they say, okay, so a big idea in my grade is measuring."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "And instead of reading five procedural statements that involve measuring, they think, okay, measuring is a big idea."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "What rich, deep activity can I use that teaches measuring to kids?"}, {"time": 1947, "text": "And as kids work on these deep, rich activities, maybe over a few days, turns out a lot of maths comes into it."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So we're recommending that let's not teach maths according to all these multiple statements and lots and lots of short questions."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Instead, let's teach maths by thinking about what are the big ideas and what are really rich, deep activities that teach those big ideas."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "So that's the, like how you teach it and maximize learning."}, {"time": 1977, "text": "What about like from a school district perspective, like measuring how well you're doing, grades and tests and stuff like that."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "Do you throw those out or is it possible?"}, {"time": 1988, "text": "I am not a fan of grades and tests myself."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "I think grades are fine if they're used at the end of a course."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "So at the end of my maths course, I might get a grade because a grade is meant to be a summative measure."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "It kind of describes your summative achievement."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "But the problem we have in maths classrooms across the US is people use grades all the time, every week or every day even."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "My own kids, when they went through high school, technology has not helped with this."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "When they went through high school, they knew they were being graded for everything they did, everything."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And not only were they being graded for everything, but they could see it in the grade book online and it would alter every class they went into."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "So this is the ultimate, what I think of as a performance culture."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "You're there to perform, somebody's measuring you, you see your score."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "So I think that's not conducive for deep learning."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "And yes, have a grade at the end of the year, but during the year, you can assess kids in much better ways."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "Like teachers can, a great way of assessing kids is to give them a rubric that kind of outlines what they're learning over the course of a unit or a few weeks."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "So kids can actually see the journey they're on, like this is what we're doing mathematically."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "Sometimes they self assess on those units and then teachers will show what the kids can do with a rubric and also write notes."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "Like in the next few weeks, you might like to learn to do this."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "So instead of kids just thinking about, I'm an A kid or a B kid, or I have this letter attached to me, they're actually seeing mathematically what's important and they're involved in the process of knowing where they are mathematically."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "At the end of the year, sure, they can have a grade, but during the year, they get these much more informative measures."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "I do think this might be more for college, but maybe not."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "Some of the best classes I've had is when I got a special like set aside, like the professor clearly saw that I was interested in some aspect of a thing."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "And then I have a few in mind and one in particular, when he said that he kind of challenged me."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "So this is outside of grades and all that kind of stuff that basically it's like reverse psychology."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "I don't think this can be done."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And so I gave everything to do that particular thing."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "So this happened to be in an artificial intelligence class."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "But I think that like special treatment of taking students who are especially like excellent at a particular little aspect, that you see their eyes light up."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "I often think like maybe it's tempting for a teacher to think you've already succeeded there, but they're actually signaling to you that like you could really launch them on their way."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "And I don't know, that's too much to expect from teachers I think to pay attention to all of that because it's really difficult."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "But I just kind of remember who are the biggest, the most important people in the history of my life of education."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And it's those people that who really didn't just like inspire me with their awesomeness, which they did, but also just they pushed me a little."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "Like they gave me a little push."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "And that requires focusing on the quote unquote excellent students in the class."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "Yeah, I think what's important though is teachers to have the perspective that they don't know who's gonna be excellent at something before they give out the activity."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "And in our camp classes that we ran, sometimes students would finish ahead of other students."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "And we would say to them, can you write a question that's like this but different?"}, {"time": 2239, "text": "Oh, and over time we encourage them to like extend things further."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "I remember we were doing one activity where kids were working out the borders of a square and how big this border would be in different case sizes."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "And one of the boys came up at the end of the class and said, I've been thinking about how you do this to the Pentagon."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "And I said, that's fantastic."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "How do you, what does it look like with Pentagon?"}, {"time": 2264, "text": "Go find out, see if you can discover."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "So I didn't know he was gonna come up and say that."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "And I didn't have in my head like this is the kid who could have this extension task, but you can still do that as a teacher."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "When kids get excited about something or they're doing well in something, have them extend it, go further."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "And then you also, like this is like teacher and coach, you could say it in different ways to different students."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "Like for me, the right thing to say is almost to say, I don't think you could do this, this is too hard."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "Like that's what I need to hear."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "It's just like, no, there's immediate push."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "But with some people, if they're a little bit more, I mean, it's all has to do with upbringing, how your genetics is."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "They might be much more, that might break them."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "Yeah, that might break them."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And so you have to be also sensitive to that."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "I mean, teaching is really difficult for this very reason."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "So what is the best way to teach math, to learn math at those early few days when you just wanna capture them?"}, {"time": 2333, "text": "I do something, actually there's a video of me doing this on our website that I love when I first meet students."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "And this is what I do."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "I show them a picture, this is the picture I show them."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "And it's a picture of seven dots like this."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "And I show it for just a few seconds and I say to them, I'd like you to tell me how many dots there are, but I don't want you to count them."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "I want you to group the dots."}, {"time": 2360, "text": "And I show it them and then I take it away before they've even had enough time to count them."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "And then I ask them, so how did you see it?"}, {"time": 2369, "text": "And I go around the room and amazingly enough, there's probably 18 different ways of seeing these seven dots."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "And so I ask people, tell me how you grouped it."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "And some people see it as like an outside hole with a center dot."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "Some people see like stripes of lines."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "Some people see segments."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "And I collect them all and I put them on the board."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "And at the end I say, look at this, we are a class of 30 kids and we saw these seven dots in 18 different ways."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "There's actually a mathematical term for this."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "It's called groupitizing."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Groupitizing?"}, {"time": 2407, "text": "So turns out though that how well you groupitize predicts how well you do in maths."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "Is it a raw talent or is it just something that you can develop?"}, {"time": 2419, "text": "I don't think it's raw."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "I don't think you're born groupitizing, I think, but some kids have developed that ability if you like."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "And you can learn it."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "So this to me is part of how wrong we have maths."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "That we think to tell whether a kid's good at maths, we're gonna give them a speed test on multiples."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "But actually seeing how kids group dots could be a more important assessment of how well they're gonna do in maths."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "Anyway, I diverge."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "What I like to do though when I start off with kids is show them I'm gonna give you maths problems."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "I'm gonna value the different ways you see them."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "And it turns out you can do this kind of problem asking people how they group dots with young children or with graduate students."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "And it's engaging for all of them."}, {"time": 2470, "text": "You talk about creativity a little bit and flexibility in your book Limitless."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "What's the role of that?"}, {"time": 2476, "text": "So it sounds like there's a bit of that kind of thing involved in groupitizing."}, {"time": 2485, "text": "So what would you say is the role of creativity and flexibility in the learning of maths?"}, {"time": 2491, "text": "I think what we know now is that what we need for this 21st century world we live in is a flexible mind."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "School should not really be about teaching kids particular methods but teaching them to approach problems with flexibility."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "Being creative, thinking creatively is really important."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "So people don't think the words maths and creativity come together, but that's what I love about maths is the creative different ways you can see it."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "And so helping our kids, there's a book I like a lot by physicists, you probably know this book called Elastic."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "You might know it."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "And it's about how we want elastic minds."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "Same kind of thing, flexible, creative minds."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "And schools do very little on developing that kind of mind."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "They do a lot of developing the kind of mind that a computer now does for us."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "Memorization."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "Memorization, doing procedures, a lot of things that we spend a lot of time in school on."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "In the world, when kids leave school, a computer will do that and better than they will."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "But that creative, flexible thinking, we're kind of at ground zero at computers being able to engage in that thinking."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Maybe we're a little above ground zero, but the human brain is perfectly suited for that creative, flexible thinking."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "That's what humans are so great at."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "So I would like the balance to shift in schools."}, {"time": 2592, "text": "Maybe you still need to do some procedural kind of thinking, but there should be a lot more of that creative, flexible thinking."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And what's the role of other humans in this picture?"}, {"time": 2604, "text": "So collaborative learning, so brainstorming together."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "So creativity as it emerges from the collective intelligence of multiple humans."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "Yeah, super important."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "And we know that also helps develop your brain, that social side of thinking."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "And I love mathematics collaboration where people build on each other's ideas and they come up with amazing things."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "I actually taught a hundred students calculus at Stanford recently, undergrads, and we taught them to collaborate."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "So these students came in Stanford and most of them were against collaboration in math."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "This is before COVID in person?"}, {"time": 2646, "text": "Yeah, it was just before COVID hit."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "It was 2019."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "And this summer."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "So you said they're against?"}, {"time": 2653, "text": "Yeah, so it's really interesting."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "So they'd only experienced maths individually in a kind of competitive individual way."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "And if they had experienced it as group work, it had been a bad experience."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "Like maybe they were the one who did it all and the others didn't do much."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "So they were kind of against collaboration."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "They didn't see any role for it in maths."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "And we taught them to collaborate and it was hard work because as well as the fact that they were kind of against collaboration, they came in with a lot of like social comparison thinking."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "So I'm in this room with other Stanford undergrads and they're better than me or..."}, {"time": 2693, "text": "So when we set them to work on a maths problem together, the first one was kind of a disaster because they put all like, they're better than me."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "They're faster than me."}, {"time": 2700, "text": "They came up with something I didn't come up with."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So we taught them to let go of that thinking and to work well together."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "And one of the things we did, we decided we wanted to do a pre and post test at the end of this teaching."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "It was only four weeks long, but we knew we didn't want to give them like a time test of individual work."}, {"time": 2719, "text": "So we gave them an applied problem to do at the beginning and we gave them to do in pairs together."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "And we gave each of them a different colored pen and said, work on this activity together and keep using that pen."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "So then we had all these pieces of student work."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "And what we saw was they just worked on separate parts of the paper."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "So there's a little like red pen section and a green pen section."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "And they didn't do that well on it."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "Even though it was a problem that middle or high school kids could do, but it was like a problem solving kind of problem."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "And then we gave them the same one to do at the end, gave them the same colors."}, {"time": 2756, "text": "And actually they had learned to collaborate."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "And not only were they collaborating the second time round, but that boosted their achievement."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "And the ones who collaborated did better on the problem."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "Collaboration is important, having people, and what was so eye opening for these undergrads and they talked about it in lovely ways was I learned to value other people's thinking on a problem."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "And I learned to value that other people saw it in different ways."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "And it was quite a big experience for them that they came out thinking, I can do maths with other people."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "People can see it differently."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "We can build on each other's ways of thinking."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "I got a chance to, I don't know if you know who Daniel Kahneman is, got a chance to interact with him."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "And like the first, cause he had a few, but one famous collaboration throughout his life with Tversky."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "And just like, you know, he hasn't met me before in person, but just the number of questions he was asking, just the curiosity."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "So I think one of the skills, the collaboration itself is a skill."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "And I remember my experience with him was like, okay, I get why you're so good at collaboration because he was just extremely good at listening and genuine curiosity about how the other person thinks about the world, sees the world."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "And then together he's, he pulled me in in that particular case."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "He doesn't know in particular, like that much about autonomous vehicles, but he kept like asking all of these questions."}, {"time": 2854, "text": "And then like 10 minutes in, we're together trying to solve the problem of autonomous driving."}, {"time": 2859, "text": "And like, and that, I mean, that's really fulfilling."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "That's really enriching."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "But it also in that moment made me realize it's kind of a skill."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "Cause you have to kind of put your ego aside, put your view of the world aside and try to learn how the other person sees it."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "And the other thing you have to put aside is this social comparison thinking."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "Like if you are sitting there thinking, wow, that was an amazing idea."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "He's so much better than I am."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "That's really gonna stop you taking on the value of that idea."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "And so there's a lot of that going on between these Stanford students when they came."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "And trying to help them let go of that."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "One of the things I've discovered just because being a little bit more in the public eye, how rewarding it is to celebrate others."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "And how much is going to actually pay off in the long term."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "So this kind of silo thinking of like, I want to prove to a small set of people around me that I'm really smart and do so by basically not celebrating how smart the other people are."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "That's actually maybe short term, it seems like a good strategy, but long term it's not."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "And I think if you practice at the student level and then at the career level, at every single stage, I think that's ultimately."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "I think that's a really good way of thinking about it."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "You mentioned textbooks and you didn't say it, maybe textbooks isn't the perfect way to teach mathematics, but I love textbooks."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "They're like pretty pictures and they smell nice and they open."}, {"time": 2959,

talking about basic, like high school, calculus, biology, chemistry, those are like, those are incredible."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "It's like Wikipedia, but with color and a nice little."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "You must've seen some good textbooks if they had pretty pictures and color."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I remember, I guess it was very, very standard, like AP calculus, AP biology, AP chemistry."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "I felt those were like some of the happiest days of my life in terms of learning was high school."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "Cause it was very easy,

mean, maybe I'm romanticizing the past, but I remember they weren't, they're pretty good."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "But so you think, what role do you think they play still?"}, {"time": 3042, "text":

mathematics, maths?"}, {"time": 3199, "text": "Why is it the plural?"}, {"time": 3201, "text": "Is it because of everything you're saying where it's a bunch of subdisciplines?"}, {"time": 3205,

dimensional lots of ways, but that's why it was called mathematics."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "And then it was shortened to maths."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "And then for some reason it was just math in the US."}, {"time": 3233, "text": "But to me, math has that more singular feel to it."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "And there's an expression here, which is do the math, which basically means do a calculation."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "That's what people mean by do the math."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "So I don't like that expression because no math could be anything doesn't have to be

emphasize the multi dimensional, like a variety of different subdisciplines, different approaches."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "Okay, but outside of the textbook, what do you see like broadly being

3339, "text": "I do think a lot of the MOOCs don't have great pedagogy."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "They're just a talking head."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "And you can actually engage people in more

something and there's a little bit more."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "Because I think if you have a half hour video, you just switch off and start doing other things."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "So the way Udacity did it is like five, 10 minute, like bit of teaching with some visual stuff perhaps."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "And then there's like a quiz almost."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "Then you

behind pay walls, they've written in really inaccessible ways."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "So people wouldn't want to read them or understand them."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "So this actually is a big problem."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "You have this whole industry of people finding out how to teach well, not sharing it with the people who are teaching."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "So that's why we made Ucubed."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "And instead of just putting articles up saying, here's some things to read about how to teach well, we translated what was coming from research into things that teacher could use."}, {"time": 3490, "text": "So lessons, there were videos to show kids and there were tips for parents."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "There were all sorts of things on the site."},

happens."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "And so it's been downloaded millions of times."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "Teachers use it every year."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "They start the school year with it."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "And what they tell us is it was amazing."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "The kids lights were on, they were excited, they loved it."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "And then the week finished and I opened my textbooks and the lights went out and they were not interested."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "Yeah, but getting that first inspiration is still powerful."}, {"time": 3544,

great things to put on the site."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "We haven't the capacity to produce these creative visual maths tasks for every year group for every day, but I would love to do that."},

could teach."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "I mean, we can do it."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "We actually, we went from the week of inspirational maths and we made K8 maths books with exactly that."},

3608, "text": "Here are rich, deep activities."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "They're not though what you can do every day for a year."}, {"time": 3616, "text": "So some teachers use them as a kind of supplement to their boring textbook."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And some people have said, okay, this is the year."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "This book tells us what the year is and then we'll supplement these big activities with."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "So they're being used and teachers really like them and are really happy about them."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "I just always want more."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "And I guess one of the things I would like for YouCubed, one of my personal goals is that every teacher of maths knows about YouCubed."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "At the moment, lots of teachers who come to us are really happy they found it but there's a lot of other teachers who don't know that it exists."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "I hope this helps."}, {"time":

role of the student outside the classroom?"}, {"time": 3673, "text": "Yeah, I think one thing we know is a lot of people when they review material, whether it's maths or anything else, don't do it in the best way."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "I think a problem a lot of people have is they read through maybe a teacher's explanation or a way of doing maths and it makes sense."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "And they think, oh yeah, I've got that."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "And they move on."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "But then it's not until you come to try and work on something and do a problem that you actually realize you didn't really understand it, just seemed to make sense."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "So I would say, this is also something that neuroscientists talk about, to keep giving yourself questions is a really good way to study."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "Rather than looking through lots of material, it's always like giving yourself lots of tests is a good way to actually deeply understand things and know what you do and you don't understand."}, {"time": 3727, "text": "So would the questions be in the form of the material you're reviewing is the answer to that question?"},

3742, "text": "I was kind of asking like, how is this extended and so on?"}, {"time": 3746, "text": "Yeah, that would be great."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "And it's a similar, I mean, a question I get asked a lot is about homework."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "What is a good thing for kids to do for homework?"}, {"time": 3754, "text": "And one of the recommendations I give is to not have kids just do lots of questions for homework, but to actually ask them to reflect on what they've learned."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "Like, what was the big idea you learned today?"}, {"time": 3769, "text": "Or what did you find difficult?"}, {"time": 3771, "text": "What did you struggle with?"}, {"time": 3773, "text": "What was something that was exciting?"}, {"time": 3778, "text": "Then kids go home and

are going through math questions, they're successful, they get them right, but they don't even really know what they're about."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "And a lot of kids go through many years of maths like that, doing lots of questions, but that really knowing what even the topic is or what it's about, what it's important for."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "So having students go back and think at the end of a day, what was the big idea from this maths lesson?"}, {"time": 3811, "text": "Why is it important?"}, {"time": 3813, "text": "Where would I find that in real life?"}, {"time": 3816,

through life never asking the bigger question, always those layers of why questions that kids ask when they're very young."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "We need to keep doing that."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "Like whatever the term is, you call first principles thinking, some people call it that, which is like, why are we doing it this way?"}, {"time": 3848, "text": "So one nice thing is to do that because there's usually a good answer."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "The reason we did it this way is because it works for this reason."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "But then if you want to do something totally novel, you'll say, well, we've been doing it this way because of historical reasons, but really this is not the best way to do it."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "There might be other ways."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "And that's how invention happens."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "And then you get, that's really useful in every aspect of life, like choosing your career, choosing your, I don't know, where you live, who your romantic partner is, like everything."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "Everything, yeah."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "And I think it probably starts doing that in math class."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "That would be good if we started doing that."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "I mean, I wonder, I probably didn't do very much of that for most of my education, asking why,

mean, one of the sad pieces of research data I think about is the questions kids ask in school goes down like in a linear progression from, in the early years, you can't stop kids asking those questions, but they learn not to ask the questions."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "I think you told somewhere about an early memory you had in your own education where you asked the question, or maybe that was an example you gave, but it was shut down."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "You've listened to something I said, yeah."}, {"time": 3972, "text": "I don't remember where it was, but it caught me."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "Yeah, I remember it really vividly."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "Or can you tell the memory?"}, {"time": 3979, "text": "Yeah, I was, it's funny, I can remember."}, {"time": 3981,

if you have any questions."}, {"time": 4004, "text": "So at one point I put my hand up and I said, I have a question, and he said something like, that's your question?"}, {"time": 4013, "text": "And I was like, oh, okay, I'm not asking any more questions in this class."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "And that hit hard in a way where you didn't wanna, the lesson you learn from that is I'm not gonna ask."}, {"time": 4022, "text": "Yeah, that was absolutely the last question I'm asking."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "And that was, yeah, he was the chair of the maths department."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "I remember that really well."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "So maybe because of that experience, one of the things we encourage when we teach kids is asking questions, and we value it when they ask questions and we put them up on walls and celebrate."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "It's funny because I wish there was a feedback signal because he probably, to put a positive spin on it, he probably didn't realize the negative impact he's had in that moment, right?"}, {"time": 4058, "text": "If he only knew, see, this is probably when you're more mature in grad school."}, {"time": 4064, "text":

"Yeah, it's an art, right, to do it, to write."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "And then you have to time it right because that kind of humor is probably better for when you're in grad school versus when you're in the early education."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "Well, and I guess kids or young people get whether somebody's doing it to be funny or, you know, I mean, this is why teaching is so hard."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "Even your tone can be impactful."}, {"time": 4115, "text": "It's so sad because for that particular human, the teacher, you just had a bad day, and one statement can have a profound negative impact."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "I know, sadly, that there's a lot of maths teachers who have that kind of approach, and I think they're suffering from the fact that they think people are math people, not math people, and that comes across in their teaching."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "But on the flip side, one positive statement."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "Keep them going."}, {"time": 4145, "text": "That is the flip side of that."}, {"time": 4147, "text": "And I myself had one teacher who was really amazing for me in maths, and she kept me in the subject."},

anyways, she was my teacher, and for the first time in my whole career in maths, she would give us problems and tell us to talk about them with each other."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "And so here I was sitting there at like 17, talking with friends about how to solve a math problem, and that was it."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "That was the change that she made, but it was profound for me because like those calculus students, I started to hear other people's ways of thinking and seeing it, and we would talk together and come up with solutions."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "And I was like, that was it."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "That changed maths for me."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "It wasn't some kind of personal interaction with her."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "It was more like she was the catalyst for that collaborative experience."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "I mean, yeah, the many ways teachers can inspire kids."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "I mean, sometimes it's a personal message, but it can be your teaching approach that changes maths for kids."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "You know, Cal Newport, he wrote a book called Deep Work, and he's a mathematician, a theoretical computer scientist, and he talks about the kind of the focus required to do that kind of work."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "Is there something you can comment on?"}, {"time": 4261, "text": "You know, we live in a world full of distractions."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "That seems like one of the elements that makes studying, and especially the studying of subjects that require thinking like maths does, difficult."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "Is there something from a student perspective, from a teacher perspective that encourages deep work that you can comment on?"}, {"time": 4281, "text": "Yeah, I think giving kids really inspiring deep problems, and we have some on our website, is a really important experience for them."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "Even if they only do it occasionally, but it's really important."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "They actually realise, I do, I give a problem out often when I'm working with teachers, and I say to them, all right, I'm gonna check in with you after an hour."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "And they're like, an hour?"}, {"time": 4311, "text": "They think it's shocking."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "And then they work on this problem, and after an hour, I say, okay, how are we doing?"}, {"time": 4317, "text": "They're like, an hour's gone by?"}, {"time": 4320, "text": "How is this possible?"}, {"time": 4322, "text": "And so everybody needs those like rich deep problems."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "Most kids go through their whole maths experience of however many years, never once working on a problem in that kind of deep way."}, {"time": 4336, "text": "So the undergrad class I teach at Stanford, we do that."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "We work on these deep problems every session."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "And the students come away going, okay, I never wanna go back to that maths relationship I had where it was just all about quick answers."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "I just don't wanna go back to that."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "And so we can all, all teachers can incorporate those problems in their classrooms."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "Maybe they don't do them every day, but they at least give kids some experience of being able to work slowly and deeply and to go to deeper places and not be told they've got five minutes to finish 20 questions."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "Well, part of it is also just the exercise of sitting there and maintaining focus for prolonged periods of time."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "That's not often, I mean, that's a skill."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "It's a skill that also could be discouraging."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "Like if you don't practice it, just sitting down for 10 minutes straight and maintaining deep focus could be exceptionally challenging."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "Like if you're really thinking about a problem and I think it's really important to realize that that's a skill that you can just like a muscle, you can build, you can start with five minutes and goes to 10 minutes to 30 and to an hour."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "And to be successful, I think in certain subjects like mathematics, you wanna be able to develop that skill."}, {"time": 4422,

long will you work on a maths problem before you give up and decide it's not possible to solve it?"}, {"time": 4442, "text": "And the result on average across the kids was two minutes."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "Yeah, that's a bad sign, but that was a powerful sign that they need to learn to not give up so quickly."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "Yeah, we mentioned offline because we've been talking so much about visualization, Grant Sanderson, Three Blue One Brown."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "So he's inspired millions of people with exactly the kind of way of thinking that you've been talking about."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "Yeah, I love his work."}, {"time": 4478, "text": "Converting sort of mathematical concepts into visual, like visually representing them, exploring them in ways that help you illuminate like the concepts."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "What do you think is the role of that?"}, {"time": 4495, "text": "So he uses mostly programmatic visualization."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "So it's the thing I mentioned where there's like animations created by writing computer programs."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "Like what do you think, how scalable is that approach?"}, {"time": 4508, "text": "But in general, what do you think about his approach?"}, {"time": 4510, "text": "I think it's amazing."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "I should work with him."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "I can share some of our visuals and he can make them in that amazing way."}, {"time": 4520, "text": "So part of his storytelling, part of it is creating the visuals and then weaving a story with those

goes into making an AR system that runs."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "So AR, an AR device, if it's really gonna do AR, needs to be running Slam in real time."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "And that alone is a big..."}, {"time": 4151, "text": "So for people who don't know, first of all, virtual reality is creating an almost fully artificial world and putting you inside it."}, {"time": 4161, "text":

real time, but in a way that creates a pleasant experience for the human perception system is, yeah, that's an engineering project."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "Yeah, well said, and it's just one of the things that the system has to do."}, {"time": 4207, "text": "It's also tracking your eyes so it knows what you're looking at, how far away what you're looking at is."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "It's performing all those functions, and it's got to keep doing that without burning up the CPU or depleting the battery unreasonably fast, and that's just table stakes."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "It's just the basic functions of the operating system, and then any content that you want to add has to sit on top of that."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "It's got to be rendered by the optics at a

was working on consumer facing content, there was a great team in Wellington, New Zealand that made a game called Dr. Groydbrod's Invaders that realized the potential of AR gaming in a way that I

podcasting for me talking, I have to finish my sentences."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "I have to actually finish making a point, which is a big problem because there's like a listener that needs to hear the point being finished as opposed to completing your sentences inside your own mind."}, {"time": 5999, "text": "And like the thing I find is useful to Elon does exact same thing is when the line of

they come off much worse than my personal appraisal of them."}, {"time": 6112, "text": "So it's kind of interesting as a writer when you're watching it, I guess, kind of like an attorney, right?"},

writing for a president, this is no joke, especially for a president who's the great communicator, Reagan."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "So, and you have to be very inspirational, but also not come off as corny, which is very hard to do."}, {"time": 6188, "text": "And she in the book talks about how she wrote speeches for him, how she, I'm paraphrasing her and I haven't read her book in a couple of decades, but basically she would write like a brain dump and it's just garbage."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "And she's like, that's okay, just get it all out there."}, {"time": 6203, "text": "And then there's that expression, all writing is editing."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "So for the White Pills specifically, this is, I don't know if it's the most ambitious book I've ever done, your reader I think is more ambitious because that's all of North Korea's history and it's written in somebody else's voice, not a person's abortion."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "And you, like you mentioned, you had to read a giant number of books."}, {"time": 6222, "text": "Yeah, 60 books as research, yeah."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "Well, maybe can we just pause, can you say what White Pill is about?"},

you think, why are you so hopeful?"}, {"time": 6238, "text": "And I'm not hopeful on an emotional level, I'm hopeful because looking at history, I think there's certain things that not will certainly happen again, but it's not at all implausible to happen again and that the good guys will win."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "And this is one of those cases."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "So, the book took on a life of its own, it's very different from how I originally conceived it."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "I originally conceived it as a kind of retelling of Camus philosophy, Ryan Holiday, who he used to be close friends with, I've talked to him in a while."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "He has a whole kind of cottage industry based on the Stoics of the past."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "I'm like, okay, I asked him once, can I do this with Camus?"}, {"time": 6276, "text": "He said, sure."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "And then I reread Camus recently and it wasn't what I had remembered."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "I was like, Camus wasn't that, I apologize to interrupt."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "So, it's interesting."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "So, he kind of took ideas from Stoics and started to kind of use it as a book that gives you advice about how to live life from the Stoic perspectives."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "And you were thinking, is there something in existentialism, absurdism, or something specifically in Camus thinking, or I think you've mentioned Mithos Sisyphus, specifically like his philosophical work."}, {"time": 6311, "text": "So, you were trying to see like, is there, can I resurrect this?"}, {"time": 6315, "text": "That's actually, I would think, that's an interesting project."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "And it's sad to hear that it didn't materialize in exactly that form, because I thought there would be a lot in that."}, {"time": 6333, "text": "So, I had Douglas Murray on my show and he also made the point, like when you go back and read Camus, there's not that much there."}, {"time": 6338, "text": "The myth of Sisyphus is not at all how I remembered it."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "The vast bulk of that book is like literary criticism."}, {"time": 6346,

title essay is basically like a six chapter essay at the back of the book, which it's good for what it is, but there's not that much there to draw."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "I'm extremely, he's a great hero of mine."}, {"time": 6367, "text": "I think his life is just enormously admirable."}, {"time": 6370, "text": "He fought very hard against the Nazi occupation."}, {"time": 6374, "text": "His book, The Plague, which I find unreadable is an allegory about Germany conquering France and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 6380, "text": "Wait a minute, why is The Plague unreadable?"}, {"time": 6383, "text": "It's the kind of book where reading the book doesn't add anything to the plot."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "The plot is a plague comes, sleeps over the town, destroys a lot of life and vanishes quickly as it came."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "You don't need to read the book now."}, {"time": 6395, "text": "You get the point."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "I deeply disagree with you."}, {"time": 6398, "text": "Yes, of course I've read The Plague."}, {"time": 6400, "text": "To me, The Plague is about the doctor and it's about love and it's about the different roles that humans take in a time of tragedy like The Plague."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "Also, it's an allegory, so you could start to think about whether it's Nazi Germany, whatever you think that is."}, {"time": 6421, "text": "To me, that was about love and about the highest ideal being the doctor that sacrifices themselves for others and still has love and hope."}, {"time": 6432, "text": "I mean, to me, the way that story is told, I think, has a lot of meaning."}, {"time": 6439, "text": "It's like, to me, you saying that's interesting."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "You say it this way, but to me, it's like saying Animal Farm doesn't need to be read because it's an obvious story."}, {"time": 6451, "text": "I don't think there's much plot to The Plague."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "I think Animal Farm has a very long plot and a complex plot."}, {"time": 6458, "text": "But there's experiences within."}, {"time": 6462, "text": "So the situation is set up in The Plague and there's experiences that start to reveal a philosophy."}, {"time": 6468, "text": "So yeah, it's not very plot driven."}, {"time": 6473, "text": "So I would say you still should read it, but The Plague doesn't... Like you didn't give away anything currently."}, {"time": 6483, "text": "Some books are just..."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "I mean, Ayn Rand is similar to that in the sense like The Plague is not as important as the behavior of the different people in that plot."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "I think she's very plot heavy."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "No, she has plot, but I'm saying that's not necessarily the important thing."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "To me, the behavior of the people is the important thing."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "You could like separate it into a bunch of blog posts and they stand on their own."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "I would have to think about that with Ayn Rand."}, {"time": 6512, "text": "She does, through the plot, create a world where you start to understand the different values that people have, but yeah."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "Yeah, but that's what the plot serves."}, {"time": 6524, "text": "Yeah, I would have to think."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "But in The Plague, it's the behavior of the people that's really important."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "And the same, I mean, The Stranger too."}, {"time": 6531, "text": "I mean, these like..."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "I'm trying to scramble here for books I really appreciate that don't have a plot."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "I mean, Notes from Underground."}, {"time": 6544,

the plot."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "He's the one who doesn't have plots."}, {"time": 6554, "text": "Thomas Mann."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "Would you say Kafka has a plot?"}, {"time": 6557, "text":

6565, "text": "Yeah, but there's like crawling around."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "But it's like a vignette."}, {"time": 6568, "text": "It's not really like this."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "It's not short, yeah."}, {"time": 6570, "text": "A Hunger Artist, one of my probably favorite short stories is that kind of a short story."}, {"time": 6575, "text": "It's a pretty long short story of Kafka's."}, {"time": 6580, "text": "It's about a man."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "I don't know if you read it."}, {"time": 6583, "text": "It's about a man that is like a freak in a sense that his skill is that he can fast for a long time."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "And then people gather on the cage and look at him as he fasts."}, {"time": 6597, "text": "I don't actually remember if he's in a cage or not."}, {"time": 6600, "text": "And eventually, he fasts so long that people don't even care anymore."}, {"time": 6604, "text": "Like they just leave."}, {"time": 6606, "text": "So there's a, it has to do something."}, {"time": 6611, "text": "It makes me think about like, don't become, the way you live, don't become like a freak show, a circus act."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "Like live for an ideal, live for something that brings you joy."}, {"time": 6625, "text": "Or don't live for the sake of attention."}, {"time": 6627, "text": "For the sake of attention."}, {"time": 6630, "text": "Yeah, anyway, so I rudely interrupted because you were talking about the plague and connecting it to the writing process of White Pill."}, {"time": 6640, "text": "Well, anyway, so how I was writing this one, I just had a first draft of notes and it's not in chronological order."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "It's like, I read certain books as research and then I had the pull quotes that was necessary there."}, {"time": 6654, "text": "And now I'm basically rearranging everything and putting it."}, {"time": 6657, "text": "So the book started as Ryan Holiday's."}, {"time": 6661, "text": "The equivalent of Ryan Holiday as Camus, the working title would have been The Point of Tears because this is great."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "Camus is a great quote maker and he has this line about man must live, live to the point of tears, which I think is just what I love about him is Camus, he always comes off as like he's clenching his teeth."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "He's clenching his teeth both in terms of like barely mitigated rage and injustice."}, {"time": 6689, "text": "Like when he sees people suffering, it just really makes him like just upset to the core."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "But also this sense of not taking life for granted and kind of just pushing yourself and pushing the boundaries."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "And his point being that life is inherently meaningless, which gives a great opportunity to impute meaning to it to create our own meaning to life."}, {"time": 6713, "text": "So taking the main essay from Sisyphus, myth of Sisyphus, that was the origin story for the white pill, but then it became something completely different."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "And so then it became, how are you so optimistic in the face of everything that's going on in the world?"}, {"time": 6727, "text": "And I started writing it when COVID started hitting."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "And I, because again, I'm not optimistic because of some temperament of mine."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "I'm optimistic because, you know, people talk about how if the US didn't exist, China would just become an empire and take over everything."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "Empires are expensive and look at the British empire, you know, look at the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 6751, "text": "Like it's not automatically sustainable."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "It costs a lot of things to make sure when you're geographically, you know, all over the world, literally, to keep everyone in line."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "It's not at all like a super villain movie."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "Like once it happens, it's the happy ending for them."}, {"time": 6770, "text": "So yeah, that was the start."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "And I'm like, all right, let me tell, one thing I'm good at is telling stories."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "So this is really a..."}, {"time": 6780, "text": "So this is narrative, plot driven."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "Very, very plot driven and also heavily character driven, but the characters are real."}, {"time": 6789, "text": "So it's interesting to kind of mention what kind of, what does the first draft kind of look like in terms of, what kind of things do you plop down?"}, {"time": 6799, "text": "Oh, so it'll be like, let's suppose I just read a, like, you know, some book called The Guillotine at Work, which was an early book attacking Lenin from the anarcho communist perspective."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "So it'll just be like all the different quotes, like a paragraph here, double space, another paragraph, you know, blah, blah, blah, so on and so forth."}, {"time": 6816, "text": "Whereas for other sections where I wasn't just using the book as research, there would be like talking about McKinley getting shot."}, {"time": 6823, "text": "Like it's just me writing the narrative and that I could just pretty much copy paste into the second draft."}, {"time": 6829, "text": "By way of advice, would you give that as advice?"}, {"time": 6832, "text": "Is that a good way to do it?"}, {"time": 6834, "text": "Or is that a very peculiar way your brain works?"}, {"time": 6836, "text": "No, so this is actually advice I feel comfortable giving to people who are trying to write."}, {"time": 6842, "text": "Because it's just like with the gym, right?"}, {"time": 6844, "text": "If you did seven sets, seven, excuse me, reps last week and you did eight this week, it's psychologically motivating because you're going the right direction and the human mind extrapolates."}, {"time": 6854, "text": "So make sure, tell yourself I'm gonna get a page done today or two pages done, sit your ass down on the computer, you're not allowed to get up till you get those two pages."}, {"time": 6864, "text": "It doesn't matter if they look like garbage because if you have a 300 page first draft and it's crap, at least you have something to work with and that's a big number."}, {"time": 6874, "text": "So if you're gonna, the thing is, since the first draft is gonna be crap, if you're editing as you write, it's gonna be extremely discouraging."}, {"time": 6882, "text": "And it's also trying to drive and doing reverse at the same time."}, {"time": 6886, "text": "It's a completely nonsensical way to do it."}, {"time": 6888, "text": "Get it all out there, don't look it over."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "If you have a great line, put it in your phone and then add it to the draft so it'll be a complete slog."}, {"time": 6897, "text": "But editing that slog is gonna be a lot easier than creating it to begin with."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "And when you see those disparate lines all laid out on the page, how difficult is it to then start stitching it together?"}, {"time": 6908, "text": "Do you find that when you look at a list of those things the final product will look very different or will you actually use those lines?"}, {"time": 6917, "text": "No, I will use those lines."}, {"time": 6918, "text": "Then I have a file called scraps."}, {"time": 6920, "text": "So like if the line's no longer used, I put it in my scrap pile."}, {"time": 6924, "text": "I'd love to see what's in the scrap pile."}, {"time": 6926, "text": "Okay, yeah, sure."}, {"time": 6928, "text": "One of the things I've been pulling scraps is a lot of times when I was earlier writing, I would have contemporary references and I realized that that's bad because I want the reader to be in the past as the present."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "So if you're talking about let's say 1901 and then you're referring to Obama, that screws people up so I had to pull all those."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "Okay, let's talk about some New Year's resolutions."}, {"time": 6953, "text": "Do you ever do New Year's resolutions?"}, {"time": 6955, "text": "Do you ever think like that, like take a special day in the year to think about how you're gonna try to change yourself or do you try to transform yourself

lot."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "I finally got a new computer which my friend Jay installed so I can have a decent camera because of my old, this is my mindset as a hoarder."}, {"time": 7123, "text":

this happens inevitably with elites, it's, you know, it happens in universities, it happens in the food industry, there's only so many people at the top of these things, the field is small, and

us because you're not in the boardroom, but we're not, you know, we are trying to produce a product that people want."}, {"time": 10269, "text": "So unlike the people who criticized me, I was bothered by, I wasn't bothered by most things, but I was bothered by the fact that he didn't show more worry about the corrupting nature of money and power."}, {"time": 10282, "text": "Like, he should, if you say that there's no corruption, you should show that because we constantly worry about it."}, {"time": 10296, "text": "Not because like, look, there's rules."}, {"time": 10299, "text": "Yeah, which are enforced by you."}, {"time": 10301, "text": "So like, I think the only way to avoid force for time, the corrupting force of power is to freak out about it, nonstop."}, {"time": 10313, "text": "The

you're the good guy, sure corruption is a concern theoretically, but I know this guy at the FDA, I know this senator, sure we disagree, sure they do some things I don't like, but in terms of corrupt,

that."}, {"time": 10388, "text": "Like if you had them on your show or just giving me advice on how to talk to them, what do you think is the right way to talk to them?"}, {"time": 10400, "text": "And
