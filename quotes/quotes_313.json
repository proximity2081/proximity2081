romantic appreciation of a moon versus a planet versus an asteroid."}, {"time": 334, "text": "It's just an object that flies out there and it doesn't really matter what the categorization is."}, {"time": 339, "text": "Because there's movies about asteroids and stuff, and then there's movies about the moon, whatever, it's a really good movie."}, {"time": 348, "text": "There's something about moons that's almost like an outlier."}, {"time": 355, "text": "You think of a moon as a thing that's the secret part, and the planet is the more vanilla regular part."}, {"time": 364, "text": "None of that?"}, {"time": 365, "text": "You don't have any of that?"}, {"time": 366, "text": "No, I actually do."}, {"time": 367, "text": "I really, satellites are, the moons are my favorite things in the solar system."}, {"time": 371, "text": "I think part of what you're saying, I agree from maybe a slightly different perspective, which is from the perspective of exploration, we've spent a lot of time sending spacecraft missions to planets."}, {"time": 383, "text": "We had a mission to Jupiter, we had a mission to Saturn, we have plenty of missions to Mars and missions to Venus."}, {"time": 388, "text": "I think the exploration of the moons in the outer solar system is the next frontier of solar system exploration."}, {"time": 395, "text": "The belt of debris, just real quick, that's out there."}, {"time": 399, "text": "Is there something incredible to be discovered there?"}, {"time": 402, "text": "Again, we tend to focus on the planets and the moons, but it feels like there's probably a lot of stuff out there and it probably, what is it?"}, {"time": 411, "text": "It's like a garbage collector from outside of the solar system, isn't it?"}, {"time": 416, "text": "Like, doesn't it protect from other objects that kind of fly in and what, it just feels like it's a cool, you know when you like walk along the beach and look for stuff and like look for, it feels like that's that kind of place where you can find cool weird things."}, {"time": 433, "text": "Or I guess in our conversation today, when we think about tools and what science is studying, is there something to be studied out there or we just don't have maybe the tools yet or there's nothing to be found?"}, {"time": 446, "text": "There's absolutely a lot to be found."}, {"time": 448, "text": "So the material that's out there is remnant material from the formation of our solar system."}, {"time": 452, "text": "We don't think it comes from outside the solar system, at least not most of it."}, {"time": 458, "text": "But there are so many fascinating objects out there and I think what you fit on is exactly right that we just don't have the tools to study them in detail."}, {"time": 468, "text": "But we can look out there and we can see there are different species of ice on their surface that tells us about, you know, the chemical composition of the disk that formed our solar system."}, {"time": 479, "text": "Some of these objects are way brighter than they should be, meaning they have some kind of geological activity."}, {"time": 484, "text": "People have hypothesized that some of these objects have subsurface oceans."}, {"time": 488, "text": "You could even stretch your imagination and say some of those oceans could be habitable."}, {"time": 492, "text": "But we can't get very detailed information about them because they're so far away."}, {"time": 496, "text": "And so I think if any of those objects were in the inner solar system, it would be studied intently and would be very interesting."}, {"time": 504, "text": "So would you be able to design a probe in that like very dense debris field, be able to like hop from one place to another?"}, {"time": 512, "text": "Is that just outside of the realm of like how would you even design devices or sensors that go out there and take pictures and land?"}, {"time": 522, "text": "Do you have to land to truly understand a little piece of rock or can you understand it from remotely, like fly up close and remotely observe?"}, {"time": 532, "text": "You can learn quite a lot from just a flyby and that's all we're currently capable of doing in the outer solar system."}, {"time": 538, "text": "The New Horizons mission is a recent example which flew by Pluto and then they had searched for another object that was out there in the Kuiper Belt, any object that was basically somewhere that they could deflect their trajectory to actually fly by."}, {"time": 553, "text": "And so they did fly by another object out there in the Kuiper Belt and they take pictures and they do what they can do."}, {"time": 559, "text": "And if you've seen the images from that mission of Pluto, you can see just how much detail we have compared to just the sort of reddish dot that we knew of before."}, {"time": 569, "text": "So you do get an amazing amount of information actually from just essentially a high speed flyby."}, {"time": 574, "text": "It always makes me sad to think about flybys that we might be able to, we might fly by a piece of rock, take a picture and think, oh, that looks pretty and cool and whatever."}, {"time": 586, "text": "And that you could study certain like composition of the surface and so on."}, {"time": 589, "text": "But it's actually teeming with life and we won't be able to see it at first."}, {"time": 595, "text": "And it's sad."}, {"time": 596, "text": "Cause you know, like when you're on a deserted island and you wave your hands and the thing flies by and you're trying to get their attention and they probably do the same, well in their own way, bacteria probably, right?"}, {"time": 607, "text": "But and we miss it."}, {"time": 610, "text": "I don't know, some reason it makes me, it's the FOMO, it's fear of missing out."}, {"time": 616, "text": "It makes me sad that there might be life out there and we don't, we're not in touch with it."}, {"time": 624, "text": "We're not talking."}, {"time": 627, "text": "A sad pause, a Russian philosophical pause."}, {"time": 633, "text": "What are the tools available to us to study planets and their moons?"}, {"time": 636, "text": "Oh my goodness."}, {"time": 638, "text": "That is such a big question."}, {"time": 641, "text": "So among the field of astronomy, so planetary science broadly speaking, well, it falls kind of at the border of astronomy, geology, climate science, chemistry, and even biology."}, {"time": 653, "text": "So it's kind of on the border of many things, but part of it falls under the heading of astronomy."}, {"time": 658, "text": "And among the things that you can study with telescopes, like solar system moons and planets, the solar system is really unique in that we can actually send spacecraft missions to the objects and study them in detail."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And so I think that's, that's the kind of type of tool that is, that people are most aware of, that's most popularized, these amazing NASA missions that either you fly by the object, you orbit the object, you land on the object, potentially you can talk about digging into it, drilling, trying to detect tectonic tremors on its surface."}, {"time": 720, "text": "I kind of came at it from the fascination with telescopes angle."}, {"time": 723, "text": "So you like telescopes, not rockets, or at least when I was a kid it was looking at the stars and playing with telescopes that really fascinated me and that's how I got into this."}, {"time": 734, "text": "But telescopes, it's amazing how much detail and how much information you can get from telescopes today."}, {"time": 742, "text": "You can resolve individual cloud features and watch them kind of sheer out in the atmosphere of Titan."}, {"time": 750, "text": "You can literally watch volcanoes on Io change from day to day as the lava flows expand."}, {"time": 758, "text": "So and then, you know, spectroscopy, you get compositional information on all these things and it's, when I started doing solar system astronomy, I was surprised by how much detail and how much information you can get even from Earth and then as well as from orbit like the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb."}, {"time": 779, "text": "So with the telescope, you can, I mean, how much information can you get about volcanoes, about storms, about sort of weather, just so we kind of get a sense, like what a resolution we're talking about?"}, {"time": 795, "text": "Well, in terms of resolution, so at a, you know, on a given night, if I go and take a picture of Io and its volcanoes, you can sometimes see at least a dozen different volcanoes."}, {"time": 806, "text": "You can see the infrared emission coming off of them and resolve them, separate them from one another on the surface and actually watch how the heat coming off of them changes with time."}, {"time": 817, "text": "And I think this time variability aspect is one of the big advantages we get from telescopes."}, {"time": 821, "text": "So you send a spacecraft mission there and you get an incredible amount of information over a very short time period."}, {"time": 827, "text": "But for some science questions, you need to observe something for 30 years, 40 years."}, {"time": 833, "text": "Like let's say you want to look at the moon Titan, which has one of the most interesting atmospheres in the solar system."}, {"time": 840, "text": "Its orbital period is 29, 30 years."}, {"time": 844, "text": "And so if you want to look at how its atmospheric seasons work, you have to observe it over that long of a time period."}, {"time": 851, "text": "And you're not going to do that with a spacecraft, but you can do it with telescopes."}, {"time": 855, "text": "Can we just zoom in on certain things like, let's talk about Io, which is the moon of Jupiter."}, {"time": 863, "text": "It's so big."}, {"time": 864, "text": "There's like volcanoes all over the place."}, {"time": 867, "text": "It's from a distance."}, {"time": 871, "text": "So can you tell me about this moon and you're sort of a scholar of many planets and moons, but that one kind of stood out to me."}, {"time": 880, "text": "So why is that an interesting one?"}, {"time": 882, "text": "For so many reasons, but Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system."}, {"time": 887, "text": "It has hundreds of active volcanoes on it."}, {"time": 890, "text": "It has volcanic plumes that go hundreds of kilometers up above its surface."}, {"time": 896, "text": "It puts out more volume of magma per volcano than volcanoes on Earth today."}, {"time": 903, "text": "But I think to me, the reason that it's most interesting is as a laboratory for understanding planetary processes."}, {"time": 912, "text": "So one of the broad goals of planetary science is to put together a sort of more general and coherent framework for how planets work in general."}, {"time": 924, "text": "Our current framework, you know, it started out very Earth centric."}, {"time": 927, "text": "We start to understand how Earth volcanoes work."}, {"time": 930, "text": "But then when you try to transport that to somewhere like Io that doesn't have an atmosphere, which has a very tenuous atmosphere, which makes a big difference for how the magma degasses, for something that's really small, for something that has a different heat source, for something that's embedded in another object's magnetic field, the kind of intuition we have from Earth doesn't apply."}, {"time": 950, "text": "And so broadly, planetary science is trying to broaden that framework so that you have a kind of narrative that you can understand how each planet became different from every other planet."}, {"time": 962, "text": "And I'm already making a mistake."}, {"time": 964, "text": "When I say planet, I mean planets and moons."}, {"time": 966, "text": "Like I said, I see the moons as planets."}, {"time": 968, "text": "As planets."}, {"time": 970, "text": "I actually already noticed that you didn't introduce Io as the moon of Jupiter."}, {"time": 974, "text": "You completely, you kind of ignored the fact that Jupiter exists."}, {"time": 979, "text": "It's like, let's focus on this."}, {"time": 983, "text": "So, and you also didn't mention Europa, which I think is the, is that the most famous moon of Jupiter?"}, {"time": 989, "text": "Is that the one gets attention because it might have life?"}, {"time": 995, "text": "But to you, Io is also beautiful."}, {"time": 997, "text": "What's the difference between volcanoes on Io versus Earth?"}, {"time": 1001, "text": "You said atmosphere makes a difference."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "What the heat source plays a big role."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "So many of the moons in the outer solar system are heated from gravitationally by tidal heating."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And I'm happy to describe what that is or, yeah, please, what's tidal?"}, {"time": 1021, "text": "So tidal heating is, it's, if you want to understand and contextualize planets and moons, you have to understand their heat sources."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So for Earth, we have radioactive decay in our interior as well as residual heat of formation."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "But for satellites, tidal heating plays a really significant role and in particular in driving geological activity on satellites and potentially making those subsurface oceans in places like Europa and Enceladus habitable."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And so the way that that works is if you have multiple moons and their orbital periods are integer multiples of one another, that means that they're always encountering each other at the same point in the orbit."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "So if they were on just random orbits, they'd be encountering each other at random places and the gravitational effect between the two moons would be canceling out over time."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "But because they're always meeting each other at the same point in the orbit, those gravitational interactions add up coherently."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "And so that tweaks them into eccentric orbits."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "What's an eccentric orbit?"}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit, it just means noncircular, so a deviation from a circular orbit."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "And that means that for Io or Europa, at some points in their orbit, they're closer to Jupiter and at some points in their orbit, they're farther away."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "And so when they're closer, they're stretched out in a sense, but literally just not very stretched out, like a couple hundred meters, something like that."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And then when they're farthest away, they're less stretched out."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "And so you actually have the shape of the object deforming over the course of the orbit."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And these orbits are like just a couple of days."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "And so that, in the case of Io, that is literally sufficient friction in its mantle to melt the rock of its mantle."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "And that's what generates the magma."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "That's the source of the magma."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "So why is, so Europa is, I thought there was like ice and oceans underneath kind of thing."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "So why is Europa not getting the friction?"}, {"time": 1145, "text": "It is, it's just a little bit farther away from Jupiter."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "And then Ganymede is also in the orbital resonance."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So it's a three object orbital resonance in the Jupiter system."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "But we have these sorts of orbital resonances all over the solar system and also in exoplanets."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "So for Europa, basically because it's farther from Jupiter, the effect is not as extreme, but you do still have heat generated in its interior in this way."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "And that may be driving, could be driving hydrothermal activity at the base of its ocean, which obviously would be a really valuable thing for life."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "So it's like heating up the ocean a little bit."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "Heating up the ocean a little bit."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And specifically in these like hydrothermal vents where we see really interesting life evolve in the bottom of Earth's oceans."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "So what's Io, what else?"}, {"time": 1195, "text": "So we know the source is this friction, but there's no atmosphere."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "I'm trying to get a sense of what it's like if you and I were to visit Io, like what would that look like?"}, {"time": 1206, "text": "What would it feel like?"}, {"time": 1208, "text": "Is this the entire thing covered in basically volcanoes?"}, {"time": 1215, "text": "So it's interesting because there's very little atmosphere."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "The surface is actually really cold, very far below freezing on the surface when you're away from a volcano, but the volcanoes themselves are over a thousand degrees or the magma when it comes out is over a thousand degrees."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "But it does come to the surface, the magma?"}, {"time": 1235, "text": "In particular places."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Whoa, that probably looks beautiful."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "So like, so it's frozen, not ice."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Like what is, is rock, it's really cold rock."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And then you just have this like, what is, what does that look, what would that look like with no atmosphere?"}, {"time": 1253, "text": "Would that, uh, would it be smoke?"}, {"time": 1258, "text": "It's just magma, like just red, yellow, like liquidy things?"}, {"time": 1263, "text": "It's black, it's black and red, I guess."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "Like think of the type of magma that you see in Hawaii."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "So different types of magma flow in different ways, for example."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So in somewhere like Io, the magma is really hot and so it will flow out in sheets because it has really low viscosity."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "And I think the lava flows that we've been having in Hawaii over the past couple of years are probably a decent analogy, although Io's magma's lavas are even more fluid and faster moving."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "How faster?"}, {"time": 1297, "text": "Like what, uh, how fat, like if you, uh, by the way, sorry, through the telescope, are you tracking at what timescale?"}, {"time": 1303, "text": "Like every frame is how far apart?"}, {"time": 1307, "text": "If you're looking through a telescope, are we talking about seconds or we're talking about days, months, when you kind of track, try to get a picture of what the surface might look like, what's the frequency?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So it depends a little bit on what you want to do."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "I, ideally every night, um, but you could take a frame every second and see how things are changing."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "The, the problem with that is that for things to change on a one second timescale, you to actually see something change that fast, you have to have super high resolution."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "The spatial resolution we have is a couple of hundred kilometers."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "And so things are not changing on those scales over one second, unless you have something really crazy happening."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "So if you get, if you get a telescope closer to Io, if you get a, or a camera closer to Io, would you be able to understand something?"}, {"time": 1359, "text": "Is that something of interest to you?"}, {"time": 1361, "text": "Would you be able to understand something deeper about these volcanic eruptions and how magma flows and just the, like the rate of the magma is, or is it basically enough to have the kilometer resolution?"}, {"time": 1375, "text": "Do you get it?"}, {"time": 1377, "text": "We want to go there."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "You want to go, you want to go to Io?"}, {"time": 1380, "text": "I mean, I don't want to go there personally, but I want to send a spacecraft mission there."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "Why are you scared?"}, {"time": 1386, "text": "Oh, you mean you don't like, I don't want to go there as a human as a human."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "I want to send a robot there to look at it though."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "This is again, everybody's discriminating against robots."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "This is not, but it's fine."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "But it's not hospitable to humans in any way, right?"}, {"time": 1402, "text": "Just very cold and very hot."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "It's very cold."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "The atmosphere is composed of sulfur dioxide, so you can breathe it."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "There's no pressure."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "I mean, it's kind of all the same things you talk about."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "One talks about, about Mars only worse, the atmosphere is still a thousand times less dense than Mars is."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And the radiation environment is terrible because you're embedded deep within Jupiter's magnetic field and Jupiter's magnetic field is full of charged particles that have all come out of Io's volcanoes actually."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "So Jupiter's magnetic field strips all this material out of Io's atmosphere and that populates its entire magnetosphere and then that material comes back around and hits Io and spreads throughout the system actually."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "It's just, it's like Io is the massive polluter of the Jupiter system."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "So what does studying Io teach you about volcanoes on earth or vice versa?"}, {"time": 1463, "text": "Is in the difference of the two, what insights can you mine out?"}, {"time": 1470, "text": "That might be interesting in some way."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Well, we try to port the tools that we use to study earth volcanism to Io and it works to some extent, but it is challenging because the situations are so different and the compositions are really different."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "When you talk about outgassing, you know, earth volcanoes outgassed primarily water and carbon dioxide, and then sulfur dioxide is the third most abundant gas."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And on Io, the water and carbon dioxide are not there, either it didn't form with them or it lost them, we don't know."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "And so the chemistry of how the magma outgassed this is completely different."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "But the kind of one to me most interesting analogy to earth is that, so Io, as I've said, it has these really low viscosity magmas, the lava spreads really quickly across its surface, it can put out massive volumes of magma in relatively short periods of time."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And that sort of volcanism is not happening anywhere else in the solar system today."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "But literally every terrestrial planet and the moon had this, what we call very effusive volcanism early in their history."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "Okay, so this is almost like a little glimpse into the early history of earth."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "So what are the chances that a volcano on earth destroys all of human civilization?"}, {"time": 1560, "text": "Maybe I wanted to sneak in that question."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "Yeah, a volcano on earth."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "Do you think about that kind of stuff when you just study volcanoes elsewhere?"}, {"time": 1569, "text": "Because isn't it kind of humbling to see something so powerful and so hot, like so unpleasant for humans, and then you realize we're sitting on many of them here?"}, {"time": 1579, "text": "Yeah, Yellowstone is a classic example."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "I don't know what the chances are of that happening."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "My intuition would be that the chances of that are lower than the chances of us getting wiped out by some other means, that maybe it'll happen eventually, that there'll be one of these massive volcanoes on earth, but we'll probably be gone by then by some other means."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "Not to sound bleak."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "Okay, so can we talk about Europa?"}, {"time": 1611, "text": "Is there, so maybe can you talk about the intuition, the hope that people have about life being in Europa?"}, {"time": 1620, "text": "Maybe also, what are the things we know about it?"}, {"time": 1623, "text": "What are the things to you that are interesting about that particular moon of Jupiter?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "Yeah, Europa is, from many perspectives, one of the really interesting places in the solar system among the solar system moons."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So there are a few, there's a lot of interest in looking for or understanding the potential for life to evolve in the subsurface oceans."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "I think it's fairly widely accepted that the chances of life evolving on the surfaces of really anything in the solar system is very low."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "The radiation environment is too harsh and there's just not liquids on the surface of most of these things and it's canonically accepted that liquids are required for life."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "And so the subsurface oceans, in addition to maybe Titan's atmosphere, the subsurface oceans of the icy satellites are one of the most plausible places in the solar system for life to evolve."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "Europa and Cellitus are interesting because for many of the big satellites, so Ganymede and Callisto, also satellites of Jupiter, also are thought to have subsurface oceans."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "But they have these ice shells and then there's an ocean underneath the ice shell."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "But on those moons around Ganymede, we think that there's another ice shell underneath and then there's rock."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "And the reason that that is a problem for life is that your ocean is probably just pure water because it's trapped between two big shells of ice."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "So Europa doesn't have this ice shell at the bottom of the ocean, we think."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "And so the water and rock are in direct interaction and so that means that you can basically dissolve a lot of material out of the rock."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "You potentially have this hydrothermal activity that's injecting energy and nutrients for life to survive."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And so this rock water interface is considered really important for the potential habitability."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "As a small aside, you kind of said that it's canonically assumed that water is required for life."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "Is it possible to have life like in a volcano?"}, {"time": 1753, "text": "I remember people were like in that National Geographic program or something kind of hypothesizing that you can really have life anywhere."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "So as long as there's a source of heat, a source of energy, do you think it's possible to have life in a volcano, like no water?"}, {"time": 1774, "text": "I think anything's possible."}, {"time": 1779, "text":

understanding how, taking again, like one of these extreme examples, if we can understand why that atmosphere behaves in the way it does, it's kind of a test of our understanding of how atmosphere

are so interested in them, aside from potentially the fact that they could come hit Earth, but scientifically it's, it gives us a window into understanding the composition of the material from which

different ways."}, {"time": 4364, "text": "Some of them are ancient objects."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "So they accreted out of the sort of disc of material that the whole solar system formed out of

look and based on their orbits say, you know, like these 50 objects originated as the same object."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "You can see them kind of dynamically moving apart after some big collision."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "And so some of them are these ancient objects maybe that have undergone collisions."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "And then there's this other category of object that is the one that I personally find really interesting which is remnants of objects that could have been planets."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "So early on a bunch of potential planets accreted that we call planetesimals and they formed and they formed with a lot of energy and they had enough time to actually differentiate."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "So some of these objects differentiated into cores and mantles and crests."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "And then they were subsequently disrupted in these massive collisions and they, now we have these fragments, we think fragments floating around the asteroid belt that are like bits of mantle, bits of core, bits of crest basically."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "So it's like puzzle pieces that you might be able to stitch together or I guess it's all mixed up so you can't stitch together the original planet candidates or is that possible to try to see if they kind of, I mean, there's too many objects in there to."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "I think that there are cases where people have kind of looked at objects and by looking at their orbits, they say these objects should have originated together, but they have very different compositions."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "And so then you can hypothesize maybe they were different fragments of a differentiated object."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "But one of the really cool things about this is, you know, we've been talking about getting clues into the interiors of planets."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "We've never seen a planetary core or deep mantle directly."}, {"time": 4497,

{"time": 4551, "text": "So when it comes to the asteroids, there are so many of them and the big pictures or the big questions are answered, so some questions can be answered by zooming in in detail on individual object, but mostly you're trying to do a statistical study."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "So you want to look at thousands of objects, even hundreds of thousands of objects and figure out what their composition is and look at, you know, how many big asteroids there are of this composition versus how many small asteroids of this other composition and put together these kinds of statistical properties of the asteroid belt."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "And those properties can be directly compared with the results of simulations for the formation of the solar system."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "What do we know about the surfaces of asteroids or the contents of the insides of asteroids and what are still open questions?"}, {"time": 4612, "text": "So I would say that we don't know a whole lot about their compositions."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "Most of them are small and so you can't study them in such detail with telescopes as you could, you know, a planet or moon and at the same time, because there are so many of them, you could send a spacecraft to a few, but you can't really like get a statistical survey with spacecraft."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "And so a lot of what we, a lot of what has been done comes down to sort of classification."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "You look at how bright they are, you look at whether they're red or blue, simply, you know,

the hydrogen or nitrogen ice sublimating off the sunward part of it, and so that is responsible for the acceleration."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "The shape also, because you have all this ice sublimating off the surface, if you take something, the analogy that works pretty well here is for a bar of soap."}, {"time": 5591, "text": "Your bar of soap starts out sort of close to spherical, at least from a physicist perspective, and as you use it over time, you eventually end up with this long, thin shard because it's been just by sort of weathering, as we would call it."}, {"time": 5608,

communicate with."}, {"time": 5837, "text": "Maybe we should be looking for artifacts or even as dumb as like space junk."}, {"time": 5843, "text": "It just kind of reframed my perspective of like,

intelligent life."}, {"time": 5857, "text": "And yeah, that made me kind of, I know it might be dumb to say, but reframe the kind of thing that we should be looking for."}, {"time": 5868, "text": "So

the simplest possible, we all want to believe the sort of most skeptical possible explanation."}, {"time": 5905, "text": "And so we missed it because we're too good at coming up with alternate explanations for things."}, {"time": 5910, "text": "And it's such an outlier, such a rare phenomenon that we can't study a hundred or a thousand of these objects."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "We have

is, is somebody who in a very small way helps us explore our own loneliness, like they listen, we connect like two lonely creatures connect for a time and it's like, oh, like acknowledge that we exist
