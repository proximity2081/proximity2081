now."}, {"time": 439, "text": "So in the 1970s, the personal computer was being born."}, {"time": 444, "text": "So did you sense, in tinkering with these circuits, did you sense the encroaching revolution in personal computing?"}, {"time": 453, "text": "So if at that point, we would sit you down and ask you to predict the 80s and the 90s, do you think you would be able to do so successfully to unroll the process that's happening?"}, {"time": 466, "text": "No, I had no clue."}, {"time": 503, "text": "And I had never heard that word."}, {"time": 520, "text": "And so there is maybe some echoes of computers there, but I never made that connection."}, {"time": 529, "text": "I didn't know that when my parents were paying for magazine subscriptions using punched cards, that there was something called a computer that was involved that read those cards and transferred the money between accounts."}, {"time": 548, "text": "I was also not really interested in those things."}, {"time": 548, "text": "It was only when I went to university to study math that I found out that they had a computer, and students were allowed to use it."}, {"time": 569, "text": "The computer wasn't really connected to the real world."}, {"time": 581, "text": "You gave the punched cards to the operator, and an hour later the operator gave you back your printout."}, {"time": 587, "text": "And so all you could do was write a program that did something very abstract."}, {"time": 595, "text": "And I don't even remember what my first forays into programming were, but they were sort of doing simple math exercises and just to learn how a programming language worked."}, {"time": 615, "text": "Did you sense, okay, first year of college, you see this computer, you're able to have a program and it generates some output."}, {"time": 621, "text": "Did you start seeing the possibility of this, or was it a continuation of the tinkering with circuits?"}, {"time": 629, "text": "Did you start to imagine that one, the personal computer, but did you see it as something that is a tool, like a word processing tool, maybe for gaming or something?"}, {"time": 642, "text": "Or did you start to imagine that it could be going to the world of robotics, like the Frankenstein picture that you could create an artificial being?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "There's like another entity in front of you."}, {"time": 653, "text": "You did not see the computer."}, {"time": 660, "text": "I don't think I really saw it that way."}, {"time": 660, "text": "I was really more interested in the tinkering."}, {"time": 665, "text": "It's maybe not a sort of a complete coincidence that I ended up sort of creating a programming language which is a tool for other programmers."}, {"time": 674, "text": "I've always been very focused on the sort of activity of programming itself and not so much what happens with the program you write."}, {"time": 690, "text": "I do remember, and I don't remember, maybe in my second or third year, probably my second actually, someone pointed out to me that there was this thing called Conway's Game of Life."}, {"time": 706, "text": "You're probably familiar with it."}, {"time": 713, "text": "So there was a Scientific American column by someone who did a monthly column about mathematical diversions."}, {"time": 720, "text": "I'm also blanking out on the guy's name."}, {"time": 720, "text": "It was very famous at the time and I think up to the 90s or so."}, {"time": 726, "text": "And one of his columns was about Conway's Game of Life and he had some illustrations and he wrote down all the rules and sort of there was the suggestion that this was philosophically interesting, that that was why Conway had called it that."}, {"time": 743, "text": "And all I had was like the two pages photocopy of that article."}, {"time": 743, "text": "I don't even remember where I got it."}, {"time": 751, "text": "But it spoke to me and I remember implementing a version of that game for the batch computer we were using where I had a whole Pascal program that sort of read an initial situation from input and read some numbers that said do so many generations and print every so many generations and then out would come pages and pages of sort of things."}, {"time": 788, "text": "I remember much later I've done a similar thing using Python but that original version I wrote at the time I found interesting because I combined it with some trick I had learned during my electronics hobbyist times."}, {"time": 807, "text": "I essentially first on paper I designed a simple circuit built out of logic gates that took nine bits of input which is sort of the cell and its neighbors and produced a new value for that cell and it's like a combination of a half adder and some other clipping."}, {"time": 834, "text": "It's actually a full adder."}, {"time": 834, "text": "And so I had worked that out and then I translated that into a series of Boolean operations on Pascal integers where you could use the integers as bitwise values."}, {"time": 850, "text": "And so I could basically generate 60 bits of a generation in like eight instructions or so."}, {"time": 869, "text": "So I was proud of that."}, {"time": 872, "text": "It's funny that you mentioned, so for people who don't know Conway's Game of Life, it's a cellular automata where there's single compute units that kind of look at their neighbors and figure out what they look like in the next generation based on the state of their neighbors and this is deeply distributed system in concept at least."}, {"time": 890, "text": "And then there's simple rules that all of them follow and somehow out of this simple rule when you step back and look at what occurs, it's beautiful."}, {"time": 904, "text": "There's an emergent complexity."}, {"time": 904, "text": "Even though the underlying rules are simple, there's an emergent complexity."}, {"time": 913, "text": "Now the funny thing is you've implemented this and the thing you're commenting on is you're proud of a hack you did to make it run efficiently."}, {"time": 923, "text": "When you're not commenting on, it's a beautiful implementation, you're not commenting on the fact that there's an emergent complexity that you've coded a simple program and when you step back and you print out the following generation after generation, that's stuff that you may have not predicted would happen is happening."}, {"time": 948, "text": "And is that magic?"}, {"time": 948, "text": "I mean, that's the magic that all of us feel when we program."}, {"time": 948, "text": "When you create a program and then you run it and whether it's Hello World or it shows something on screen, if there's a graphical component, are you seeing the magic in the mechanism of creating that?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "I think I went back and forth."}, {"time": 965, "text": "As a student, we had an incredibly small budget of computer time that we could use."}, {"time": 974, "text": "It was actually measured."}, {"time": 974, "text": "I once got in trouble with one of my professors because I had overspent the department's budget."}, {"time": 980, "text": "It's a different story."}, {"time": 989, "text": "I actually wanted the efficient implementation because I also wanted to explore what would happen with a larger number of generations and a larger size of the board."}, {"time": 996, "text": "Once the implementation was flawless, I would feed it different patterns and then I think maybe there was a follow up article where there were patterns that were like gliders, patterns that repeated themselves after a number of generations but translated one or two positions to the right or up or something like that."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "I remember things like glider guns."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "Well, you can Google Conway's Game of Life."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "People still go aww and ooh over it."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "For a reason because it's not really well understood why."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "I mean, this is what Stephen Wolfram is obsessed about."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "We don't have the mathematical tools to describe the kind of complexity that emerges in these kinds of systems."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "The only way you can do is to run it."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "I'm not convinced that it's sort of a problem that lends itself to classic mathematical analysis."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "One theory of how you create an artificial intelligence or artificial being is you kind of have to, same with the Game of Life, you kind of have to create a universe and let it run."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "That creating it from scratch in a design way, coding up a Python program that creates a fully intelligent system may be quite challenging."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "You might need to create a universe just like the Game of Life."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "You might have to experiment with a lot of different universes before there is a set of rules that doesn't essentially always just end up repeating itself in a trivial way."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "Yeah, and Stephen Wolfram works with these simple rules, says that it's kind of surprising how quickly you find rules that create interesting things."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "You shouldn't be able to, but somehow you do."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "And so maybe our universe is laden with rules that will create interesting things that might not look like humans, but emergent phenomena that's interesting may not be as difficult to create as we think."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "But let me sort of ask, at that time, some of the world, at least in popular press, was kind of captivated, perhaps at least in America, by the idea of artificial intelligence, that these computers would be able to think pretty soon."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And did that touch you at all?"}, {"time": 1165, "text": "In science fiction or in reality in any way?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "I didn't really start reading science fiction until much, much later."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "I think as a teenager I read maybe one bundle of science fiction stories."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "Was it in the background somewhere, like in your thoughts?"}, {"time": 1197, "text": "That sort of the using computers to build something intelligent always felt to me, because I felt I had so much understanding of what actually goes on inside a computer."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "I knew how many bits of memory it had and how difficult it was to program."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "And sort of, I didn't believe at all that you could just build something intelligent out of that, that would really sort of satisfy my definition of intelligence."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "That was about consciousness, and that was a big eye opener in some sense."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "In what sense?"}, {"time": 1254, "text": "So, on your own brain, did you at the time or do you now see your own brain as a computer?"}, {"time": 1260, "text": "Or is there a total separation of the way?"}, {"time": 1260, "text": "So yeah, you're very pragmatically practically know the limits of memory, the limits of this sequential computing or weakly paralyzed computing, and you just know what we have now, and it's hard to see how it creates."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "But it's also easy to see, it was in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and now at least similarities between the brain and our computers."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "Oh yeah, I mean, I totally believe that brains are computers in some sense."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "I mean, the rules they use to play by are pretty different from the rules we can sort of implement in our current hardware, but I don't believe in, like, a separate thing that infuses us with intelligence or consciousness or any of that."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "There's no soul, I've been an atheist probably from when I was 10 years old, just by thinking a bit about math and the universe, and well, my parents were atheists."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "Now, I know that you could be an atheist and still believe that there is something sort of about intelligence or consciousness that cannot possibly emerge from a fixed set of rules."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "I am not in that camp."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "I totally see that, sort of, given how many millions of years evolution took its time, DNA is a particular machine that sort of encodes information and an unlimited amount of information in chemical form and has figured out a way to replicate itself."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "I thought that that was, maybe it's 300 million years ago, but I thought it was closer to half a billion years ago, that that's sort of originated and it hasn't really changed, that the sort of the structure of DNA hasn't changed ever since."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "That is like our binary code that we have in hardware."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "The basic programming language hasn't changed, but maybe the programming itself... Obviously, it did sort of, it happened to be a set of rules that was good enough to sort of develop endless variability and sort of the idea of self replicating molecules competing with each other for resources and one type eventually sort of always taking over."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "That happened before there were any fossils, so we don't know how that exactly happened, but I believe it's clear that that did happen."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Can you comment on consciousness and how you see it?"}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Because I think we'll talk about programming quite a bit."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "We'll talk about, you know, intelligence connecting to programming fundamentally, but consciousness is this whole other thing."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "Do you think about it often as a developer of a programming language and as a human?"}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Those are pretty sort of separate topics."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "Sort of my line of work working with programming does not involve anything that goes in the direction of developing intelligence or consciousness, but sort of privately as an avid reader of popular science writing, I have some thoughts which is mostly that I don't actually believe that consciousness is an all or nothing thing."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "I have a feeling that, and I forget what I read that influenced this, but I feel that if you look at a cat or a dog or a mouse, they have some form of intelligence."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "If you look at a fish, it has some form of intelligence, and that evolution just took a long time, but I feel that the sort of evolution of more and more intelligence that led to sort of the human form of intelligence followed the evolution of the senses, especially the visual sense."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "I mean, there is an enormous amount of processing that's needed to interpret a scene, and humans are still better at that than computers are."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "And I have a feeling that there is a sort of, the reason that like mammals in particular developed the levels of consciousness that they have and that eventually sort of going from intelligence to self awareness and consciousness has to do with sort of being a robot that has very highly developed senses."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "As far as robots go, I think that the self driving cars have that sort of the greatest opportunity of developing something like that, because when I drive myself, I don't just pay attention to the rules of the road."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "I also look around and I get clues from that, oh, this is a shopping district, oh, here's an old lady crossing the street, oh, here is someone carrying a pile of mail, there's a mailbox, I bet you they're going to cross the street to reach that mailbox."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "And I slow down, and I don't even think about that."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And so, there is so much where you turn your observations into an understanding of what other consciousnesses are going to do, or what other systems in the world are going to be, oh, that tree is going to fall."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "I see sort of, I see much more of, I expect somehow that if anything is going to become unconscious, it's going to be the self driving car and not the network of a bazillion computers in a Google or Amazon data center that are all networked together to do whatever they do."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "So, in that sense, so you actually highlight, because that's what I work in Thomas Vehicles, you highlight the big gap between what we currently can't do and what we truly need to be able to do to solve the problem."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Under that formulation, then consciousness and intelligence is something that basically a system should have in order to interact with us humans, as opposed to some kind of abstract notion of a consciousness."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "Consciousness is something that you need to have to be able to empathize, to be able to fear, understand what the fear of death is, all these aspects that are important for interacting with pedestrians, you need to be able to do basic computation based on our human desires and thoughts."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "And if you sort of, yeah, if you look at the dog, the dog clearly knows, I mean, I'm not the dog owner, but I have friends who have dogs, the dogs clearly know what the humans around them are going to do, or at least they have a model of what those humans are going to do and they learn."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Some dogs know when you're going out and they want to go out with you, they're sad when you leave them alone, they cry, they're afraid because they were mistreated when they were younger."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "We don't assign sort of consciousness to dogs, or at least not all that much, but I also don't think they have none of that."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "So I think it's consciousness and intelligence are not all or nothing."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "The spectrum is really interesting."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "But in returning to programming languages and the way we think about building these kinds of things, about building intelligence, building consciousness, building artificial beings."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "So I think one of the exciting ideas came in the 17th century and with Leibniz, Hobbes, Descartes, where there's this feeling that you can convert all thought, all reasoning, all the thing that we find very special in our brains, you can convert all of that into logic."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So you can formalize it, formal reasoning, and then once you formalize everything, all of knowledge, then you can just calculate and that's what we're doing with our brains is we're calculating."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "So there's this whole idea that this is possible, that this we can actually program."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "But they weren't aware of the concept of pattern matching in the sense that we are aware of it now."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "They sort of thought they had discovered incredible bits of mathematics like Newton's calculus and their sort of idealism, their sort of extension of what they could do with logic and math sort of went along those lines and they thought there's like, yeah, logic."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "There's like a bunch of rules and a bunch of input."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "They didn't realize that how you recognize a face is not just a bunch of rules but is a shit ton of data plus a circuit that sort of interprets the visual clues and the context and everything else and somehow can massively parallel pattern match against stored rules."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "I mean, if I see you tomorrow here in front of the Dropbox office, I might recognize you."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "Even if I'm wearing a different shirt, yeah, but if I see you tomorrow in a coffee shop in Belmont, I might have no idea that it was you or on the beach or whatever."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "I make those kind of mistakes myself all the time."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "I see someone that I only know as like, oh, this person is a colleague of my wife's and then I see them at the movies and I didn't recognize them."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "But do you see those, you call it pattern matching, do you see that rules is unable to encode that?"}, {"time": 2012, "text": "Everything you see, all the pieces of information you look around this room, I'm wearing a black shirt, I have a certain height, I'm a human, all these, there's probably tens of thousands of facts you pick up moment by moment about this scene."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "You take them for granted and you aggregate them together to understand the scene."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "You don't think all of that could be encoded to where at the end of the day, you can just put it all on the table and calculate?"}, {"time": 2037, "text": "I don't know what that means."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "I mean, yes, in the sense that there is no actual magic there, but there are enough layers of abstraction from the facts as they enter my eyes and my ears to the understanding of the scene that I don't think that AI has really covered enough of that distance."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "It's like if you take a human body and you realize it's built out of atoms, well, that is a uselessly reductionist view, right?"}, {"time": 2081, "text": "The body is built out of organs, the organs are built out of cells, the cells are built out of proteins, the proteins are built out of amino acids, the amino acids are built out of atoms and then you get to quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "So that's a very pragmatic view."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "I mean, obviously as an engineer, I agree with that kind of view, but you also have to consider the Sam Harris view of, well, intelligence is just information processing."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "Like you said, you take in sensory information, you do some stuff with it and you come up with actions that are intelligent."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "That makes it sound so easy."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "I don't know who Sam Harris is."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "Oh, well, it's a philosopher."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "So like this is how philosophers often think, right?"}, {"time": 2129, "text": "And essentially that's what Descartes was, is wait a minute, if there is, like you said, no magic, so he basically says it doesn't appear like there's any magic, but we know so little about it that it might as well be magic."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "So just because we know that we're made of atoms, just because we know we're made of organs, the fact that we know very little how to get from the atoms to organs in a way that's recreatable means that you shouldn't get too excited just yet about the fact that you figured out that we're made of atoms."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "Right, and the same about taking facts as our sensory organs take them in and turning that into reasons and actions, that sort of, there are a lot of abstractions that we haven't quite figured out how to deal with those."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "That's also true, probably."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "People want to take a shortcut, but there's sort of, this abstraction is a data structure that the compiler then uses to produce outputs that is relevant, like a translation of that program to machine code that can be executed by hardware, and then that data structure gets thrown away."}, {"time": 2333, "text": "Yeah, in some sense, the same abstraction for motion is probably one of the primary sources of our, of information for us, we just know what to do, I think we know what to do with that, we've built up other abstractions on top."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "On the other hand, how do I recognize your face, I have no idea."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "Right, so our actual day to day lives, we're operating at the very highest level of abstraction, we're just not even conscious of all the little details underlying it."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "There's compilers on top of, it's like turtles on top of turtles, or turtles all the way down, there's compilers all the way down, but that's essentially, you say that there's no magic, that's what I, what I was trying to get at, I think, is with Descartes started this whole train of saying that there's no magic, I mean, there's all this beforehand."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "Well didn't Descartes also have the notion though that the soul and the body were fundamentally separate?"}, {"time": 2467, "text": "Separate, yeah, I think he had to write in God in there for political reasons, so I don't know actually, I'm not a historian, but there's notions in there that all of reasoning, all of human thought can be formalized."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "I think that continued in the 20th century with Russell and with Gadot's incompleteness theorem, this debate of what are the limits of the things that could be formalized, that's where the Turing machine came along, and this exciting idea, I mean, underlying a lot of computing that you can do quite a lot with a computer."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "You can encode a lot of the stuff we're talking about in terms of recognizing faces and so on, theoretically, in an algorithm that can then run on a computer."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "And in that context, I'd like to ask programming in a philosophical way, what does it mean to program a computer?"}, {"time": 2526, "text": "So you said you write a Python program or compiled a C++ program that compiles to some byte code, it's forming layers, you're programming a layer of abstraction that's higher, how do you see programming in that context?"}, {"time": 2544, "text": "Can it keep getting higher and higher levels of abstraction?"}, {"time": 2549, "text": "I think at some point the higher levels of abstraction will not be called programming and they will not resemble what we call programming at the moment."}, {"time": 2670, "text": "You can like prove that Aristotelian sieve produces all prime numbers and only prime numbers."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "So I don't know if you know who Andrej Karpathy is, I'm afraid not."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "So he's a head of AI at Tesla now, but he was at Stanford before and he has this cheeky way of calling this concept software 2.0."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "So let me disentangle that for a second."}, {"time": 2700, "text": "So kind of what you're referring to is the traditional, the algorithm, the concept of an algorithm, something that's there, it's clear, you can read it, you understand it, you can prove it's functioning as kind of software 1.0."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "And what software 2.0 is, is exactly what you described, which is you have neural networks, which is a type of machine learning that you feed a bunch of data and that neural network learns to do a function."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "All you specify is the inputs and the outputs you want and you can't look inside."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "You can't analyze it."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "All you can do is train this function to map the inputs to the outputs by giving a lot of data."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "And that's as programming becomes getting a lot of data."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "That's what programming is."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "Well, that would be programming 2.0."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "To programming 2.0."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "I wouldn't call that programming."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "It's just a different activity."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "Just like building organs out of cells is not called chemistry."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "Well, so let's just step back and think sort of more generally, of course."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "But you know, it's like as a parent teaching your kids, things can be called programming."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "In that same sense, that's how programming is being used."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "You're providing them data, examples, use cases."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "So imagine writing a function not by, not with for loops and clearly readable text, but more saying, well, here's a lot of examples of what this

had a very, very focused problem."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "I wanted a programming language that sat somewhere in between shell scripting and C.

You probably are."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "Well, that's right."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "So what is it about Python?"}, {"time": 3589, "text": "How do you think of productivity in general as you were designing it now, sort of through the decades, last three decades, what do you think it means to be a productive programmer?"}, {"time": 3600, "text": "And how did you try to design it into the language?"}, {"time": 3603, "text": "There are different tasks and as a programmer, it's useful to have different tools available that sort of are suitable for different tasks."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "So I still write C code, I still write shell code, but I write most of my things in Python."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "Why do I still use those other languages, because sometimes the task just demands it."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "And well, I would say most of the time the task actually demands a certain language because the task is not write a program that solves problem X from scratch, but it's more like fix a bug in existing program X or add a small feature to an existing large program."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "But even if you're not constrained in your choice of language by context like that, there is still the fact that if you write it in a certain language, then you have this balance between how long does it take you to write the code and how long does the code run?"}, {"time": 3691, "text": "And when you're in the phase of exploring solutions, you often spend much more time writing the code than running it because every time you've run it, you see that the output is not quite what you wanted and you spend some more time coding."}, {"time": 3718, "text": "And a language like Python just makes that iteration much faster because there are fewer details that you have to get right before your program compiles and runs."}, {"time": 3739, "text": "There are libraries that do all sorts of stuff for you, so you can sort of very quickly take a bunch of existing components, put them together, and get your prototype application running."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "Just like when I was building electronics, I was using a breadboard most of the time, so I had this sprawl out circuit that if you shook it, it would stop working because it was not put together very well, but it functioned and all I wanted was to see that it worked and then move on to the next schematic or design or add something to it."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "Once you've sort of figured out, oh, this is the perfect design for my radio or light sensor or whatever, then you can say, okay, how do we design a PCB for this?"}, {"time": 3795, "text": "How do we solder the components in a small space?"}, {"time": 3799, "text": "How do we make it so that it is robust against, say, voltage fluctuations or mechanical disruption?"}, {"time": 3812, "text": "I know nothing about that when it comes to designing electronics, but I know a lot about that when it comes to writing code."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "So the initial steps are efficient, fast, and there's not much stuff that gets in the way, but you're kind of describing, like Darwin described the evolution of species, right?"}, {"time": 3836, "text": "You're observing of what is true about Python."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "Now if you take a step back, if the act of creating languages is art and you had three months to do it, initial steps, so you just specified a bunch of goals, sort of things that you observe about Python, perhaps you had those goals, but how do you create the rules, the syntactic structure, the features that result in those?"}, {"time": 3865, "text": "So I have in the beginning and I have follow up questions about through the evolution of Python too, but in the very beginning when you were sitting there creating the lexical analyzer or whatever."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "Python was still a big part of it because I sort of, I said to myself, I don't want to have to design everything from scratch, I'm going to borrow features from other languages that I like."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "So you basically, exactly, you first observe what you like."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "But so you borrow ideas and concepts and very concrete sort of local rules from different languages like the indentation and certain other syntactic features from ABC, but I chose to borrow string literals and how numbers work from C and various other things."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "So in then, if you take that further, so yet you've had this funny sounding, but I think surprisingly accurate and at least practical title of benevolent dictator for life for quite, you know, for the last three decades or whatever, or no, not the actual title, but functionally speaking."}, {"time": 3987,

backward compatible to Python 2 in ways that a lot of people know."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "So what was that deliberation, discussion, decision like?"}, {"time": 4011, "text": "What was the psychology of that experience?"}, {"time": 4014, "text": "Do you regret any aspects of how that experience undergone that?"}, {"time": 4018, "text": "Well, yeah, so it was a group process really."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "At that point, even though I was BDFL in name and certainly everybody sort of respected my position as the creator and the current sort of owner of the language design, I was looking at everyone else for feedback."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "Sort of Python 3.0 in some sense was sparked by other people in the community pointing out, oh, well, there are a few issues that sort of bite users over and over."}, {"time": 4066, "text": "Can we do something about that?"}, {"time": 4068, "text": "And for Python 3, we took a number of those Python words as they were called at the time and we said, can we try to sort of make small changes to the language that address those words?"}, {"time": 4086, "text": "And we had sort of in the past, we had always taken backwards compatibility very seriously."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "And so many Python words in earlier versions had already been resolved because they could be resolved while maintaining backwards compatibility or sort of using a very gradual path of evolution of the language in a certain area."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "And so we were stuck with a number of words that were widely recognized as problems, not like roadblocks, but nevertheless sort of things that some people trip over and you know that that's always the same thing that people trip over when they trip."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "And we could not think of a backwards compatible way of resolving those issues."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "But it's still an option to not resolve the issues, right?"}, {"time": 4141, "text": "And so yes, for a long time, we had sort of resigned ourselves to, well, okay, the language is not going to be perfect in this way and that way and that way."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "And we sort of, certain of these, I mean, there are still plenty of things where you can say, well, that particular detail is better in Java or in R or in Visual Basic or whatever."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "And we're okay with that because, well, we can't easily change it."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "It's not too bad."}, {"time": 4178, "text": "We can do a little bit with user education or we can have a static analyzer or warnings in the parse or something."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "But there were things where we thought, well, these are really problems that are not going away."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "They are getting worse in the future."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "We should do something about that."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "But ultimately there is a decision to be made, right?"}, {"time": 4205, "text": "So was that the toughest decision in the history of Python you had to make as the benevolent dictator for life?"}, {"time": 4215, "text": "Or if not, what are there, maybe even on the smaller scale, what was the decision where you were really torn up about?"}, {"time": 4222, "text": "Well, the toughest decision was probably to resign."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "All right, let's go there."},
