solo podcast episodes on difficult topics, especially in history, like the rise and fall of the Third Reich or Stalin, Putin, and many other difficult topics that I'm fascinated by."}, {"time": 389, "text": "I have a worldview that seeks inspiring positive insights, even and perhaps especially from periods of tragedy and evil that perhaps some folks may find value in."}, {"time": 400, "text": "If I can only learn to convey the ideas in my mind as clearly as I think them."}, {"time": 405, "text": "I think deeply and rigorously and precisely, but to be honest, have trouble speaking in a way that reflects that rigor of thought."}, {"time": 416, "text": "So it really does mean a lot, the love and support I get as I try to get better at this thing, at this talking thing."}, {"time": 423, "text": "Anyway, go to masterclass.com slash LEX to get a discount and to support this podcast."}, {"time": 429, "text": "And now finally, here's my conversation with Stephen Wolfram."}, {"time": 434, "text": "You said that there are moments in history of physics and maybe mathematical physics or even mathematics where breakthroughs happen and then a flurry of progress follows."}, {"time": 444, "text": "So if you look back through the history of physics, what moments stand out to you as important such breakthroughs where a flurry of progress follows?"}, {"time": 454, "text": "So the big famous one was 1920s, the invention of quantum mechanics, where in about five or 10 years, lots of stuff got figured out."}, {"time": 463, "text": "That's now quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 465, "text": "Can you mention the people involved?"}, {"time": 466, "text": "Yeah, it was kind of the Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Einstein had been a key figure, originally Planck, then Dirac was a little bit later."}, {"time": 476, "text": "That was something that happened at that time, that's sort of before my time, right?"}, {"time": 480, "text": "In my time was in the 1970s, there was this sort of realization that quantum field theory was actually going to be useful in physics and QCD, quantum thermodynamics theory of quarks and gluons and so on was really getting started."}, {"time": 496, "text": "And there was again, sort of big flurry of things happened then, I happened to be a teenager at that time and happened to be really involved in physics."}, {"time": 506, "text": "And so I got to be part of that, which was really cool."}, {"time": 509, "text": "Who were the key figures aside from your young selves at that time?"}, {"time": 513, "text": "You know, who won the Nobel Prize for QCD, okay?"}, {"time": 517, "text": "People, David Gross, Frank Wilczek, you know, David Politzer."}, {"time": 521, "text": "The people who are the sort of the slightly older generation, Dick Feynman, Murray Gellman, people like that, who were Steve Weinberg, Gerhard Hoft, he's younger, he's in the younger group actually."}, {"time": 534, "text": "But these are all, you know, characters who were involved."}, {"time": 539, "text": "I mean, it's funny because those are all people who are kind of in my time and I know them and they don't seem like sort of historical, you know, iconic figures."}, {"time": 550, "text": "They seem more like everyday characters, so to speak."}, {"time": 554, "text": "And so it's always, you know, when you look at history from long afterwards, it always seems like everything happened instantly."}, {"time": 564, "text": "And that's usually not the case."}, {"time": 565, "text": "There was usually a long buildup, but usually there's, you know, there's some methodological thing happens and then there's a whole bunch of low hanging fruit to be picked."}, {"time": 573, "text": "And that usually lasts five or 10 years."}, {"time": 576, "text": "You know, we see it today with machine learning and, you know, deep learning neural nets and so on."}, {"time": 582, "text": "You know, methodological advance, things actually started working in, you know, 2011, 2012 and so on."}, {"time": 588, "text": "And, you know, there's been this sort of rapid picking of low hanging fruit, which is probably, you know, some significant fraction of the way done, so to speak."}, {"time": 600, "text": "Do you think there's a key moment?"}, {"time": 601, "text": "Like if I had to really introspect, like what was the key moment for the deep learning, quote unquote, revolution?"}, {"time": 608, "text": "It's probably the AlexNet business."}, {"time": 610, "text": "AlexNet with ImageNet."}, {"time": 611, "text": "So is there something like that with physics where, so deep learning neural networks have been around for a long time."}, {"time": 619, "text": "Absolutely, since the 1940s, yeah."}, {"time": 622, "text": "There's a bunch of little pieces that came together and then all of a sudden everybody's eyes lit up."}, {"time": 627, "text": "Like, wow, there's something here."}, {"time": 629, "text": "Like even just looking at your own work, just your thinking about the universe, that there's simple rules can create complexity."}, {"time": 640, "text": "You know, at which point was there a thing where your eyes light up?"}, {"time": 645, "text": "It's like, wait a minute, there's something here."}, {"time": 646, "text": "Is it the very first idea or is it some moment along the line of implementations and experiments and so on?"}, {"time": 654, "text": "There's a couple of different stages to this."}, {"time": 656, "text": "I mean, one is the think about the world computationally."}, {"time": 661, "text": "Can we use programs instead of equations to make models of the world?"}, {"time": 665, "text": "That's something that I got interested in in the beginning of the 1980s."}, {"time": 670, "text": "I did a bunch of computer experiments."}, {"time": 673, "text": "When I first did them, I didn't really, I could see some significance to them, but it took me a few years to really say, wow, there's a big important phenomenon here that lets sort of complex things arise from very simple programs."}, {"time": 687, "text": "That kind of happened back in 1984 or so."}, {"time": 690, "text": "Then, you know, a bunch of other years go by, then I start actually doing a lot of much more systematic computer experiments and things and find out that the, you know, this phenomenon that I could only have said occurs in one particular case is actually something incredibly general."}, {"time": 705, "text": "And then that led me to this thing called principle of computational equivalence."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And that was a long story."}, {"time": 711, "text": "And then, you know, as part of that process, I was like, okay, you can make simple programs, can make models of complicated things."}, {"time": 719, "text": "What about the whole universe?"}, {"time": 720, "text": "That's our sort of ultimate example of a complicated thing."}, {"time": 723, "text": "And so I got to thinking, you know, could we use these ideas to study fundamental physics?"}, {"time": 730, "text": "You know, I happen to know a lot about, you know, traditional fundamental physics."}, {"time": 734, "text": "My first, you know, I had a bunch of ideas about how to do this in the early 1990s."}, {"time": 739, "text": "I made a bunch of technical progress."}, {"time": 741, "text": "I figured out a bunch of things I thought were pretty interesting."}, {"time": 743, "text": "You know, I wrote about them back in 2002."}, {"time": 746, "text": "With the new kind of science in the cellular automata world."}, {"time": 749, "text": "And there's echoes in the cellular automata world with your new Wolfram physics project."}, {"time": 756, "text": "We'll get to all that."}, {"time": 757, "text": "Allow me to sort of romanticize a little more on the philosophy of science."}, {"time": 763, "text": "So Thomas Kuhn, philosopher of science, describes that, you know, the progress in science is made with these paradigm shifts."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And so to link on the sort of original line of discussion, do you agree with this view that there is revolutions in science that just kind of flip the table?"}, {"time": 783, "text": "What happens is it's a different way of thinking about things."}, {"time": 787, "text": "It's a different methodology for studying things."}, {"time": 789, "text": "And that opens stuff up."}, {"time": 791, "text": "There's this idea of, he's a famous biographer, but I think it's called the innovators."}, {"time": 799, "text": "There's a biographer of Steve Jobs, of Albert Einstein."}, {"time": 802, "text": "He also wrote a book, I think it's called the innovators, where he discusses how a lot of the innovations in the history of computing has been done by groups."}, {"time": 813, "text": "There's a complicated group dynamic going on, but there's also a romanticized notion that the individual is at the core of the revolution."}, {"time": 822, "text": "Like where does your sense fall?"}, {"time": 825, "text": "Is ultimately like one person responsible for these revolutions that creates the spark or one or two, whatever, or is it just the big mush and mess and chaos of people interacting, of personalities interacting?"}, {"time": 841, "text": "I think it ends up being like many things, there's leadership and there ends up being, it's a lot easier for one person to have a crisp new idea than it is for a big committee to have a crisp new idea."}, {"time": 850, "text": "And I think, but I think it can happen that you have a great idea, but the world isn't ready for it."}, {"time": 859, "text": "And you can, I mean, this has happened to me plenty, right?"}, {"time": 864, "text": "It's, you have an idea, it's actually a pretty good idea, but things aren't ready, either you're not really ready for it, or the ambient world isn't ready for it."}, {"time": 874, "text": "And it's hard to get the thing to get traction."}, {"time": 878, "text": "I mean, when I look at a new kind of science, you're now living inside the history, so you can't tell the story of these decades, but it seems like the new kind of science has not had the revolutionary impact I would think it might."}, {"time": 899, "text": "Like, it feels like at some point, of course it might be, but it feels at some point people will return to that book and say, that was something special here."}, {"time": 909, "text": "This was incredible."}, {"time": 911, "text": "Or do you think that's already happened?"}, {"time": 913, "text": "Oh, yeah, it's happened, except that people aren't, the sort of the heroism of it may not be there, but what's happened is for 300 years, people basically said, if you want to make a model of things in the world, mathematical equations are the best place to go."}, {"time": 929, "text": "Last 15 years, doesn't happen."}, {"time": 932, "text": "New models that get made of things most often are made with programs, not with equations."}, {"time": 938, "text": "Now, was that sort of going to happen anyway?"}, {"time": 942, "text": "Was that a consequence of my particular work and my particular book?"}, {"time": 947, "text": "It's hard to know for sure."}, {"time": 948, "text": "I mean, I am always amazed at the amounts of feedback that I get from people where they say, oh, by the way, I started doing this whole line of research because I read your book, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 958, "text": "It's like, well, can you tell that from the academic literature?"}, {"time": 961, "text": "Was there a chain of academic references?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "One of the interesting side effects of publishing in the way you did this tome is it serves as an education tool and an inspiration to hundreds of thousands, millions of people, but because it's not a single, it's not a chain of papers with spiffy titles, it doesn't create a splash of citations."}, {"time": 989, "text": "It's had plenty of citations, but it's, you know, I think that people think of it as probably more, you know, conceptual inspiration than kind of a, you know, this is a line from here to here to here in our particular field."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "I think that the thing which I am disappointed by and which will eventually happen is this kind of study of the sort of pure computationalism, this kind of study of the abstract behavior of the computational universe."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "That should be a big thing that lots of people do."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "You mean in mathematics purely, almost like."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "It's like pure mathematics, but it isn't mathematics."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "But it isn't, it isn't."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "It's a new kind of mathematics."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "Is it a new title of the book?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "That's why the book is called that."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "Right, that's not coincidental."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "It's interesting that I haven't seen really rigorous investigation by thousands of people of this idea."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "I mean, you look at your competition around rule 30."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "I mean, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "If you can say something."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "Is there some aspect of this thing that could be predicted?"}, {"time": 1058, "text": "That's the fundamental question of science."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "That's the core."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "Well, that has been a question of science."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "I think that is some people's view of what science is about and it's not clear that's the right view."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "In fact, as we live through this pandemic full of predictions and so on, it's an interesting moment to be pondering what science's actual role in those kinds of things is."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "Or you think it's possible that in science, clean, beautiful, simple prediction may not even be possible in real systems."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "That's the open question."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "I don't think it's open."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "I think that question is answered and the answer is no."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "Well, no, no."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "The answer could be just humans are not smart enough yet."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "Like we don't have the tools yet."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "No, that's the whole point."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "I mean, that's sort of the big discovery of this principle of computational equivalence of mine."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "That there is this fundamental limitation built into science, this idea of computational irreducibility that says that even though you may know the rules by which something operates, that does not mean that you can readily sort of be smarter than it and jump ahead and figure out what it's going to do."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "Yes, but do you think there's a hope for pockets of computational reducibility?"}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Computational reducibility."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And then a set of tools and mathematics that help you discover such pockets."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "That's where we live is in the pockets of reducibility."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "That's why, and this is one of the things that sort of come out of this physics project and actually something that, again, I should have realized many years ago, but didn't, is it could very well be that everything about the world is computationally reducible and completely unpredictable."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "But in our experience of the world, there is at least some amount of prediction we can make."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "And that's because we have sort of chosen a slice of, probably talk about this in much more detail, but I mean, we've kind of chosen a slice of how to think about the universe in which we can kind of sample a certain amount of computational reducibility."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "And that's sort of where we exist."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "And it may not be the whole story of how the universe is, but it is the part of the universe that we care about and we sort of operate in."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "And that's, you know, in science, that's been sort of a very special case of that."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "That is science has chosen to talk a lot about places where there is this computational reducibility that it can find, you know, the motion of the planets can be more or less predicted."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "You know, something about the weather is much harder to predict."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "Something about, you know, other kinds of things that are much harder to predict."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "And it's, these are, but science has tended to, you know, concentrate itself on places where its methods have allowed successful prediction."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "So you think rule 30, if we could linger on it, because it's just such a beautiful, simple formulation of the essential concept underlying all the things we're talking about."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "Do you think there's pockets of reducibility inside rule 30?"}, {"time": 1248, "text": "Yes, that is the question of how big are they?"}, {"time": 1251, "text": "What will they allow you to say?"}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And that's, and figuring out where those pockets are, I mean, in a sense, that's the, that's sort of a, you know, that is an essential thing that one would like to do in science."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "But it's also, the important thing to realize that has not been, you know, is that science, if you just pick an arbitrary thing, you say, what's the answer to this question?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "That question may not be one that has a computationally reducible answer."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "That question, if you choose, you know, if you walk along the series of questions and you've got one that's reducible and you get to another one that's nearby and it's reducible too, if you stick to that kind of stick to the land, so to speak, then you can go down this chain of sort of reducible, answerable things."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "But if you just say, I'm just pick a question at random, I'm gonna have my computer pick a question at random."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "Most likely it's gonna be reducible."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "Most likely it will be reducible."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "And what we're thrown in the world, so to speak, we, you know, when we engineer things, we tend to engineer things to sort of keep in the zone of reducibility."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "When we're throwing things by the natural world, for example, not at all certain that we will be kept in this kind of zone of reducibility."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "Can we talk about this pandemic then?"}, {"time": 1332, "text": "For a second, is a, so how do we, there's obviously huge amount of economic pain that people are feeling."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "There's a huge incentive and medical pain, health, just all kind of psychological."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "There's a huge incentive to figure this out, to walk along the trajectory of reducible, of reducibility."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "There's a lot of disparate data."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "You know, people understand generally how viruses spread, but it's very complicated because there's a lot of uncertainty."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "There's a, there could be a lot of variability also, like so many, obviously a nearly infinite number of variables that represent human interaction."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And so you have to figure out, from the perspective of reducibility, figure out which variables are really important in this kind of, from an epidemiological perspective."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "So why aren't we, you kind of said that we're clearly failing."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "Well, I think it's a complicated thing."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "So, I mean, you know, when this pandemic started up, you know, I happened to be in the middle of being about to release this whole physics project thing, but I thought, you know."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "The timing is just cosmically absurd."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "A little bit bizarre, but you know, but I thought, you know, I should do the public service thing of, you know, trying to understand what I could about the pandemic."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "And, you know, we'd been curating data about it and all that kind of thing."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "But, you know, so I started looking at the data and started looking at modeling and I decided it's just really hard."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "You need to know a lot of stuff that we don't know about human interactions."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "It's actually clear now that there's a lot of stuff we didn't know about viruses and about the way immunity works and so on."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And it's, you know, I think what will come out in the end is there's a certain amount of what happens that we just kind of have to trace each step and see what happens."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "There's a certain amount of stuff where there's going to be a big narrative about this happened because, you know, of T cell immunity."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "This could happen because there's this whole giant sort of field of asymptomatic viral stuff out there."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "You know, there will be a narrative and that narrative, whenever there's a narrative, that's kind of a sign of reducibility."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "But when you just say, let's from first principles figure out what's going on, then you can potentially be stuck in this kind of a mess of irreducibility where you just have to simulate each step and you can't do that unless you know details about, you know, human interaction networks and so on and so on and so on."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "The thing that has been very sort of frustrating to see is the mismatch between people's expectations about what science can deliver and what science can actually deliver, so to speak."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "Because people have this idea that, you know, it's science."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "So there must be a definite answer and we must be able to know that answer."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And, you know, this is, it is both, you know, when you've, after you've played around with sort of little programs in the computational universe, you don't have that intuition anymore."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "You know, it's, I always, I'm always fond of saying, you know, the computational animals are always smarter than you are."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "That is, you know, you look at one of these things and it's like, it can't possibly do such and such a thing."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "Then you run it and it's like, wait a minute, it's doing that thing."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "How does that work?"}, {"time": 1527, "text": "Okay, now I can go back and understand it."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "But that's the brave thing about science is that in the chaos of the irreducible universe, we nevertheless persist to find those pockets."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "That's kind of the whole point."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "That's like, you say that the limits of science, but that, you know, yes, it's highly limited, but there's a hope there."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "And like, there's so many questions I want to ask here."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So one, you said narrative, which is really interesting."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "So obviously from a, at every level of society, you look at Twitter, everybody's constructing narratives about the pandemic, about not just the pandemic, but all the cultural tension that we're going through."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "So there's narratives, but they're not necessarily connected to the underlying reality of these systems."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "So our human narratives, I don't even know if they're, I don't like those pockets of reducibility because we're, it's like constructing things that are not actually representative of reality, and thereby not giving us like good solutions to how to predict the system."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "Look, it gets complicated because, you know, people want to say, explain the pandemic to me, explain what's going to happen."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "In the future."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Yes, but also, can you explain it?"}, {"time": 1608, "text": "Is there a story to tell?"}, {"time": 1609, "text": "What already happened in the past?"}, {"time": 1611, "text": "Yeah, or what's going to happen, but I mean, you know, it's similar to sort of explaining things in AI or in any computational system."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "It's like, you know, explain what happened."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "Well, it could just be this happened because of this detail and this detail and this detail, and a million details, and there isn't a big story to tell."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "There's no kind of big arc of the story that says, oh, it's because, you know, there's a viral field that has these properties and people start showing symptoms."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "You know, when the seasons change, people will show symptoms and people don't even understand, you know, seasonal variation of flu, for example."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "It's something where, you know, there could be a big story, or it could be just a zillion little details that mount up."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "See, but, okay, let's pretend that this pandemic, like the coronavirus, resembles something like the 1D rule 30 cellular automata, okay?"}, {"time": 1665, "text": "So, I mean, that's how epidemiologists model virus spread."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "Indeed, yes."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "They sometimes use cellular automata, yes."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "Yeah, and okay, so you could say it's simplistic, but okay, let's say it's representative of actually what happens."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "You know, the dynamic of, you have a graph, it probably is closer to the hypergraph model."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "It is, yes."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "It's actually, that's another funny thing."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "As we were getting ready to release this physics project, we realized that a bunch of things we'd worked out about foliations of causal graphs and things were directly relevant to thinking about

circle."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "So, you know, Einstein's observation was maybe the physical structure of space is such that space is curved."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "So the shortest distance

thing."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "But then what Einstein did was he wrote down these differential equations that basically represented the curvature of space and its response to the presence of mass

an explanation for gravity, so to speak."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "And the surprise is that from 1915 until today, everything that we've measured about gravity precisely agrees with general relativity."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "And that, you know, it wasn't clear black holes were sort of a predict, well, actually the expansion of the universe was an early potential prediction, although

generate our universe from a data structure, a simple structure, simple set of rules, and we can generate our entire universe."}, {"time": 4482, "text": "Yes, that's the idea."}, {"time": 4482, "text": "That's awe inspiring."}, {"time": 4484, "text": "Right, but so the question is how do you actualize that?"}, {"time": 4490, "text": "What might this rule be like?"}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And so one thing you quickly realize is if you're gonna pack everything about our universe into this tiny rule, not much that we are familiar with in our universe will be obvious in that rule."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "So you don't get to fit all these parameters of the universe, all these features of, you know, this is how space works, this is how time works, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 4512, "text": "You don't get to fit that all in."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "It all has to be sort of packed in to this thing, something much smaller, much more basic, much lower level machine code, so to speak, than that."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "And all the stuff that we're familiar with has to kind of emerge from the operation."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "So the rule in itself, because of the computational reducibility, is not gonna tell you the story."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "It's not gonna give you the answer to, it's not gonna let you predict what you're gonna have for lunch tomorrow, and it's not going to let you predict basically anything about your life, about the universe."}, {"time": 4544, "text": "Right, and you're not going to be able to see in that rule, oh, there's the three for the number of dimensions of space and so on."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "That's not gonna be there."}, {"time": 4552, "text": "Spacetime is not going to be obviously."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "Right, so the question is then, what is the universe made of?"}, {"time": 4557, "text": "That's a basic question."}, {"time": 4560, "text": "And we've had some assumptions about what the universe is made of for the last few thousand years that I think in some cases just turn out not to be right."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "And the most important assumption is that space is a continuous thing."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "That is that you can, if you say, let's pick a point in space."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "We're gonna do geometry."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "We're gonna pick a point."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "We can pick a point absolutely anywhere in space."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "Precise numbers we can specify of where that point is."}, {"time": 4588,

4600, "text": "A point is this indivisible infinitesimal thing."}, {"time": 4607, "text": "Okay, so we might've said that about material objects."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "We might've said that about water, for example."}, {"time": 4612, "text": "We might've said water is a continuous thing that we can just pick any point we want in some water, but actually we know it isn't true."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "We know that water is made of molecules that are discrete."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "And so the question, one fundamental question is what is space made of?"}, {"time": 4628, "text": "And so one of the things that's sort of a starting point for what I've done is to think of space as a discrete thing, to think of there being sort of atoms of space just as there are atoms of material things, although very different kinds of atoms."}, {"time": 4643, "text": "And by the way, I mean, this idea, you know, there were ancient Greek philosophers who had this idea."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "There were, you know, Einstein actually thought this is probably how things would work out."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "I mean, he said, you know, repeatedly he thought that's the way it would work out."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "We don't have the mathematical tools in our time, which was 1940s, 1950s and so on to explore this."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "Like the way he thought, you mean that there is something very, very small and discrete that's underlying space."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "And that means that, so, you know, the mathematical theory, mathematical theories in physics assume that space can be described just as a continuous thing."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "You can just pick coordinates and the coordinates can have any values."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "And that's how you define space."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "Space is this just sort of background sort of theater on which the universe operates."}, {"time": 4693, "text": "But can we draw a distinction between space as a thing that could be described by three values, coordinates, and how you're, are you using the word space more generally when you say?"}, {"time": 4709, "text": "No, I'm just talking about space as in what we experience in the universe."}, {"time": 4714, "text": "So that you think this 3D aspect of it is fundamental."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "No, I don't think that 3D is fundamental at all, actually."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "I think that the thing that has been assumed is that space is this continuous thing where you can just describe it by, let's say three numbers, for instance."}, {"time": 4731, "text": "But most important thing about that is that you can describe it by precise numbers because you can pick any point in space and you can talk about motions, any infinitesimal motion in space."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "And that's what continuous means."}, {"time": 4743, "text": "That's what continuous means."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "That's what, you know, Newton invented calculus to describe these kind of continuous small variations and so on."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "That was, that's kind of a fundamental idea from Euclid on that's been a fundamental idea about space."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "Is that right or wrong?"}, {"time": 4760, "text": "It's right at the level of our experience most of the time."}, {"time": 4765, "text": "It's not right at the level of the machine code, so to speak."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "Machine code."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "Yeah, of the simulation."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "They're the very lowest level of the fabric of the universe, at least under the Wolfram physics model is your senses is discrete."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "So now what does that mean?"}, {"time": 4786, "text": "So it means what is space then?"}, {"time": 4789, "text": "So in models, the basic idea is you say there are these sort of atoms of space."}, {"time": 4796, "text": "They're these points that represent, you know, represent places in space, but they're just discrete points."}, {"time": 4803, "text": "And the only thing we know about them is how they're connected to each other."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "We don't know where they are."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "They don't have coordinates."}, {"time": 4810, "text": "We don't get to say this is a position, such and such."}, {"time": 4812, "text": "It's just, here's a big bag of points."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "Like in our universe, there might be 10 to the 100 of these points."}, {"time": 4818, "text": "And all we know is this point is connected to this other point."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "So it's like, you know, all we have is the friend network, so to speak."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "We don't have, you know, people's, you know, physical addresses."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "All we have is the friend network of these points."}, {"time": 4832, "text": "The underlying nature of reality is kind of like a Facebook."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "We don't know their location, but we have the friends."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "We know which point is connected to which other points."}, {"time": 4841, "text": "And that's all we know."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "And so you might say, well, how on earth can you get something which is like our experience of, you know, what seems like continuous space?"}, {"time": 4850, "text": "Well, the answer is, by the time you have 10 to the 100 of these things, those connections can work in such a way that on a large scale, it will seem to be like continuous space in let's say three dimensions or some other number of dimensions or 2.6 dimensions or whatever else."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "Because they're much, much, much, much larger."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "So like the number of relationships here we're talking about is just a humongous amount."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "So the kind of thing you're talking about is very, very, very small relative to our experience of daily life."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "Right, so I mean, you know, we don't know exactly the size, but maybe 10 to the minus, maybe around 10 to the minus 100 meters."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "So, you know, the size of, to give a comparison, the size of a proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "And so this is something incredibly tiny compared to that."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "And the idea that from that would emerge the experience of continuous space is mind blowing."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "Well, what's your intuition why that's possible?"}, {"time": 4913, "text": "Like, first of all, I mean, we'll get into it, but I don't know if we will through the medium of conversation, but the construct of hypergraphs is just beautiful."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "Cellular automata are beautiful."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "But this thing about, you know, continuity arising from discrete systems is in today's world is actually not so surprising."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "I mean, you know, your average computer screen, right?"}, {"time": 4939, "text": "Every computer screen is made of discrete pixels."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "Yet we have the, you know, we have the idea that we're seeing these continuous pictures."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "I mean, it's, you know, the fact that on a large scale, continuity can arise from lots of discrete elements."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "This is at some level unsurprising now."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "But the pixels have a very definitive structure of neighbors on a computer screen."}, {"time": 4966, "text": "There's no concept of spatial, of space inherent in the underlying fabric of reality."}, {"time": 4976, "text": "So the point is that, but there are cases where there are."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "So for example, let's just imagine you have a square grid."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "Okay, and at every point on the grid, you have one of these atoms of space and it's connected to four other, four other atoms of space on the, you know, Northeast, Southwest corners, right?"}, {"time": 4994, "text": "There you have something where if you zoom out from that, it's like a computer screen."}, {"time": 4999, "text": "Yeah, so the relationship creates the spatial, like the relationship creates a constraint, which then in an emergent sense creates a like, yeah, like basically a spatial coordinate for that thing."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "Even though the individual point doesn't have a space."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "Even though the individual point doesn't know anything, it just knows what its neighbors are."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "On a large scale, it can be described by saying, oh, it looks like it's a, you know, this grid is zoomed out grid."}, {"time": 5032, "text": "You can say, well, you can describe these different points by saying they have certain positions, coordinates, et cetera."}, {"time": 5037, "text": "Now, in the sort of real setup, it's more complicated than that."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "It isn't just a square grid or something."}, {"time": 5043, "text": "It's something much more dynamic and complicated, which we'll talk about."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "But so, you know, the first idea, the first key idea is, you know, what's the universe made of?"}, {"time": 5053, "text": "It's made of atoms of space basically with these connections between them."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "What kind of connections do they have?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "Well, so the simplest kind of thing you might say is, we've got something like a graph where every atom of space, where we have these edges that go between, these connections that go between atoms of space."}, {"time": 5073, "text": "We're not saying how long these edges are."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "We're just saying there is a connection from this place, from this atom to this atom."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "Just a quick pause, because there's a lot of very people that listen to this."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "Just to clarify, because I did a poll actually, what do you think a graph is a long time ago?"}, {"time": 5089, "text": "And it's kind of funny how few people know the term graph outside of computer science."}, {"time": 5096, "text": "Let's call it a network."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "I think that's it."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "Let's call it a network is better."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "So, but every time, I like the word graph though."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "So let's define, let's just say that a graph will use terms nodes and edges maybe."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "And it's just the nodes represent some abstract entity and then the edges represent relationships between those entities."}, {"time": 5115, "text": "So that's what a graph says."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "Sorry, so there you go."}, {"time": 5118, "text": "So that's the basic structure."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "That is the simplest case of a basic structure."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "Actually, it tends to be better to think about hypergraphs."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "So a hypergraph is just, instead of saying there are connections between pairs of things, we say there are connections between any number of things."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "So there might be ternary edges."}, {"time": 5139, "text": "So instead of just having two points are connected by an edge, you say three points are all associated with a hyperedge, are all connected by a hyperedge."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "That's just, at some level, that's a detail."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "It's a detail that happens to make the, for me, sort of in the history of this project, the realization that you could do things that way broke out of certain kinds of arbitrariness that I felt that there was in the model before I had seen how this worked."}, {"time": 5167, "text": "I mean, a hypergraph can be mapped to a graph."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "It's just a convenient representation."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "Mathematical speaking."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "But so then, so, okay, so the first question, the first idea of these models of ours is space is made of these connected sort of atoms of space."}, {"time": 5186, "text": "The next idea is space is all there is."}, {"time": 5189, "text": "There's nothing except for this space."}, {"time": 5191, "text": "So in traditional ideas in physics, people have said there's space, it's kind of a background."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "And then there's matter, all these particles, electrons, all these other things, which exist in space, right?"}, {"time": 5203, "text": "But in this model, one of the key ideas is there's nothing except space."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "So in other words, everything that exists in the universe is a feature of this hypergraph."}, {"time": 5214, "text": "So how can that possibly be?"}, {"time": 5215, "text": "Well, the way that works is that there are certain structures in this hypergraph where you say that little twisty knotted thing, we don't know exactly how this works yet, but we have sort of idea about how it works mathematically."}, {"time": 5230, "text": "This sort of twisted knotted thing, that's the core of an electron."}, {"time": 5234, "text": "This thing over there that has this different form, that's something else."}, {"time": 5238, "text": "So the different peculiarities of the structure of this graph are the very things that we think of as the particles inside the space, but in fact, it's just a property of the space."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "Mind blowing, first of all, that it's mind blowing, and we'll probably talk in its simplicity and beauty."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "Yes, I think it's very beautiful."}, {"time": 5260, "text": "I mean, this is, I'm..."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "But okay, but that's space, and then there's another concept we didn't really kind of mention, but you think it of computation as a transformation."}, {"time": 5270, "text": "Let's talk about time in a second."}, {"time": 5271, "text": "Let's just, I mean, on the subject of space, there's this question of kind of what, there's this idea, there is this hypergraph, it represents space, and it represents everything that's in space."}, {"time": 5283, "text": "The features of that hypergraph, you can say certain features in this part we do know, certain features of the hypergraph represent the presence of energy, for example, or the presence of mass or momentum, and we know what the features of the hypergraph that represent those things are, but it's all just the same hypergraph."}, {"time": 5300, "text": "So one thing you might ask is, you know, if you just look at this hypergraph and you say, and we're gonna talk about sort of what the hypergraph does, but if you say, you know, how much of what's going on in this hypergraph is things we know and care about, like particles and atoms and electrons and all this kind of thing, and how much is just the background of space?"}, {"time": 5320, "text": "So it turns out, so far as in one rough estimate of this, everything that we care about in the universe is only one part in 10 to the 120 of what's actually going on."}, {"time": 5332, "text": "The vast majority of what's happening is purely things that maintain the structure of space."}, {"time": 5337, "text": "That, in other words, that the things that are the features of space that are the things that we consider notable, like the presence of particles and so on, that's a tiny little piece of froth on the top of all this activity that mostly is just intended to, you know, mostly, I can't say intended, there's no intention here, that just maintains the structure of space."}, {"time": 5360, "text": "Let me load that in."}, {"time": 5364, "text": "It just makes me feel so good as a human being."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "To be the froth on the one in a 10 to the 120 or something of, well."}, {"time": 5373, "text": "And also just humbling how, in this mathematical framework, how much work needs to be done on the infrastructure of our universe."}, {"time": 5384, "text": "Right, to maintain the infrastructure of our universe is a lot of work."}, {"time": 5387, "text": "We are merely writing a little tiny things on top of that infrastructure."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "But you were just starting to talk a little bit about, we talked about space, that represents all the stuff that's in the universe."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "The question is, what does that stuff do?"}, {"time": 5406, "text": "And for that, we have to start talking about time and what is time and so on."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "And, you know, one of the basic idea of this model is time is the progression of computation."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "So in other words, we have a structure of space and there is a rule that says how that structure of space will change."}, {"time": 5425, "text": "And it's the application, the repeated application of that rule that defines the progress of time."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "And what does the rule look like in the space of hypergraphs?"}, {"time": 5436, "text": "Right, so what the rule says is something like, if you have a little tiny piece of hypergraph that looks like this, then it will be transformed into a piece of hypergraph that looks like this."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "So that's all it says."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "It says you pick up these elements of space and you can think of these edges, these hyper edges as being relations between elements in space."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "You might pick up these two relations between elements in space."}, {"time": 5463, "text": "And we're not saying where those elements are or what they are, but every time there's a certain arrangement of elements in space, then arrangement in the sense of the way they're connected, then we transform it into some other arrangement."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "So there's a little tiny pattern and you transform it into another little pattern."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "And then because of this, I mean, again, it's kind of similar to cellular automata in that like on paper, the rule looks like super simple."}, {"time": 5486, "text": "It's like, yeah, okay."}, {"time": 5490, "text": "Yeah, right, from this, the universe can be born."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "But like once you start applying it, beautiful structure starts being, potentially can be created."}, {"time": 5501, "text": "And what you're doing is you're applying that rule to different parts, like anytime you match it within the hypergraph."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "And then one of the like incredibly beautiful and interesting things to think about is the order in which you apply that rule, because that pattern appears all over the place."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "Right, so this is a big complicated thing, very hard to wrap one's brain around, okay?"}, {"time": 5526, "text": "So you say the rule is every time you see this little pattern transform it in this way."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "But yet, as you look around the space that represents the universe, there may be zillions of places where that little pattern occurs."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "So what it says is just do this, apply this rule wherever you feel like."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "And what is extremely non trivial is, well, okay, so this is happening sort of in computer science terms, sort of asynchronously, you're just doing it wherever you feel like doing it."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "And the only constraint is that if you're going to apply the rule somewhere, the things to which you apply the rule, the little elements to which you apply the rule, if they have to be, okay, well, you can think of each application of the rule as being kind of an event that happens in the universe."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "And the input to an event has to be ready for the event to occur."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "That is, if one event occurred, if one transformation occurred, and it produced a particular atom of space, then that atom of space has to already exist before another transformation that's going to apply to that atom of space can occur."}, {"time": 5603, "text": "So that's like the prerequisite for the event."}, {"time": 5606, "text": "So that defines a kind of, this sort of set of causal relationships between events."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "It says, this event has to have happened before this event."}, {"time": 5618, "text": "But that is..."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "But that's not a very limiting constraint."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "And what's interesting... You still get the zillion, that's a technical term, options."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "But, okay, so this is where things get a little bit more elaborate, but..."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "But they're mind blowing, so..."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "Right, but so what happens is, so the first thing you might say is, you know, let's... Well, okay, so this question about the freedom of which event you do when."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "Well, let me sort of state an answer and then explain it."}, {"time": 5650, "text": "Okay, the validity of special relativity is a consequence of the fact that in some sense, it doesn't matter in what order you do these underlying things, so long as they respect this kind of set of causal relationships."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "So... And that's the part that's in a certain sense is a really important one, but the fact that it sometimes doesn't matter, that's a..."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "I don't know what to... That's another, like, beautiful thing."}, {"time": 5678, "text": "Well, okay, so there's this idea of what I call causal invariance."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "Causal invariance, exactly."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "So that's a... Really, really powerful idea."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "Right, it's a powerful idea, which has actually arisen in different forms many times in the history of mathematics, mathematical logic, even computer science, has many different names."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "I mean, our particular version of it is a little bit tighter than other versions, but it's basically the same idea."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "Here's how to think about that idea."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "So imagine that...

make another point, which is that it turns out that even if the underlying rule does not have this property of causal invariance, it can turn out that every observation made by observers of the rule can, they can impose what amounts to causal invariance on the rule."}, {"time": 5833, "text": "We can explain that."}, {"time": 5834, "text": "It's a little bit more complicated."}, {"time": 5835,

bit more."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "What's a little more detail like?"}, {"time": 5884, "text": "Well, so one thing that is sort of surprising in this theory is one of the sort of achievements of 20th century physics was kind of bringing space and time together."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "That was, you know, special relativity."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "People talk about space time, this sort

know, and it seems like the theory of relativity sort of says space and time are fundamentally the same kind of thing."}, {"time": 5925, "text": "So one of the things that took a while to understand

kinds of things."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "And so that at first seems like how can that possibly be right?"}, {"time": 5954, "text": "How can that possibly be Lorentz invariant?"}, {"time": 5956, "text": "That's the term for things being, you know, following the rules of special relativity."}, {"time": 5961, "text": "Well, it turns out that when you have causal invariants that, and let's see, we can, it's worth explaining a little bit how this works."}, {"time": 5971, "text": "It's a little bit elaborate, but the basic point is that even though space and time sort of come from very different places, it turns out that the rules of sort of space time that special relativity talks about come out of this model when you're looking at large enough systems."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "So a way to think about this, you know, in terms of when you're looking at large enough systems, the part of that story is when you look at some fluid like water, for example, there are equations that govern the flow of water."}, {"time": 6008, "text": "Those equations are things that apply on a large scale."}, {"time": 6012, "text": "If you look at the individual molecules, they don't know anything about those equations."}, {"time": 6016, "text": "It's just the sort of the large scale effect of those molecules turns out to follow those equations."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "And it's the

time at the lowest level of the model, which is space."}, {"time": 6035, "text": "The hypergraph time is the evolution of this hypergraph."}, {"time": 6039, "text": "But there's also space time that we think about and general relativity for your special relativity."}, {"time": 6047, "text": "Like how do you go from the lowest source code of space and time as we're talking about to the more traditional terminology of space and time?"}, {"time": 6058, "text": "So the key thing is this thing we call the causal graph."}, {"time": 6061, "text": "So the causal graph is the graph of causal relationships between events."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "So every one of these little updating events, every one of these little transformations of the hypergraph happens somewhere in the hypergraph, happens at some stage in the computation."}, {"time": 6078, "text": "That event has a causal relationship to other events in the sense that if another event needs as its input, the output from the first event, there will be a causal relationship of the future event will depend on the past event."}, {"time": 6095, "text": "So you can say it has a causal connection."}, {"time": 6097, "text": "And so you can make this graph of causal relationships between events."}, {"time": 6102, "text": "That graph of causal relationships, causal invariance implies that that graph is unique."}, {"time": 6107, "text": "It doesn't matter even though you think, oh, I'm, let's say we were sorting a string, for example, I did that particular transposition of characters at this time, then I did that one, then I did this one."}, {"time": 6120, "text": "Turns out if you look at the network of connections between those updating events, that network is the same."}, {"time": 6126, "text": "It's the, if you were to, the structure."}, {"time": 6131, "text": "So in other words, if you were to draw that, if you were to put that network on a picture of where you're doing all the updating, the places where you put the nodes of the network will be different, but the way the nodes are connected will always be the same."}, {"time": 6143, "text": "So, but the causal graph is, I don't know, it's kind of an observation, it's not enforced, it's just emergent from a set of events."}, {"time": 6153, "text": "It's a feature of, okay, so what it is is."}, {"time": 6156, "text": "The characteristic, I guess, of the way events happen."}, {"time": 6158, "text": "Right, it's an event can't happen until its input is ready."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "And so that creates this network of causal relationships."}, {"time": 6166, "text": "And that's the causal graph."}, {"time": 6168, "text": "And the thing that the next thing to realize is, okay, we, when you're going to observe what happens in the universe, you have to sort of make sense of this causal graph."}, {"time": 6179, "text": "So, and you are an observer who yourself is part of this causal graph."}, {"time": 6185, "text": "And so that means, so let me give you an example of how that works."}, {"time": 6188, "text": "So imagine we have a really weird theory of physics of the world where it says this updating process, there's only gonna be one update at every moment in time."}, {"time": 6198, "text": "And there's just gonna be like a Turing machine."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "It has a little head that runs around and just is always just updating one thing at a time."}, {"time": 6203, "text": "So you say, I have a theory of physics and the theory of physics says, there's just this one little place where things get updated."}, {"time": 6210, "text": "You say, that's completely crazy because, it's plainly obvious that things are being updated sort of at the same time."}, {"time": 6217, "text": "Async obviously, yeah, at the same time, yeah."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "But the fact is that the thing is that if I'm talking to you and you seem to be being updated as I'm being updated, but if there's just this one little head that's running around updating things, I will not know whether you've been updated or not until I'm updated."}, {"time": 6235, "text": "So in other words, draw this causal graph of the causal relationship between the updatings in you and the updatings in me, it'll still be the same causal graph, whether even though the underlying sort of story of what happens is, oh, there's just this one little thing and it goes and updates in different places in the universe."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "So is that clear or is that a hypothesis?"}, {"time": 6258, "text": "Is that clear that there's a unique causal graph?"}, {"time": 6261, "text": "If there's causal invariance, there's unique causal graph."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "So it's okay to think of what we're talking about as a hypergraph and the operations on it as a kind of touring machine with a single head, like a single guy running around updating stuff."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "Is that safe to intuitively think of it this way?"}, {"time": 6280, "text": "Let me think about that for a second."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "Yes, I think so."}, {"time": 6282, "text": "I think there's nothing, it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 6284, "text": "I mean, you can say, okay, there is one, the reason I'm pausing for a second is that I'm wondering, well, when you say running around, depends how far it jumps every time it runs."},

brain to think of it that way as opposed to simultaneous."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "Well, maybe it's not, okay, but the thing is that's not how we experience the world."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "What we experience is we look around, everything seems to be happening at successive moments in time everywhere in space."}, {"time": 6321, "text": "That is the, and that's partly a feature of our particular construction."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "I mean, that is the speed of light is really fast compared to, you know, we look around, you know, I can see maybe a hundred feet away right now."},

milliseconds or something like that, I don't know."}, {"time": 6346, "text": "And speed of light is much faster."}, {"time": 6347, "text": "Right, you know, light goes, in a billionth of a second light has gone afoot."}, {"time": 6351, "text": "So it goes a billion feet every second."}, {"time": 6353, "text": "There's certain moments through this conversation where I imagine the absurdity of the fact that there's two descendants of apes modeled by a hypergraph that are communicating with each other and experiencing this whole thing as a real time simultaneous update with, I'm taking in

little tangent, I just remembered that we're talking about, I mean, about the fabric of reality."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "Right, so we've got this causal graph that represents the sort of causal relationships between all these events in the universe."}, {"time": 6403, "text": "That causal graph kind of is a representation of space time, but our experience of it requires that we pick reference frames."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "This is kind of a key idea."}, {"time": 6414, "text": "Einstein had this idea that what that means is we have to say, what are we going to pick as being the sort of what we define as simultaneous moments in time?"}, {"time": 6427, "text": "So for example, we can say, you know, how do we set our clocks?"}, {"time": 6433, "text": "You know, if we've got a spacecraft landing on Mars, you know, do we say that, you know, what time is it landing at?"}, {"time": 6439, "text": "Was it, you know, even though there's a 20 minute speed of light delay or something, you know, what time do we say it landed at?"}, {"time": 6445, "text": "How do we set up sort of time coordinates for the world?"}, {"time": 6450, "text": "And that turns out to be that there's kind of this arbitrariness to how we set these reference frames that defines sort of what counts as simultaneous."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "And what is the essence of special relativity is to think about reference frames going at different speeds and to think about sort of how they assign, what counts as space, what counts as time and so on."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "That's all a bit technical, but the basic bottom line is that this causal invariance property, that means that it's always the same causal graph, independent of how you slice it with these reference frames, you'll always sort of see the same physical processes go on."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "And that's basically why special relativity works."}, {"time": 6490, "text": "So there's something like special relativity, like everything around space and time that fits this idea of the causal graph."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "And so that, it's kind of not a big deal because it's kind of a, you know, it was completely unobvious when you started off with saying, we've got this graph, it's being updated in time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that just looks like nothing to do with special relativity."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "And yet you get that."}, {"time": 6545, "text": "And what, I mean, then the thing, I mean, this was stuff that I figured out back in the 1990s."}, {"time": 6551, "text": "The next big thing you get is general relativity."}, {"time": 6556, "text": "And so in this hypergraph, the sort of limiting structure, when you have a very big hypergraph, you can think of as being just like, you know, water seems continuous on a large scale."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "So this hypergraph seems continuous on a large scale."}, {"time": 6570, "text": "One question is, you know, how many dimensions of space does it correspond to?"}, {"time": 6575, "text": "So one question you can ask is, if you've just got a bunch of points and they're connected together, how do you deduce what effective dimension of space that bundle of points corresponds to?"}, {"time": 6586, "text": "And that's pretty easy to explain."}, {"time": 6587, "text": "So basically if you say you've got a point and you look at how many neighbors does that point have?"}, {"time": 6592, "text": "Okay, imagine it's on a square grid."}, {"time": 6594, "text": "Then it'll have four neighbors."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "Go another level out."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "How many neighbors do you get then?"}, {"time": 6600, "text": "What you realize is as you go more and more levels out, as you go more and more distance on the graph out, you're capturing something which is essentially a circle in two dimensions so that, you know, the number of the area of a circle is pi R squared."}, {"time": 6614, "text": "So it's the number of points that you get to goes up like the distance you've gone squared."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "And in general, in D dimensional space, it's R to the power D. It's the number of points you get to if you go R steps on the graph grows like the number of steps you go to the power of the dimension."}, {"time": 6635, "text": "And that's a way that you can estimate the effective dimension of one of these graphs."}, {"time": 6639, "text": "So what does that grow to?"}, {"time": 6641, "text": "So how does the dimension grow?"}, {"time": 6642, "text": "There's a, I mean, obviously the visual aspect of these hypergraphs, they're often visualized in three dimensions."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "So there's a certain kind of structure, like you said, there's, I mean, a circle, a sphere, there's a planar aspect to it, to this graph to where it kind of, it almost starts creating a surface, like a complicated surface, but a surface."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "So how does that connect to effective dimension?"}, {"time": 6671, "text": "Okay, so if you can lay out the graph in such a way that the points in the graph that, you know, the points that are neighbors on the graph are neighbors as you lay them out, and you can do that in two dimensions, then it's gonna approximate a two dimensional thing."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "If you can't do that in two dimensions, if everything would have to fold over a lot in two dimensions, then it's not approximating a two dimensional thing."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "Maybe you can lay it out in three dimensions."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "Maybe you have to lay it out in five dimensions to have it be the case that it sort of smoothly lays out like that."}, {"time": 6702, "text": "Well, but okay, so I apologize for the different tangent questions, but you know, there's an infinity number of possible rules."}, {"time": 6711, "text": "So we have to look for rules that create the kind of structures that are reminiscent for, that have echoes of the different physics theories in them."}, {"time": 6725, "text": "So what kind of rules, is there something simple to be said about the kind of rules that you have found beautiful, that you have found powerful?"}, {"time": 6733, "text": "Right, so I mean, what, you know, one of the features of computational irreducibility is, it's very, you can't say in advance, what's gonna happen with any particular, you can't say, I'm gonna pick these rules from this part of rule space, so to speak, because they're gonna be the ones that are gonna work."},

you know, different properties of the universe, like dimensionality, you know, integer dimensionality, features of other features of quantum mechanics, things like that."}, {"time": 6768, "text": "At this point, what we've got is, we've got rules that any one of those features, we can get a rule that has that feature."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "Yeah, so the."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "We don't have the sort of, the final, here's a rule which has all of these features, we do not have that yet."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "So if I were to try to summarize the Wolfram physics project, which is, you know, something that's been in your brain for a long time, but really has just exploded in activity, you know, only just months ago."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "So it's an evolving thing, and next week, I'll try to publish this conversation as quickly as possible, because by the time it's published, already new things will probably have come out."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "So if I were to

time."}, {"time": 6825, "text": "The progress of time, there's a causal graph that's a characteristic of this, and the basic process of science, of, yeah, of science within the Wolfram physics model

And those are some kind of properties at a certain level, layer of abstraction on the graph."}, {"time": 8378, "text": "And there's, but the layers of abstraction are kind of, they're compounding."}, {"time": 8382, "text": "Stacking up."}, {"time": 8383, "text": "So it's difficult, but..."}, {"time": 8386, "text": "But the specs nevertheless remain the same."}, {"time": 8387, "text": "Okay, the specs underneath."}, {"time": 8389, "text": "So I have an estimate."}, {"time": 8390, "text": "So the question is, what are the units?"}, {"time": 8392, "text": "So we've got these different fundamental constants about the world."}, {"time": 8396, "text": "So one of them is the speed of light, which is the..."}, {"time": 8398, "text": "So the thing that's always the same in all these different ways of thinking about the universe is the notion of time, because time is computation."}, {"time": 8406, "text": "And so there's an elementary time, which is sort of the amount of time that we ascribe to elapsing in a single computational step."}, {"time": 8417, "text": "So that's the elementary time."}, {"time": 8418, "text": "So then there's an elementary... That's a parameter or whatever."}, {"time": 8420, "text": "That's a constant."}, {"time": 8421, "text": "It's whatever we define it to be, because I mean, we don't, you know..."}, {"time": 8425, "text": "I mean, it's all relative, right?"}, {"time": 8426, "text": "It doesn't matter."}, {"time": 8427, "text": "Yes, it doesn't matter what it is, because we could be, it could be slower."}, {"time": 8430, "text": "It's just a number which we use to convert that to seconds, so to speak, because we are experiencing things and we say this amount of time has elapsed, so to speak."}, {"time": 8439, "text": "But we're within this thing."}, {"time": 8442, "text": "So it doesn't matter, right?"}, {"time": 8443, "text": "But what does matter is the ratio, what we can, the ratio of the spatial distance and this hypergraph to this moment of time."}, {"time": 8454, "text": "Again, that's an arbitrary thing, but we measure that in meters per second, for example, and that ratio is the speed of light."}, {"time": 8460, "text": "So the ratio of the elementary distance to the elementary time is the speed of light, okay?"}, {"time": 8467, "text": "And so there's another, there are two other levels of this, okay?"}, {"time": 8471, "text": "So there is a thing which we can talk about, which is the maximum entanglement speed, which is a thing that happens at another level in this whole sort of story of how these things get constructed."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "That's a sort of maximum speed in quantum, in the space of quantum states."}, {"time": 8486, "text": "Just as the speed of light is a maximum speed in physical space, this is a maximum speed in the space of quantum states."}, {"time": 8492, "text": "There's another level which is associated with what we call ruleal space, which is another one of these maximum speeds."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "We'll get to this."}, {"time": 8500, "text": "So these are limitations on the system that are able to capture the kind of

maximum entanglement speed, which is actually something that is possibly measurable, particularly in black hole systems and things like this."}, {"time": 8537, "text": "Anyway, this is long, long story short."}, {"time": 8539, "text": "You're asking what the processing specs of the universe, of the sort of computation of the universe."}, {"time": 8545, "text": "There's a question of even what are the units of some of these measurements, okay?"}, {"time": 8549, "text": "So the units I'm using are Wolfram language instructions per second, okay?"}, {"time": 8553, "text": "Because you gotta have some, what computation are you doing?"}, {"time": 8557, "text": "There gotta be some kind of frame of reference."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "So, because it turns out in the end, there will be, there's sort of an arbitrariness in the language that you use to describe the universe."}, {"time": 8566, "text": "So in those terms, I think it's like 10 to the 500, Wolfram language operations per second, I think, is the, I think it's of that order."}, {"time": 8576, "text": "You know, basically."}, {"time": 8577, "text": "So that's the scale of the computation."}, {"time": 8579, "text": "If there's an interesting thing to say about storage and memory."}, {"time": 8582, "text": "Well, there's a question of how many sort of atoms of space might there be?"}, {"time": 8586, "text": "You know, maybe 10 to the 400."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "We don't know exactly how to estimate these numbers."}, {"time": 8591, "text": "I mean, this is based on some, I would say, somewhat rickety way of estimating things."}, {"time": 8597, "text": "You know, when there start to be able to be experiments done, if we're lucky, there will be experiments that can actually nail down some of these numbers."}, {"time": 8604, "text": "And because of computation reducibility, there's not much hope for very efficient compression, like very efficient representation of this atom space?"}, {"time": 8615, "text": "I mean, there's probably certain things, you know, the fact that we can deduce anything, okay, the question is how deep does the reducibility go?"}, {"time": 8625, "text": "And I keep on being surprised that it's a lot deeper than I thought."}, {"time": 8628, "text": "Okay, and so one of the things is that, that there's a question of sort of how much of the whole of physics do we have to be able to get in order to explain certain kinds of phenomena?"}, {"time": 8639, "text": "Like for example, if we want to study quantum interference, do we have to know what an electron is?"}, {"time": 8645, "text": "Turns out I thought we did, turns out we don't."}, {"time": 8648, "text": "I thought to know what energy is, we would have to know what electrons were."}, {"time": 8653, "text": "So you get a lot of really powerful shortcuts."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "There's a bunch of sort of bulk information about the world."}, {"time": 8659, "text": "The thing that I'm excited about last few days, okay, is the idea of fermions versus bosons, fundamental idea that I mean, it's the reason we have matter that doesn't just self destruct, is because of the exclusion principle that means that two electrons can never be in the same quantum state."}, {"time": 8678, "text": "Is it useful for us to maybe first talk about how quantum mechanics fits into the Wolfram physics model?"}, {"time": 8688, "text": "So we talked about general relativity."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "Now, what have you found from quantum mechanics within and outside of the Wolfram physics?"}, {"time": 8699, "text": "Right, so I mean, the key idea of quantum mechanics that sort of the typical interpretation is classical physics says a definite thing happens."}, {"time": 8709, "text": "Quantum physics says there's this whole set of paths of things that might happen."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "And we are just observing some overall probability of how those paths work."}, {"time": 8719, "text": "Okay, so when you think about our hypergraphs and all these little updates that are going on, there's a very remarkable thing to realize, which is if you say, well, which particular sequence of updates should you do?"}, {"time": 8732, "text": "Say, well, it's not really defined."}, {"time": 8733, "text": "You can do any of a whole collection of possible sequences of updates."}, {"time": 8737, "text": "Okay, that set of possible sequences of updates defines yet another kind of graph that we call a multiway graph."}, {"time": 8746, "text": "And a multiway graph just is a graph where at every node, there is a choice of several different possible things that could happen."}, {"time": 8755, "text": "So for example, you go this way, you go that way."}, {"time": 8757, "text": "Those are two different edges in the multiway graph."}, {"time": 8760, "text": "And you're building up the set of possibilities."}, {"time": 8762, "text": "So actually, like, for example, I just made the one, the multiway graph for tic tac toe, okay?"}, {"time": 8767, "text": "So tic tac toe, you start off with some board that, you know, is everything is blank, and then somebody can put down an X somewhere, an O somewhere, and then there are different possibilities."}, {"time": 8778, "text": "At each stage, there are different possibilities."}, {"time": 8780, "text": "And so you build up this multiway graph of all those possibilities."}, {"time": 8783, "text": "Now notice that even in tic tac toe, you have the feature that there can be something where you have two different things that happen and then those branches merge because you end up with the same shape, you know, the same configuration of the board, even though you got there in two different ways."}, {"time": 8800, "text": "So the thing that's sort of an inevitable feature of our models is that just like quantum mechanics suggests, definite things don't happen."}, {"time": 8808, "text": "Instead, you get this whole multiway graph of all these possibilities."}, {"time": 8812, "text": "Okay, so then the question is, so, okay, so that's sort of a picture of what's going on."}, {"time": 8818, "text": "Now you say, okay, well, quantum mechanics has all these features of, you know, all this mathematical structure and so on."}, {"time": 8824, "text": "How do you get that mathematical structure?"}, {"time": 8827, "text": "Okay, a couple of things to say."}, {"time": 8828, "text": "So quantum mechanics is actually, in a sense, two different theories glued together."}, {"time": 8833, "text": "Quantum mechanics is the theory of how quantum amplitudes work that more or less give you the probabilities of things happening."}, {"time": 8840, "text": "And it's the theory of quantum measurement, which is the theory of how we actually conclude definite things."}, {"time": 8847, "text": "Because the mathematics just gives you these quantum amplitudes, which are more or less probabilities of things happening, but yet we actually observe definite things in the world."}, {"time": 8856, "text": "Quantum measurement has always been a bit mysterious."}, {"time": 8859, "text": "It's always been something where people just say, well, the mathematics says this, but then you do a measurement, and there are philosophical arguments about what the measurement is."}, {"time": 8866, "text": "But it's not something where there's a theory of the measurement."}, {"time": 8869, "text": "Somebody on Reddit also asked, please ask Stephen to tell his story of the double slit experiment."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "Okay, yeah, I can."}, {"time": 8881, "text": "Is that, does that make sense?"}, {"time": 8882, "text": "Oh yeah, it makes sense."}, {"time": 8883, "text": "Absolutely makes sense."}, {"time": 8885, "text": "Why, is this like a good way to discuss?"}, {"time": 8888, "text": "Let me go, let me explain a couple of things first."}, {"time": 8890, "text": "So the structure of quantum mechanics is mathematically quite complicated."}, {"time": 8896, "text": "One of the features, let's see, well, how to describe this."}, {"time": 8900, "text": "Okay, so first point is there's this multiway graph of all these different paths of things that can happen in the world."}, {"time": 8908, "text": "And the important point is that these, you can have branchings and you can have mergings."}, {"time": 8915, "text": "Okay, so this property turns out causal invariance is the statement that the number of mergings is equal to the number of branchings."}, {"time": 8926, "text": "So in other words, every time there's a branch, eventually there will also be a merge."}, {"time": 8930, "text": "In other words, every time there were two possibilities for what might've happened, eventually those will merge."}, {"time": 8935, "text": "Beautiful concept by the way, but yeah, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "So that idea, okay, so then, so that's one thing and that's closely related to the sort of objectivity in quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 8948, "text": "The fact that we believe definite things happen, it's because although there are all these different paths, in some sense, because of causal invariance, they all imply the same thing."}, {"time": 8957, "text": "I'm cheating a little bit in saying that, but that's roughly the essence of what's going on."}, {"time": 8962, "text": "Okay, next thing to think about is you have this multiway graph, it has all these different possible things that are happening."}, {"time": 8970, "text": "Now we ask, this multiway graph is sort of evolving with time."}, {"time": 8974, "text": "Over time, it's branching, it's merging, it's doing all these things, okay?"}, {"time": 8979, "text": "Question we can ask is if we slice it at a particular time, what do we see?"}, {"time": 8986, "text": "And that slice represents in a sense, something to do with the state of the universe at a particular time."}, {"time": 8993, "text": "So in other words, we've got this multiway graph of all these possibilities, and then we're asking, okay, we take the slice, this slice represents, okay, each of these different paths corresponds to a different quantum possibility for what's happening."}, {"time": 9009, "text": "When we take the slice, we're saying, what are the set of quantum possibilities that exist at a particular time?"}, {"time": 9014, "text": "And when you say slice, you slice the graph and then there's a bunch of leaves."}, {"time": 9019, "text": "A bunch of leaves."}, {"time": 9020, "text": "Those represent the state of things."}, {"time": 9023, "text": "Right, but then, okay, so the important thing that you are quickly picking up on is that what matters is kind of how these leaves are related to each other."}, {"time": 9034, "text": "So a good way to tell how leaves are related is just to say on the step before do they have a common ancestor?"}, {"time": 9042, "text": "So two leaves might be, they might have just branched from one thing or they might be far away, way far apart in this graph where to get to a common ancestor, maybe you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the graph, all the way back to the beginning."}, {"time": 9055, "text": "So there's some kind of measure of distance."}, {"time": 9057, "text": "Right, but what you get is by making the slice, we call it branchial space, the space of branches."}, {"time": 9065, "text": "And in this branchial space, you have a graph that represents the relationships between these quantum states in branchial space."}, {"time": 9074, "text": "You have this notion of distance in branchial space."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "It's connected to quantum entanglement."}, {"time": 9080, "text": "Yes, yes, it's basically, the distance in branchial space is kind of an entanglement distance."}, {"time": 9087, "text": "So this."}, {"time": 9088, "text": "That's a very nice model."}, {"time": 9089, "text": "Right, it is very nice, it's very beautiful."}, {"time": 9093, "text": "I mean, it's so clean."}, {"time": 9095, "text": "I mean, it's really, and it tells one, okay, so anyway, so then this branchial space has this sort of map of the entanglements between quantum states."}, {"time": 9107, "text": "So in physical space, we have, so you can say, take, let's say the causal graph, and we can slice that at a particular time, and then we get this map of how things are laid out in physical space."}, {"time": 9121, "text": "When we do the same kind of thing, there's a thing called the multiway causal graph, which is the analog of a causal graph for the multiway system."}, {"time": 9127, "text": "We slice that, we get essentially the relationships between things, not in physical space, but in the space of quantum states."}, {"time": 9135, "text": "It's like which quantum state is similar to which other quantum state."}, {"time": 9139, "text": "Okay, so now I think next thing to say is just to mention how quantum measurement works."}, {"time": 9144, "text": "So quantum measurement has to do with reference frames in branchial space."}, {"time": 9149, "text": "So, okay, so measurement in physical space, it matters whether how we assign spatial position and how we define coordinates in space and time."}, {"time": 9162, "text": "And that's how we make measurements in ordinary space."}, {"time": 9165, "text": "Are we making a measurement based on us sitting still here?"}, {"time": 9168, "text": "Are we traveling at half the speed of light and making measurements that way?"}, {"time": 9171, "text": "These are different reference frames in which we're making our measurements."}, {"time": 9174, "text": "And the relationship between different events and different points in space and time will be different depending on what reference frame we're in."}, {"time": 9184, "text": "Okay, so then we have this idea of quantum observation frames, which are the analog of reference frames, but in branchial space."}, {"time": 9193, "text": "And so what happens is what we realize is that a quantum measurement is the observer is sort of arbitrarily determining this reference frame."}, {"time": 9203, "text": "The observer is saying, I'm going to understand the world by saying that space and time are coordinated this way."}, {"time": 9210, "text": "I'm gonna understand the world by saying that quantum states and time are coordinated in this way."}, {"time": 9216, "text": "And essentially what happens is that the process of quantum measurement is a process of deciding how you slice up this multiway system in these quantum observation frames."}, {"time": 9228, "text": "So in a sense, the observer, the way the observer enters is by their choice of these quantum observation frames."}, {"time": 9235, "text": "And what happens is that the observer, because, okay, this is again, another stack of other concepts, but anyway, because the observer is computationally bounded, there is a limit to the type of quantum observation frames that they can construct."}, {"time": 9249, "text": "Interesting, okay, so there's some constraints, some limit on the choice of observation frames."}, {"time": 9257, "text": "Right, and by the way, I just want to mention that there's a, I mean, it's bizarre, but there's a hierarchy of these things."}, {"time": 9263, "text": "So in thermodynamics, the fact that we believe entropy increases, we believe things get more disordered, is a consequence of the fact that we can't track each individual molecule."}, {"time": 9274, "text": "If we could track every single molecule, we could run every movie in reverse, so to speak, and we would not see that things are getting more disordered."}, {"time": 9282, "text": "But it's because we are computationally bounded, we can only look at these big blobs of what all these molecules collectively do, that we think that things are, that we describe it in terms of entropy increasing and so on."}, {"time": 9295, "text": "And it's the same phenomenon, basically, and also a consequence of computational irreducibility that causes us to basically be forced to conclude that definite things happen in the world, even though there's this quantum, this set of all these different quantum processes that are going on."}, {"time": 9311, "text": "So, I mean, I'm skipping a little bit, but that's a rough picture."}, {"time": 9318, "text": "And in the evolution of the Wolfram Physics Project, where do you feel we stand on some of the puzzles that are along the way?"}, {"time": 9325, "text": "See, you're skipping along a bunch of stuff."}, {"time": 9328, "text": "It's amazing how much these things are unraveling."}, {"time": 9330, "text": "I mean, you know, these things, look, it used to be the case that I would agree with Dick Feynman, nobody understands quantum mechanics, including me, okay?"}, {"time": 9338, "text": "I'm getting to the point where I think I actually understand quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 9341, "text": "My exercise, okay, is can I explain quantum mechanics for real at the level of kind of middle school type explanation?"}, {"time": 9350, "text": "And I'm getting closer, it's getting there."}, {"time": 9352, "text": "I'm not quite there, I've tried it a few times, and I realized that there are things where I have to start talking about elaborate mathematical concepts and so on."}, {"time": 9360, "text": "But I think, and you've got to realize that it's not self evident that we can explain at an intuitively graspable level, something which, about the way the universe works, the universe wasn't built for our understanding, so to speak."}, {"time": 9376, "text": "But I think then, okay, so another important idea is this idea of branchial space, which I mentioned, this sort of space of quantum states."}, {"time": 9387, "text": "It is, okay, so I mentioned Einstein's equations describing the effect of mass and energy on trajectories of particles, on GD6."}, {"time": 9400, "text": "The curvature of physical space is associated with the presence of energy, according to Einstein's equations, okay?"}, {"time": 9409, "text": "So it turns out that, rather amazingly, the same thing is true in branchial space."}, {"time": 9414, "text": "So it turns out the presence of energy or more accurately Lagrangian density, which is a kind of relativistic invariant version of energy, the presence of that causes essentially deflection of GD6 in this branchial space, okay?"}, {"time": 9431, "text": "So you might say, so what?"}, {"time": 9461, "text": "And so the big story has been, how do you derive these quantum amplitudes?"}, {"time": 9465, "text": "And people think these quantum amplitudes, they have a complex number, has a real part and an imaginary part."}, {"time": 9471, "text": "You can also think of it as a magnitude and a phase."}, {"time": 9473, "text": "And people have sort of thought these quantum amplitudes have magnitude and phase, and you compute those together."}, {"time": 9480, "text": "Turns out that the magnitude and the phase come from completely different places."}, {"time": 9486, "text": "The magnitude comes, okay, so how do you compute things in quantum mechanics?"}, {"time": 9490, "text": "Roughly, I'm telling you, I'm getting there to be able to do this at a middle school level, but I'm not there yet."}, {"time": 9497, "text": "Roughly what happens is you're asking, does this state in quantum mechanics evolve to this other state in quantum mechanics?"}, {"time": 9507, "text": "And you can think about that like a particle traveling or something traveling through physical space, but instead it's traveling through branchial space."}, {"time": 9516, "text": "And so what's happening is, does this quantum state evolve to this other quantum state?"}, {"time": 9519, "text": "It's like saying, does this object move from this place in space to this other place in space?"}, {"time": 9525, "text": "Okay, now the way that these quantum amplitudes characterize kind of to what extent the thing will successfully reach some particular point in branchial space, just like in physical space, you could say, oh, it had a certain velocity and it went in this direction."}, {"time": 9542, "text": "In branchial space, there's a similar kind of concept."}, {"time": 9545, "text": "Is there a nice way to visualize for me now mentally branchial space?"}, {"time": 9550, "text": "It's just, you have this hypergraph, sorry, you have this multiway graph."}, {"time": 9555, "text": "It's this big branching thing, branching and merging thing."}, {"time": 9558, "text": "But I mean, like moving through that space, I'm just trying to understand what that looks like."}, {"time": 9565, "text": "You know, that space is probably exponential dimensional, which makes it again, another can of worms in understanding what's going on."}, {"time": 9573, "text": "That space as in an ordinary space, this hypergraph, the spatial hypergraph limits to something which is like a manifold, like something like three dimensional space."}, {"time": 9585, "text": "Almost certainly the multiway graph limits to a Hilbert space, which is something that, I mean, it's just a weird exponential dimensional space."}, {"time": 9595, "text": "And by the way, you can ask, I mean, there are much weirder things that go on."}, {"time": 9598, "text": "For example, one of the things I've been interested in is the expansion of the universe in branchial space."}, {"time": 9603, "text": "So we know the universe is expanding in physical space, but the universe is probably also expanding in branchial space."}, {"time": 9610, "text": "So that means the number of quantum states of the universe is increasing with time."}, {"time": 9615, "text": "The diameter of the thing is growing."}, {"time": 9617, "text": "Right, so that means that the, and by the way, this is related to whether quantum computing can ever work."}, {"time": 9629, "text": "Okay, so let me explain why."}, {"time": 9630, "text": "So let's talk about, okay, so first of all, just to finish the thought about quantum amplitudes, that the incredibly beautiful thing, but I'm just very excited about this."}, {"time": 9640, "text": "The fine path integral is this formula."}, {"time": 9644, "text": "It says that the amplitude, the quantum amplitude is E to the I S over H bar, where S is the thing called the action."}, {"time": 9651, "text": "And it, okay, so that can be thought of as representing a deflection of the angle of this path in the multiway graph."}, {"time": 9662, "text": "So it's a deflection of a geodesic in the multiway path that is caused by this thing called the

slit."}, {"time": 9805, "text": "And what happens in this model, and we've just been understanding this in the last few weeks, actually, is that what essentially happens is that the double slit experiment is a story of the interface between branchial space and physical space."}, {"time": 9821, "text": "And what's essentially happening is that the destructive interference is the result of the two possible paths associated with photons going through those two slits winding up at opposite ends of branchial space."}, {"time": 9833, "text": "And so that's why there's sort of nothing there when you look at it, is because these two different sort of branches couldn't get merged together to produce something that you can measure in physical space."}, {"time": 9847, "text": "Is there a lot to be understood about branchial space?"}, {"time": 9850, "text": "I guess, mathematically speaking."}, {"time": 9853, "text": "Yes, it's a very beautiful mathematical thing."}, {"time": 9856, "text":

bothering to do quantum computing research?"}, {"time": 10100, "text": "No, because what they're really doing is they're trying to use physics to get to a new level of what's possible in computing."},

that's been a, was a big thing that I think we're, we're pretty close to."}, {"time": 11090, "text": "I mean, I can give you a little bit of the roadmap."}, {"time": 11092, "text": "It's sort of interesting to see, it's like, what are particles?"}, {"time": 11095, "text": "What are things like electrons?"}, {"time": 11096, "text": "How do they really work?"}, {"time": 11098, "text": "Are you

11108, "text": "So the first thing we want to understand is the quantization of spin."}, {"time": 11113, "text": "So particles, they, they kind of spin, they have a certain angular momentum, that

a quite elaborate mathematical story about homotopic groups in twister space and all kinds of things."}, {"time": 11154, "text": "But bottom line is that seems within reach."}, {"time": 11158, "text": "And that's, that's a big deal because that's a very core feature of understanding how particles work in quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 11164, "text": "Another core feature is this difference between particles that obey the exclusion principle and sort of stay apart, that leads to the stability of matter and things like that, and particles that love to get together and be in the same state, things like photons, that, and that's what leads to phenomena like lasers, where you can get sort of coherently everything in the same state."}, {"time": 11185, "text": "That difference is the particles of integer spin are bosons like to get together in the same state, the particles of half integer spin are fermions, like electrons that they tend to stay apart."}, {"time": 11197, "text": "And so the

really close."}, {"time": 11211, "text": "Is this connected fermions and bosons?"}, {"time": 11214, "text": "So this was what happens is what seems to happen, okay?"}, {"time": 11217, "text": "It's, you know, subject to revision in the next few days."}, {"time": 11221, "text": "But what seems to be the case is that bosons are associated with essentially merging in multiway graphs, and fermions are associated with branching in multiway graphs."}, {"time": 11231, "text": "And that essentially the exclusion principle is the fact that in branchial space, things have a certain extent in branchial space that in which things are being sort of forced apart in branchial space, whereas the case of bosons, they get, they come together in branchial space."}, {"time": 11249, "text": "And the

cases."}, {"time": 11310, "text": "It's why are spinners important in quantum mechanics?"}, {"time": 11314, "text": "Can you just give a...

this?"}, {"time": 11768, "text": "And I thought it was, might be one of these things where you just, you know, you can get it to the threshold, and then you find out its rule number, such and such,

these morphisms, these connections between categories."}, {"time": 13445, "text": "Okay, so it turns out the morphisms and categories, at least weak categories, are very much like the paths in our hypergraphs and things."}, {"time": 13454, "text": "And it turns out, again, this is where it all gets crazy."}, {"time": 13458, "text": "I mean, the fact that these things are connected is just bizarre."}, {"time": 13462, "text": "So category theory, our causal graphs are like second order category theory."}, {"time": 13469, "text": "And it turns out you can take the limits of infinite order

13547, "text": "No, but the thing which is sort of interesting to me is that there's sort of an upper reach of mathematics, of the abstraction of mathematics."}, {"time": 13555, "text": "This thing,

it's this limiting object."}, {"time": 13589, "text": "And this is an instance of that limiting object."}, {"time": 13593, "text": "So what to me is, I mean, again, I've been always afraid of this kind of mathematics because it seemed incomprehensibly abstract to me."}, {"time": 13602, "text": "But what I'm sort of excited about with this is that we've sort of concretified the way that you can reach this kind of mathematics, which makes it, well, both seem more relevant and also the fact that I don't yet know exactly what mileage we're gonna get from using the sort of the apparatus that's been built in those areas of mathematics to analyze what we're doing."}, {"time": 13626, "text": "But the thing that's."}, {"time": 13627, "text": "So both ways."}, {"time": 13628, "text": "So using

this obviously, because I like to think about these meta questions of, you know, what's happening is this model that we have is an incredibly minimal model."}, {"time": 13868, "text": "And once you have an incredibly minimal model, and this happened with cellular automata as well, cellular automata are an incredibly minimal model."}, {"time": 13876, "text": "And so it's inevitable that it gets you, it's sort of an upstream thing that gets used in lots of different places."}, {"time": 13882, "text": "And it's like, you know, the fact that it gets used, you know, cellular automata is sort of a minimal model of let's say road traffic flow or something."}, {"time": 13889, "text": "And they're also a minimal model of something in, you know, chemistry, and they're also a minimal model of

misquoting."}, {"time": 14058, "text": "But I mean, the question is, is beauty a guide to whether something is correct?"}, {"time": 14066, "text": "Which is kind of also the story of Occam's razor."},

that as an argument for the existence of God because it's like, why is there order in the universe?"}, {"time": 14129, "text": "Why doesn't every single particle in the universe just do its own thing?"}, {"time": 14133, "text": "Something must be making there be order in the universe."}, {"time": 14137, "text": "We, in the sort of early theology point of view, that's the role of God is to do that, so to speak."}, {"time": 14145, "text": "In our, we might say, it's the role of a formal theory to do that."}, {"time": 14150, "text": "And then the question is, but how simple should that theory be?"}, {"time": 14153, "text": "And should that theory be one that, where I think the point is, if it's simple, it's almost inevitably somewhat beautiful in the sense that, because all the stuff that we see has to fit into this little tiny theory."}, {"time": 14168, "text": "And the way it does that has to be, it depends on your notion of beauty, but I mean, for me, the sort of the surprising connectivity of it is, at least in my aesthetic, that's something that responds to my aesthetic."}, {"time": 14185, "text": "But the question is, I mean, you're a fascinating person in the sense that you're at once talking about computational, the fundamental computational reducibility of the universe, and on the other hand, trying to come up with a theory of everything, which simply describes the, the simple origins of that computational reducibility."}, {"time": 14211, "text": "I mean, both of those things are kind of, it's paralyzing to think that we can't make any sense of the universe in the general case, but it's hopeful to think like, one, we can think of a rule and that generates this whole complexity, and two, we can find pockets of reducibility that are powerful for everyday life to do different kinds of predictions."}, {"time": 14235, "text": "I suppose Sabine wants to find, focus on the finding of small pockets of reducibility versus the theory of everything."}, {"time": 14281, "text": "I mean, my main point was this new kind of science, and it's like, you can apply it to biology, you can apply it to, you know, other kinds of physics, you can apply it to fundamental physics, it's just an application, so to speak, it's not the core thing."}, {"time": 14294, "text": "But then, you know, one of the things that was interesting with that book

like, you know, if what you're doing is right, it'll overturn 50 years of what we've been doing."}, {"time": 14324, "text": "And it's like, no, it won't, was what I was saying."}, {"time": 14326,

the methods that we have and we're just fine here."}, {"time": 14420, "text": "Now what's happened in the last 18 years or so, I think there's a couple of things have happened."}, {"time": 14425,

15040, "text": "Warp drive, yeah."}, {"time": 15041, "text": "So like, would we be able to, will, you know, will like Elon Musk start paying attention?"}, {"time": 15047, "text": "Like it's awfully

15055, "text": "I agreed to give a talk at some NASA workshop in a few weeks about faster than light travel."}, {"time": 15059, "text": "So I haven't figured it out yet, but no, but."}, {"time": 15062, "text": "You got two weeks."}, {"time": 15064, "text": "But do you think that kind of understanding of fundamental theory of physics can lead to those engineering breakthroughs?"}, {"time": 15069, "text": "Okay, I think it's far away, but I'm not certain."}, {"time": 15072, "text": "I mean, you know, this is the thing that, I set myself an exercise when gravity waves, gravitational waves were discovered, right?"}, {"time": 15079, "text": "I set myself the exercise of what would black hole technology look like?"}, {"time": 15083, "text": "In other words, right now, you know, black

right in our backyard."}, {"time": 15092, "text": "You know, what kind of technology could we build with them?"}, {"time": 15121, "text": "And then the questions, another one, okay, this is another crazy one, is the thing that I'm calling a vacuum cleaner, okay?"}, {"time": 15127, "text": "So, I mentioned that, you know, there's all this activity in the universe, which is maintaining the structure of space."}, {"time": 15134, "text": "And that leads to a certain energy density effectively in space."}, {"time": 15140, "text": "And so the question, in fact, dark energy is a story of essentially negative mass produced by the absence of energy you thought would be there, so to speak."}, {"time": 15153, "text": "And we don't know exactly how it works in either our model or the physical universe, but this notion of a vacuum cleaner is a thing where, you know, you have all these things that are maintaining the structure of space, but what if you could clean out some of that stuff that's maintaining the structure of space and make a simpler vacuum somewhere?"}, {"time": 15171, "text": "You know, what would that do?"}, {"time": 15172, "text": "A totally different kind of vacuum."}, {"time": 15174, "text": "Right, and that would lead to negative energy density, which would need to, so gravity is usually a purely attractive force, but negative mass would lead to repulsive gravity and lead to all kinds of weird things."}, {"time": 15188, "text": "Now, can it be done in our universe?"}, {"time": 15191, "text": "You know, my immediate thought is no, but you know, the fact is that, okay, so here's the thing."}, {"time": 15198, "text": "Well, once you understand the fact, because you're saying like, at this level of abstraction, can we reach to the lower levels and mess with it?"}, {"time": 15206, "text": "Once you understand the levels, I think you can start to."}, {"time": 15207, "text": "I know, and I'm, you know, I have to say that this reminds me of people telling one years ago that, you know, you'll never transmit data over a copper wire at more than 1,000, you know, 1,000 board or something, right?"}, {"time": 15221, "text": "And this is, why did that not happen?"}, {"time": 15223, "text": "You know, why do we have this much, much faster data transmission?"}, {"time": 15226, "text": "Because we've understood many more of the details of what's actually going on."}, {"time": 15230, "text": "And it's the same exact story here."}, {"time": 15232, "text": "And it's the same, you know, I think that this, as I say, I think one of the features of sort of, one of the things about our time that will seem incredibly naive in the future is the belief that, you know, things like heat is just random motion of molecules, that it's just throw up your hands, it's just random."}, {"time": 15252, "text": "We can't say anything about it."}, {"time": 15254, "text": "That will seem naive."}, {"time": 15255, "text": "Yeah, at the heat death

have huge engineering impact."}, {"time": 15305, "text": "Right, and I think that that's right."}, {"time": 15307, "text": "And I mean, we live in, you know, we make use of so many of those pockets."}, {"time": 15311, "text": "And the fact is, you know, I, you know, this is, yes, it's a, you know, it's one of these things where, where, you know, I'm a person who likes to figure out ideas and so on, and the sort of tests of my level of imagination, so to speak."}, {"time": 15329, "text": "And so a couple of places where there's sort of serious humility in terms of my level of
