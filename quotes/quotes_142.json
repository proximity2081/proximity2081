[{"title": "David Eagleman: Neuroplasticity and the Livewired Brain | Lex Fridman Podcast #119", "id": "386s-y1aRRo", "quotes": [{"time": 313, "text": "It's called Livewired by the way."}, {"time": 314, "text": "Yeah, the thing is we typically think about the brain in terms of the metaphors we already have, like hardware and software, that's how we build all our stuff, but what's happening in the brain is fundamentally so different."}, {"time": 326, "text": "So I coined this new term liveware, which is a system that's constantly reconfiguring itself physically as it learns and adapts to the world around it."}, {"time": 337, "text": "It's physically changing."}, {"time": 338, "text": "So it's liveware meaning like hardware but changing."}, {"time": 344, "text": "Well, the hardware and the software layers are blended and so typically engineers are praised for their efficiency and making something really clean and clear, like, okay, here's the hardware layer, then I'm gonna run software on top of it."}, {"time": 357, "text": "And there's all sorts of universality that you get out of a piece of hardware like that that's useful."}, {"time": 362, "text": "But what the brain is doing is completely different."}, {"time": 365, "text": "And I am so excited about where this is all going because I feel like this is where our engineering will go."}, {"time": 373, "text": "So currently we build all our devices a particular way, but I can't tear half the circuitry out of your cell phone and expect it to still function."}, {"time": 382, "text": "But you can do that with the brain."}, {"time": 386, "text": "So just as an example, kids who are under about seven years old can get one half of their brain removed, it's called a hemispherectomy, and they're fine."}, {"time": 395, "text": "They have a slight limp on the other side of their body, but they can function just fine that way."}, {"time": 400, "text": "And this is generally true."}, {"time": 402, "text": "You know, sometimes children are born without a hemisphere and their visual system rewires so that everything is on the single remaining hemisphere."}, {"time": 412, "text": "What thousands of cases like this teach us is that it's a very malleable system that is simply trying to accomplish the tasks in front of it by rewiring itself with the available real estate."}, {"time": 426, "text": "How much of that is a quirk or a feature of evolution?"}, {"time": 429, "text": "Like, how hard is it to engineer?"}, {"time": 431, "text": "Because evolution took a lot of work."}, {"time": 434, "text": "Trillions of organisms had to die for it to create this thing we have in our skull."}, {"time": 441, "text": "Like, because you said you kind of look forward to the idea that we might be engineering our systems like this in the future, like creating liveware systems."}, {"time": 450, "text": "How hard do you think is it to create systems like that?"}, {"time": 454, "text": "It has proven itself to be a difficult challenge."}, {"time": 457, "text": "What I mean by that is even though it's taken evolution a really long time to get where it is now, all we have to do now is peek at the blueprints."}, {"time": 467, "text": "It's just three pounds, this organ, and we just figure out how to do it."}, {"time": 470, "text": "But that's the part that I mean is a difficult challenge because there are tens of thousands of neuroscientists, we're all poking and prodding and trying to figure this out, but it's an extremely complicated system."}, {"time": 480, "text": "But it's only gonna be complicated until we figure out the general principles."}, {"time": 485, "text": "Exactly like if you had a magic camera you could look inside the nucleus of a cell and you'd see hundreds of thousands of things moving around or whatever, and then it takes Crick and Watson to say, oh, you know what, you're just trying to maintain the order of the base pairs and all the rest is details."}, {"time": 500, "text": "Then it simplifies it and we come to understand something."}, {"time": 503, "text": "That was my goal in LiveWire, which I've written over 10 years, by the way, is to try to distill things down to the principles of what plastic systems are trying to accomplish."}, {"time": 514, "text": "But to even just linger, you said, it's possible to be born with just one hemisphere and you still are able to function."}, {"time": 521, "text": "First of all, just to pause on that, I mean, that's kind of, that's amazing."}, {"time": 527, "text": "I don't know if people quite, I mean, you kind of hear things here and there."}, {"time": 531, "text": "This is why I'm kind of, I'm really excited about your book is I don't know if there's definitive sort of popular sources to think about this stuff."}, {"time": 541, "text": "I mean, there's a lot of, I think from my perspective, what I heard is there's like been debates over decades about how much neuroplasticity there is in the brain and so on, and people have learned a lot of things and now it's converging towards people that are understanding there's much more plastic than people realize."}, {"time": 561, "text": "But just like linger on that topic, like how malleable is the hardware of the human brain?"}, {"time": 568, "text": "Maybe you said children at each stage of life."}, {"time": 572, "text": "Yeah, so here's the whole thing."}, {"time": 573, "text": "I think part of the confusion about plasticity has been that there are studies at all sorts of different ages, and then people might read that from a distance and they think, oh, well, Fred didn't recover when half his brain was taken out and so clearly you're not plastic, but then you do it with a child and they are plastic."}, {"time": 592, "text": "And so part of my goal here was to pull together the tens of thousands of papers on this, both from clinical work and from all the way down to the molecular and understand what are the principles here?"}, {"time": 604, "text": "The principles are that plasticity diminishes, that's no surprise."}, {"time": 609, "text": "By the way, maybe I should just define plasticity."}, {"time": 611, "text": "It's the ability of a system to mold into a new shape and then hold that shape."}, {"time": 616, "text": "That's why we make things that we call plastic because they are moldable and they can hold that new shape, like a plastic toy or something."}, {"time": 625, "text": "And so maybe we'll use a lot of terms that are synonymous."}, {"time": 629, "text": "So something is plastic, something is malleable, changing, live wire, the name of the book is like synonyms."}, {"time": 638, "text": "So I'll tell you, exactly right, but I'll tell you why I chose live wire instead of plasticity."}, {"time": 642, "text": "So I use the term plasticity in the book, but sparingly, because that was a term coined by William James over a hundred years ago and he was, of course, very impressed with plastic manufacturing that you could mold something into shape and then it holds that."}, {"time": 658, "text": "But that's not what's actually happening in the brain."}, {"time": 661, "text": "It's constantly rewiring your entire life."}, {"time": 663, "text": "You never hit an end point."}, {"time": 666, "text": "The whole point is for it to keep changing."}, {"time": 668, "text": "So even in the few minutes of conversation that we've been having, your brain is changing, my brain is changing."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Next time I see your face, I will remember, oh yeah, like that time Lex and I sat together and we did these things."}, {"time": 681, "text": "I wonder if your brain will have like a Lex thing going on for the next few months."}, {"time": 685, "text": "Like it'll stay there until you get rid of it because it was useful for now."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Yeah, no, I'll probably never get rid of it."}, {"time": 690, "text": "Let's say for some circumstance, you and I don't see each other for the next 35 years."}, {"time": 694, "text": "When I run into you, I'll be like, oh yeah."}, {"time": 696, "text": "That looks familiar."}, {"time": 697, "text": "Yeah, yeah, we sat down for a podcast back when there were podcasts."}, {"time": 703, "text": "Back when we lived outside virtual reality."}, {"time": 707, "text": "So you chose live wire to mold a plastic."}, {"time": 710, "text": "Exactly, because plastic implies, I mean, it's the term that's used in the field and so that's why we need to use it still for a while."}, {"time": 717, "text": "But yeah, it implies something gets molded into shape and then holds that shape forever."}, {"time": 720, "text": "But in fact, the whole system is completely changing."}, {"time": 723, "text": "Then back to how malleable is the human brain at each stage of life."}, {"time": 728, "text": "So what, just at a high level, is it malleable?"}, {"time": 733, "text": "So yes, and plasticity diminishes."}, {"time": 737, "text": "But one of the things that I felt like I was able to put together for myself after reading thousands of papers on this issue is that different parts of the brain have different plasticity windows."}, {"time": 750, "text": "So for example, with the visual cortex, that cements itself into place pretty quickly over the course of a few years."}, {"time": 757, "text": "And I argue that's because of the stability of the data."}, {"time": 761, "text": "In other words, what you're getting in from the world, you've got a certain number of angles, colors, shapes."}, {"time": 767, "text": "It's essentially the world is visually stable."}, {"time": 769, "text": "So that hardens around that data."}, {"time": 772, "text": "As opposed to, let's say, the somatosensory cortex, which is the part that's taking information from your body, or the motor cortex right next to it, which is what drives your body."}, {"time": 780, "text": "The fact is, bodies are always changing."}, {"time": 781, "text": "You get taller over time, you get fatter, thinner, over time, you might break a leg and have to limp for a while, stuff like that."}, {"time": 788, "text": "So because the data there is always changing, by the way, you might get on a bicycle, you might get on a surfboard, things like that."}, {"time": 795, "text": "Because the data is always changing, that stays more malleable."}, {"time": 799, "text": "And when you look through the brain, you find that it appears to be this, how stable the data is determines how fast something hardens into place."}, {"time": 808, "text": "But the point is, different parts of the brain harden into place at different times."}, {"time": 811, "text": "Do you think it's possible that, depending on how much data you get on different sensors, that it stays more malleable longer?"}, {"time": 821, "text": "So like, if you look at different cultures that experience, like if you keep your eyes closed, or maybe you're blind, I don't know, but let's say you keep your eyes closed for your entire life, then the visual cortex might be much less malleable."}, {"time": 838, "text": "The reason I bring that up is like, well maybe we'll talk about brain computer interfaces a little bit down the line, but is this, is the malleability a genetic thing, or is it more about the data, like you said, that comes in?"}, {"time": 854, "text": "Ah, so the malleability itself is a genetic thing."}, {"time": 857, "text": "The big trick that Mother Nature discovered with humans is make a system that's really flexible, as opposed to most other creatures to different degrees."}, {"time": 868, "text": "So if you take an alligator, it's born, its brain does the same thing every generation."}, {"time": 874, "text": "If you compare an alligator 100,000 years ago to an alligator now, they're essentially the same."}, {"time": 879, "text": "We, on the other hand, as humans, drop into a world with a half baked brain, and what we require is to absorb the culture around us, and the language, and the beliefs, and the customs, and so on, that's what Mother Nature has done with us, and it's been a tremendously successful trick we've taken over the whole planet as a result of this."}, {"time": 929, "text": "So this is the experiment that Mother Nature ran, and it turns out that, for better or worse, we've won."}, {"time": 934, "text": "I mean, yeah, we put other animals in the zoos, and we, yeah, that's right."}, {"time": 938, "text": "AI might do better."}, {"time": 939, "text": "Okay, fair enough, that's true."}, {"time": 941, "text": "And maybe what the trick Mother Nature did is just the stepping stone to AI, but."}, {"time": 946, "text": "So that's a beautiful feature of the human brain, that it's malleable, but let's, on the topic of Mother Nature, what do we start with?"}, {"time": 956, "text": "Like, how blank is the slate?"}, {"time": 958, "text": "Ah, so it's not actually a blank slate."}, {"time": 961, "text": "What it's, it's terrific engineering that's set up in there, but much of that engineering has to do with, okay, just make sure that things get to the right place."}, {"time": 970, "text": "For example, like the fibers from the eyes getting to the visual cortex, or all this very complicated machinery in the ear getting to the auditory cortex, and so on."}, {"time": 977, "text": "So things, first of all, there's that."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And then what we also come equipped with is the ability to absorb language and culture and beliefs, and so on."}, {"time": 987, "text": "So you're already set up for that."}, {"time": 988, "text": "So no matter what you're exposed to, you will absorb some sort of language."}, {"time": 992, "text": "That's the trick, is how do you engineer something just enough that it's then a sponge that's ready to take in and fill in the blanks?"}, {"time": 1000, "text": "How much of the malleability is hardware?"}, {"time": 1002, "text": "How much is software?"}, {"time": 1003, "text": "Is that useful at all in the brain?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "So what are we talking about?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So there's neurons, there's synapses, and all kinds of different synapses, and there's chemical communication, like electrical signals, and there's chemical communication from the synapses."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "I would say the software would be the timing and the nature of the electrical signals, I guess, and the hardware would be the actual synapses."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "So here's the thing, this is why I really, if we can, I wanna get away from the hardware and software metaphor because what happens is, as activity passes through the system, it changes things."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "Now, the thing that computer engineers are really used to thinking about is synapses, where two neurons connect."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "Of course, each neuron connects with 10,000 of its neighbors, but at a point where they connect, what we're all used to thinking about is the changing of the strength of that connection, the synaptic weight."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "But in fact, everything is changing."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "All of these things are plastic."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "The reason that most people only talk about the synaptic weights is because that's really all we can measure well."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And all this other stuff is really, really hard to see with our current technology."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "So essentially, that just gets ignored."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "But in fact, the system is plastic at all these different levels."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "And my way of thinking about this is an analogy to pace layers."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "So pace layers is a concept that Stewart Brand suggested about how to think about cities."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "So you have fashion, which changes rapidly in cities."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "You have governance, which changes more slowly."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "You have the structure, the buildings of a city, which changes more slowly, all the way down to nature."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "You've got all these different layers of things that are changing at different paces, at different speeds."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "I've taken that idea and mapped it onto the brain, which is to say you have some biochemical cascades that are just changing really rapidly when something happens, all the way down to things that are more and more cemented in there."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "And this actually allows us to understand a lot about particular kinds of things that happen."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "For example, one of the oldest, probably the oldest rule in neurology is called Ribot's Law, which is that older memories are more stable than newer memories."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "So when you get old and demented, you'll be able to remember things from your young life."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Maybe you'll remember this podcast, but you won't remember what you did a month ago or a year ago."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "And this is a very weird structure, right?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "No other system works this way, where older memories are more stable than newer memories."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "But it's because through time, things get more and more cemented into deeper layers of the system."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "And so this is, I think, the way we have to think about the brain, not as, okay, you've got neurons, you've got synaptic weights, and that's it."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So, yeah, so the idea of LiveWare and LiveWired is that it's like a, it's a gradual, yeah, it's a gradual spectrum between software and hardware."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "And so the metaphors completely doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Cause like when you talk about software and hardware, it's really hard lines."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "I mean, of course, software is unlike hard, but even hardware, but like, so there's two groups, but in the software world, there's levels of abstractions, right?"}, {"time": 1239, "text": "There's the operating system, there's machine code, and then it gets higher and higher levels."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "But somehow that's actually fundamentally different than the layers of abstractions in the hardware."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "But in the brain, it's all like the same."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And I love the city, the city metaphor."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "I mean, yeah, it's kind of mind blowing cause it's hard to know what to think about that."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "Like if I were to ask the question, this is an important question for machine learning is, how does the brain learn?"}, {"time": 1269, "text": "So essentially you're saying that, I mean, it just learns on all of these different levels at all different paces."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "And as a result, what happens is as you practice something, you get good at something, you're physically changing the circuitry, you're adapting your brain around the thing that is relevant to you."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "So let's say you take up, do you know how to surf?"}, {"time": 1296, "text": "So let's say you take up surfing now at this age."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "What happens is you'll be terrible at first, you don't know how to operate your body, you don't know how to read the waves, things like that."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "And through time you get better and better."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "What you're doing is you're burning that into the actual circuitry of your brain."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "You're of course conscious when you're first doing it, you're thinking about, okay, where am I doing?"}, {"time": 1312, "text": "What's my body weight?"}, {"time": 1313, "text": "But eventually when you become a pro at it, you are not conscious of it at all."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "In fact, you can't even unpack what it is that you did."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Think about riding a bicycle."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "You can't describe how you're doing it, you're just doing it, you're changing your balance when you come, you know, you do this to go to a stop."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "So this is what we're constantly doing is actually shaping our own circuitry based on what is relevant for us."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Survival, of course, being the top thing that's relevant."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "But interestingly, especially with humans, we have these particular goals in our lives, computer science, neuroscience, whatever."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "And so we actually shape our circuitry around that."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "I mean, you mentioned this gets slower and slower with age, but is there, like I think I've read and spoken offline, even on this podcast with a developmental neurobiologist, I guess would be the right terminology, is like looking at the very early, like from embryonic stem cells to the creation of the brain."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And like, that's mind blowing how much stuff happens there."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "So it's very malleable at that stage."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And then, but after that, at which point does it stop being malleable?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So that's the interesting thing is that it remains malleable your whole life."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "So even when you're an old person, you'll be able to remember new faces and names, you'll be able to learn new sorts of tasks."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And thank goodness, cause the world is changing rapidly in terms of technology and so on."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "I just sent my mother an Alexa and she figured out how to go on the settings and do the thing."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And I was really impressed that she was able to do it."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "So there are parts of the brain that remain malleable their whole life."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "The interesting part is that really your goal is to make an internal model of the world."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Your goal is to say, okay, the brain is trapped in silence and darkness, and it's trying to understand how the world works out there, right?"}, {"time": 1426, "text": "I love that image."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Yeah, I guess it is."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "You forget, it's like this lonely thing is sitting in its own container and trying to actually throw a few sensors, figure out what the hell's going on."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "You know what I sometimes think about is that movie, The Martian with Matt Damon, the, I mean, it was written in a book, of course, but the movie poster shows Matt Damon all alone on the red planet."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "And I think, God, that's actually what it's like to be inside your head and my head and anybody's head is that you're essentially on your own planet in there."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And I'm essentially on my own planet."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "And everyone's got their own world where you've absorbed all of your experiences up to this moment in your life that have made you exactly who you are and same for me and everyone."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "And we've got this very thin bandwidth of communication."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "And I'll say something like, oh yeah, that tastes just like peaches."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "And you'll say, oh, I know what you mean."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "But the experience, of course, might be vastly different for us."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "But anyway, yes."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "So the brain is trapped in silence and darkness, each one of us, and what it's trying to do, this is the important part, it's trying to make an internal model of what's going on out there, as in how do I function in the world?"}, {"time": 1498, "text": "How do I interact with other people?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "Do I say something nice and polite?"}, {"time": 1502, "text": "Do I say something aggressive and mean?"}, {"time": 1504, "text": "Do I, you know, all these things that it's putting together about the world."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "And I think what happens when people get older and older, it may not be that plasticity is diminishing."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "It may be that their internal model essentially has set itself up in a way where it says, okay, I've pretty much got a really good understanding of the world now, and I don't really need to change, right?"}, {"time": 1525, "text": "So when much older people find themselves in a situation where they need to change, they can actually are able to do it."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "It's just that I think this notion that we all have that plasticity diminishes as we grow older is in part because the motivation isn't there."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "But if you were 80 and you get fired from your job and suddenly had to figure out how to program a WordPress site or something, you'd figure it out."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "So the capability, the possibility of change is there."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "But then that's the highest challenge, the interesting challenge to this plasticity, to this liveware system."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "If we could talk about brain computer interfaces and Neuralink, what are your thoughts about the efforts of Elon Musk, Neuralink, BCI in general in this regard, which is adding a machine, a computer, the capability of a computer to communicate with the brain and the brain to communicate with a computer at the very basic applications and then like the futuristic kind of thoughts."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "Yeah, first of all, it's terrific that people are jumping in and doing that because it's clearly the future."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "The interesting part is our brains have pretty good methods of interacting with technology."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "So maybe it's your fat thumbs on a cell phone or something, but, or maybe it's watching a YouTube video and getting into your eye that way."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "But we have pretty rapid ways of communicating with technology and getting data."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "So if you actually crack open the skull and go into the inner sanctum of the brain, you might be able to get a little bit faster, but I'll tell you, I'm not so sanguine on the future of that as a business."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And I'll tell you why."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "It's because there are various ways of getting data in and out and an open head surgery is a big deal."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "Neurosurgeons don't wanna do it because there's always risk of death and infection on the table."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "And also it's not clear how many people would say, I'm gonna volunteer to get something in my head so that I can text faster, 20% faster."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "So I think it's, mother nature surrounds the brain with this armored bunker of the skull because it's a very delicate material."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And there's an expression in neurosurgery about the brain is, the person is never the same after you open up their skull."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "Now, whether

evil?"}, {"time": 3119, "text": "And there was a little spot pointing to it and there was a picture of Gandhi and there was a little spot that was pointing to Hitler."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "And these Time Magazine covers always make me mad because it's so goofy to think that we're gonna find some spot in the brain or something."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "Instead, the interesting part is because we're livewired, we are all about the world and the culture around us."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "So somebody like Adolf Hitler got all this positive feedback about what was going on and the

all these other people, they're all spun each other up."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "And you look at anything like, I mean, look at the cultural revolution in China or the Russian revolution or things like this where you look at these things, my God, how do people all behave like this?"}, {"time": 3175, "text": "But it's easy to see groups of people spinning themselves up in particular ways where

fundamental thing."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "So we did this experiment in my lab where we brought people and we stick them in the scanner."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "And we, I don't know if you

hand."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "And the question is, how much does your brain care about all the people in your out group versus the one label that happens to match you?"}, {"time": 3326, "text":

fundamental that is, or if it's the emergent thing about culture."}, {"time": 3353, "text": "Like if we lived alone with like, if it's genetically built into the brain, like this longing for tribe."},

part of this study that I think matter for this point."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "One is, so okay, so we show that you have a much bigger response."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "And by the way, this is not a cognitive thing."}, {"time": 3374, "text": "This is a very low level basic response to seeing pain in somebody, okay."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "Great study by the way."}, {"time": 3380, "text":

this one word thing that they're now your allies, you care more about them."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "But then what I wanted to do was look at how ingrained is this or how arbitrary is it?"},

this team."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "You know, now I did my own personal study of this."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "So once you're an Augustinian, that tends to be sticky because I've been a Packers

gets there."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "As long as the information gets there, your brain figures out what to do with it."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "Like expanding the set of sensors, it could be arbitrarily, yeah, it could expand arbitrarily, which is fascinating."}, {"time": 5062, "text": "And by the way, the reason I use this skin, there's all kinds of cool stuff going on in the AR world with glasses."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "But the fact is your eyes are overtaxed and your ears are overtaxed and you need to be able to see and hear other stuff."}, {"time": 5073, "text": "But you're covered with the skin, which is this incredible computational material with which you can feed information."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "And we don't use our skin for much of anything nowadays."},

this information that way."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "And what I'm doing here with the deaf community is what's called sensory substitution, where I'm capturing sound and I'm just replacing the ears

other people or something like that."}, {"time": 5164, "text": "Sure, now what you need is a way to measure this."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "So as long as there's a machine that can measure it, it's easy, it's trivial to feed this in here and you come to be, it comes to be part of your reality."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "It's like you have another sensor."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "And that kind of thing is without doing like, if you look in Neuralink, I forgot how you put it, but it was eloquent, without getting, cutting into the brain, basically."}, {"time": 5187, "text": "So this costs, at

you take it off."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "Yeah, and so, and the name of the company, by the way, is Neosensory for new senses, because the whole idea is."}, {"time": 5202, "text": "Beautiful, that's."}, {"time": 5203, "text": "You can, as I said, you come to the table with certain plug and play devices and then that's it."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "Like I can pick up on this little bit of

can expand our umwelt by adding new senses, yeah."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "What's umwelt?"}, {"time": 5222, "text": "Oh, I'm sorry, the umwelt is the slice of reality that you pick up on."},
