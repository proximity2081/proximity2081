real neuroscientists that really study real synapses or real neurons, they agree, they agree."}, {"time": 413, "text": "It's a hundreds of year task and they're building it up slowly and surely."}, {"time": 418, "text": "What the signal is there is not clear."}, {"time": 420, "text": "We think we have all of our metaphors."}, {"time": 422, "text": "We think it's electrical, maybe it's chemical, it's a whole soup, it's ions and proteins and it's a cell."}, {"time": 429, "text": "And that's even around like a single synapse."}, {"time": 431, "text": "If you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse, it's a city of its own."}, {"time": 435, "text": "And that's one little thing on a dendritic tree, which is extremely complicated electrochemical thing."}, {"time": 442, "text": "And it's doing these spikes and voltages are flying around and then proteins are taking that and taking it down into the DNA and who knows what."}, {"time": 449, "text": "So it is the problem of the next few centuries."}, {"time": 451, "text": "It is fantastic."}, {"time": 453, "text": "But we have our metaphors about it."}, {"time": 454, "text": "Is it an economic device?"}, {"time": 456, "text": "Is it like the immune system or is it like a layered set of, you know, arithmetic computations?"}, {"time": 462, "text": "We have all these metaphors and they're fun."}, {"time": 464, "text": "But that's not real science per se."}, {"time": 468, "text": "There is neuroscience."}, {"time": 469, "text": "That's not neuroscience."}, {"time": 471, "text": "That's like the Greek speculating about how to get to the moon, fun, right?"}, {"time": 475, "text": "And I think that I like to say this fairly strongly because I think a lot of young people think we're on the verge because a lot of people who don't talk about it clearly let it be understood that, yes, we kind of, this is a brain inspired, we're kind of close, you know, breakthroughs are on the horizon."}, {"time": 490, "text": "And that's scrupulous people sometimes who need money for their labs."}, {"time": 493, "text": "That's what I'm saying, scrupulous, but people will oversell, I need money for my lab, I'm studying computational neuroscience, I'm going to oversell it."}, {"time": 503, "text": "And so there's been too much of that."}, {"time": 505, "text": "So I'll step into the gray area between metaphor and engineering with, I'm not sure if you're familiar with brain computer interfaces."}, {"time": 515, "text": "So a company like Elon Musk has Neuralink that's working on putting electrodes into the brain and trying to be able to read, both read and send electrical signals."}, {"time": 526, "text": "Just as you said, even the basic mechanism of communication in the brain is not something we understand."}, {"time": 535, "text": "But do you hope without understanding the fundamental principles of how the brain works, we'll be able to do something interesting at that gray area of metaphor?"}, {"time": 546, "text": "It's not my area."}, {"time": 547, "text": "So I hope in the sense, like anybody else hopes for some interesting things to happen from research, I would expect more something like Alzheimer's will get figured out from modern neuroscience."}, {"time": 556, "text": "There's a lot of human suffering based on brain disease and we throw things like lithium at the brain, it kind of works, no one has a clue why."}, {"time": 565, "text": "That's not quite true, but mostly we don't know."}, {"time": 568, "text": "And that's even just about the biochemistry of the brain and how it leads to mood swings and so on."}, {"time": 573, "text": "How thought emerges from that, we were really, really completely dim."}, {"time": 578, "text": "So that you might want to hook up electrodes and try to do some signal processing on that and try to find patterns, fine, by all means, go for it."}, {"time": 585, "text": "It's just not scientific at this point."}, {"time": 588, "text": "So it's like kind of sitting in a satellite and watching the emissions from a city and trying to infer things about the microeconomy, even though you don't have microeconomic concepts."}, {"time": 597, "text": "It's really that kind of thing."}, {"time": 599, "text": "And so yes, can you find some signals that do something interesting or useful?"}, {"time": 602, "text": "Can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain?"}, {"time": 606, "text": "Yeah, absolutely, and then I can imagine business models based on that and even medical applications of that."}, {"time": 614, "text": "But from there to understanding algorithms that allow us to really tie in deeply from the brain to computer, I just, no, I don't agree with Elon Musk."}, {"time": 622, "text": "I don't think that's even, that's not for our generations, not even for the century."}, {"time": 626, "text": "So just in hopes of getting you to dream, you've mentioned Kolmogorov and Turing might pop up, do you think that there might be breakthroughs that will get you to sit back in five, 10 years and say, wow?"}, {"time": 643, "text": "Oh, I'm sure there will be, but I don't think that there'll be demos that impress me."}, {"time": 649, "text": "I don't think that having a computer call a restaurant and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough."}, {"time": 657, "text": "And people, you know, some people present it as such."}, {"time": 659, "text": "It's imitating human intelligence."}, {"time": 661, "text": "It's even putting coughs in the thing to make a bit of a PR stunt."}, {"time": 667, "text": "And so fine that the world runs on those things too."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And I don't want to diminish all the hard work and engineering that goes behind things like that and the ultimate value to the human race."}, {"time": 677, "text": "But that's not scientific understanding."}, {"time": 680, "text": "And I know the people that work on these things, they are after scientific understanding."}, {"time": 683, "text": "In the meantime, they've got to kind of, you know, the trains got to run and they got mouths to feed and they got things to do and there's nothing wrong with all that."}, {"time": 690, "text": "I would call that though, just engineering."}, {"time": 692, "text": "And I want to distinguish that between an engineering field, like electrical engineering and chemical engineering that originally emerged, that had real principles and you really know what you're doing and you had a little scientific understanding, maybe not even complete."}, {"time": 703, "text": "So it became more predictable and it really gave value to human life because it was understood."}, {"time": 709, "text": "And so we don't want to muddle too much these waters of, you know, what we're able to do versus what we really can't do in a way that's going to impress the next."}, {"time": 718, "text": "So I don't need to be wowed, but I think that someone comes along in 20 years, a younger person who's absorbed all the technology and for them to be wowed, I think they have to be more deeply impressed."}, {"time": 729, "text": "A young Kolmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunts that you see right now coming from the big companies."}, {"time": 734, "text": "The demos, but do you think the breakthroughs from Kolmogorov would be, and give this question a chance, do you think there'll be in the scientific fundamental principles arena or do you think it's possible to have fundamental breakthroughs in engineering?"}, {"time": 748, "text": "Meaning, you know, I would say some of the things that Elon Musk is working with SpaceX and then others sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals of engineering, of manufacturing, of saying, here's a problem we know how to do a demo of and actually taking it to scale."}, {"time": 765, "text": "So there's going to be all kinds of breakthroughs."}, {"time": 766, "text": "I just don't like that terminology."}, {"time": 768, "text": "I'm a scientist and I work on things day in and day out and things move along and eventually you say, wow, something happened, but I don't like that language very much."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Also I don't like to prize theoretical breakthroughs over practical ones."}, {"time": 781, "text": "I tend to be more of a theoretician and I think there's lots to do in that arena right now."}, {"time": 786, "text": "And so I wouldn't point to the Kolmogorovs, I might point to the Edisons of the era and maybe Musk is a bit more like that."}, {"time": 791, "text": "But you know, Musk, God bless him, also will say things about AI that he knows very little about and he leads people astray when he talks about things he doesn't know anything about."}, {"time": 803, "text": "Trying to program a computer to understand natural language, to be involved in a dialogue we're having right now, that ain't going to happen in our lifetime."}, {"time": 810, "text": "You could fake it, you can mimic, sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread them, but the deep understanding of language, no, it's not going to happen."}, {"time": 818, "text": "And so from that, I hope you can perceive that the deeper, yet deeper kind of aspects and intelligence are not going to happen."}, {"time": 824, "text": "Now will there be breakthroughs?"}, {"time": 825, "text": "No, I think that Google was a breakthrough, I think Amazon is a breakthrough, you know, I think Uber is a breakthrough, you know, that bring value to human beings at scale in new, brand new ways based on data flows and so on."}, {"time": 836, "text": "A lot of these things are slightly broken because there's not kind of an engineering field that takes economic value in context of data and, you know, planetary scale and worries about all the externalities, the privacy, you know, we don't have that field so we don't think these things through very well."}, {"time": 853, "text": "I see that as emerging and that will be, you know, looking back from 100 years, that will be a constituted breakthrough in this era, just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough in the early part of the last century and chemical engineering was a breakthrough."}, {"time": 864, "text": "So the scale, the markets that you talk about and we'll get to will be seen as sort of breakthrough and we're in the very early days of really doing interesting stuff there and we'll get to that, but just taking a quick step back, can you give, kind of throw off the historian hat."}, {"time": 881, "text": "I mean, you briefly said that the history of AI kind of mimics the history of chemical engineering, but..."}, {"time": 889, "text": "I keep saying machine learning."}, {"time": 890, "text": "You keep wanting to say AI, just to let you know, I don't, you know, I resist that."}, {"time": 894, "text": "I don't think this is about AI really was John McCarthy as almost a philosopher saying, wouldn't it be cool if we could put thought in a computer?"}, {"time": 903, "text": "If we could mimic the human capability to think or put intelligence in, in some sense into a computer."}, {"time": 909, "text": "That's an interesting philosophical question and he wanted to make it more than philosophy."}, {"time": 913, "text": "He wanted to actually write down a logical formula and algorithms that would do that."}, {"time": 917, "text": "And that is a perfectly valid, reasonable thing to do."}, {"time": 920, "text": "That's not what's happening in this era."}, {"time": 923, "text": "So the reason I keep saying AI actually, and I'd love to hear what you think about it."}, {"time": 927, "text": "Machine learning has a very particular set of methods and tools."}, {"time": 934, "text": "Maybe your version of it is that mine doesn't, it's very, very open."}, {"time": 937, "text": "It does optimization, it does sampling, it does..."}, {"time": 940, "text": "So systems that learn is what machine learning is."}, {"time": 942, "text": "Systems that learn and make decisions."}, {"time": 944, "text": "And make decisions."}, {"time": 945, "text": "So it's not just pattern recognition and, you know, finding patterns, it's all about making decisions in real worlds and having close feedback loops."}, {"time": 952, "text": "So something like symbolic AI, expert systems, reasoning systems, knowledge based representation, all of those kinds of things, search, does that neighbor fit into what you think of as machine learning?"}, {"time": 964, "text": "So I don't even like the word machine learning, I think that what the field you're talking about is all about making large collections of decisions under uncertainty by large collections of entities."}, {"time": 973, "text": "And there are principles for that, at that scale."}, {"time": 976, "text": "You don't have to say the principles are for a single entity that's making decisions, single agent or single human."}, {"time": 980, "text": "It really immediately goes to the network of decisions."}, {"time": 982, "text": "Is a good word for that or no?"}, {"time": 984, "text": "No, there's no good words for any of this."}, {"time": 985, "text": "That's kind of part of the problem."}, {"time": 987, "text": "So we can continue the conversation to use AI for all that."}, {"time": 989, "text": "I just want to kind of raise the flag here that this is not about, we don't know what intelligence is and real intelligence."}, {"time": 998, "text": "We don't know much about abstraction and reasoning at the level of humans."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "We don't have a clue."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "We're not trying to build that because we don't have a clue."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "Eventually it may emerge."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "They'll make, I don't know if there'll be breakthroughs, but eventually we'll start to get glimmers of that."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "It's not what's happening right now."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "We're taking data."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "We're trying to make good decisions based on that."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "We're trying to scale."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "We're trying to economically viably, we're trying to build markets."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "We're trying to keep value at that scale and aspects of this will look intelligent."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "Computers were so dumb before, they will seem more intelligent."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "We will use that buzzword of intelligence so we can use it in that sense."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "So machine learning, you can scope it narrowly as just learning from data and pattern recognition."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "But when I talk about these topics, maybe data science is another word you could throw in the mix, it really is important that the decisions are as part of it."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "It's consequential decisions in the real world."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Am I going to have a medical operation?"}, {"time": 1050, "text": "Am I going to drive down the street?"}, {"time": 1053, "text": "Things where there's scarcity, things that impact other human beings or other environments and so on."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "How do I do that based on data?"}, {"time": 1060, "text": "How do I do that adaptively?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "How do I use computers to help those kinds of things go forward?"}, {"time": 1064, "text": "Whatever you want to call that."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "So let's call it AI."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Let's agree to call it AI, but let's not say that the goal of that is intelligence."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "The goal of that is really good working systems at planetary scale that we've never seen before."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "So reclaim the word AI from the Dartmouth conference from many decades ago of the dream of humans."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "I don't want to reclaim it."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "I want a new word."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "I think it was a bad choice."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "I mean, if you read one of my little things, the history was basically that McCarthy needed a new name because cybernetics already existed and he didn't like, no one really liked Norbert Wiener."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "Norbert Wiener was kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all this and in some sense he did."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "You look at the language of cybernetics, it was everything we're talking about."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "It was control theory and signal processing and some notions of intelligence and closed feedback loops and data."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "It was all there."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "It's just not a word that lived on partly because of the maybe the personalities."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "But McCarthy needed a new word to say, I'm different from you."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "I'm not part of your show."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "I got my own."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "Invented this word and again, thinking forward about the movies that would be made about it, it was a great choice."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "But thinking forward about creating a sober academic and real world discipline, it was a terrible choice because it led to promises that are not true that we understand."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "We understand artificial perhaps, but we don't understand intelligence."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "It's a small tangent because you're one of the great personalities of machine learning, whatever the heck you call the field."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "Do you think science progresses by personalities or by the fundamental principles and theories and research that's outside of personalities?"}, {"time": 1156, "text": "And I wouldn't say there should be one kind of personality."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "I have mine and I have my preferences and I have a kind of network around me that feeds me and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree, but all kinds of personalities are needed."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Right now, I think the personality that it's a little too exuberant, a little bit too ready to promise the moon is a little bit too much in ascendance."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "And I do think that there's some good to that."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "It certainly attracts lots of young people to our field, but a lot of those people come in with strong misconceptions and they have to then unlearn those and then find something to do."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "And so I think there's just got to be some multiple voices and I wasn't hearing enough of the more sober voice."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "So as a continuation of a fun tangent and speaking of vibrant personalities, what would you say is the most interesting disagreement you have with Jan Lacune?"}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So Jan's an old friend and I just say that I don't think we disagree about very much really."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "He and I both kind of have a let's build it kind of mentality and does it work kind of mentality and kind of concrete."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "We both speak French and we speak French more together and we have a lot in common."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "And so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement, it's not really a fundamental one."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "I think it's just kind of what we're emphasizing."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Jan has emphasized pattern recognition and has emphasized prediction."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "And it's interesting to try to take that as far as you can."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "If you could do perfect prediction, what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment?"}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And I think that's way too limited."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "We cannot do perfect prediction."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "We will never have the data sets that allow me to figure out what you're about ready to do, what question you're going to ask next."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "I have no clue."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "I will never know such things."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "Moreover, most of us find ourselves during the day in all kinds of situations we had no anticipation of that are kind of very, very novel in various ways."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "And in that moment, we want to think through what we want."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "And also there's going to be market forces acting on us."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "I'd like to go down that street, but now it's full because there's a crane in the street."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "I got to think about that."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "I got to think about what I might really want here."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "And I got to sort of think about how much it costs me to do this action versus this action."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "I got to think about the risks involved."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "A lot of our current pattern recognition and prediction systems don't do any risk evaluations."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "They have no error bars, right?"}, {"time": 1299, "text": "I got to think about other people's decisions around me."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "I got to think about a collection of my decisions, even just thinking about like a medical treatment, you know, I'm not going to take a, the prediction of a neural net about my health, about something consequential."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "I'm not about ready to have a heart attack because some number is over 0.7."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "Even if you had all the data in the world that ever been collected about heart attacks better than any doctor ever had, I'm not going to trust the output of that neural net to predict my heart attack."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "I'm going to want to ask what if questions around that."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "I'm going to want to look at some us or other possible data I didn't have, causal things."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "I'm going to want to have a dialogue with a doctor about things we didn't think about when he gathered the data."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "You know, I could go on and on."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "I hope you can see."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "And I don't, I think that if you say predictions, everything that, that, that you're missing all of this stuff."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "And so prediction plus decision making is everything, but both of them are equally important."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And so the field has emphasized prediction, Jan rightly so has seen how powerful that is."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "But at the cost of people not being aware that decision making is where the rubber really hits the road, where human lives are at stake, where risks are being taken, where you got to gather more data."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "You got to think about the error bars."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "You got to think about the consequences of your decisions on others."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "You got to think about the economy around your decisions, blah, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "I'm not the only one working on those, but we're a smaller tribe."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "And right now we're not the one that people talk about the most."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "But you know, if you go out in the real world and industry, you know, at Amazon, I'd say half the people there are working on decision making and the other half are doing, you know, the pattern recognition."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And the words of pattern recognition and prediction, I think the distinction there, not to linger on words, but the distinction there is more a constrained sort of in the lab data set versus decision making is talking about consequential decisions in the real world, under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And just the whole of it, the whole mess of it that actually touches human beings and scale."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "And the forces, that's the distinction."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "It helps add those, that perspective, that broader perspective."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "I totally agree."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "On the other hand, if you're a real prediction person, of course, you want it to be in the real world."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "You want to predict real world events."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "I'm just saying that's not possible with just data sets."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "That it has to be in the context of, you know, strategic things that someone's doing, data they might gather, things they could have gathered, the reasoning process around data."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "It's not just taking data and making predictions based on the data."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "So one of the things that you're working on, I'm sure there's others working on it, but I don't hear often it talked about, especially in the clarity that you talk about it, and I think it's both the most exciting and the most concerning area of AI in terms of decision making."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "So you've talked about AI systems that help make decisions that scale in a distributed way, millions, billions decisions, sort of markets of decisions."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "Can you, as a starting point, sort of give an example of a system that you think about when you're thinking about these kinds of systems?"}, {"time": 1467, "text": "Yeah, so first of all, you're absolutely getting into some territory, which I will be beyond my expertise."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "And there are lots of things that are going to be very not obvious to think about."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Just like, again, I like to think about history a little bit, but think about put yourself back in the sixties."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "There was kind of a banking system that wasn't computerized really."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "There was database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do I actually not just move data around, but actual money and have it be, you know, valid and have transactions that ATMs happen that are actually, you know, all valid and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "So that's the kind of issues you get into when you start to get serious about sorts of things like this."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "I like to think about as kind of almost a thought experiment to help me think something simpler, which is the music market."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "And because there is, to first order, there is no music market in the world right now and in our country, for sure."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "There are something called things called record companies and they make money and they prop up a few really good musicians and make them superstars and they all make huge amounts of money."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "But there's a long tail of huge numbers of people that make lots and lots of really good music that is actually listened to by more people than the famous people."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "They are not in a market."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "They cannot have a
