dragons?"}, {"time": 188, "text": "Well, the dragons are usually tennis balls on the end of C stands, but sometimes they hang out."}, {"time": 198, "text": "It's a C stand."}, {"time": 199, "text": "It's like, you know, it's like a little, like the thing you got the camera on here."}, {"time": 201, "text": "Oh, this is like film lingo."}, {"time": 202, "text": "Yeah, no, I understand."}, {"time": 203, "text": "I'm trying to impress you with my film lingo."}, {"time": 205, "text": "You know what a banana is?"}, {"time": 208, "text": "It's when you walk like this."}, {"time": 209, "text": "Do a banana."}, {"time": 211, "text": "I did not know what a banana was."}, {"time": 212, "text": "Yeah, see?"}, {"time": 213, "text": "I misunderstood."}, {"time": 214, "text": "Yeah, cause it's just a food."}, {"time": 216, "text": "Normally."}, {"time": 217, "text": "You fancy Hollywood folk with a lingo."}, {"time": 220, "text": "And I'm, my name is Bjorn Hapthor Bjornsson and I am seven foot four and yeah."}, {"time": 227, "text": "So dragons don't, dragons don't scare me even though they've been extinct for a while."}, {"time": 231, "text": "You're a scientist, right?"}, {"time": 232, "text": "Is that checkout?"}, {"time": 234, "text": "Yeah, I actually, I'm really into video games."}, {"time": 236, "text": "I don't know if you play video games."}, {"time": 237, "text": "There's a, there's a Skyrim video game that's part of the Elder Scrolls series."}, {"time": 243, "text": "And for the longest time, there's a legend that there's dragons."}, {"time": 246, "text": "I think it started in Daggerfall."}, {"time": 247, "text": "And so I always, I grew up playing those video games and dreaming of one day meeting a dragon in a virtual world."}, {"time": 254, "text": "And eventually you did in Skyrim."}, {"time": 256, "text": "So it's, dragons represent, I don't know exactly what they represent, but they represent maybe this kind of mythical creature that is bigger than anything humans can possibly comprehend maybe."}, {"time": 270, "text": "Cause they're so, they're so, they show up so often in myth from the, from the religious stories, you know, of the snake and so on, the serpent."}, {"time": 279, "text": "And I don't know what that is."}, {"time": 280, "text": "Well, this breathing fire, that's kind of weird."}, {"time": 282, "text": "It's interesting when I think about dragons, cause now that you bring it up, these are people that probably wouldn't have access to the fact that there used to be dinosaurs."}, {"time": 289, "text": "Maybe they did."}, {"time": 290, "text": "If they didn't, they're drawing things that look like, you know, a dinosaur cousin, but cool, that can breathe fire and has wacky wings and a spiked tail."}, {"time": 302, "text": "Yeah, where the heck did they come up with that?"}, {"time": 304, "text": "Cause they're clearly of course represented in mythology all the way back to, no, not cave drawings."}, {"time": 310, "text": "Well, the Egyptians probably knew what the, and they could time travel."}, {"time": 313, "text": "So they would have gone back to the caves."}, {"time": 315, "text": "Well, the aliens that placed living organisms on earth could time travel and they could plant legends into the, into the collective intelligence of the human species."}, {"time": 327, "text": "Yeah, and perhaps they were thinking of us to do something smart with it."}, {"time": 330, "text": "And we didn't, we just came up with the sky."}, {"time": 333, "text": "We're just, what's that?"}, {"time": 333, "text": "Sorry, that was very offensive."}, {"time": 335, "text": "I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you with your video game."}, {"time": 337, "text": "I'm more of a burger time Donkey Kong dude."}, {"time": 342, "text": "Oh, what is that?"}, {"time": 344, "text": "That's an original."}, {"time": 345, "text": "Burger time was an arcade game that later showed up on the Intellivision, it was Intellivision."}, {"time": 352, "text": "I believe it was made by Texas Instruments, horrible first generation video game console."}, {"time": 358, "text": "And burger time, you just, it's like Super Mario."}, {"time": 360, "text": "You just got to stay away from the eggs and the pickles and stuff."}, {"time": 364, "text": "And you just go, and the bun falls."}, {"time": 367, "text": "And then you go down to the and the cheese and then the meat."}, {"time": 371, "text": "I'm not going to say it's as complicated as Skyrim, but took me a while to finish it when I was seven."}, {"time": 377, "text": "Did you play video games, was that a part of your life, a part of the source of happiness for you at all?"}, {"time": 382, "text": "It was, it was."}, {"time": 384, "text": "I played video games up until around, I think in 2010, I got the Red Ring of Death on my Xbox 360."}, {"time": 391, "text": "That was it?"}, {"time": 393, "text": "I never, or whatever the Xbox was then."}, {"time": 396, "text": "I had, I was playing, I had finished the Grand Theft Auto that was out and finished the Red Dead Redemption."}, {"time": 402, "text": "So I was doing that thing where you just drive around, you know, the streets of New York or just ride around on your horse shooting people and, you know, throwing grenades into groups of people in Grand Theft."}, {"time": 415, "text": "And you're describing the same thing that happened a decade later, because it's now Red Dead Redemption 2 and there's still not a new Grand Theft Auto, so."}, {"time": 423, "text": "Yeah, there isn't, right?"}, {"time": 425, "text": "Yeah, they're working on it."}, {"time": 426, "text": "They're always flirting with that idea."}, {"time": 427, "text": "You know who else plays Skyrim?"}, {"time": 430, "text": "Another person, the two people I'm a huge fan of from that time in Matt TV is Bobby Lee."}, {"time": 434, "text": "He plays Skyrim?"}, {"time": 435, "text": "He's a huge fan of Skyrim."}, {"time": 436, "text": "He plays every."}, {"time": 437, "text": "So what Bobby Lee loves to do is to grind, do the boring task over and over, gather mushrooms."}, {"time": 445, "text": "Like in Skyrim, you can fight dragons, you can fight all kinds of things, but you can also gather mushrooms and different ingredients to make potions and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 454, "text": "He loves the ingredients."}, {"time": 455, "text": "He's the, you know, in the hunter gatherer world, he's the gatherer."}, {"time": 458, "text": "He's the gatherer."}, {"time": 459, "text": "Yeah, I've heard him described that way and he likes to describe himself that way."}, {"time": 464, "text": "I worked with Bobby not too long ago."}, {"time": 466, "text": "He came and did a couple days on this thing we were shooting and I was looking forward to catching up with my old pal."}, {"time": 472, "text": "And if you know anything about Bobby Lee, you'd probably be able to predict that he spent that entire time playing farming on his iPad."}, {"time": 479, "text": "Well, humans are a source of anxiety and trouble, so sometimes it's good to escape human interaction through video games."}, {"time": 487, "text": "I'm with him on that."}, {"time": 487, "text": "He's one of the funniest people ever."}, {"time": 491, "text": "What do you think makes him funny?"}, {"time": 494, "text": "It's just all the times you've worked with him, the nonstandard, nonsecular way of his being."}, {"time": 502, "text": "Bobby Lee is one of the most raw people, raw performers who lets it all hang out to the degree that he will even get naked in front of his audience, which is usually a metaphor for someone doing standup."}, {"time": 515, "text": "I'm bearing all, I'm showing you everything, and Bobby will just pull his bird out of his pants."}, {"time": 520, "text": "Yeah, I don't think he understands metaphor too much."}, {"time": 523, "text": "He embodies metaphor."}, {"time": 524, "text": "Yes, he embodies metaphor."}, {"time": 526, "text": "He's the gatherer, we call him the gathering metaphor."}, {"time": 529, "text": "Bobby the gatherer metaphor."}, {"time": 530, "text": "He's a metaphor for something else, for somebody else's life."}, {"time": 533, "text": "Someday he'll be in the dictionary representing some kind of concept, maybe the metaphor itself."}, {"time": 540, "text": "Yeah, once this whole thing falls apart and we are climbing the kudzu vines that spiral up the Sears Tower, like they say in Fight Club, Bobby will go back to his gatherer form and be happy as a pig in shit, just walking around in a loincloth with his bird hanging out, tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them for a stool lap dance or whatever he does."}, {"time": 559, "text": "I'd love to dig into something he did."}, {"time": 562, "text": "You guys did a lot of great podcasts together."}, {"time": 564, "text": "He asked you in a very uncomfortable process of why you don't do standup."}, {"time": 569, "text": "So let me ask you, do you hate money?"}, {"time": 573, "text": "Well, I'm originally from Canada, yeah."}, {"time": 576, "text": "So yeah, I'm a fricking pinko socialist."}, {"time": 580, "text": "Is that where you come from?"}, {"time": 582, "text": "That's not a nice thing to say."}, {"time": 584, "text": "I thought the Soviet Union, that is a nice thing to say."}, {"time": 587, "text": "Like comrade, he's a good socialist with red, like some bold colors, yeah."}, {"time": 598, "text": "There was an interesting tension in your voice and the way you talked about it."}, {"time": 601, "text": "There's just not a source of happiness for you."}, {"time": 604, "text": "You respect the art form, but it was not something that you were connected to, you felt connected to."}, {"time": 610, "text": "Yeah, I respect the art form a lot."}, {"time": 614, "text": "And I grew up with all the albums and stuff."}, {"time": 616, "text": "I had an older brother and sister who, so we had George Carlin, we had Richard Pryor, we had Robert Klein, we had Gilda Live, the Gilda Radner concert, we had all sorts of stuff."}, {"time": 630, "text": "But I don't know, there's a lot of reasons."}, {"time": 633, "text": "I do feel like a career in show business is it never goes the way you plan, like most things."}, {"time": 641, "text": "And I was fortunate enough to get started outside of my native Vancouver or in my native Vancouver."}, {"time": 647, "text": "I grew up in the burbs outside and there was a lot of industry there."}, {"time": 650, "text": "So I was fortunate enough to get started as an actor when I was like 16."}, {"time": 654, "text": "So yeah, there were some times early on where I came up with some standup stuff and did it, but yeah, I quickly abandoned it."}, {"time": 666, "text": "And then you go through, you do Mad TV and stuff, and that's where my, and this is gonna sound weird."}, {"time": 673, "text": "Do I sound as anxiety as I did when I was on Bobby's podcast trying to avoid his questions?"}, {"time": 678, "text": "Well, he was giving you this face this whole time that was making the whole just atmosphere feel full of anxiety."}, {"time": 685, "text": "So I'm trying not to give you a face."}, {"time": 686, "text": "The whole time I was saying, play cool, play cool."}, {"time": 690, "text": "Play cool, Lex."}, {"time": 691, "text": "You said it out loud a couple of times."}, {"time": 694, "text": "Just, you know, you cut that out."}, {"time": 695, "text": "Play cool, dude."}, {"time": 696, "text": "Cut out, cut it out."}, {"time": 697, "text": "Maintain, bro."}, {"time": 698, "text": "Here's what I'll say."}, {"time": 699, "text": "There's two ways to do it."}, {"time": 700, "text": "I think it's lame when someone who's done one thing for a while goes and starts doing standup out of nowhere."}, {"time": 706, "text": "Cause I think it's an art form that's under attack because it's not like anything else."}, {"time": 711, "text": "You need, although now you can of course, you know, make whatever you want."}, {"time": 716, "text": "It's the era of self publishing as far as making a product and putting it out there, which is getting easier, of course, and I can't wait to talk to you about that with AI and how it's changing art."}, {"time": 727, "text": "But in standup, all you need is a microphone and you know, perhaps it'd be good to have some mental illness and then you can just run up there and talk forever."}, {"time": 740, "text": "And I say this to, you know, comedians."}, {"time": 742, "text": "It's like, you guys have to deal with just an influx of people who aren't sure why they're doing comedy."}, {"time": 750, "text": "I would ask comedians, I mean, not good ones, good ones, you know what they're doing, but everyone else like, what are you doing?"}, {"time": 756, "text": "Why, why are you doing standup?"}, {"time": 758, "text": "Having said that, I am allergic to money."}, {"time": 760, "text": "Yeah, do you think they have a good answer for that?"}, {"time": 762, "text": "Why are they doing it?"}, {"time": 763, "text": "Cause I actually like when I'm in Austin, I like going to open mics, just listening."}, {"time": 767, "text": "It's inspiring to me, both the funny and the unfunny people because they've been doing it for several years."}, {"time": 775, "text": "Sometimes over a decade and they're still at it."}, {"time": 778, "text": "They're still right there."}, {"time": 778, "text": "There's going for the punch and then especially open mics that are really sad in that there's, you know, only like five other people in the audience and they're usually just other comedians and they're still going all out as if they're in front of a stadium."}, {"time": 794, "text": "But that to me sounds like someone who loves it."}, {"time": 797, "text": "I got no questions for that person."}, {"time": 799, "text": "I got questions for someone who goes sideways from here I'm recognizable doing something and then I'm doing standup because it's like, and truly look, I've been fortunate enough to be in the business for a long time and at this point, if I came up, I mean, doing live stuff is fun."}, {"time": 815, "text": "I have friends that are like, you know, some guys who are primarily sketch people or you would look at them as sketch people and they can sell tickets for being sketch people and they, and we'll talk about it."}, {"time": 825, "text": "And they're like, you know, I do a monologue and I do a little standup, then I do a song, then I do another monologue, then I play off the audience, do a little standup, but standup is, it's almost like playing music in that, you know, people are going up there playing music, but what band have you been listening to?"}, {"time": 844, "text": "That's what you're gonna sound like."}, {"time": 846, "text": "So it's really, I mean, of course, I'm speaking from zero experience, but I've heard it takes years, of course, to find your own voice."}, {"time": 854, "text": "Standups that when they first go up, they're doing some sort of impersonation of so and so and so and so, and then you gotta pop this audience that's paying and you're gonna get run over by the next person who's coming up and it's hard to follow the last person who went up before you."}, {"time": 871, "text": "And I mean, that is a really hard way to, it's a very, it's quite a gauntlet to be in to find your voice comedically."}, {"time": 878, "text": "But don't you have that same kind of thing with sketch?"}, {"time": 880, "text": "Where you still have to find your own voice with like all the impressions you do, they're just terrible, you know, there are different spins and different people, they're not like perfect impressions, right?"}, {"time": 892, "text": "So that's, I mean, that's a similar kind of challenge and journey as standup."}, {"time": 897, "text": "You're just saying they're kind of distinct and you fell into this one and you fell in love with it, which is like what Mad TV kind of opened you up to."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Yeah, as a kid, I literally wanted to be an actor."}, {"time": 908, "text": "I always wanted to be an actor from a very young age, as far back as I can remember, and I was the class clown and wanted to do comedy stuff and comedic acting and so on."}, {"time": 917, "text": "So comedic acting."}, {"time": 918, "text": "Yeah, early on, my influences were a very predictable list of guys from SCTV, Early Saturday Night Live, Monty Python, all of those performers really influenced me."}, {"time": 932, "text": "It was later that I saw people like Kevin Kline, who's an incredible actor."}, {"time": 938, "text": "I vividly remember being like 12, 13, seeing him get an Academy Award for Fish Called Wanda."}, {"time": 944, "text": "And it blew my mind, because I was like, he was hilarious."}, {"time": 947, "text": "I mean, it was one of my favorite movies back then and now."}, {"time": 950, "text": "And he won an Academy Award."}, {"time": 952, "text": "And at that point, I started thinking more about acting."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And then I was, like I said, really fortunate to fall in with, I mean, I always wanted to do it and I was trying to hustle this and that when I was a kid."}, {"time": 966, "text": "And then I ended up getting represented."}, {"time": 969, "text": "And then I ended up on a teen show."}, {"time": 971, "text": "I was on, basically, the easiest way to pitch it is it's like a Canadian, my so called life with these kids and their lives and stuff."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And I did that for like five years and I really love acting."}, {"time": 983, "text": "I really, truly love acting."}, {"time": 985, "text": "And I'm not someone who wants people to know my opinion."}, {"time": 990, "text": "So that's another thing about standup."}, {"time": 993, "text": "Like I love the illusion of what I get to do in entertainment and podcasting is great for that."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "But to stand up there and, I don't know, just for me, it's like it would have to all be fantasy."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "Yeah, so Nietzsche said that every profound spirit needs a mask."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "Like you said, you don't like to talk about, in your comedy, you don't like to talk about stuff that's personal to you."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "If you were to psychoanalyze yourself, do you think it's just not something you find funny or are you running from something and it's not your fault?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "Will."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "It's not your fault, Will."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "Speaking of another really great comedic actor who's also a serious actor, Robin Williams."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "One of the best serious actors."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "I mean, and one of the funniest people of all time, but as great, as incredible as he was as a funny man, as a standup and a performer, I almost like his serious stuff better."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "Can I ask you a question about that?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "What do you make of the, that he committed suicide?"}, {"time": 1063, "text": "I think it's, I mean, it's super depressing."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "I've referred to him as like the Jesus Christ of depression."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "It's almost like he died for others depression."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "You'd look at someone like that and go, wait a minute, you're a rockstar."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "Like you don't, you could just check out if you're not liking your life."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "And of course, something like suicide begs that you look a little deeper and realize how tortured the human mind can make someone."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "Is there some aspect to, you know, we're in LA."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "Is there some aspect of celebrity that is isolating that can make you feel really lonely?"}, {"time": 1102, "text": "I don't feel, no, not really."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "You feel the love?"}, {"time": 1105, "text": "No, I just feel like I'm not, I mean, it's like, I don't know, I've always kind of had a small group of friends and those people don't, you know, it's like I've known the same people for years and years."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "You never really felt the celebrity really."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "Nah, in LA, it's hard to, it's hard for people."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "They see you and then the next minute they see so and so."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "So it's like, you know, I'm the guy from that."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "Mike and Molly, right?"}, {"time": 1131, "text": "Nope, nope."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "King of, you shave your head, you go bald."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Are you King of Queens?"}, {"time": 1137, "text": "Nope, that's not me."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "So close."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "You're wow, shit, you used to be the mountain on Game of Thrones."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "You look like shit, what happened?"}, {"time": 1146, "text": "You've been just eating fried dough?"}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Yeah, that's what's up."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "Can't lift any weights anymore."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "I'm at the gym doing like 15 pounds with shoulder press."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "Ah, and people coming up to me."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "You used to be a dragon killer, dude."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Half the man you used to be."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "What's, have there been low points in your life?"}, {"time": 1165, "text": "Sorry to go there, but."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Hey, hey, hey."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "Yeah, there's, everybody has a low point in life."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "The operative."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "Do you suffer from like depression and any of those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 1181, "text": "You know what, I do."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "I do, I have a bunch of stuff."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "How do you deal with it?"}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Said friends?"}, {"time": 1187, "text": "The friends and the."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "They don't do anything for me in that sense."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "I have an incredible fiance who, that's nice to have somebody constant that you love very much and see as the best person and all that good stuff."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "Hopefully, vice versa."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "Well, on your recent Instagram, she said that she loves you, so."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "Wow, you were."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "At least allegedly."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "Just on, yeah, allegedly."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "That might all be for, yeah."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "How much money did you pay her to say that?"}, {"time": 1215, "text": "I don't have any, because I'm not a stand up."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "I was like, I can do, you got Venmo?"}, {"time": 1221, "text": "I got, I only have like $123."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "I can give you some Dogecoin."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Yeah, some Doge."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "You got, you want some Doge?"}, {"time": 1227, "text": "I got some of those monkey NFTs."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "Oh, before I forget."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Put a dudesie sticker on your microphone if that's okay."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "Here."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "Now, these are tricky, because I have the thumbs of a, I have like Italian sausage thumbs."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "Don't wait and watch this happen."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "I'm just gonna."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "This will take another."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "Yeah, ooh, this is embarrassing."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "When this, are you good under pressure?"}, {"time": 1257, "text": "I have anxiety."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "I have performance anxiety."}, {"time":

"But that's not what podcasting is."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "Podcasting, you need to just be malleable and say whatever and do whatever."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "And that's what makes it a real, I mean, look, it's a medium for conversation."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "And if you're driving along listening to this or anything else, it's the true meaning of the parasocial relationship because the

forces me to sit down with Chad and goof around for an hour or an hour plus."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "And it provides the parameters that I a lot of times ignore because I think that podcasting is just two dudes shitting around or three or four."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "But it sits me down and gives me a premise to work with communically."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "And then you just riff with it."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "It's been a hoot."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "So from the acting perspective, a lot of people like Daniel Day Lewis will see acting just like as you described, which is you have your roles, you embrace those roles, and then you disappear."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "You don't do podcasts."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "You don't do any of that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "Your art is your art."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "So is that part of you feels that way?"}, {"time": 3173, "text": "Is that the actor side of you?"}, {"time": 3175, "text": "Anytime I get to do something that I don't get a chance to do much of or something that people haven't seen me do much of or that I've done on some scale that hasn't been very wide and not a lot of people have seen it, that's the stuff that I get really excited about."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "I don't know why I'm, I don't know why necessarily."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "I haven't answered that question yet in my life, like what it is about being an actor that I love so much because it's not like I don't like to, it's not like I'm trying to get away from myself and play other characters and stuff and not be myself."}, {"time": 3211, "text": "But it is, it has always been fun to just be other people and escape."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "Yeah, is there some aspect to the impressions where you become that person?"}, {"time": 3222, "text": "Is that like, what's that like to, I suppose acting is a full on version of that."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "You really at its best become the character."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "Is there some fun in that?"}, {"time": 3236, "text": "If you can play a character for long enough and then jump out of it, that's a lot of fun."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "Like I did this movie like four or five years ago called The Inside Game about the NBA gambling scandal that there's a Netflix documentary about it right now."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "And that character, I played Jimmy Batista, Baba the sheep, who's this guy who was this bookie and rah, rah, rah, and it's a very, he's, there's a lot going on with him."}, {"time": 3270, "text": "He's running numbers with the mob and stuff and there's a lot of money changing hands."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "That character was so, I got to be, get so deep into that character that coming out of it was a little odd."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "Or as weird as this sounds, the three stooges was hard for me to, I found that I had some of Curly's mannerisms just automatically, I could not stop them when people, when I would talk to people, they would come, I wasn't, I'm not doing it on purpose."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "Like I'm ready to shed it because I've been working on it for months and months at that point as far as getting the thing down and then you got to shoot."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "And then for me, it's always, I always want to change the stuff I did the day before."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "I'm like that."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "Or I'm like, I could have done it better and this and that."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "And that stayed with you, that character stayed with you a little bit."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "Totally, yeah."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "I just feel like with actors, sometimes when you listen to interviews, they have spent so much time sort of living inside other characters that they almost don't have a depth of personality themselves, like a depth."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "Like I don't mean that as a negative thing."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "It's just like, it feels like the art form at its best is pretending to be other people."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "And even pretending sounds negative, but like bringing certain characters to life."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "Yeah, yeah, embodying."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "A weird thing happened while we were doing Stooges because you've got a very heavy blueprint."}, {"time": 3359,

a scene, I would just think about, I mean, aside from all the other preparation, you know everything and what you're supposed to do."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "And I've been watching so much of it."},

unknown of now we're shooting it."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "And here are these parameters within to shoot the scene."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "I could still see it as them doing it."}, {"time": 3420, "text": "So much so that when I saw the movie at the premiere, I was like, who's this big fuck doing?"}, {"time": 3425, "text": "Cause I'm not curly to me."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "Curly is curly."}, {"time": 3429, "text": "So you're seeing yourself in black and white almost."}, {"time": 3431, "text": "I was seeing him."}, {"time": 3432, "text": "Yeah, I was only seeing him."}, {"time":

you know about Jerome Lester Horowitz is curly."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "I'm not saying he was exhumed or something or a spirit went in me or some weird, crystal mommy shit like that."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "I'm saying that this, because you know so much of it and because of the heavy blueprint that they left with you, you're channeling what that person does."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "And I was seeing entire scenes before you do them the way he would do it."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "And then you want a couple takes to make sure that you're doing it right."}, {"time": 3474, "text": "But that one was hard to let go of."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "Some of them are."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "Do you think Larry David, who was also in there dressed as a nun, also had trouble letting go of that?"}, {"time": 3483, "text": "We mentioned clothes make the man think that worked for him in that case."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "Man, you know he."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "Was it like

long."}, {"time": 3505, "text": "But shit, I gotta be out here in Atlanta, it's boiling hot."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "But at one point, there was this line where he kept doing, he would just spit a different line every time he was getting hit in the head with something and he's laying there on the ground."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "And he goes, he comes to and he says, at one point he goes, Miami audiences are the best audiences in the world, right?"}, {"time": 3527, "text": "Because he's loopy."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "Now he's playing a nun at the orphanage where the three stooges

don't."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "Like, you know if you can do this one or you can't."}, {"time": 4135, "text": "I think that process for him is lightning quick."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "But I also think he can look at someone who he does not do, and then by the end of the afternoon, he can do it."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "Maybe have an intuition who he can do."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "So the

brings her guy back, and then after a while, he gets pretty creepy."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "But it's also possible that if you interviewed your friends and family, what they love about you, the things they would list, it's a small list."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "They love you deeply, but the list is small."}, {"time": 4347, "text": "Like the thing that really we appreciate about each other

"text": "How do you feel about sentience?"}, {"time": 4404, "text": "Like when it comes to, because again, my pal Chad will be like, speaking of Black Mirror, he's with that San Junipero episode,

over."}, {"time": 5141, "text": "So I think that's the future, and that forces us to contend with what do we find compelling and beautiful about the art form itself?"}, {"time": 5153, "text": "So

been getting a lot better, the betas that they're releasing, right?"}, {"time": 5240, "text": "Absolutely, one of the big breakthroughs, I mean Dolly really started it, is that if you train a system

that art often has, which is it takes a lot of work for one artist to create one piece, one human being to create one piece of art that can just generate endlessly."}, {"time": 5306, "text": "And that makes us appreciate the thing less for some reason."}, {"time": 5310, "text": "Do you have any sort of a similar opinion that I do that if art doesn't come from a human being, it's inherently worth a little less?"}, {"time": 5318, "text": "Yeah, I think, I don't know if it's the human being, but the artist matters."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "And I think some of that has to do with the world view, the artist and the backstory, the memories, the life that led up to this piece of art, the perspective they take on the world, the journey they took to the world, the struggle, the triumphs, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "But I think AI systems can probably have the same."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "But we would have to, as opposed to treating it as a one black box, it would have to be an artist that has a Twitter account, and they have a consistent personality, they have a consistent avatar."}, {"time": 5362, "text": "And I think down the line, have something like human rights."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "But then it really becomes awfully like a person."}, {"time": 5368, "text": "Oi, that's terrifying."}, {"time": 5371, "text": "As much as I dig dudes, it's terrifying, I hope."}, {"time": 5374, "text": "It's terrifying, like, you know, a lot of things that came with the internet and the digital age are terrifying."}, {"time": 5379, "text": "Porn is terrifying, the mass, like the amount of porn that's online now is terrifying."}, {"time": 5385, "text": "The, like you mentioned, Bob Dylan with electric guitar, I would compare it more to the leap from, to sort of to the Napster and the Spotifyzation of music, which is like, you have these, it's less about albums now, and it's more about individual songs, and it's much easier to deliver the songs."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "And it's more about sort of the engagement of the listener versus like signing the artist and like distribution of the artist and so on."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "So

to be."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "You know, like if you wanted a baked potato, you would have put it in the microwave, you had to, and then long story, uphill both ways and digging the potato and

don't even, I don't get it."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "I think people will figure out, you see people on like on the train, public transit and so on, they're staring at their phone."}, {"time": 5517,

we're in, we're clearly in the Wild West still of the internet, and just when you think you're out of it, the internet proves another way that it can be dangerous and detrimental to people and
