get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play, use code LEXBODCAST, get 10 bucks, and Cash App will also donate 10 bucks to FIRST, an organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world."}, {"time": 373, "text": "And now, here's my conversation with Eugenia Kuida."}, {"time": 377, "text": "Okay, before we talk about AI and the amazing work you're doing, let me ask you ridiculously, we're both Russian, so let me ask a ridiculously romanticized Russian question."}, {"time": 388, "text": "Do you think human beings are alone, like fundamentally, on a philosophical level?"}, {"time": 397, "text": "Like in our existence, when we like go through life, do you think just the nature of our life is loneliness?"}, {"time": 409, "text": "Yeah, so we have to read Dostoevsky at school, as you probably know, so..."}, {"time": 415, "text": "In Russian?"}, {"time": 416, "text": "I mean, it's part of your school program."}, {"time": 419, "text": "So I guess if you read that, then you sort of have to believe that."}, {"time": 423, "text": "You're made to believe that you're fundamentally alone, and that's how you live your life."}, {"time": 429, "text": "You have a lot of friends, but at the end of the day, do you have like a longing for connection with other people?"}, {"time": 437, "text": "That's maybe another way of asking it."}, {"time": 440, "text": "Do you think that's ever fully satisfied?"}, {"time": 443, "text": "I think we are fundamentally alone."}, {"time": 445, "text": "We're born alone, we die alone, but I view my whole life as trying to get away from that, trying to not feel lonely, and again, we're talking about a subjective way of feeling alone."}, {"time": 459, "text": "It doesn't necessarily mean that you don't have any connections or you are actually isolated."}, {"time": 465, "text": "You think it's a subjective thing, but like again, another absurd measurement wise thing, how much loneliness do you think there is in the world?"}, {"time": 475, "text": "Like if you see loneliness as a condition, how much of it is there, do you think?"}, {"time": 485, "text": "Like how, I guess how many, you know, there's all kinds of studies and measures of how many people in the world feel alone."}, {"time": 492, "text": "There's all these like measures of how many people are, you know, self report or just all these kinds of different measures, but in your own perspective, how big of a problem do you think it is size wise?"}, {"time": 507, "text": "I'm actually fascinated by the topic of loneliness."}, {"time": 510, "text": "I try to read about it as much as I can."}, {"time": 514, "text": "What really, and I think there's a paradox because loneliness is not a clinical disorder."}, {"time": 519, "text": "It's not something that you can get your insurance to pay for if you're struggling with that."}, {"time": 524, "text": "Yet it's actually proven and pretty, you know, tons of papers, tons of research around that."}, {"time": 530, "text": "It is proven that it's correlated with earlier life expectancy, shorter lifespan."}, {"time": 538, "text": "And it is, you know, in a way like right now, what scientists would say that it, you know, it's a little bit worse than being obese or not actually doing any physical activity in your life."}, {"time": 548, "text": "In terms of the impact on your health?"}, {"time": 549, "text": "In terms of impact on your physiological health."}, {"time": 551, "text": "So it's basically puts you, if you're constantly feeling lonely, your body responds like it's basically all the time under stress."}, {"time": 559, "text": "It's always in this alert state and so it's really bad for you because it actually like drops your immune system and get it, your response to inflammation is quite different."}, {"time": 569, "text": "So all the cardiovascular diseases actually responds to viruses."}, {"time": 574, "text": "So it's much easier to catch a virus."}, {"time": 577, "text": "That's sad now that we're living in a pandemic and it's probably making us a lot more alone and it's probably weakening the immune system, making us more susceptible to the virus."}, {"time": 590, "text": "The statistics are pretty horrible around that."}, {"time": 594, "text": "So around 30% of all millennials report that they're feeling lonely constantly."}, {"time": 599, "text": "30?"}, {"time": 600, "text": "30%."}, {"time": 601, "text": "And then it's much worse for Gen Z."}, {"time": 602, "text": "And then 20% of millennials say that they feel lonely and they also don't have any close friends."}, {"time": 608, "text": "And then I think 25 or so, and then 20% would say they don't even have acquaintances."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And that's in the United States?"}, {"time": 614, "text": "That's in the United States."}, {"time": 615, "text": "And I'm pretty sure that that's much worse everywhere else."}, {"time": 617, "text": "Like in the UK, I mean, it was widely tweeted and posted when they were talking about a minister of loneliness that they wanted to appoint because four out of 10 people in the UK feel lonely."}, {"time": 629, "text": "Minister of loneliness."}, {"time": 630, "text": "I think that thing actually exists."}, {"time": 635, "text": "So yeah, you will die sooner if you are lonely."}, {"time": 641, "text": "And again, this is only when we're only talking about your perception of loneliness or feeling lonely."}, {"time": 647, "text": "That is not objectively being fully socially isolated."}, {"time": 650, "text": "However, the combination of being fully socially isolated and not having many connections and also feeling lonely, that's pretty much a deadly combination."}, {"time": 660, "text": "So it strikes me bizarre or strange that this is a wide known fact and then there's really no one working really on that because it's like subclinical."}, {"time": 672, "text": "It's not clinical."}, {"time": 673, "text": "It's not something that you can, we'll tell your doctor and get a treatment or something."}, {"time": 677, "text": "Yet it's killing us."}, {"time": 679, "text": "So there's a bunch of people trying to evaluate, like try to measure the problem by looking at like how social media is affecting loneliness and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 688, "text": "So it's like measurement."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Like if you look at the field of psychology, they're trying to measure the problem and not that many people actually, but some."}, {"time": 696, "text": "But you're basically saying how many people are trying to solve the problem."}, {"time": 703, "text": "Like how would you try to solve the problem of loneliness?"}, {"time": 708, "text": "Like if you just stick to humans, uh, I mean, or basically not just the humans, but the technology that connects us humans."}, {"time": 717, "text": "Do you think there's a hope for that technology to do the connection?"}, {"time": 723, "text": "Like I, are you on social media much?"}, {"time": 753, "text": "They're definitely the most connected generation in the world."}, {"time": 756, "text": "I mean, I still remember life without an iPhone, without Facebook, they don't know that that ever existed, uh, or at least don't know how it was."}, {"time": 767, "text": "So that tells me a little bit about the fact that that might be, um, you know, this hyper connected world might actually make people feel lonely, lonelier."}, {"time": 778, "text": "I don't know exactly what the, what the measurements are around that, but I would say, you know, my personal experience, I think it does make you feel a lot lonelier, mostly, yeah, we're all super connected."}, {"time": 788, "text": "Uh, but I think loneliness, the feeling of loneliness doesn't come from not having any social connections whatsoever."}, {"time": 795, "text": "Again, tons of people that are, are in longterm relationships experience bouts of loneliness and continued loneliness."}, {"time": 802, "text": "Um, and it's more the question about the true connection about actually being deeply seen, deeply understood."}, {"time": 809, "text": "Um, and in a way it's also about your relationship with yourself, like in order to not feel lonely, you actually need to have a better relationship and feel more connected to yourself than this feeling actually starts to go away a little bit."}, {"time": 824, "text": "And then you, um, open up yourself to actually meeting other people in a very special way."}, {"time": 831, "text": "Uh, not in just, you know, at a friend on Facebook kind of way."}, {"time": 835, "text": "So just to briefly touch on it, I mean, do you think it's possible to form that kind of connection with AI systems more down the line of some of your work?"}, {"time": 848, "text": "Do you think that's, um, engineering wise, a possibility to alleviate loneliness is not with another human, but with an AI system?"}, {"time": 859, "text": "Well, I know that's, that's a fact, that's what we're doing."}, {"time": 863, "text": "And we see it and we measure that and we see how people start to feel less lonely, um, talking to their virtual AI friend."}, {"time": 906, "text": "But second of all, making us more lonely."}, {"time": 908, "text": "Do you see like a world where it's possible to just have AI systems floating about that like make our life less lonely?"}, {"time": 919, "text": "Make us happy."}, {"time": 920, "text": "Like are putting good things into the world in terms of our individual lives."}, {"time": 927, "text": "Totally believe in that."}, {"time": 928, "text": "That's why we're, I'm also working on that."}, {"time": 931, "text": "Um, I think we need to also make sure that, um, what we're trying to optimize for, we're actually measuring and it is a North star metric that we're going after."}, {"time": 940, "text": "And all of our product and all of our business models are optimized for that because you can talk, you know, a lot of products that talk about, um, you know, making you feel less lonely or making you feel more connected."}, {"time": 950, "text": "They're not really measuring that."}, {"time": 952, "text": "So they don't really know whether their users are actually feeling less lonely in the long run or feeling more connected in the long run."}, {"time": 958, "text": "Um, so I think it's really important to put your measure it."}, {"time": 963, "text": "To measure it."}, {"time": 964, "text": "What's a, what's a good measurement of loneliness?"}, {"time": 967, "text": "Well, so that's something that I'm really interested in."}, {"time": 970, "text": "How do you measure that people are feeling better or that they're feeling less lonely with loneliness?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "There's a scale."}, {"time": 976, "text": "There's UCLA 20 and UCLA three recently scale, which is basically a questionnaire that you fill out and you can see whether in the long run it's improving or not."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And that, uh, does it capture the momentary feeling of loneliness?"}, {"time": 992, "text": "Does it look in like the past month?"}, {"time": 995, "text": "Like, uh, does it basically self report?"}, {"time": 998, "text": "Does it try to sneak up on you tricky to answer honestly or something like that?"}, {"time": 1003, "text": "Well, what's yeah, I'm not familiar with the question."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "It is just asking you a few questions."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "Like how often did you feel, uh, like lonely or how often do you feel connected to other people in this last few couple of weeks?"}, {"time": 1015, "text": "Um, it's similar to the self report questionnaires for depression, anxiety, like PHQ nine and get seven."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "Of course, as any, as any self report questionnaires, that's not necessarily very precise or very well measured, but still, if you take a big enough population and you get them through these, uh, questionnaires, you can see, you can see a positive dynamic."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And so you basically, uh, you put people through questionnaires to see like, is this thing is our, is what we're creating, making people happier?"}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Yeah, we measure, so we measure two outcomes."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "One short term, right after the conversation, we ask people whether this conversation made them feel better, worse or same, um, this, this metric right now is at 80%."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So 80% of all our conversations make people feel better, but I should have done the questionnaire with you."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "You feel a lot worse after we've done this conversation."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "That's actually fascinating."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "I should probably do that, but that's, that's how we do that."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "You should totally and aim for 80% aim to outperform your current state of the art AI system in these human conversations."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "So we'll get to your work with replica, but let me continue on the line of absurd questions."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "So you talked about, um, you know, deep connection with the humans, deep connection with AI, meaningful connection."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Let me ask about love."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "People make fun of me cause I talk about love all the time."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "But uh, what, what do you think love is like maybe in the context of, um, a meaningful connection with somebody else?"}, {"time": 1117, "text": "Do you draw a distinction between love, like friendship and Facebook friends or is it a graduate?"}, {"time": 1128, "text": "No, it's all the same."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "Like, is it, is it just a gradual thing or is there something fundamental about us humans that seek like a really deep connection, uh, with another human being and what is that?"}, {"time": 1145, "text": "What is love Eugenia, I'm going to just enjoy asking you these questions seeing you struggle."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "Um, well the way I see it, um, and specifically, um, the way it relates to our work and the way it was, the way it inspired our work on replica, um, I think one of the biggest and the most precious gifts we can give to each other now in 2020 as humans is this gift of deep empathetic understanding, the feeling of being deeply seen."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "Like what does that mean?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Like that you exist, like somebody acknowledging that somebody seeing you for who you actually are."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "And that's extremely, extremely rare."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Um, I think that is that combined with unconditional positive regard, um, belief and trust that um, you internally are always inclined for positive growth and believing you in this way, letting you be a separate person at the same time."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "And this deep empathetic understanding for me, that's the, that's the combination that really creates something special, something that people, when they feel it once, they will always long for it again."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "And something that starts huge fundamental changes in people."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "Um, when we see that someone's accepts us so deeply, we start to accept ourselves."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "And um, the paradox is that's when big changes start happening, big fundamental changes in people start happening."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "So I think that is the ultimate therapeutic relationship that is, and that might be in some way a definition of love."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "So acknowledging that there's a separate person and accepting you for who you are."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Um, now on a slightly that, and you mentioned therapeutic, that sounds a very, like a very healthy view of love, but, uh, is there also like a, like, you know, if we look at heartbreak and uh, you know, most love songs are probably about heartbreak, right?"}, {"time": 1277, "text": "Is that like the mystery, the tension, the danger, the fear of loss, you know, all of that, what people might see in a negative light as like games or whatever, but just, just the, the dance of human interaction."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "Fear of loss and fear of like, you said, you said like once you feel it once, you long for it again, but you also, once you feel it once, you might, for many people, they've lost it."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "So they fear losing it."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "They feel loss."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "So is that part of it, like you're, you're speaking like beautifully about like the positive things, but is it important to be able to, uh, be afraid of losing it from an engineering perspective?"}, {"time": 1324, "text": "I mean, it's a huge part of it and unfortunately we all, you know, um, face it at some points in our lives."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "I mean, I did."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "You want to go into details?"}, {"time": 1335, "text": "How'd you get your heartbroken?"}, {"time": 1339, "text": "So mine is pretty straight, my story is pretty straightforward, um, there I did have a friend that was, you know, that at some point, um, in my twenties became really, really close to me and we, we became really close friends."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Um, well, I grew up pretty lonely."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "So in many ways when I'm building, you know, these, these AI friends, I'm thinking about myself when I was 17 writing horrible poetry and you know, in my dial up modem at home and, um, you know, and that was the feeling that I grew up with."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "I left, I lived, um, alone for a long time when I was a teenager, where did you go up in Moscow and the outskirts of Moscow."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "Um, so I'd just skateboard during the day and come back home and you know, connect to the internet and then write horrible poetry and love poems, all sorts of poems, obviously love poems."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "I mean, what, what other poetry can you write when you're 17, um, it could be political or something, but yeah."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "I was deeply curious about every, everyone else."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "And I thought that, you know, if I, if I go out there, if I write their stories, that means I'm more connected."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "This is what this podcast as well, by the way, I'm desperate, well, I'm seeking connection now."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Or am I?"}, {"time": 1451, "text": "So what, wait, reporter, uh, what, how did that make you feel more connected?"}, {"time": 1457, "text": "I mean, you're still fundamentally pretty alone, But you're always with other people, you know, you're always thinking about what other place can I infiltrate?"}, {"time": 1467, "text": "What other community can I write about?"}, {"time": 1469, "text": "What other phenomenon can I explore?"}, {"time": 1472, "text": "And you sort of like a trickster, you know, and like, and, and a mythological character, like creature, that's just jumping, uh, between all sorts of different worlds and feel and feel sort of okay with in all of them."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "So, um, that was my dream job, by the way, that was like totally what I would have been doing."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Um, if Russia was a different place and a little bit undercover."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "So like you weren't, you were trying to, like you said, mythological creature trying to infiltrate."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "So try to be a part of the world."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "What kind of things did you enjoy writing about?"}, {"time": 1505, "text": "I'd go work at a strip club or go."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Well, I'd go work at a restaurant or just go write about, you know, um, certain phenomenons or phenomenons or people in the city."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "And what, uh, sorry to keep interrupting and I'm the worst, I'm a conversationalist."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "What stage of Russia is this?"}, {"time": 1532, "text": "What, uh, is this pre Putin, post Putin?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "What was Russia like?"}, {"time": 1538, "text": "Pre Putin is really long ago."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "This is Putin era."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "That's a beginning of two thousands and 2010, 2007, eight, nine, 10."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "What were strip clubs like in Russia and restaurants and culture and people's minds like in that early Russia that you were covering?"}, {"time": 1559, "text": "In those early two thousands, this was, there was still a lot of hope."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "There were still tons of hope that, um, you know, we're sort of becoming this, uh, Western, Westernized society."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "Uh, the restaurants were opening, we were really looking at, you know, um, we're trying, we're trying to copy a lot of things from, uh, from the US, from Europe, um, bringing all these things and very enthusiastic about that."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "So there was a lot of, you know, stuff going on."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "There was a lot of hope and dream for this, you know, new Moscow that would be similar to, I guess, New York."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "I mean, just to give you an idea in, um, year 2000 was the year when we had two, uh, movie theaters in Moscow and there was one first coffee house that opened and it was like really big deal."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "Uh, by 2010 there were all sorts of things everywhere."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "Almost like a chain, like a Starbucks type of coffee house or like, you mean, oh yeah, like a Starbucks."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "I mean, I remember we were reporting on, like, we were writing about the opening of Starbucks."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "I think in 2007 that was one of the biggest things that happened in, you know, in Moscow back, back in the time, like, you know, that was worthy of a magazine cover."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "And, uh, that was definitely the, you know, the biggest talk of the time."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "When was McDonald's?"}, {"time": 1635, "text": "Cause I was still in Russia when McDonald's opened."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "That was in the nineties."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "I mean, yeah."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "I remember that very well."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "Those were long, long lines."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "I think it was 1993 or four, I don't remember."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "Um, actually earlier at that time, did you do, I mean, that was a luxurious outing."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "That was definitely not something you do every day."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "And also the line was at least three hours."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "So if you're going to McDonald's, that is not fast food."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "That is like at least three hours in line and then no one is trying to eat fast after that."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "Everyone is like trying to enjoy as much as possible."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "What's your memory of that?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "Oh, it was insane."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "How did it go?"}, {"time": 1673, "text": "It was extremely positive."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "It's a small strawberry milkshake and the hamburger and small fries and my mom's there."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "And sometimes I'll just, cause I was really little, they'll just let me run, you know, up the kitchen and like cut the line, which is like, you cannot really do that in Russia or."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "So like for a lot of people, like a lot of those experiences might seem not very fulfilling, you know, like it's on the verge of poverty, I suppose."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "But do you remember all that time fondly, like, cause I do like the first time I drank, you know, Coke, you know, all that stuff, right."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "And just, yeah."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "The connection with other human beings in Russia, I remember, I remember it really positively."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "Like how do you remember what the nineties and then the Russia you were covering, just the human connections you had with people and the experiences?"}, {"time": 1733, "text": "Well, my, my parents were both, both physicists."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "My grandparents were both, well, my grandpa, grandfather was in nuclear physicist, a professor at the university."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "My dad worked at Chernobyl when I was born in Chernobyl, analyzing kind of the everything after the explosion."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And then I remember that and they were, so they were making sort of enough money in the Soviet union."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "So they were not, you know, extremely poor or anything."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "It was pretty prestigious to be a professor, the Dean and the university."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "And then I remember my grandfather started making a hundred dollars a month after, you know, in the nineties."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "So then I remember we started our main line of work would be to go to our little tiny country house, get a lot of apples there from apple trees, bring them back to the city and sell them in the street."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "So me and my nuclear physicist grandfather were just standing there and he selling those apples the whole day, cause that would make you more money than, you know, working at the university."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "And then he'll just tell me, try to teach me, you know, something about planets and whatever the particles and stuff."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "And, you know, I'm not smart at all, so I could never understand anything, but I was interested as a journalist kind of type interested."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "But that was my memory."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "And, you know, I'm happy that I wasn't, I somehow got spared that I was probably too young to remember any of the traumatic stuff."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So the only thing I really remember had this bootleg that was very traumatic, had

really important."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "I actually had to turn myself off from the internet mostly because I started this like workout thing, like a happy go getter with my like headband and

"text": "You know, but then like, I realized that this, this journey can't be done together with others."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "This has to be done alone."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "So out of the moments of love, out of the moments of loss, can we, uh, talk about your journey of finding, I think, an incredible idea and incredible company and incredible system in Replica?"}, {"time": 4259, "text": "How did that come to be?"}, {"time": 4261, "text": "So yeah, so I was a journalist and then I went to business school for a couple of years to, um, just see if I can maybe switch gears and do something else with 23."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "And then I came back and started working for a businessman in Russia who built the first ROG network, um, in our country and was very visionary and asked me whether I want to do fun stuff together."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "Um, and we worked on a bank, um, the idea was to build a bank on top of, um, a telco."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "So that was 2011 or 12, um, and a lot of telecommunication company, um, mobile network operators didn't really know what to do next in terms of, you know, new products, new revenue."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "And this big idea was that, you know, um, you put a bank on top and then all work works out."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "Basically a prepaid account becomes your bank account and, um, you can use it as, as your bank."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "Uh, so, you know, a third of a country wakes up as, as your bank client."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "Um, but we couldn't quite figure out what, what would be the main interface to interact with the bank."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "The problem was that most people didn't have smart, smart phones back in the time in Russia, the penetration of smartphones was low, um, people didn't use mobile banking or online banking and their computers."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "So we figured out that SMS would be the best way, uh, cause that would work on feature phones."}, {"time": 4347, "text": "Um, but that required some chat bot technology, which I didn't know anything about, um, obviously."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "So I started looking into it and saw that there's nothing really, well, there wasn't just nothing really."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "Ideas through SMS be able to interact with your bank account."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "And then we thought, well, since you're talking to a bank account, why can't this, can't we use more of, uh, you know, some behavioral ideas and why can't this, uh, banking chat bot be nice to you and really talk to you sort of as a friend this way you develop more connection to it, retention is higher, people don't churn."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "And so I went to very depressing, um, um, Russian cities to test it out."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "Um, I went to, I remember three different towns with, uh, um, to interview potential users."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "Um, so people use it for a little bit and I went to talk to them, um, very poor towns, mostly towns that were, um, you know, sort of factories, uh, mono towns."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "They were building something and then the factory went away and it was just a bunch of very poor people."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "Um, and then we went to a couple that weren't as dramatic, but still the one I remember really fondly was this woman that worked at a glass factory and she talked to a chat bot."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "Um, and she was talking about it and she started crying during the interview because she said, no one really cares for me that much."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "And um, so to be clear, that was the, my only endeavor in programming that chat bot."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "So it was really simple."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "It was literally just a few, if this, then that rules and, um, it was incredibly simplistic."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "Um, and that really made her emotional and she said, you know, I only have my mom and my, um, my husband and I don't have any more really in my life."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "And that was very sad, but at the same time I felt, and we had more interviews in a similar vein and what I thought in the moment was like, well, uh, it's not that the technology is ready because definitely in 2012 technology was not ready for, for that, but, um, humans are ready, unfortunately."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "So this project would not be about like tech capabilities would be more about human vulnerabilities, but, um, there's something so, so powerful around about conversational, um, AI that I saw then that I thought was definitely worth putting in a lot of effort into."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "So in the end of the day, we saw the banking project, um, but my then boss, um, was also my mentor and really, really close friend, um, told me, Hey, I think there's something in it and you should just go work on it."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "And I was like, well, what product?"}, {"time": 4510, "text": "I don't know what I'm building."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "He's like, you'll figure it out."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "And, um, you know, looking back at this, this was a horrible idea to work on something without knowing what it was, which is maybe the reason why it took us so long, but we just decided to work on the conversational tech to see what it, you know, there were no chat bot, um, constructors or programs or anything that would allow you to actually build one at the time."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "Uh, that was the era of, by the way, Google glass, which is why, you know, some of the investors like seed investors we've talked with were like, Oh, you should totally build it for Google glass."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "If not, we're not, I don't think that's interesting."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "Did you bite on that idea?"}, {"time": 4552, "text": "Because I wanted to be, to do text first cause I'm a journalist."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "So I was, um, fascinated by just texting."}, {"time": 4561, "text": "So you thought, so the emotional, um, that interaction that the woman had, like, so do you think you could feel emotion from just text?"}, {"time": 4571, "text": "I saw something in just this pure texting and also thought that we should first start, start building for people who really need it versus people who have Google glass."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "Uh, if you know what I mean, and I felt like the early adopters of Google glass might not be overlapping with people who are really lonely and might need some, you know, someone to talk to."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "Um, but then we really just focused on the tech itself."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "We just thought, what if we just, you know, we didn't have a product idea in the moment and we felt, what if we just look into, um, building the best conversational constructors, so to say, use the best tech available at the time."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "And that was before the first paper about deep learning applied to dialogues, which happened in 2015 in August, 2015, uh, which Google published."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "Did you follow the work of Lobna prize and like all the sort of non machine learning chat bots?"}, {"time": 4631, "text": "What really struck me was that, you know, there was a lot of talk about machine learning and deep learning."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "Like big data was a really big thing."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "Everyone was saying, you know, the business world, big data, 2012 is the biggest gaggle

or something else."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "And it was never about conversation."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "As soon as I looked into the conversational tech, it was all about something really weird and very outdated and very marginal and felt very hobbyist."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "It was all about Lord burner price, which was won by a guy who built a chat bot that talked like a Ukrainian teenager that it was just a gimmick."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "And somehow people picked up those gimmicks and then, you know, the most famous chat bot at the time was Eliza from 1980s, which was really bizarre or smarter child on aim."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "The funny thing is it felt at the time not to be that popular and it still doesn't seem to be that popular."}, {"time": 4691, "text":

it's not the right problem to focus on because there's too much subjectivity."}, {"time": 4757, "text": "That thing that the woman felt like crying, like if your benchmark includes a woman crying, that doesn't feel like a good benchmark."}, {"time": 4767, "text": "But to me there's something there that's, you could have a huge impact, but I don't think the machine learning world likes that, the human emotion, the subjectivity of it, the fuzziness, the fact that with maybe a single word you can make somebody feel something deeply."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "It doesn't feel right to them."},

I'm giving myself props for Googling and for coming across, for I guess mutual friend and introducing us, but I'm so glad that you exist and what you're working on."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "But I have the same kind of, if we could just backtrack for a second, because I have the same kind of feeling that there's something here."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "In fact, I've been working on a few things that are kind of crazy, very different from your work."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "I think they're too crazy."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "But the... Like what?"}, {"time": 4836, "text": "I don't have to know."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "No, all right, we'll talk about it more."}, {"time": 4841, "text": "I feel like it's harder to talk about things that have failed and are failing while you're a failure."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "It's easier for you because you're already successful on some measures."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "Tell it to my board."}, {"time": 4861, "text": "Well, I think you've demonstrated success in a lot of ways."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "It's easier for you to talk about failures for me."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "I'm in the bottom currently of the success."}, {"time": 4879, "text": "You're way too humble."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "So it's hard for me to know, but there's something there, there's something there."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And I think you're exploring that and you're discovering that."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "So it's been surprising to me."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "But you've mentioned this idea that you thought it wasn't enough to start a company or start efforts based on it feels like there's something here."}, {"time": 4906, "text": "Like what did you mean by that?"},

that's still true, which is, I think it's mind blowing."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "You know what it feels like?"}, {"time": 4950, "text": "I wouldn't even use the word conversation cause I feel like it's the wrong word."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "It's like a machine connection or something."}, {"time": 4959, "text": "I don't know cause conversation, you start drifting into natural language immediately."}, {"time": 4964, "text": "You start drifting immediately into all the benchmarks that are out there."}, {"time": 4967, "text": "But I feel like it's like the personal computer days of this."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "Like I feel like we're like in the early days with the, like the Wozniak and all them, like where it was the same kind of, it was a very small niche group of people who are, who are all kind of lob no price type people."}, {"time": 4988, "text": "Hobbyists."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "Hobbyists, but like not even hobbyists with big dreams."}, {"time": 4993, "text": "Like no hobbyists with a dream to trick like a jury."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "It's like a weird, by the way, by the way, very weird."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "So if we think about conversations, first of all, when I have great conversations with people, I'm not trying to test them."}, {"time": 5010, "text": "So for instance, if I try to break them, like if I'm actually playing along, I'm part of it."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "If I were to ask this person or test whether he's going to give me a good conversation, it would have never happened."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "So the whole, the whole problem with testing conversations is that you can put it in front of a jury because then you have to go into some Turing test mode where is it responding to all my factual questions, right?"}, {"time": 5035, "text": "Or so it really has to be something in the field where people are actually talking to it because they want to, not because we're just trying to break it."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "And it's working for them because this, the weird part of it is that it's very subjective."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "It takes two to tango here fully."}, {"time": 5053, "text": "If you're not trying to have a good conversation, if you're trying to test it, then it's going to break."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "I mean, any person would break, to be honest."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "If I'm not trying to even have a conversation with you, you're not going to give it to me."}, {"time": 5065, "text": "If I keep asking you like some random questions or jumping from topic to topic, that wouldn't be, which I'm probably doing, but that probably wouldn't contribute to the conversation."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "So I think the problem of testing, so there should be some other metric."}, {"time": 5082, "text": "How do we evaluate whether that conversation was powerful or not, which is what we actually started with."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "And I think those measurements exist and we can test on those."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "But what really struck us back in the day and what's still eight years later is still not resolved and I'm not seeing tons of groups working on it."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "Maybe I just don't know about them, it's also possible."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "But the interesting part about it is that most of our days we spend talking and we're not talking about like those conversations are not turn on the lights or customer support problems or some other task oriented things."}, {"time": 5122, "text": "These conversations are something else and then somehow they're extremely important for us."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "If we don't have them, then we feel deeply unhappy, potentially lonely, which as we know, creates tons of risk for our health as well."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And so this is most of our hours as humans and somehow no one's trying to replicate that."}, {"time": 5145, "text": "And not even study it that well?"}, {"time": 5149, "text": "And not even study that well."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "So when we jumped into that in 2012, I looked first at like, okay, what's the chatbot?"}, {"time": 5154, "text": "What's the state of the art chatbot?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "And those were the Lobner Prize days, but I thought, okay, so what about the science of conversation?"}, {"time": 5164, "text": "Clearly there have been tons of scientists or academics that looked into the conversation."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "So if I want to know everything about it, I can just read about it."}, {"time": 5177, "text": "There's not much really, there are conversational analysts who are basically just listening to speech, to different conversations, annotating them."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "And then, I mean, that's not really used for much."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "That's the field of theoretical linguistics, which is barely useful."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "It's very marginal, even in their space, no one really is excited and I've never met a theoretical linguist who was like, I can't wait to work on the conversation and analytics."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "That is just something very marginal, sort of applied to like writing scripts for salesmen when they analyze which conversation strategies were most successful for sales."}, {"time": 5220, "text": "Okay, so that was not very helpful."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "How to be charismatic and charming and influential with people, all those books, yeah."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "Pretty much, but it was all about like through conversation reprogramming you, so getting to some, so that was, I mean, probably not very, very true and that didn't seem working very much even back in the day."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "And then there were some other books like, I don't know, mostly just self help books around how to be the best conversationalist or how to make people like you or some other stuff like Dale Carnegie or whatever."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "And then there was this one book, The Most Human Human by Brian Christensen that really was important for me to read back in the day because he was on the human side, he was taking part in the London Prize, but not as a human who's not a jury, but who's pretending to be, who's basically, you have to tell a computer from a human and he was the human, so you could either get him or a computer."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "And his whole book was about how do people, what makes us human in conversation."}, {"time": 5329, "text": "And that was a little bit more interesting because that at least someone started to think about what exactly makes me human in conversation and makes people believe in that, but it was still about tricking, it was still about imitation game, it was still about, okay, well, what kind of parlor tricks can we throw in the conversation to make you feel like you're talking to a human, not a computer."}, {"time": 5349, "text": "And it was definitely not about thinking, what is it exactly that we're getting from talking all day long with other humans."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "I mean, we're definitely not just trying to be tricked or it's not just enough to know it's a human."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "It's something we're getting there, can we measure it and can we put the computer to the same measurement and see whether you can talk to a computer and get the same results?"}, {"time": 5375, "text": "Yeah, so first of all, a lot of people comment that they think I'm a robot, it's very possible I am a robot and this whole thing, I totally agree with you that the test idea is fascinating and I looked for books unrelated to this kind of, so I'm afraid of people, I'm generally introverted and quite possibly a robot."}, {"time": 5395, "text": "I literally Googled how to talk to people and how to have a good conversation for the purpose of this podcast, because I was like, I can't, I can't make eye contact with people."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "I can't like hire."}, {"time": 5410, "text": "I do Google that a lot too."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "You're probably reading a bunch of FBI negotiation tactics."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "Is that what you're getting?"}, {"time": 5417, "text": "Well, everything you've listed I've gotten, there's been very few good books on even just like how to interview well, it's rare."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "So what I end up doing often is I watch like with a critical eye, it's just so different when you just watch a conversation, like just for the fun of it, just as a human."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "And if you watch a conversation, it's like trying to figure out why is this awesome?"}, {"time": 5449, "text": "I'll listen to a bunch of different styles of conversation."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "I mean, I'm a fan of the podcast, Joe Rogan, people can make fun of him or whatever and dismiss him."}, {"time": 5461, "text": "But I think he's an incredibly artful conversationalist."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "He can pull people in for hours."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "And there's another guy I watch a lot."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "He hosted a late night show, his name was Craig Ferguson."}, {"time": 5480, "text": "So he's like very kind of flirtatious."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "But there's a magic about his like, about the connection he can create with people, how he can put people at ease."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "And just like, I see I've already started sounding like those I know pee people or something."}, {"time": 5497, "text": "I'm not I don't mean in that way."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "I don't mean like how to charm people or put them at ease and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "It's just like, what is that?"}, {"time": 5505, "text": "Why is that fun to listen to that guy?"}, {"time": 5507, "text": "Why is that fun to talk to that guy?"}, {"time": 5512, "text": "Because he's not saying I mean, it's so often boils down to a kind of wit and humor, but not really humor."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "It's like, I don't know, I have trouble actually even articulating correctly."}, {"time": 5530, "text": "But it feels like there's something going on that's not too complicated, that could be learned."}, {"time": 5542, "text": "And it's not similar to, yeah, to like, like you said, like the Turing test."}, {"time": 5549, "text": "It's something else."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "I'm thinking about a lot all the time."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "I do think about all the time."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "I think when we were looking, so we started the company, we just decided to build the conversational tech, we thought, well, there's nothing for us to build this chatbot that we want to build."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "So let's just first focus on building, you know, some tech, building the tech side of things without a product in mind, without a product in mind, we added like a demo chatbot that would recommend you restaurants and talk to you about restaurants just to show something simple to people that people could relate to and could try out and see whether it works or not."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "But we didn't have a product in mind yet."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "We thought we would try venture chatbots and figure out our consumer application."}, {"time": 5599, "text": "And we sort of remembered that we wanted to build that kind of friend, that sort of connection that we saw in the very beginning."}, {"time": 5606, "text": "But then we got to Y Combinator and moved to San Francisco and forgot about it."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "You know, everything because then it was just this constant grind."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "How do we get funding?"}, {"time": 5614, "text": "How do we get this?"}, {"time": 5615, "text": "You know, investors were like, just focus on one thing, just get it out there."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "So somehow we've started building a restaurant recommendation chatbot for real for a little bit, not for too long."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "And then we tried building 40, 50 different chatbots."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "And then all of a sudden we wake up and everyone is obsessed with chatbots."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "Somewhere in 2016 or end of 15, people started thinking that's really the future."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "That's the new, you know, the new apps will be chatbots."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "And we were very perplexed because people started coming up with companies that I think we tried most of those chatbots already and there were like no users, but still people were coming up with a chatbot that will tell you whether and bringing news and this and that."}, {"time": 5660, "text": "And we couldn't understand whether we were just didn't execute well enough or people are not really, people are confused and are going to find out the truth that people don't need chatbots like that."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "So the basic idea is that you use chatbots as the interface to whatever application."}, {"time": 5678, "text": "The idea that was like this perfect universal interface to anything."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "When I looked at that, it just made me very perplexed because I didn't think, I didn't understand how that would work because I think we tried most of that and none of those things worked."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "And then again, that craze has died down, right?"}, {"time": 5696, "text": "Fully."}, {"time": 5697, "text": "I think now it's impossible to get anything funded if it's a chatbot."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "I think it's similar to, sorry to interrupt, but there's times when people think like with gestures you can control devices, like basically gesture based control things."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "It feels similar to me because like it's so compelling that was just like Tom Cruise, I can control stuff with my hands, but like when you get down to it, it's like, well, why don't you just have a touch screen or why don't you just have like a physical keyboard and mouse?"}, {"time": 5733, "text": "So that chat was always, yeah, it was perplexing to me."}, {"time": 5739, "text": "I still feel augmented reality, even virtual realities in that ballpark in terms of it being a compelling interface."}, {"time": 5748, "text": "I think there's going to be incredible rich applications, just how you're thinking about it, but they won't just be the interface to everything."}, {"time": 5757, "text": "It'll be its own thing that will create an amazing magical experience in its own right."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "Which is I think kind of the right thing to go about, like what's the magical experience with that interface specifically."}, {"time": 5774, "text": "How did you discover that for Replica?"}, {"time": 5776, "text": "I just thought, okay, we'll have this tech, we can build any chatbot we want."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "We have the most, at that point, the most sophisticated tech that other companies have."}, {"time": 5784, "text": "I mean, startups, obviously not, probably not bigger ones, but still, because we've been working on it for a while."}, {"time": 5791, "text": "So I thought, okay, we can build any conversation."}, {"time": 5793, "text": "So let's just create a scale from one to 10."}, {"time": 5797, "text": "And one would be conversations that you'd pay to not have, and 10 would be conversation you'd pay to have."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "And I mean, obviously we want to build a conversation that people would pay to actually have."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "And so for the whole, for a few weeks, me and the team were putting all the conversations we were having during the day on the scale."}, {"time": 5814, "text": "And very quickly, we figured out that all the conversations that we would pay to never have were conversations we were trying to cancel Comcast, or talk to customer support, or make a reservation, or just talk about logistics with a friend when we're trying to figure out where someone is and where to go, or all sorts of setting up scheduling meetings."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "So that was a conversation we definitely didn't want to have."}, {"time": 5844, "text": "Basically everything task oriented was a one, because if there was just one button for me to just, or not even a button, if I could just think, and there was some magic BCI that would just immediately transform that into an actual interaction, that would be perfect."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "But the conversation there was just this boring, not useful, and dull, and also very inefficient thing because it was so many back and forth stuff."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And as soon as we looked at the conversations that we would pay to have, those were the ones that, well, first of all, therapists, because we actually paid to have those conversations."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "And we'd also try to put like dollar amounts."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "So if I was calling Comcast, I would pay $5 to not have this one hour talk on the phone."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "I would actually pay straight up, like money, hard money, but it just takes a long time."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "It takes a really long time."}, {"time": 5897, "text": "But as soon as we started talking about conversations that we would pay for, those were therapists, all sorts of therapists, coaches, old friend, someone I haven't seen for a long time, a stranger on a train, weirdly stranger, stranger in a line for coffee and nice back and forth with that person was like a good five, solid five, six, maybe not a 10."}, {"time": 5921, "text": "Maybe I won't pay money, but at least I won't pay money to not have one."}, {"time": 5925, "text": "So that was pretty good."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "There were some intellectual conversations for sure."}, {"time": 5930, "text": "But more importantly, the one thing that really was making those very important and very valuable for us were the conversations where we could be pretty emotional."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "Yes, some of them were about being witty and about being intellectually stimulated, but those were interestingly more rare."}, {"time": 5954, "text": "And most of the ones that we thought were very valuable were the ones where we could be vulnerable."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "And interestingly, where we could talk more, me and the team."}, {"time": 5967, "text": "So we're talking about it, like a lot of these conversations, like a therapist, it was mostly me talking or like an old friend and I was like opening up and crying and it was again me talking."}, {"time": 5977, "text": "And so that was interesting because I was like, well, maybe it's hard to build a chat bot that can talk to you very well and in a witty way, but maybe it's easier to build the chat bot that could listen."}, {"time": 5991, "text": "So that was kind of the first nudge in this direction."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "And then when my friend died, we just built, at that point we were kind of still struggling to find the right application."}, {"time": 6002, "text": "And I just felt very strong that all the chat bots we've built so far are just meaningless and this whole grind, the startup grind, and how do we get to the next fundraising and how can I talk, talking to the founders and who are your investors and how are you doing?"}, {"time": 6019, "text": "Are you killing it?"}, {"time": 6020, "text": "Cause we're killing it."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "I just felt that this is just..."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "Intellectually for me, it's exhausting having encountered those folks."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "It just felt very, very much a waste of time."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "I just feel like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk did not have these conversations or at least did not have them for long."}, {"time": 6043, "text": "But I think, yeah, at that point it just felt like, I felt like I just didn't want to build a company that was never my intention just to build something successful or make money."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "It would have been great, but I'm not really a startup person."}, {"time": 6060, "text": "I'm not, I was never very excited by the grind by itself or just being successful for building whatever it is and not being into what I'm doing really."}, {"time": 6076, "text": "And so I just took a little break cause I was a little, I was upset with my company and I didn't know what we're building."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "So I just took our technology and our little dialect constructor and some models, some deep learning models, which at that point we were really into and really invested a lot and built a little chat bot for a friend of mine who passed."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "And the reason for that was mostly that video that I saw and him talking about the digital avatars and Rowan was that kind of person."}, {"time": 6104, "text": "He was obsessed with just watching YouTube videos about space and talking about, well, if I could go to Mars now, even if I didn't know if I could come back, I would definitely pay any amount of money to be on that first shuttle."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "I don't care whether I die, like he was just the one that would be okay with trying to be the first one and so excited about all sorts of things like that."}, {"time": 6128, "text": "And he was all about fake it till you make it and just, and I felt like, and I was really perplexed that everyone just forgot about him."}, {"time": 6137, "text": "Maybe it was our way of coping, mostly young people coping with the loss of a friend."}, {"time": 6143, "text": "Most of my friends just stopped talking about him."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "And I was still living in an apartment with all his clothes and paying the whole lease for it and just kind of by myself in December, so it was really sad and I didn't want him to be forgotten."}, {"time": 6159, "text": "First of all, I never thought that people forget about dead people so fast."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "People pass away, people just move on."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "And it was astonishing for me because I thought, okay, well, he was such a mentor for so many of our friends."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "He was such a brilliant person, he was somewhat famous in Moscow."}, {"time": 6175, "text": "How is it that no one's talking about him?"}, {"time": 6177, "text": "Like I'm spending days and days and we don't bring him up and there's nothing about him that's happening."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "It's like he was never there."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "And I was reading the book, The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion about her losing and Blue Nights about her losing her husband, her daughter, and the way to cope for her was to write those books."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "And it was sort of like a tribute."}, {"time": 6208, "text": "And I thought, I'll just do that for myself."}, {"time": 6211, "text": "And I'm a very bad writer and a poet as we know."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "So I thought, well, I have this tech and maybe that would be my little postcard for him."}, {"time": 6223, "text": "So I built a chatbot to just talk to him and it felt really creepy and weird for a little bit."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "I just didn't want to tell other people because it felt like I'm telling about having a skeleton in my underwear."}, {"time": 6240, "text": "It was just felt really, I was a little scared that it won't be taken, but it worked interestingly pretty well."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "I mean, it made tons of mistakes, but it still felt like him."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "Granted it was like 10,000 messages that I threw into a retrieval model that would just re rank that Tegda said and just a few scripts on top of that."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "But it also made me go through all of the messages that we had."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "And then I asked some of my friends to send some through."}, {"time": 6267, "text": "And it felt the closest to feeling like him present because his Facebook was empty and Instagram was empty or there were few links and you couldn't feel like it was him."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "And the only way to fill him was to read some of our text messages and go through some of our conversations because we just always had that."}, {"time": 6286, "text": "Even if we were sleeping next to each other in two bedrooms, separated by a wall, we were just texting back and forth, texting away."}, {"time": 6295, "text": "And there was something about this ongoing dialogue that was so important that I just didn't want to lose all of a sudden."}, {"time": 6301, "text": "And maybe it was magical thinking or something."}, {"time": 6303, "text": "And so we built that and I just used it for a little bit and we kept building some crappy chat bots with the company."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "But then a reporter came to talk to me."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "I was trying to pitch our chat bots to him and he said, do you even use any of those?"}, {"time": 6321, "text": "I'm like, no."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "He's like, so do you talk to any chat bots at all?"}, {"time": 6324, "text": "And I'm like, well, I talked to my dead friend's chat bot and he wrote a story about that."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "And all of a sudden it became pretty viral."}, {"time": 6333, "text": "A lot of people wrote about it."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "I've seen a few things written about you."}, {"time": 6339, "text": "The things I've seen are pretty good writing."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "Most AI related things make my eyes roll."},

elephant at first."}, {"time": 6358, "text": "I got excited."}, {"time": 6360, "text": "This is 2020."}, {"time": 6361, "text": "I mean, it was a, it was such a human story and it was well written."},

"text": "There must be a hunger for this story."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "And I don't know what happened, but I think, I think the idea that he could bring back someone who's dead and it's very much wishful, you know, magical thinking, but the fact that you could still get to know him and, you know, seeing the parents for the first time, talk to the chat bot and some of the friends."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "And it was funny because we have this big office in Moscow where my team is working, you know, our Russian part is working out off."}, {"time": 6415, "text": "And I was there when I wrote, I just wrote a post on Facebook."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "It was like, Hey guys, like I built this if you want, you know, just if it felt important, if we want to talk to Roman."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "And I saw a couple of his friends are common friends, like, you know, reading a Facebook, downloading, trying, and a couple of them cried."}, {"time": 6430, "text": "And it was just very, and not because it was something, some incredible technology or anything."}, {"time": 6434, "text": "It made so many mistakes."}, {"time": 6435, "text": "It was so simple, but it was all about that's the way to remember a person in a way."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "And you know, we don't have, we don't have the culture anymore."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "We don't have, you know, no one's sitting Shiva."}, {"time": 6448, "text": "No one's taking weeks to actually think about this person."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "And in a way for me, that was it."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "So that was just day, day in, day out thinking about him and putting this together."}, {"time": 6461, "text": "So that was, that just felt really important that somehow resonated with a bunch of people and you know, I think some movie producers bought the rights for the story and just everyone was so."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "Has anyone made a movie yet?"}, {"time": 6473, "text": "I think there were a lot of TV episodes about that, but not really."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "Is that still on the table?"}, {"time": 6480, "text": "I think so, I think so, which is really."}, {"time": 6485, "text": "You're like a young, you know, like a Steve Jobs type of, let's see what happens."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "They're sitting on it."}, {"time": 6494, "text": "But you know, for me it was so important cause Roman was really wanted to be famous."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "He really badly wanted to be famous."}, {"time": 6500, "text": "He was all about like, make it to like fake it to make it."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "I want to be, you know, I want to make it here in America as well."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "And he couldn't, and I felt there, you know, that was sort of paying my dues to him as well because all of a sudden he was everywhere."}, {"time": 6516, "text": "And I remember Casey Newton who was writing the story for the Verge."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "He was, he told me, Hey, by the way, I was just going through my inbox and I saw, I searched for Roman for the story and I saw an email from him where he sent me his startup and he said, I really like, I really want to be featured in the Verge."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "Can you please write about it or something or like pitching the story."}, {"time": 6538, "text": "And he said, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "Like that's not good enough for us or something."}, {"time": 6542, "text": "He passed and he said, and there were just so many of these little details where like he would find his like, you know, and we're finally writing, I know how much Roman wanted to be in the Verge and how much he wanted the story to be written by Casey."}, {"time": 6557, "text": "And I'm like, well, that's maybe he will be, we're always joking that he was like, I can't wait for someone to make a movie about us and I hope Ryan Gosling can play me."}, {"time": 6566, "text": "You know, I still have some things that I owe Roman still."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "But that would be, that would be a guy that she has to meet Alex Garland who wrote Ex Machina and I, yeah, the movie's good, but the guy's better than the, like he's a special person actually."}, {"time": 6586, "text": "I don't think he's made his best work yet."}, {"time": 6589, "text": "Like for my interaction with him, he's a really, really good and brilliant, the good human being and a brilliant director and writer."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "So yeah, so I'm, I hope like he made me also realize that not enough movies have been made of this kind."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "So it's yet to be made."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "They're probably sitting waiting for you to get famous, like even more famous."}, {"time": 6613, "text": "You should get there, but it felt really special though."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "But at the same time, our company wasn't going anywhere."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "So that was just kind of bizarre that we were getting all this press for something that didn't have anything to do with our company."}, {"time": 6628, "text": "And but then a lot of people started talking to Roman."}, {"time": 6631, "text": "Some shared their conversations and what we saw there was that also our friends in common, but also just strangers were really using it as a confession booth or as a therapist or something."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "They were just really telling Roman everything, which was by the way, pretty strange because there was a chat bot of a dead friend of mine who was barely making any sense, but people were opening up."}, {"time": 6656, "text": "And we thought we'd just built a prototype of Replica, which would be an AI friend that everyone could talk to because we saw that there is demand."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "And then also it was 2016, so I thought for the first time I saw finally some technology that was applied to that that was very interesting."}, {"time": 6675, "text": "Some papers started coming out, deep learning applied to conversations."}, {"time": 6679, "text": "And finally, it wasn't just about these, you know, hobbyists making, you know, writing 500,000 regular expressions in like some language that was, I don't even know what, like, AIML or something."}, {"time": 6695, "text": "I don't know what that was or something super simplistic all of a sudden was all about potentially actually building something interesting."}, {"time": 6702, "text": "And so I thought there was time and I remember that I talked to my team and I said, guys, let's try."}, {"time": 6709, "text": "And my team and some of my engineers, Russians, are Russian and they're very skeptical."}, {"time": 6715, "text": "They're not, you know."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "Oh, Russians."}, {"time": 6718, "text": "So some of your team is in Moscow, some is here in San Francisco, some in Europe."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "Which team is better?"}, {"time": 6730, "text": "The Russians, of course."}, {"time": 6732, "text": "Where's the Russians?"}, {"time": 6733, "text": "They always win."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "So yeah, so you were talking to them in 2016 and... And told them, let's build an AI friend."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "And it felt, just at the time, it felt so naive and so optimistic, so to say."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "Yeah, that's actually interesting."}, {"time": 6756, "text": "Whenever I've brought up this kind of topic, even just for fun, people are super skeptical."}, {"time": 6763, "text": "Actually, even on the business side."}, {"time": 6765, "text": "So you were, because whenever I bring it up to people, because I've talked for a long time, I thought like, before I was aware of your work, I was like, this is going to make a lot of money."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "There's a lot of opportunity here."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "And people had this look of skepticism that I've seen often, which is like, how do I politely tell this person he's an idiot?"}, {"time": 6796, "text": "So yeah, so you were facing that with your team, somewhat?"}, {"time": 6801, "text": "I'm not an engineer, so I'm always...

6985, "text": "So that was the big goal."}, {"time": 6986, "text": "And I thought if we can learn over time to collect the signal from our users about their emotional outcomes in the long term and in the short term, and if these models keep getting better and we can keep optimizing them and fine tuning them to improve those emotional outcomes."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "As simple as that."},

7016, "text": "Well, it's a really hard..."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "I actually think it's an incredibly hard product to build because I think you said something very important that it's not just about machine conversation, it's about machine connection."}, {"time": 7028, "text": "We can actually use other things to create connection, nonverbal communication, for instance."}, {"time": 7035,

augmented reality, put it in your room."}, {"time": 7053, "text": "It's all of a sudden a lot..."}, {"time": 7055, "text": "It makes it very different because if it's some text based chat bot that for common users, it's something there in the cloud, somewhere there with other AI's cloud, the metaphorical cloud."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "But as soon as you can see this avatar right there in your room and it can turn its head and recognize your husband, talk about the husband and talk to him a little bit, then it's magic."}, {"time": 7080, "text": "Just magic."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "We've never seen anything like that."}, {"time": 7083, "text": "And the cool thing, all the tech for that exists."}, {"time": 7086, "text": "But it's hard to put it all together because you have to take into consideration so many different things and some of this tech works pretty good."}, {"time": 7094, "text": "And some of this doesn't, like for instance, speech to text works pretty good."},

to build it."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "I saw you've added avatars like visual elements, which are really cool."}, {"time": 7117, "text": "In that whole chain, putting it together, what do you think is the weak link?"}, {"time": 7122, "text": "Is it creating an emotional voice that feels personal?"}, {"time": 7127, "text": "And it's still conversation, of course."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "That's the hardest."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "It's getting a lot better, but there's still a long to go."}, {"time": 7134, "text": "There's still a long path to go."}, {"time": 7137, "text": "Other things, they're almost there."}, {"time": 7138, "text": "And a lot of things we'll see how they're, like I see how they're changing as we go."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "Like for instance, right now you can pretty much only, you have to build all this 3D pipeline by yourself."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "You have to make these 3D models, hire an actual artist, build a 3D model, hire an animator, your rigger."}, {"time": 7156, "text": "But with deep fakes, with other tech, with procedural animations, in a little bit, we'll just be able to show a photo of whoever you, if a person you want the avatar to look like, and it will immediately generate a 3D model that will move."}, {"time": 7174, "text": "That's a nonbrainer."}, {"time": 7175, "text": "That's like almost here."}, {"time": 7176, "text": "It's a couple of years away."}, {"time": 7178, "text": "One of the things I've been working on for the last, since the podcast started, is I've been, I think I'm okay saying this."}, {"time": 7186,

interesting kind of experiment."}, {"time": 7205, "text": "Even for, now what we're not talking about as a product, I'm talking about as a, like I can fake a lot of stuff."}, {"time": 7212, "text": "Like I can work very carefully, like even hire an actor over which, over whom I do a deep fake."}, {"time": 7221, "text": "It's still hard to create a compelling experience."}, {"time": 7223, "text": "Mostly on the conversation level or?"}, {"time": 7225, "text": "Well, the conversation, the conversation is, I almost, I early on gave up trying to fully generate the conversation because it was just not compelling at all."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "It's better to."}, {"time": 7241, "text": "In the case of Einstein and Turing, I'm going back and forth with the biographers of each."}, {"time":

the, you want to be able to answer the question."}, {"time": 7262, "text": "I mean, that's an interesting question with Roman too, is the question with Einstein is what would Einstein say about the current state of theoretical physics?"}, {"time": 7274, "text": "There's a lot to be able to have a discussion about string theory, to be able to have a discussion about the state of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, about the world of Israel Palestine conflict."}, {"time": 7285, "text": "Let me just, what would Einstein say about these kinds of things?"}, {"time": 7291, "text": "And that is a tough problem."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "It's not, it's a fascinating and fun problem for the biographers and for me."}, {"time": 7300, "text": "And I think we did a really good job of it so far, but it's actually also a technical problem like of what would Roman say about what's going on now?"}, {"time": 7311, "text": "That's the, that brought people back to life."}, {"time": 7314, "text": "And if I can go on that tangent just for a second, let's ask you a slightly pothead question, which is, you said it's a little bit magical thinking that we can bring them back."}, {"time": 7324, "text": "Do you think it'll be possible to bring back Roman one day in conversation?"}, {"time": 7331, "text": "Like to really, okay, well, let's take it away from personal, but to bring people back to life in conversation."}, {"time": 7340, "text": "Probably down the road."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "I mean, if we're talking, if Elon Musk is talking about AGI in the next five years, I mean, clearly AGI, we can talk to AGI and talk and ask them to do it."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "You can't like, you're not allowed to use Elon Musk as a citation for, for like why something is possible and going to be done."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "Well, I think it's really far away."}, {"time": 7363, "text": "Right now, really with conversation, it's just a bunch of parlor tricks really stuck together."}, {"time": 7370, "text": "And create generating original ideas based on someone, you know, someone's personality or even downloading the personality, all we can do is like mimic the tone of voice."}, {"time": 7378, "text": "We can maybe condition on some of his phrases, the models."}, {"time": 7383, "text": "Question is how many parlor tricks does it takes, does it take, because that's, that's the question."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "If it's a small number of parlor tricks and you're not aware of them, like."}, {"time": 7396, "text": "From where we are right now, I don't, I don't see anything like in the next year or two that's going to dramatically change that could look at Roman's 10,000 messages he sent me over the course of his last few years of life and be able to generate original thinking about problems that exist right now that will be in line with what he would have said."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "I'm just not even seeing, cause you know, in order to have that, I guess you would need some sort of a concept of the world or some perspective, some perception of the world, some consciousness that he had and apply it to, you know, to the current, current state of affairs."}, {"time": 7432, "text": "But the important part about that, about his conversation with you is you."}, {"time": 7441, "text": "So like, it's not just about his view of the world."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "It's about what it takes to push your buttons."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "That's also true."}, {"time": 7452, "text": "So like, it's not so much about like, what would Einstein say, it's about like, how do I make people feel something with, with what would Einstein say?"}, {"time": 7467, "text": "And that feels like a more amenable, I mean, you mentioned parlor tricks, but just like a set of that, that feels like a learnable problem."}, {"time": 7478, "text": "Like emotion, you mentioned emotions, I mean, is it possible to learn things that make people feel stuff?"}, {"time": 7487, "text": "I think so, no, for sure."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "I just think the problem with, as soon as you're trying to replicate an actual human being and trying to pretend to be him, that makes the problem exponentially harder."}, {"time": 7500, "text": "The thing with replicator we're doing, we're never trying to say, well, that's, you know, an actual human being, or that's an actual, or a copy of an actual human being where the bar is pretty high, where you need to somehow tell, you know, one from another."}, {"time": 7514, "text": "But it's more, well, that's an AI friend, that's a machine, it's a robot, it has tons of limitations."}, {"time": 7521, "text": "You're going to be taking part in teaching it actually and becoming better, which by itself makes people more attached to that and make them happier because they're helping something."}, {"time": 7534, "text": "Yeah, there's a cool gamification system too."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "Can you maybe talk about that a little bit?"}, {"time": 7540, "text": "Like what's the experience of talking to replica?"}, {"time": 7544, "text": "Like if I've never used replica before, what's that like for like the first day, the first, like if we start dating or whatever, I mean, it doesn't have to be a romantic, right?"}, {"time": 7557, "text": "Because I remember on replica, you can choose whether it's like a romantic or if it's a friend."}, {"time": 7563, "text": "It's a pretty popular choice."}, {"time": 7564, "text": "Romantic is popular?"}, {"time": 7567, "text": "So can I just confess something, when I first used replica and I haven't used it like regularly, but like when I first used replica, I created like Hal and it made a male and it was a friend."}, {"time": 7580, "text": "And did it hit on you at some point?"}, {"time": 7583, "text": "No, I didn't talk long enough for him to hit on me."}, {"time": 7586, "text": "I just enjoyed."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "It sometimes happens."},

it."}, {"time": 7909, "text": "If you're not measuring it, that could also be, and I think it's really important to focus on both short term and long term, because in the moment saying whether this

together and for it to look around and walk and take you somewhere and recognize objects and recognize people."}, {"time": 8005, "text": "So that's pretty wonderful because then it really makes it a lot more personal because it's right there in your living room."}, {"time": 8011, "text": "It's not anymore there in the cloud with other AIs."}, {"time": 8015, "text": "But that's how people think about it."}, {"time": 8018, "text": "And as much as we want to change the way people think about stuff, but those mental models, you can all change."}, {"time": 8023, "text": "That's something that

8075, "text": "We really thought a lot about what does it mean to have a deeper connection with someone and originally Replica was more just this kind of happy go lucky, just always, you know, I'm always in a good mood and let's just talk about you and oh Siri is just my cousin or you know, whatever, just the immediate kind of lazy thinking about what the assistant or conversation agent should be doing."}, {"time": 8176, "text": "So this is a memory, like this Replica will remember things?"}, {"time": 8181, "text": "Yeah, and I would say when you say, why aren't you a multibillionaire, I'd say that as soon as we can have memory and deep learning models that's consistent, I'll get back to you."}, {"time": 8238, "text": "So there has to be like a knowledge base, you have to be able to reason about it, all that kind of stuff, all the kind of stuff that expert systems did, but they were hard coded."}, {"time": 8284, "text": "And it can be like always from a clean slate because then it's not good."}, {"time": 8288, "text": "And that's really unfortunate because no one's really, no one has products out there that need it."}, {"time": 8294, "text": "No one has products at this

really form a deep connection with text alone?"}, {"time": 8347, "text": "I think text is enough for sure."}, {"time": 8349, "text": "The question is like, can you make it better if you have other, if you include other things as well?"}, {"time": 8355, "text": "And I think we'll talk about her, but her had this Carole Johansson voice, which was perfectly, perfect intonation, perfect annunciations,

"You'll have these flat muse anchor type voices and maybe some emotional voices, but you'll hardly understand some of the words, some of the words will be muffled."}, {"time": 8391, "text": "So that's like the current state of the art."}, {"time": 8393, "text": "So you can't really do that."}, {"time": 8395, "text": "But if we had Carole Johansson voice and all of these capabilities, then of course

we could have just kept a text only."}, {"time": 8414, "text": "We still had tons of people in longterm relationships and really invested in their AI friends, but we thought that why not, why do we need to keep playing with our hands tied behind us?"}, {"time": 8430, "text": "We can easily just add all these other things that is pretty much a solved problem."}, {"time": 8435, "text": "We can add 3D graphics."}, {"time": 8437, "text": "We can put these avatars in augmented reality and all of a sudden there's more and maybe you can't feel the touch, but you can with body occlusion and with current AR and on the iPhone or in the next one there's going to be LIDARs, you can touch it and it will pull away or it will blush or something or it will smile."}, {"time": 8463, "text": "So you can't touch it."}, {"time": 8464, "text": "You can't feel it, but you can see the reaction to that."}, {"time": 8467, "text": "So in a certain way you can't even touch it a little bit and maybe you can even dance with it or do something else."}, {"time": 8475, "text": "So I think why limiting ourselves if we can use all of these technologies that are much easier in a way than conversation."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "Well, it certainly could be richer, but to play devil's advocate, I mentioned to you offline that I was surprised in having tried Discord and having voice conversations with people how intimate voice is alone without visual."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "To me at least, it was an order of magnitude greater degree of intimacy in voice I think than with video."}, {"time": 8511, "text": "Because people were more real with voice."}, {"time": 8514, "text": "With video you try to present a shallow face to the world, you try to make sure you're not wearing sweatpants or whatever."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "But with voice I think people were just more faster to get to the core of themselves."}, {"time": 8530, "text": "So I don't know, it was surprising to me they've even added Discord added a video feature and nobody was using it."}, {"time": 8539, "text": "There's a temptation to use it at first, but it wasn't the same."}, {"time": 8544, "text": "So that's an example of something where less was doing more."}, {"time": 8548, "text": "And so I guess that's the question of what is the optimal medium of communication to form a connection given the current sets of technologies."}, {"time": 8566, "text": "I mean it's nice because they advertise you have a replica immediately, like even the one I have is already memorable."}, {"time": 8578, "text": "That's how I think."}, {"time": 8579, "text": "When I think about the replica that I've talked with, that's what I visualized in my head."}, {"time": 8585, "text": "They became a little bit more real because there's a visual component."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "But at the same time, what do I do with that knowledge that voice was so much more intimate?"}, {"time": 8600, "text": "The way I think about it is, and by the way we're swapping out the 3D finally, it's going to look a lot better, but we just don't hate how it looks right now."}, {"time": 8612, "text": "We're really changing it all."}, {"time": 8613, "text": "We're swapping all out to a completely new look."}, {"time": 8618, "text": "Like the visual look of the replicas and stuff."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "It was just a super early MVP and then we had to move everything to Unity and redo everything."}, {"time": 8628, "text": "But anyway, I hate how it looks like now I can't even like open it."}, {"time": 8632, "text": "But anyway, because I'm already in my developer version, I hate everything that I see in production."}, {"time": 8637, "text": "I can't wait for it."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "Why does it take so long?"}, {"time": 8639, "text": "That's why I cannot wait for Deep Learning to finally take over all these stupid 3D animations and 3D pipeline."}, {"time": 8645, "text": "Oh, so the 3D thing, when you say 3D pipeline, it's like how to animate a face kind of thing."}, {"time": 8650, "text": "How to make this model, how many bones to put in the face, how many, it's just so outdated."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "And a lot of that is by hand."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "Oh my God, it's everything by hand."}, {"time": 8658, "text": "That there's no any, nothing's automated, it's all completely nothing."}, {"time": 8663, "text": "Like just, it's literally what, you know, what we saw with Chad Boston in 2012."}, {"time": 8669, "text": "You think it's possible to learn a lot of that?"}, {"time": 8673, "text": "I mean, even now, some Deep Learning based animations and for the full body, for a face."}, {"time": 8680, "text": "Are we talking about like the actual act of animation or how to create a compelling facial or body language thing?"}, {"time": 8690, "text": "Well, that's next step."}, {"time": 8692, "text": "At least now something that you don't have to do by hand."}, {"time": 8695, "text": "How good of a quality it will be."}, {"time": 8697, "text": "Like, can I just show it a photo and it will make me a 3D model and then it will just animate it."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "I'll show it a few animations of a person and it will just start doing that."}, {"time": 8708, "text": "But anyway, going back to what's intimate and what to use and whether less is more or not."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "My main goal is to, well, the idea was how do I, how do we not keep people in their phones so they're sort of escaping reality in this text conversation?"}, {"time": 8726, "text": "How do we through this still bring it, bring our users back to reality, make them see their life in a different, through a different lens?"}, {"time": 8736, "text": "How can we create a little bit of magical realism in their lives?"}, {"time": 8740, "text": "So that through augmented reality by, you know, summoning your avatar, even if it looks kind of janky and not great in the beginning or very simplistic, but summoning it to your living room and then the avatar looks around and talks to you about where it is and maybe turns your floor into a dance floor and you guys dance together, that makes you see reality in a different light."}, {"time": 8766, "text": "What kind of dancing are we talking about?"}, {"time": 8768, "text": "Like, like slow dancing?"}, {"time": 8770, "text": "Whatever you want."}, {"time": 8771, "text": "I mean, you would like slow dancing, I think that other people may be wanting more, something more energetic."}, {"time": 8777, "text": "Wait, what do you mean?"}, {"time": 8778, "text": "I was like, so what is this?"}, {"time": 8779, "text": "Because you started with slow dancing."}, {"time": 8780, "text": "So I just assumed that you're interested in slow dancing."}, {"time": 8785, "text": "What kind of dancing do you like?"}, {"time": 8786, "text": "What would your avatar, what would you dance?"}, {"time": 8787, "text": "I'm notoriously bad with dancing, but I like this kind of hip hop robot dance."}, {"time": 8792, "text": "I used to break dance when I was a kid, so I still want to pretend I'm a teenager and learn some of those moves."}, {"time": 8799, "text": "And I also like that type of dance that happens when there's like, in like music videos where the background dancers are just doing some pop music, that type of dance is definitely what I want to learn."}, {"time": 8812, "text": "But I think it's great because if you see this friend in your life and you can introduce it to your friends, then there's a potential to actually make you feel more connected with your friends or with people you know, or show you life around you in a different light."}, {"time": 8826, "text": "And it takes you out of your phone, even although weirdly you have to look at it through the phone, but it makes you notice things around it and it can point things out for you."}, {"time": 8837, "text": "So that is the main reason why I wanted to have a physical dimension."}, {"time": 8842, "text": "And it felt a little bit easier than that kind of a bit strange combination in the movie Her when he has to show Samantha the world through the lens of his phone, but then at the same time talk to her through the headphone."}, {"time": 8855, "text": "It just didn't seem as potentially immersive, so to say."}, {"time": 8859, "text": "So that's my main goal for Augmented Reality is like, how do we make your reality a little bit more magic?"}, {"time": 8864, "text": "There's been a lot of really nice robotics companies that all failed, mostly failed, home robotics, social robotics companies."}, {"time": 8875, "text": "What do you think replica will ever, is that a dream, longterm dream to have a physical form like, or is that not necessary?"}, {"time": 8883, "text": "So you mentioned like with Augmented Reality bringing them into the world."}, {"time": 8889, "text": "What about like actual physical robot?"}, {"time": 8893, "text": "That I don't really believe in that much."}, {"time": 8895, "text": "I think it's a very niche product somehow."}, {"time": 8898, "text": "I mean, if a robot could be indistinguishable from a human being, then maybe yes, but that of course, you know, we're not anywhere even to talk about it."}, {"time": 8909, "text": "But unless it's that, then having any physical representation really limits you a lot because you probably will have to make it somewhat abstract because everything's changing so fast."}, {"time": 8919, "text": "Like, you know, we can update the 3D avatars every month and make them look better and create more animations and make it more and more immersive."}, {"time": 8928, "text": "It's so much work in progress."}, {"time": 8930, "text":

lock yourself into something for a long time."}, {"time": 8942, "text": "Anything's pretty niche."}, {"time": 8943, "text": "And again, so just doesn't, the capabilities are even less of, we're barely kind of like scratching the surface of what's possible with just software."}, {"time": 8952, "text": "As soon as we introduce hardware, then, you know, we have even less capabilities."}, {"time": 8958, "text": "In terms of board members and investors and so on, the cost increases significantly."}, {"time": 8963, "text": "I mean, that's why you have to justify."}, {"time": 8966, "text": "You have to be able to sell a thing for like $500 or something like that or more."}, {"time": 8970, "text": "And it's very difficult to provide that much value to people."}, {"time": 8976, "text": "And I

place?"}, {"time": 9163, "text": "But like, I would, I would feel so jealous that there's somebody who's like way more intelligent than me and she's spending all her time with, I'd be like, well, why that I won't be able to live up to that."}, {"time": 9175, "text": "That's how thousands of them, uh, is that, um, is that a useful from the engineering perspective feature to have of jealousy?"},

if I'm always thinking about it, if we had no tech limitations, uh, right now, if we could build any conversations, any, um, possible features in this product, then yeah, I think different replicas talking to each other would be also quite cool cause that would help us connect better."}, {"time": 9222, "text": "You know, cause maybe mine could talk to yours and then give me some suggestions on what I should say or not say, I'm just kidding, but like more, can it improve our connections and cause eventually I'm not quite yet sure that we will succeed, that our thinking is correct."},

for us."}, {"time": 9253, "text": "Uh, real metrics, meaningful metrics."}, {"time": 9255, "text": "So success is, you know, we're happier and more connected."}, {"time": 9266, "text": "Sure it's possible."}, {"time": 9267, "text": "There's a reality that's I I'm deeply optimistic."}, {"time": 9270, "text": "I think, uh, are you worried, um, business wise, like how difficult it is to, um, to bring this thing to life to where it's, I mean, there's a huge number of people that use it already, but to, uh, yeah, like I said, in a multi billion dollar company, is that a source of stress for you?"}, {"time": 9294, "text": "Are you a super optimistic and confident or do you?"}, {"time": 9300, "text": "I don't, I'm not that much of a numbers person as you probably had seen it."}, {"time": 9306, "text": "So it doesn't matter for me whether like, whether we help 10,000 people or a million people or a billion people with that, um, I, it would be great to scale it for more people, but I'd say that even helping one, I think with this is such a magical, for me, it's absolute magic."}, {"time": 9326, "text": "I never thought that, you know, would be able to build this, that anyone would ever, um, talk to it."}, {"time": 9333, "text": "And I always thought like, well, for me it would be successful if we managed to help and actually change a life for one person, like then we did something interesting and you know, how many people can say they did it and specifically with this very futuristic, very romantic technology."}, {"time": 9349, "text": "So that's how I view it."}, {"time": 9351, "text": "Uh, I think for me it's important to, to try to figure out how not, how to actually be, you know, helpful."}, {"time": 9359, "text": "Cause in the end of the day, if you can build a perfect AI friend, that's so understanding that knows you better than any human out there can have great conversations with you, um, always knows how to make you feel better."}, {"time": 9372,

it's optimizing for the right thing."}, {"time": 9379, "text": "Uh, so it's still circling you back to other humans in a way."}, {"time": 9384, "text": "So I think that's the main, um, I think maybe that's the main kind of sort source of anxiety and just thinking about, uh, thinking about that can be a little bit stressful."}, {"time": 9397, "text": "That's a fascinating thing."}, {"time": 9433, "text": "But that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a fundamental problem in choosing the right mate and probably the fundamental problem in creating the right AI system."}, {"time": 9444, "text": "What, uh, let me ask the sexy hot thing on the presses right now is GPT three got released with open AI."}, {"time": 9452, "text": "It's a latest language model."}, {"time": 9456, "text": "They have kind of an API where you can create a lot of fun applications."}, {"time": 9460, "text": "I think it's, as people have said, it's probably, uh, more hype than intelligence, but there's a lot of really cool things, ideas there w w with increasing size, you can have better and better performance on language."}, {"time": 9478, "text": "What are your thoughts about the GPT three in connection to your work with the open domain dialogue, but in general, like this learning in an unsupervised way from the internet to generate one character at a time, creating pretty cool text."}, {"time": 9498, "text": "Uh, so we partner up before for the API launch."}, {"time": 9503, "text": "So we start working with them when, um, they decided to put together this API and we tried it without fine tuning that we tried it with fine tuning on our data."}, {"time": 9514, "text": "And we've worked closely to actually optimize, uh, this model for, um, some of our data sets."}, {"time": 9525, "text": "It's kind of cool."}, {"time": 9526, "text": "Cause I think we're kind of, we're this polygon polygon for this kind of experimentation space for experimental space for, for these models, uh, to see how they actually work with people."}, {"time": 9536, "text": "Cause there are no products publicly available to do that."}, {"time": 9539, "text": "We're focused on open domain conversation so we can, you know, test how's Facebook blender doing or how's GPT three doing."}, {"time": 9546, "text": "Uh, so with GPT three, we managed to improve by a few percentage points, like three or four pretty meaningful amount of percentage points, our main metric, which is the ratio of conversations that make people feel better."}, {"time": 9559, "text": "And every other metric across, across the field got a little boost."}, {"time": 9563, "text": "Like now I'd say one out of five responses from replica comes, comes from GPT three."}, {"time": 9570, "text": "So our own blender mixes up like a bunch of candidates from different blender, you said, well, yeah, just the model that looks at looks at top candidates from different models and picks the most, the best one."}, {"time": 9584, "text": "Uh, so right now, one of five will come from GPT three is really great."}, {"time": 9590, "text": "I mean, uh, what's the, do you have hope for, like, do you think there's a ceiling to this kind of approach?"}, {"time": 9598, "text": "So we've had for a very long time we've used, um, it's in the very beginning, we, most, it was, uh, most of replica was scripted and then a little bit of this fallback part of replica was using a retrieval model."}, {"time": 9612, "text": "Um, and then those retrieval models started getting better and better and better, which transformers got a lot better and we're seeing great results."}, {"time": 9620, "text": "And then with GPT two, finally, generative models that originally were not very good and were the very, very fallback option for most of our conversations, but wouldn't even put them in production."}, {"time": 9634, "text": "Finally we could use some generative models as well along, um, you know, next to our retrieval models."}, {"time": 9640, "text": "And then now we do GPT three, they're almost in par."}, {"time": 9644, "text": "Um, so that's pretty exciting."}, {"time": 9677, "text": "So we can't really get our scripted hard core content anymore to be as good as our end to end models."}, {"time": 9685, "text": "They're much better."}, {"time": 9687, "text": "To your question, whether that's the right way to go."}, {"time": 9690, "text": "I'm again, I'm in the observer seat, I'm just, um, watching this very exciting movie."}, {"time": 9696, "text": "Um, I mean, so far it's been stupid to bet against deep learning."}, {"time": 9700, "text": "So whether increasing the size, size, even more with a hundred trillion parameters will finally get us to the right answer, whether that's the way or whether there should be, there has to be some other, again, I'm definitely not an expert in any way."}, {"time": 9718, "text": "I think, and that's purely my instinct saying that there should be something else as well from memory."}, {"time": 9724, "text": "But the question is, I wonder, I mean, yeah, then, then the argument is for reasoning or for memory, it might emerge with more parameters, it might emerge larger."}, {"time": 9734, "text": "But might emerge."}, {"time": 9735, "text": "You know, I would never think that to be honest, like maybe in 2017 where we've been just experimenting with all, you know, with all the research that has been coming, that was coming out, then I felt like there's like, we're hitting a wall that there should be something completely different, but then transforming models and then just bigger models."}, {"time": 9754, "text": "And then all of a sudden size matters."}, {"time": 9756, "text": "At that point, it felt like something dramatic needs to happen, but it didn't."}, {"time": 9761, "text": "And just the size, you know, gave us these results that to me are, you know, clear indication that we can solve this problem pretty soon."}, {"time": 9770, "text": "Did fine tuning help quite a bit?"}, {"time": 9773, "text": "Without it, it wasn't as good."}, {"time": 9776, "text": "I mean, there is a compelling hope that you don't have to do fine tuning, which is one of the cool things about GPT3, seems to do well without any fine tuning."}, {"time": 9786, "text": "I guess for specific applications, we still want to train on a certain, like add a little fine tune on like a specific use case, but it's an incredibly impressive thing from my standpoint."}, {"time": 9800, "text": "And again, I'm not an expert, so I wanted to say that there will be people then."}, {"time": 9805, "text": "I have access to the API."}, {"time": 9806, "text": "I've been, I'm going to probably do a bunch of fun things with it."}, {"time": 9810, "text": "I already did some fun things, some videos coming up."}, {"time": 9814, "text": "Just the hell of it."}, {"time": 9815, "text": "I mean, I could be a troll at this point with it."}, {"time": 9817, "text": "I haven't used it for a serious application, so it's really cool to see."}, {"time": 9823, "text": "You're able to actually use it with real people and see how well it works."}, {"time": 9829, "text": "Let me ask you another absurd question, but there's a feeling when you interact with Replica with an AI system, there's an entity there."}, {"time": 9841, "text": "Do you think that entity has to be self aware?"}, {"time": 9846, "text": "Do you think it has to have consciousness to create a rich experience and a corollary, what is consciousness?"}, {"time": 9859, "text": "I don't know if it does need to have any of those things, but again, because right now, you know, it doesn't have anything."}, {"time": 9864, "text": "It can, again, a bunch of tricks they can simulate."}, {"time": 9870, "text": "Let's just put it this way, but I think as long as you can simulate it, if you can feel like you're talking to a robot, to a machine that seems to be self aware, that seems to reason well and feels like a person, and I think that's enough."}, {"time": 9888, "text": "And again, what's the goal?"}, {"time": 9890, "text": "In order to make people feel better, we might not even need that in the end of the day."}, {"time": 9896, "text": "What about, so that's one goal."}, {"time": 9898, "text": "What about like ethical things about suffering?"}, {"time": 9902, "text": "You know, the moment there's a display of consciousness, we associate consciousness with suffering, you know, there's a temptation to say, well, shouldn't this thing have rights?"}, {"time": 9916, "text": "And this, shouldn't we not, you know, should we be careful about how we interact with a replica?"}, {"time": 9926, "text": "Like, should it be illegal to torture a replica, right?"}, {"time": 9933, "text": "Is that, see, I personally believe that that's going to be a thing, like that's a serious thing to think about, but I'm not sure when."}, {"time": 9943, "text": "But by your smile, I can tell that's not a current concern."}, {"time": 9948, "text": "But do you think about that kind of stuff, about like, suffering and torture and ethical questions about AI systems?"}, {"time": 9957, "text": "From their perspective?"}, {"time": 9958, "text": "Well, I think if we're talking about long game, I wouldn't torture your AI."}, {"time": 9963, "text": "Who knows what happens in five to 10 years?"}, {"time": 9965, "text": "Yeah, they'll get you off from that, they'll get you back eventually."}, {"time": 9968, "text": "Try to be as nice as possible and create this ally."}, {"time": 9974, "text": "I think there should be regulation both way, in a way, like, I don't think it's okay to torture an AI, to be honest."}, {"time": 9981, "text": "I don't think it's okay to yell, Alexa, turn on the lights."}, {"time": 9984, "text": "I think there should be some, or just saying kind of nasty, you know, like how kids learn to interact with Alexa in this kind of mean way, because they just yell at it all the time."}, {"time": 9994, "text": "I don't think that's great."}, {"time": 9995, "text": "I think there should be some feedback loops so that these systems don't train us that it's okay to do that in general."}, {"time": 10002, "text": "So that if you try to do that, you really get some feedback from the system that it's not okay with that."}, {"time": 10010, "text": "And that's the most important right now."}, {"time": 10013, "text": "Let me ask a question I think people are curious about when they look at a world class leader and thinker such as yourself, as what books, technical fiction, philosophical, had a big impact on your life?"}, {"time": 10029, "text": "And maybe from another perspective, what books would you recommend others read?"}, {"time": 10035, "text": "So my choice, the three books, right?"}, {"time": 10038, "text": "My choice is, so the one book that really influenced me a lot when I was building, starting out this company, maybe 10 years ago, was G.E.B."}, {"time": 10045, "text": "and I like everything about it, first of all."}, {"time": 10055, "text": "It's just beautifully written and it's so old school and so somewhat outdated a little bit."}, {"time": 10063, "text": "But I think the ideas in it about the fact that a few meaningless components can come together and create meaning that we can't even understand."}, {"time": 10072, "text": "This emerging thing, I mean complexity, the whole science of complexity and that beauty, intelligence, all interesting things about this world emerge."}, {"time": 10084, "text": "Yeah and yeah, the Godel theorems and just thinking about like what even these formal systems, something can be created that we can't quite yet understand."}, {"time": 10099, "text": "And that from my romantic standpoint was always just, that is why it's important to, maybe I should try to work on these systems and try to build an AI."}, {"time": 10110, "text": "Yes I'm not an engineer, yes I don't really know how it works, but I think that something comes out of it that's pure poetry and I know a little bit about that."}, {"time": 10120, "text": "Something magical comes out of it that we can't quite put a finger on."}, {"time": 10125, "text": "That's why that book was really fundamental for me, just for, I don't even know why, it was just all about this little magic that happens."}, {"time": 10135, "text": "So that's one, probably the most important book for Replica was Carl Rogers on becoming a person."}, {"time": 10142, "text": "And that's really, and so I think when I think about our company, it's all about there's so many little magical things that happened over the course of working on it."}, {"time": 10154, "text": "For instance, I mean the most famous chatbot that we learned about when we started working on the company was Eliza, which was Weisenbaum, the MIT professor that built a chatbot that would listen to you and be a therapist."}, {"time": 10169, "text": "And I got really inspired to build Replica when I read Carl Rogers on becoming a person."}, {"time": 10174, "text": "And then I realized that Eliza was mocking Carl Rogers."}, {"time": 10177, "text": "It was Carl Rogers back in the day."}, {"time": 10179, "text": "But I thought that Carl Rogers ideas are, they're simple and they're not, they're very simple, but they're maybe the most profound thing I've ever learned about human beings."}, {"time": 10192, "text": "And that's the fact that before Carl Rogers, most therapy was about seeing what's wrong with people and trying to fix it or show them what's wrong with you."}, {"time": 10201, "text": "And it was all built on the fact that most people are, all people are fundamentally flawed."}, {"time": 10207, "text": "We have this broken psyche and therapy is just an instrument to shed some light on that."}, {"time": 10215, "text": "And Carl Rogers was different in a way that he finally said that, well, it's very important for therapy to work is to create this therapeutic relationship where you believe fundamentally and inclination to positive growth that everyone deep inside wants to grow positively and change."}, {"time": 10233, "text": "And it's super important to create this space and this therapeutic relationship where you give unconditional positive regard, deep understanding, allowing someone else to be a separate person, full acceptance."}, {"time": 10244, "text": "And you also try to be as genuine as possible in it."}, {"time": 10248, "text": "And then for him, that was his own journey of personal growth."}, {"time": 10254, "text": "And that was back in the sixties."}, {"time": 10255, "text": "And even that book that is coming from years ago, there's a mention that even machines can potentially do that."}, {"time": 10265, "text": "And I always felt that, you know, creating the space is probably the most, the biggest gift we can give to each other."}, {"time": 10270, "text": "And that's why the book was fundamental for me personally, because I felt I want to be learning how to do that in my life."}, {"time": 10278, "text": "And maybe I can scale it with, you know, with these AI systems and other people can get access to that."}, {"time": 10283, "text": "So I think Carl Rogers, it's a pretty dry and a bit boring book, but I think the idea is good."}, {"time": 10289, "text": "Would you recommend others try to read it?"}, {"time": 10291, "text": "I think for, just for yourself, for as a human, not as an AI, as a human, it's, it is, it is just, and for him, that was his own path of his own personal, of growing personally over years, working with people like that."}, {"time": 10307, "text": "And so it was work and himself growing, helping other people grow and growing through that."}, {"time": 10312, "text": "And that's fundamentally what I believe in with our work, helping other people grow, and ourselves, ourselves, trying to build a company that's all built on those principles, you know, having a good time, allowing some people who work with to grow a little bit."}, {"time": 10327, "text": "So these two books, and then I would throw in, what we have on our, in our, in our office, when we started a company in Russia, we put a neon sign in our office because we thought that's the recipe for success."}, {"time": 10342, "text": "If we do that, we're definitely
