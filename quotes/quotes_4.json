set of function is set of function which has small capacity or small diversity, small VC dimension example."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Which contain good function inside."}, {"time": 1117, "text":

describe VC?"}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So, when you have a machine."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "So, machine capable to pick up one function from the admissible set of function."}, {"time": 1142,

pick up function."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "But it can be small."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "Small, we call it capacity but maybe better called diversity."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "So, not very different function in the set."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "It's infinite set of function but not very diverse."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "So, it is small VC dimension."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "When VC dimension is small, you need small amount of training data."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "So, the goal is to create admissible set of functions which is have small VC dimension and contain good function."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Then you will be able to pick up the function using small amount of observations."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "So, that is the task of learning?"}, {"time": 1207,

formulated yesterday."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Statistical learning theory does not involve in creating admissible set of function."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "In classical learning theory, everywhere, 100% in textbook, the set of function, admissible set of function is given."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "But this is science about nothing because the most difficult problem to create admissible set of functions given, say, a lot of functions, continuum set of function, create admissible set of functions."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "That means that it has finite VC dimension, small VC dimension and contain good function."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "So, this was out of consideration."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "So, what's the process of doing that?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "I mean, it's fascinating."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "What is the process of creating this admissible set of functions?"}, {"time": 1273, "text": "That is invariant."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "That's invariant."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "Yeah, you're looking of properties of training data and properties means that you have some function and you just count what is value, average value of function on training data."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "You have model and what is expectation of this function on the model and they should coincide."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "So, the problem is about how to pick up functions."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "It can be any function."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "In fact, it is true for all functions."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "But because when we're talking, say, duck does not jumping, so you don't ask question jump like a duck because it is trivial."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "It does not jumping and doesn't help you to recognize jump."}, {"time": 1336,

this illness, this disease."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "It is legal."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "So, there is a general type of predicate looks like and special type of predicate, which related to this

"Well, the mixed reality, Microsoft is really, it's not even futuristic, it's here."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "It's incredible stuff."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "And look, and it's having an impact right now."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "Like one of the more interesting things that's happened with mixed reality over the past couple of years that I didn't clearly see is that it's become the computing device for folks who, for doing their work, who haven't used any computing device at all to do their work before."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "So technicians and service folks and people who are doing like machine maintenance on factory floors."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "So like they, you know, because they're mobile and like they're out in the world and they're working with their hands and, you know, sort of servicing these like very complicated things, they're, they don't use their mobile phone and like they don't carry a laptop with them and, you know, they're not tethered to a desk."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "And so mixed reality, like where it's getting traction right now, where HoloLens is selling a lot of units is for these sorts of applications for these workers."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "And it's become like, I mean, like the people love it."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "They're like, oh my God, like this is like for them, like the same sort of productivity boosts that, you know, like an office worker had when they got their first personal computer."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "Yeah, but you did mention it's certainly obvious AI as a platform, but can we dig into it a little bit?"}, {"time": 1395, "text": "How does AI begin to infuse some of the products in Microsoft?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "So currently providing training of, for example, neural networks in the cloud or providing pre trained models or just even providing computing resources and whatever different inference that you wanna do using neural networks."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "How do you think of AI infusing as a platform that Microsoft can provide?"}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think it's super interesting."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "It's like everywhere."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And like we run these review meetings now where it's me and Satya and like members of Satya's leadership team and like a cross functional group of folks across the entire company who are working on like either AI infrastructure or like have some substantial part of their product work using AI in some significant way."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Now, the important thing to understand is like when you think about like how the AI is gonna manifest in like an experience for something that's gonna make it better, like I think you don't want the AIness to be the first order thing."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "It's like whatever the product is and like the thing that is trying to help you do, like the AI just sort of makes it better."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And this is a gross exaggeration, but like people get super excited about like where the AI is showing up in products and I'm like, do you get that excited about like where you're using a hash table like in your

engineering tool."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "And so like it shows up everywhere."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So like we've got dozens and dozens of features now in Office that are powered by like fairly sophisticated machine learning, our search engine wouldn't work at all if you took the machine learning out of it."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "The like increasingly things like content

"No, no, no, it's like anti bullying stuff."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "So the usual social network stuff that you have to deal with."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "But it's like really it's targeted, it's targeted towards a gaming audience."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "So it's like a very particular type of thing where the line between playful banter and like legitimate bullying is like a subtle one."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "And like you have to like, it's sort of tough."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Like I have."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "I'd love to if we could dig into it because you're also, you led the engineering efforts of LinkedIn."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "And if we look at LinkedIn as a social network, and if we look at the Xbox gaming as the social components, the very different kinds

to prevent abusive behavior and at the same time, let people be playful and joke around and that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1622, "text": "I think in a certain way, like if you have what I would call vertical social networks, it gets to be a little bit easier."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "So like if you have a clear notion of like what your social network should be used for, or like what you are designing a community around, then you don't have as many dimensions to your sort of content safety problem as you do in a general purpose platform."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "I mean, so like on LinkedIn, like the whole social network is about connecting people with opportunity, whether it's helping them find a job or to sort of find mentors or to sort of help them like find their next sales

is, I mean, like in some ways, like that's very, very broad, but in other ways it's sort of, it's narrow."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "And so like you can build AI's like machine learning systems that are capable with those boundaries of making better automated decisions about like what is sort of inappropriate and offensive comment or dangerous comment or illegal content when you have some constraints."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "You know, same thing with like the gaming social network."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "So for instance, like it's about playing games, not having fun."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "And like the thing that you don't want to have happen on the platform is why bullying is such an important thing."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Like bullying is not fun."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "So you want to do everything in your power to encourage that not to happen."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "And yeah, but I think it's sort of a tough problem in general and it's one where I think, you know, eventually we're going to have to have some sort of clarification from our policymakers about what it is that we should be doing, like where the lines are, because it's tough."},

should have a say in like where the lines are drawn."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "Like you don't want a bunch of people making like unilateral decisions."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And like we are in a state right now for some of these platforms where you actually do have to make unilateral decisions where the policymaking isn't going to happen fast enough in order to like prevent very bad things from happening."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "But like we need the policymaking side of that to catch up, I think, as quickly as possible because you want that whole process to be a democratic thing, not a, you know, not some sort of weird thing where you've got a non representative group of people making decisions that have, you know, like national and global impact."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "And it's fascinating because the digital space is different than the physical space in which nations and governments were established."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "And so what policy looks like globally, what bullying looks like globally, what's healthy communication looks like globally is an open question and we're all figuring it out together, which is fascinating."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "Yeah, I mean with, you know, sort of fake news, for instance."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Deep fakes and fake news generated by humans?"}, {"time": 1842, "text": "Yeah, so we can talk about deep fakes, like I think that is another like, you know, sort of very interesting level of complexity."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "But like if you think about just the written word, right?"}, {"time": 1851, "text": "Like we have, you know, we invented papyrus, what, 3,000 years ago where we, you know, you could sort of put word on paper."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And then 500 years ago, like we get the printing press, like where the word gets a little bit more ubiquitous."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "And then like you really, really didn't get ubiquitous printed word until the end of the 19th century when the offset press was invented."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "And then, you know, just sort of explodes and like, you know, the cross product of that and the Industrial Revolution's need for educated citizens resulted in like this rapid expansion of literacy and the rapid expansion of the word."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "But like we had 3,000 years up to that point to figure out like how to, you know, like what's journalism, what's editorial integrity, like what's, you know, what's scientific peer review."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "And so like you built all of this mechanism to like try to filter through all of the noise that the technology made possible to like, you know, sort of getting to something that society could cope with."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "And like, if you think about just the piece, the PC didn't exist 50 years ago."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "And so in like this span of, you know, like half a century, like we've gone from no digital, you know, no ubiquitous digital technology to like having a device that sits in your pocket where you can sort of say whatever is on your mind to like what did Mary have in her, Mary Meeker just released her new like slide deck last week."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "You know, we've got 50% penetration of the internet to the global population."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "Like there are like three and a half billion people who are connected now."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "So it's like, it's crazy, crazy, like inconceivable, like how fast all of this happened."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "So, you know, it's not surprising that we haven't figured out what to do yet, but like we gotta really like lean into this set of problems because like we basically have three millennia worth of work to do about how to deal with all of this and like probably what, you know, amounts to the next decade worth of time."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So since we're on the topic of tough, you know, tough challenging problems, let's look at more on the tooling side in AI that Microsoft is looking at is face recognition software."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "So there's a lot of powerful positive use cases for face recognition, but there's some negative ones and we're seeing those in different governments in the world."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "So how do you, how does Microsoft think about the use of face recognition software as a platform in governments and companies?"}, {"time": 2019, "text": "How do we strike an ethical balance here?"}, {"time": 2022, "text": "Yeah, I think we've articulated a clear point of view."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "So Brad Smith wrote a blog post last fall, I believe that sort of like outlined like very specifically what, you know, what our point of view is there."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "And, you know, I think we believe that there are certain uses to which face recognition should not be put."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And we believe again, that there's a need for regulation there."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "Like the government should like really come in and say that, you know, this is where the lines are."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "And like, we very much wanted to like figuring out where the lines are, should be a democratic process."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "But in the short term, like we've drawn some lines where, you know, we push back against uses of face recognition technology, you know, like the city of San Francisco, for instance, I think has completely outlawed any government agency from using face recognition tech."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "And like that may prove to be a little bit overly broad."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "But for like certain law enforcement things, like you really, I would personally rather be overly sort of cautious in terms of restricting use of it until like we have, you know, sort of defined a reasonable, you know, democratically determined regulatory framework for like where we could and should use it."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "And, you know, the other thing there is like, we've got a bunch of research that we're doing and a bunch of progress that we've made on bias there."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "And like, there are all sorts of like weird biases that these models can have, like all the way from like the most noteworthy one where, you know, you may have underrepresented minorities who are like underrepresented in the training data and then you start learning like strange things."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "But like there are even, you know, other weird things."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "Like we've, I think we've seen in the public research, like models can learn strange things, like all doctors are men, for instance, just, yeah."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "I mean, and so like, it really is a thing where it's very important for everybody who is working on these things before they push publish, they launch the experiment, they, you know, push the code to, you know, online, or they even publish the paper that they are at least starting to think about what some of the potential negative consequences are, some of this stuff."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "I mean, this is where, you know, like the deep fake stuff I find very worrisome just because there are going to be some very good beneficial uses of like GAN generated imagery."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "And funny enough, like one of the places where it's actually useful is we're using the technology right now to generate synthetic visual data for training some of the face recognition models to get rid of the bias."}, {"time": 2223, "text": "So like, that's one like super good use of the tech, but like, you know, it's getting good enough now where, you know, it's going to sort of challenge a normal human being's ability to, like now you're just sort of say, like it's very expensive for someone to fabricate a photorealistic fake video."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "And like GANs are going to make it fantastically cheap to fabricate a photorealistic fake video."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "And so like what you assume you can sort of trust is true versus like be skeptical about is about to change."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "And like, we're not ready for it, I don't think."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "The nature of truth, right."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "That's, it's also exciting because I think both you and I probably would agree that the way to solve, to take on that challenge is with technology, right?"}, {"time": 2272, "text": "There's probably going to be ideas of ways to verify which kind of video is legitimate, which kind is not."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "So to me, that's an exciting possibility, most likely for just the comedic genius that the internet usually creates with these kinds of videos and hopefully will not result in any serious harm."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "Yeah, and it could be, you know, like I think we will have technology to, that may be able to detect whether or not something's fake or real."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "Although the fakes are pretty convincing, even like when you subject them to machine scrutiny."}, {"time": 2314, "text": "But, you know, we also have these increasingly interesting social networks, you know, that are under fire right now for some of the bad things that they do."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "Like one of the things you could choose to do with a social network is like you could, you could use crypto and the networks to like have content signed where you could have a like full chain of custody that accompanied every piece of content."},

verified chain of custody that shows like, oh, this is coming from this source."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "And it's like signed by like someone whose identity I trust."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "Yeah, I think having that, you know, having that chain of custody, like being able to like say, oh, here's this video."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "Like it may or may not have been produced using some of this deepfake technology, but if you've got a verified chain of custody where you can sort of trace it all the way back to an identity and you can decide whether or not like I trust this identity."},

that's not the super high tech."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "Like we've had all of this technology forever."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "And, but I think you're right."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "Like it has to be some sort of technological thing because the underlying tech that is used to create this is not going to do anything but get better over time and the genie is sort of out of the bottle."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "There's no stuffing it back in."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "And there's a social component, which I think is really healthy for a democracy where people will be skeptical about the thing they watch in general."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "So, you know, which is good."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "Skepticism in general is good for content."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "So deepfakes

where basically nobody trusted the media because you knew it was propaganda."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And that kind of skepticism encouraged further research about ideas as opposed to just trusting any one source."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "Well, look, I think it's one of the reasons why the scientific method and our apparatus of modern science is so good."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "Like, because you don't have to trust anything."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "Like, the whole notion of modern science beyond the fact that this is a hypothesis and this is an experiment to test the hypothesis and this is a peer review process for scrutinizing published results."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "But stuff's also supposed to be reproducible."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "So you know it's been vetted

I don't know what it is."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "Like, I think a lot of engineers are like this where like, you know, sort of this, like your brain is sort of wired for skepticism."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "Like, you don't just first order trust everything that you see and encounter."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "And like, you're sort of curious to understand, you know, the next thing."},

large business owner."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "So I'm just a huge fan of many of Microsoft products."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "I mean, I still, actually in terms of, I generate a lot of graphics

2579, "text": "So what do you see the future of these products?"}, {"time": 2583, "text": "I think there's a bunch of excite."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "I mean, on the Office front, there's gonna be this like increasing productivity wins that are coming out of some of these AI powered features that are coming."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "Like the products will sort of get smarter and smarter in like a very subtle way."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "Like there's not gonna be this big bang moment where like Clippy is gonna reemerge and it's gonna be."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "Wait a minute."},

assistant."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "Do you think that there's a possibility of that in the future?"}, {"time": 2632, "text": "So I think there are a bunch of like very small ways in which like machine learning powered assistive things are in the product right now."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "So there are a bunch of interesting things."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "Like the auto response stuff's getting better and better."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "And it's like getting to the point where it can auto respond with like, okay, this person's clearly trying to schedule a meeting."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "So it looks at your calendar and it automatically like tries to find like a time and a space that's mutually interesting."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Like we have this notion of Microsoft search at a Microsoft search where it's like not just web search, but it's like search across like all of your information that's sitting inside of like your Office 365 tenant and like potentially in other products."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "And like we have this thing called the Microsoft Graph that is basically an API federator that sort of like gets you hooked up across the entire breadth of like all of the, like what were information silos before they got woven together with the graph."}, {"time": 2705, "text": "Like that is like getting increasing, with increasing effectiveness, sort of plumbed into some of these auto response things where you're gonna be able to see the system like automatically retrieve information for you."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "Like if, you know, like I frequently send out, you know, emails to folks where like I can't find a paper or a document or whatnot."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "There's no reason why the system won't be able to do that for you."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "And like, I think the, it's building towards like having things that look more like, like a fully integrated, you know, assistant, but like you'll have a bunch of steps that you will see before you, like it will not be this like big bang thing where like Clippy comes back and you've got this like, you know, manifestation of, you know, like a fully, fully powered assistant."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "So I think that's, that's definitely coming in, like all of the, you know, collaboration, coauthoring stuff's getting better."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "You know, it's like really interesting."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "Like if you look at how we use the Office product portfolio at Microsoft, like more and more of it is happening inside of like Teams as a canvas."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "And like, it's this thing where, you know, you've got collaboration is like at the center of the product and like we built some like really cool stuff that's some of, which is about to be open source that are sort of framework level things for doing, for doing coauthoring."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "So in, is there a cloud component to that?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "So on the web, or is it, and forgive me if I don't already know this, but with Office 365, we still, the collaboration we do if we're doing Word, we still send the

huge, huge cloud component."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "And like part of, you know, part of this framework stuff, I think we're calling it, like I, like we've been working on it for a couple of years."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "So like, I know the internal code name for it, but I think when we launched it to build, it's called the Fluid Framework."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "So like you can be in whatever canvas is most convenient for you to get your work done."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "So I, out of my own sort of curiosity as an engineer, I know what it's like to sort of lead a team of

sizes, mostly large size of engineers."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "What does it take to lead such a large group into a continue innovation, continue being highly productive and yet develop all kinds of new ideas and yet maintain, like what does it take to lead such a large group of brilliant people?"}, {"time": 2928, "text": "I think the thing that you learn as you manage larger and larger scale is that there are three things that are like very, very important for big engineering teams."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "Like one is like having some sort of forethought about what it is that you're gonna be building over large periods of time."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "Like not exactly, like you don't need to know that like, you know, I'm putting all my chips on this one product and like this is gonna be the thing, but like it's useful to know like what sort of capabilities you think you're going to need to have to build the products of the future."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "And then like invest in that infrastructure, like whether, and like I'm not just talking about storage systems or cloud APIs, it's also like what does your development process look like?"}, {"time": 2975, "text": "What tools do you want?"}, {"time": 2976, "text": "Like what culture do you want to build around?"}, {"time": 2980, "text": "Like how you're, you know, sort of collaborating together to like make complicated technical things."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "And so like having an opinion and investing in that is like, it just gets more and more important."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "And like the sooner you can get a concrete set of opinions, like the better you're going to be."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "Like you can wing it for a while at small scales, like, you know, when you start a company, like you don't have to be like super specific about it, but like the biggest miseries that I've ever seen as an engineering leader are in places where you didn't have a clear enough opinion about those things soon enough."}]}, {"title": "Keoki Jackson: Lockheed Martin | Lex Fridman Podcast #33", "id": "anXep8kBOCg", "quotes": [{"time": 360, "text": "So maybe you can give a little bit of an overview of, so Lockheed Martin has partnered with a few years ago with Boeing to work with the DOD and NASA to build launch systems and rockets with the ULA."}, {"time": 373, "text": "What's beyond that?"}, {"time": 375, "text": "What's Lockheed's mission timeline, long term dream in terms of space?"}, {"time": 379, "text": "You mentioned the moon, I've heard you talk about asteroids."}, {"time": 385, "text": "As Mars, what's the timeline?"}, {"time": 387, "text": "What's the engineering challenges and what's the dream long term?"}, {"time": 391, "text": "Yeah, I think the dream long term is to have a permanent presence in space beyond low earth orbit, ultimately with a long term presence on the moon and then to the planets, to Mars."}, {"time": 403, "text": "Sorry to interrupt on that."}, {"time": 405, "text": "So long term presence means..."}, {"time": 408, "text": "Sustained and sustainable presence in an economy, a space economy that really goes alongside that."}, {"time": 414, "text": "With human beings and being able to launch perhaps from those, so like hop?"}, {"time": 422, "text": "You know, there's a lot of energy that goes in those hops, right?"}, {"time": 426, "text": "So I think the first step is being able to get there and to be able to establish sustained bases, right?"}, {"time": 432, "text": "And build from there."}, {"time": 434, "text": "And a lot of that means getting, as you know, things like the cost of launch down and you mentioned United Launch Alliance."}, {"time": 443, "text": "And so I don't wanna speak for ULA, but obviously they're working really hard to on their next generation of launch vehicles to maintain that incredible mission success record that ULA has, but ultimately continue to drive down the cost and make the flexibility, the speed and the access ever greater."}, {"time": 466, "text": "So what's the missions that are in the horizon that you could talk to?"}, {"time": 471, "text": "Is there a hope to get to the moon?"}, {"time": 474, "text": "I mean, I think you know this, or you may know this, there's a lot of ways to accomplish some of these goals."}, {"time": 480, "text": "And so that's a lot of what's in discussion today."}, {"time": 483, "text": "But ultimately the goal is to be able to establish a base essentially in cislunar space that would allow for ready transfer from orbit to the lunar surface and back again."}, {"time": 499, "text": "And so that's sort of that near term, I say near term in the next decade or so vision, starting off with a stated objective by this administration to get back to the moon in the 2024, 2025 timeframe, which is right around the corner here."}, {"time": 517, "text": "How big of an engineering challenge is that?"}, {"time": 521, "text": "I think the big challenge is not so much to go, but to stay, right?"}, {"time": 526, "text": "And so we demonstrated in the 60s that you could send somebody up, do a couple of days of mission and bring them home again successfully."}, {"time": 535, "text": "Now we're talking about doing that, I'd say more to, I don't wanna say an industrial scale, but a sustained scale, right?"}, {"time": 541, "text": "So permanent habitation, regular reuse of vehicles, the infrastructure to get things like fuel, air, consumables, replacement parts, all the things that you need to sustain that kind of infrastructure."}, {"time": 560, "text": "So those are certainly engineering challenges, there are budgetary challenges, and those are all things that we're gonna have to work through."}, {"time": 570, "text": "The other thing, and I shouldn't, I don't wanna minimize this, I mean, I'm excited about human exploration, but the reality is our technology and where we've come over the last 40 years essentially has changed what we can do with robotic exploration as well."}, {"time": 588, "text": "And to me, it's incredibly thrilling, and this seems like old news now, but the fact that we have rovers driving around the surface of Mars and sending back data is just incredible."}, {"time": 601, "text": "The fact that we have satellites in orbit around Mars that are collecting weather, they're looking at the terrain, they're mapping, all of these kinds of things on a continuous basis, that's incredible."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And the fact that you got the time lag, of course, going to the planets, but you can effectively have virtual human presence there in a way that we have never been able to do before."}, {"time": 625, "text": "And now with the advent of even greater processing power, better AI systems, better cognitive systems and decision systems, you put that together with the human piece and we've really opened up the solar system in a whole different way."}, {"time": 642, "text": "And I'll give you an example, we've got OSIRIS REx, which is a mission to the asteroid Bennu."}, {"time": 647, "text": "So the spacecraft is out there right now on basically a year mapping activity to map the entire surface of that asteroid in great detail."}, {"time": 659, "text": "You know, all autonomously piloted, right?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "But the idea then that, and this is not too far away, it's gonna go in, it's got a sort of fancy vacuum cleaner with a bucket, it's gonna collect the sample off the asteroid and then send it back here to Earth."}, {"time": 674, "text": "And so, you know, we have gone from sort of those tentative steps in the 70s, you know, early landings, video of the solar system to now we've sent spacecraft to Pluto, we have gone to comets and brought and intercepted comets, we've brought stardust, you know, material back."}, {"time": 697, "text": "So that's, we've gone far and there's incredible opportunity to go even farther."}, {"time": 703, "text": "So it seems quite crazy that this is even possible, that can you talk a little bit about what it means to orbit an asteroid and with a bucket to try to pick up some soil samples?"}, {"time": 718, "text": "Yeah, so part of it is just kind of the, you know, these are the same kinds of techniques we use here on Earth for high speed, high accuracy imagery, stitching these scenes together and creating essentially high accuracy world maps, right?"}, {"time": 737, "text": "And so that's what we're doing, obviously, on a much smaller scale with an asteroid."}, {"time": 743, "text": "But the other thing that's really interesting, you put together sort of that neat control and, you know, data and imagery problem."}, {"time": 753, "text": "But the stories around how we designed the collection, I mean, as essentially, you know, this is the sort of the human ingenuity element, right?"}, {"time": 761, "text": "That, you know, essentially had an engineer who had a, one day he's like, oh, starts messing around with parts, vacuum cleaner, bucket, you know, maybe we could do something like this."}, {"time": 773, "text": "And that was what led to what we call the pogo stick collection, right?"}, {"time": 777, "text": "Where basically a thing comes down, it's only there for seconds, does that collection, grabs the, essentially blows the regolith material into the collection hopper and off it goes."}, {"time": 790, "text": "It doesn't really land almost."}, {"time": 792, "text": "It's a very short landing."}, {"time": 793, "text": "Wow, that's incredible."}, {"time": 795, "text": "So what is, in those, we talked a little bit more about space, what's the role of the human in all of this?"}, {"time": 804, "text": "What are the challenges?"}, {"time": 805, "text": "What are the opportunities for humans as they pilot these vehicles in space?"}, {"time": 813, "text": "And for humans that may step foot on either the moon or Mars?"}, {"time": 821, "text": "Yeah, it's a great question because, you know, I just have been extolling the virtues of robotic and, you know, rovers, autonomous systems, and those absolutely have a role."}, {"time": 833, "text": "I think the thing that we don't know how to replace today is the ability to adapt on the fly to new information."}, {"time": 842, "text": "And I believe that will come, but we're not there yet."}, {"time": 847, "text": "There's a ways to go."}, {"time": 848, "text": "And so, you know, you think back to Apollo 13 and the ingenuity of the folks on the ground and on the spacecraft essentially cobbled together a way to get the carbon dioxide scrubbers to work."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Those are the kinds of things that ultimately, you know, and I'd say not just from dealing with anomalies, but, you know, dealing with new information."}, {"time": 873, "text": "You see something and rather than waiting 20 minutes or half an hour, an hour to try to get information back and forth, but be able to essentially revector on the fly, collect, you know, different samples, take a different approach, choose different areas to explore."}, {"time": 892, "text": "Those are the kinds of things that human presence enables that is still a ways ahead of us on the AI side."}, {"time": 900, "text": "Yeah, there's some interesting stuff we'll talk about on the teaming side here on Earth."}, {"time": 904, "text": "That's pretty cool to explore."}, {"time": 906, "text": "And in space, let's not leave the space piece out."}, {"time": 908, "text": "So what does teaming, what does AI and humans working together in space look like?"}, {"time": 913, "text": "Yeah, one of the things we're working on is a system called Maya, which is, you think of it, so it's an AI assistant."}, {"time": 921, "text": "In space, exactly."}, {"time": 924, "text": "And you think of it as the Alexa in space, right?"}, {"time": 928, "text": "But this goes hand in hand with a lot of other developments."}, {"time": 931, "text": "And so today's world, everything is essentially model based, model based systems engineering to the actual digital tapestry that goes through the design, the build, the manufacture, the testing, and ultimately the sustainment of these system."}, {"time": 983, "text": "And it's not just, you know, dealing with problems as they come up, but also offering up opportunities for additional exploration capability, for example."}, {"time": 992, "text": "So that's the vision is that, you know, these are gonna take the best of the human to respond to changing circumstances and rely on the best of AI capabilities to monitor these, you know, this almost infinite number of data points and correlations of data points that humans frankly aren't that good at."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "So how do you develop systems in space like this, whether it's Alexa in space or in general, any kind of control systems, any kind of intelligent systems when you can't really test stuff too much out in space?"}, {"time": 1028, "text": "It's very expensive to test stuff."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So how do you develop such systems?"}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Yeah, that's the beauty of this digital twin, if you will."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And of course, with Lockheed Martin, we've over the past, you know, five plus decades been refining our knowledge of the space environment, of how materials behave, dynamics, the controls, the radiation environments, all of these kinds of things."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "So we're able to create very sophisticated models."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "They're not perfect, but they're very good."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "And so you can actually do a lot."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "I spent part of my career, you know, simulating communication spacecraft, you know, missile warning spacecraft, GPS spacecraft in all kinds of scenarios and all kinds of environments."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So this is really just taking that to the next level."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "The interesting thing is that now you're bringing into that loop a system depending on how it's developed that may be non deterministic, it may be learning as it goes."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "And in fact, we anticipate that it will be learning as it goes."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "And so that brings a whole new level of interest, I guess, into how do you do verification and validation of these non deterministic learning systems in scenarios that may go out of the bounds or the envelope that you have initially designed them to."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "So had this system and its intelligence has the same complexity, some of the same complexity human does and learns over time, it's unpredictable in certain kinds of ways in the, so you still, you also have to model that when you're thinking about it."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "So in your thoughts, it's possible to model the majority of situations, the important aspects of situations here on earth and in space enough to test stuff?"}, {"time": 1142, "text": "Yeah, this is really an active area of research and we're actually funding university research in a variety of places, including MIT."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "This is in the realm of trust and verification and validation of I'd say autonomous systems in general and then as a subset of that autonomous systems that incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "And this is not an easy problem."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "We're working with startup companies, we've got internal R&D, but our conviction is that autonomy and more and more AI enabled autonomy is gonna be in everything that Lockheed Martin develops and fields and it's gonna be retrofitting it."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Autonomy and AI are gonna be retrofit into existing systems, they're gonna be part of the design for all of our future systems."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "And so maybe I should take a step back and say the way we define autonomy."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "So we talk about autonomy essentially a system that composes, selects and then executes decisions with varying levels of human intervention."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "And so you could think of no autonomy."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "So this is essentially the human doing the task."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "You can think of effectively partial autonomy where the human is in the loop."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "So making decisions in every case about what the autonomous system can do."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "Either in the cockpit or remotely."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Or remotely, exactly, but still in that control loop."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "And then there's what you'd call supervisory autonomy."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "So the autonomous system is doing most of the work, the human can intervene to stop it or to change the direction."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And then ultimately full autonomy where the human is off the loop altogether."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And for different types of missions wanna have different levels of autonomy."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "So now take that spectrum and this conviction that autonomy and more and more AI are in everything that we develop."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "The kinds of things that Lockheed Martin does, a lot of times are safety of life critical kinds of missions."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "You think about aircraft, for example."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "And so we require and our customers require an extremely high level of confidence."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "One, that we're gonna protect life."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "Two, that these systems will behave in ways that their operators can understand."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "And so this gets into that whole field."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Again, being able to verify and validate that the systems have been and that they will operate the way they're designed and the way they're expected."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "And furthermore, that they will do that in ways that can be explained and understood."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "And that is an extremely difficult challenge."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Yeah, so here's a difficult question."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "I don't mean to bring this up, but I think it's a good case study that people are familiar with the Boeing 737 Max commercial airplane has had two recent crashes where their flight control software system failed and it's software."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "So I don't mean to speak about Boeing, but broadly speaking, we have this in the autonomous vehicle space too, semi autonomous."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "We have millions of lines of code software making decisions."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "There is a little bit of a clash of cultures because software engineers don't have the same culture of safety often that people who build systems like at Lockheed Martin do where it has to be exceptionally safe, you have to test this on."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "So how do we get this right when software is making so many decisions?"}, {"time": 1373, "text": "Yeah, and there's a lot of things that have to happen."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And by and large, I think it starts with the culture, which is not necessarily something that A, is taught in school or B is something that would come, depending on what kind of software you're developing, it may not be relevant, right?"}, {"time": 1393, "text": "If you're targeting ads or something like that."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "So, and by and large, I'd say not just Lockheed Martin, but certainly the aerospace industry as a whole has developed a culture that does focus on safety, safety of life, operational safety, mission success."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "But as you note, these systems have gotten incredibly complex."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "And so they're to the point where it's almost impossible, you know, state spaces become so huge that it's impossible to, or very difficult to do a systematic verification across the entire set of potential ways that an aircraft could be flown, all the conditions that could happen, all the potential failure scenarios."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "Now, maybe that's soluble one day, maybe when we have our quantum computers at our fingertips, we'll be able to actually simulate across an entire, you know, almost infinite state space."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "But today, you know, there's a lot of work to really try to bound the system, to make sure that it behaves in predictable ways, and then have this culture of continuous inquiry and skepticism and questioning to say, did we really consider the right realm of possibilities?"}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Have we done the right range of testing?"}, {"time": 1480, "text": "Do we really understand, you know, in this case, you know, human and machine interactions, the human decision process alongside the machine processes?"}, {"time": 1489, "text": "And so that's that culture, we call it the culture of mission success at Lockheed Martin that really needs to be established."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "And it's not something, you know, it's something that people learn by living in it."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And it's something that has to be promulgated, you know, and it's done, you know, from the highest levels at a company of Lockheed Martin, like Lockheed Martin."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Yeah, and the same is being faced at certain autonomous vehicle companies where that culture is not there because it started mostly by software engineers."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "So that's what they're struggling with."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "Is there lessons that you think we should learn as an industry and a society from the Boeing 737 MAX crashes?"}, {"time": 1530, "text": "These crashes obviously are tremendous tragedies."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "They're tragedies for all of the people, the crew, the families, the passengers, the people on the ground involved."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "And, you know, it's also a huge business and economic setback as well."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "I mean, you know, we've seen that it's impacting essentially the trade balance of the US."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "So these are important questions."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "And these are the kinds that, you know, we've seen similar kinds of questioning at times."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "You know, you go back to the Challenger accident."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "And it is, I think, always important to remind ourselves that humans are fallible, that the systems we create, as perfect as we strive to make them, we can always make them better."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And so another element of that culture of mission success is really that commitment to continuous improvement."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "If there's something that goes wrong, a real commitment to root cause and true root cause understanding, to taking the corrective actions and to making the future systems better."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "And certainly we strive for, you know, no accidents."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And if you look at the record of the commercial airline industry as a whole and the commercial aircraft industry as a whole, you know, there's a very nice decaying exponential to years now where we have no commercial aircraft accidents at all, right?"}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Fatal accidents at all."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "So that didn't happen by accident."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "It was through the regulatory agencies, FAA, the airframe manufacturers really working on a system to identify root causes and drive them out."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "So maybe we can take a step back and many people are familiar, but Lockheed Martin broadly, what kind of categories of systems are you involved in building?"}, {"time": 1654, "text": "You know, Lockheed Martin, we think of ourselves as a company that solves hard mission problems."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And the output of that might be an airplane or a spacecraft or a helicopter or a radar or something like that."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "But ultimately we're driven by these, you know, what is our customer?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "What is that mission that they need to achieve?"}, {"time": 1672, "text": "And so that's what drove the SR71, right?"}, {"time": 1675, "text": "How do you get pictures of a place where you've got sophisticated air defense systems that are capable of handling any aircraft that was out there at the time, right?"}, {"time": 1687, "text": "So that, you know, that's what yielded an SR71."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "Let's build a nice flying camera."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And make sure it gets out and it gets back, right?"}, {"time": 1695, "text": "And that led ultimately to really the start of the space program in the US as well."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "So now take a step back to Lockheed Martin of today."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "And we are, you know, on the order of 105 years old now between Lockheed and Martin, the two big heritage companies."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "Of course, we're made up of a whole bunch of other companies that came in as well."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "General Dynamics, you know, kind of go down the list."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "Today, you can think of us in this space of solving mission problems."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "So obviously on the aircraft side, tactical aircraft, building the most advanced fighter aircraft that the world has ever seen."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "We're up to now several hundred of those delivered, building almost a hundred a year."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And of course, working on the things that come after that."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "On the space side, we are engaged in pretty much every venue of space utilization and exploration you can imagine."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "So I mentioned things like navigation and timing GPS, communication satellites, missile warning satellites."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "We've built commercial surveillance satellites."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "We've built commercial communication satellites."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "We do civil space."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "So everything from human exploration to the robotic exploration of the outer planets."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "And keep going on the space front."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "But a couple of other areas that I'd like to put out, we're heavily engaged in building critical defensive systems."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "And so a couple that I'll mention, the Aegis Combat System."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "This is basically the integrated air and missile defense system for the US and allied fleets."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "And so protects carrier strike groups, for example, from incoming ballistic missile threats, aircraft threats, cruise missile threats, and kind of go down the list."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "So the carriers, the fleet itself is the thing that is being protected."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "The carriers aren't serving as a protection for something else."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "Well, that's a little bit of a different application."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "We've actually built the version called Aegis Ashore, which is now deployed in a couple of places around the world."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So that same technology, I mean, basically can be used to protect either an ocean going fleet or a land based activity."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Another one, the THAAD program."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "So THAAD, this is the Theater High Altitude Area Defense."}, {"time": 1845, "text": "This is to protect relatively broad areas against sophisticated ballistic missile threats."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "And so now it's deployed with a lot of US capabilities."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "And now we have international customers that are looking to buy that capability as well."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "And so these are systems that defend, not just defend militaries and military capabilities, but defend population areas."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "We saw maybe the first public use of these back in the first Gulf War with the Patriot Systems."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "And these are the kinds of things that Lockheed Martin delivers."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "And there's a lot of stuff that goes into it."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "A lot of stuff that goes with it."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "So think about the radar systems and the sensing systems that cue these, the command and control systems that decide how you pair a weapon against an incoming threat."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "And then all the human and machine interfaces to make sure that they can be operated successfully in very strenuous environments."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "Yeah, there's some incredible engineering that at every front, like you said."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "So maybe if we just take a look at Lockheed history broadly, maybe even looking at Skunk Works."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "What are the biggest, most impressive milestones of innovation?"}, {"time": 1931, "text": "So if you look at stealth, I would have called you crazy if you said that's possible at the time."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And supersonic and hypersonic."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "So traveling at, first of all, traveling at the speed of sound is pretty damn fast."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "And supersonic and hypersonic, three, four, five times the speed of sound."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "That seems, I would also call you crazy if you say you can do that."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So can you tell me how it's possible to do these kinds of things?"}, {"time": 1959, "text": "And is there other milestones and innovation that's going on that you can talk about?"}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Well, let me start on the Skunk Works saga."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "And you kind of alluded to it in the beginning."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "Skunk Works is as much an idea as a place."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "And so it's driven really by Kelly Johnson's 14 principles."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "And I'm not gonna list all 14 of them off, but the idea, and this I'm sure will resonate with any engineer who's worked on a highly motivated small team before."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "The idea that if you can essentially have a small team of very capable people who wanna work on really hard problems, you can do almost anything."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "Especially if you kind of shield them from bureaucratic influences, if you create very tight relationships with your customers so that you have that team and shared vision with the customer."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "Those are the kinds of things that enable the Skunk Works to do these incredible things."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And we listed off a number that you brought up stealth."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "And I wish I could have seen Ben Rich with a ball bearing rolling it across the desk to a general officer and saying, would you like to have an aircraft that has the radar cross section of this ball bearing?"}, {"time": 2041, "text": "Probably one of the least expensive and most effective marketing campaigns in the history of the industry."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "So just for people that are not familiar, the way you detect aircraft, I'm sure there's a lot of ways, but radar for the longest time, there's a big blob that appears in the radar."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "How do you make a plane disappear so it looks as big as a ball bearing?"}, {"time": 2066, "text": "What's involved in technology wise there?"}, {"time": 2068, "text": "What's the broadly sort of the stuff you can speak about?"}, {"time": 2072, "text": "I'll stick to what's in Ben Rich's book."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "But obviously the geometry of how radar gets reflected and the kinds of materials that either reflect or absorb are kind of the couple of the critical elements there."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "And it's a cat and mouse game, right?"}, {"time": 2088, "text": "I mean, you know, radars get better, stealth capabilities get better."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "And so it's a really a game of continuous improvement and innovation there."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "I'll leave it at that."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "Yeah, so the idea that something is essentially invisible is quite fascinating."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "But the other one is flying fast."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "So speed of sound is 750, 60 miles an hour."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "So supersonic is three, you know, Mach three, something like that."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "Yeah, we talk about the supersonic obviously, and we kind of talk about that as that realm from Mach one up through about Mach five and then hypersonic."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "So, you know, high supersonic speeds would be past Mach five."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "And you got to remember Lockheed Martin and actually other companies have been involved in hypersonic development since the late 60s."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "You know, you think of everything from the X 15 to the space shuttle as examples of that."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "I think the difference now is if you look around the world, particularly the threat environment that we're in today, you're starting to see, you know, publicly, folks like the Russians and the Chinese saying they have hypersonic weapons capability that could threaten US and allied capabilities."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And also basically, you know, the claims are these could get around defensive systems that are out there today."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "And so there's a real sense of urgency."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "You hear it from folks like the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, Dr. Mike Griffin, and others in the department of defense that hypersonics is something that's really important to the nation in terms of both parity, but also defensive capabilities."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "And so that's something that, you know, we're pleased."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "It's something that Lockheed Martin's, you know, had a heritage in, we've invested R and D dollars on our side for many years."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "And we have a number of things going on with various US government customers in that field today that we're very excited about."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "So I would anticipate we'll be hearing more about that in the future from our customers."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "And I've actually haven't read much about this."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "Probably you can't talk about much of it at all, but on the defensive side, it's a fascinating problem of perception of trying to detect things that are really hard to see."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "Can you comment on how hard that problem is and how hard is it to stay ahead, even if we go back a few decades, stay ahead of the competition?"}, {"time": 2250, "text": "Well, maybe I'd, again, you gotta think of these as ongoing capability development."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "And so think back to the early days of missile defense."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "So this would be in the 80s, the SDI program."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "And in that timeframe, we proved and Lockheed Martin proved that you could hit a bullet with a bullet, essentially, and which is something that had never been done before to take out an incoming ballistic missile."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "And so that's led to these incredible hit to kill kinds of capabilities, PAC 3."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "That's the Patriot Advanced Capability Model 3 that Lockheed Martin builds, the THAAD system that I talked about."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "So now hypersonics, they're different from ballistic systems."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "And so we gotta take the next step in defensive capability."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "I can, I'll leave that there, but I can only imagine."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "Now, let me just comment sort of as an engineer, it's sad to know that so much that Lockheed has done in the past is classified or today, and it's shrouded in secrecy."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "It has to be by the nature of the application."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "So like what I do, so what we do here at MIT, we would like to inspire young engineers, young scientists, and yet in the Lockheed case, some of that engineer has to stay quiet."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "How does that make you feel?"}, {"time": 2342, "text": "Is there a future where more can be shown or is it just the nature of this world that it has to remain secret?"}, {"time": 2353, "text": "It's a good question."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "I think the public can see enough of, and including students who may be in grade school, high school, college today, to understand the kinds of really hard problems that we work on."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "And I mean, look at the F35, right?"}, {"time": 2376, "text": "And obviously a lot of the detailed performance levels are sensitive and controlled."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "But we can talk about what an incredible aircraft this is, supersonic, super cruise, kind of a fighter, stealth capabilities."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "It's a flying information system in the sky with data fusion, sensor fusion capabilities that have never been seen before."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "So these are the kinds of things that I believe, these are the kinds of things that got me excited when I was a student."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "I think these still inspire students today."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "And the other thing I'd say, I mean, people are inspired by space."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "People are inspired by aircraft."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Our employees are also inspired by that sense of mission."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "And I'll just give you an example."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "I had the privilege to work and lead our GPS programs for some time."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "And that was a case where I actually worked on a program that touches billions of people every day."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "And so when I said, I worked on GPS, everybody knew what I was talking about, even though they didn't maybe appreciate the technical challenges that went into that."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "But I'll tell you, I got a briefing one time from a major in the Air Force."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "And he said, I go by callsign GIMP, GPS is my passion."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "I love GPS."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "And he was involved in the operational test of the system."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "And he said, I was out in Iraq, and I was on a helicopter, Blackhawk helicopter, and I was bringing back a sergeant and a handful of troops from a deployed location."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "And he said, my job is GPS."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "So I asked that sergeant, and he's beaten down and kind of half asleep."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "And I said, what do you think about GPS?"}, {"time": 2494, "text": "And he brightened up, his eyes lit up, and he said, well, GPS, that brings me and my troops home every day."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "And that's the kind of story where it's like, okay, I'm really making a difference here in the kind of work."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "So that mission piece is really important."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "The last thing I'll say is, and this gets to some of these questions around advanced technologies."}, {"time": 2516, "text": "It's not, they're not just airplanes and spacecraft anymore."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "For people who are excited about advanced software capabilities, about AI, about bringing machine learning, these are the things that we're doing to exponentially increase the mission capabilities that go on those platforms."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "And those are the kinds of things that I think are more and more visible to the public."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "Yeah, I think autonomy, especially in flight, is super exciting."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "Do you see a day, here we go, back into philosophy, future when most fighter jets will be highly autonomous to a degree where a human doesn't need to be in the cockpit in almost all cases?"}, {"time": 2560, "text": "Well, I mean, that's a world that to a certain extent we're in today."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "Now these are remotely piloted aircraft, to be sure."}, {"time": 2567, "text": "But we have hundreds of thousands of flight hours a year now in remotely piloted aircraft."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "And then if you take the F35, there are huge layers, I guess, in levels of autonomy built into that aircraft so that the pilot is essentially more of a mission manager rather than doing the data, the second to second elements of flying the aircraft."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "So in some ways it's the easiest aircraft in the world to fly."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And kind of a funny story on that."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "So I don't know if you know how aircraft carrier landings work, but basically there's what's called a tail hook and it catches wires on the deck of the carrier."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "And that's what brings the aircraft to a screeching halt, right?"}, {"time": 2619, "text": "And there's typically three of these wires."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "So if you miss the first, the second one, you catch the next one, right?"}, {"time": 2625, "text": "And we got a little criticism."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "I don't know how true this story is, but we got a little criticism."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "The F35 is so perfect, it always gets the second wires."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "We're wearing out the wire because it always hits that one."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "But that's the kind of autonomy that just makes these, essentially up levels what the human is doing to more of that mission manager."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "So much of that landing by the F35 is autonomous."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "Well, it's just, the control systems are such that you really have dialed out the variability that comes with all the environmental conditions."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "You're wearing it out."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "So my point is to a certain extent, that world is here today."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Do I think that we're gonna see a day anytime soon when there are no humans in the cockpit?"}, {"time": 2671, "text": "I don't believe that."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "But I do think we're gonna see much more human machine teaming, and we're gonna see that much more at the tactical edge."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "And we did a demo, and you asked about what the Skunk Works is doing these days."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "And so this is something I can talk about, but we did a demo with the Air Force Research Laboratory."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "We called it Have Raider."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "And so using an F16 as an autonomous wingman, and we demonstrated all kinds of maneuvers and various mission scenarios with the autonomous F16 being that so called loyal or trusted wingman."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "And so those are the kinds of things that, we've shown what is possible now."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "Given that you've up leveled that pilot to be a mission manager, now they can control multiple other aircraft."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "Think of them almost as extensions of your own aircraft flying alongside with you."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "So that's another example of how this is really coming to fruition."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "And then I mentioned the landings, but think about just the implications for humans and flight safety, and this goes a little bit back to the discussion we were having about how do you continuously improve the level of safety through automation while working through the complexities that automation introduces."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "So one of the challenges that you have in high performance fighter aircraft is what's called G lock."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "So this is G induced loss of consciousness."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "So you pull nine Gs, you're wearing a pressure suit, that's not enough to keep the blood going to your brain, you black out."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And of course that's bad if you happen to be flying low, near the deck and in an obstacle or terrain environment."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "And so we developed a system in our aeronautics division called Auto Gcast, so autonomous ground collision avoidance system."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "And we built that into the F16."}, {"time": 2790, "text": "It's actually saved seven aircraft, eight pilots already in a relatively short time it's been deployed."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "It was so successful that the Air Force said, hey, we need to have this in the F35 right away."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "So we've actually done testing of that now on the F35."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "And we've also integrated an autonomous air collision avoidance system."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "So think the air to air problem."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "So now it's the integrated collision avoidance system."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "But these are the kinds of capabilities, I wouldn't call them AI."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "I mean, they're very sophisticated models of the aircraft dynamics coupled with the terrain models to be able to predict when essentially the pilot is doing something that is gonna take the aircraft or the pilot's not doing something in this case."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "But it just gives you an example of how autonomy can be really a lifesaver in today's world."}, {"time": 2845, "text": "It's like a autonomous automated emergency braking in cars."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "But is there any exploration of perception of, for example, detecting a G lock that the pilot is out?"}, {"time": 2859, "text": "So as opposed to perceiving the external environment to infer that the pilot is out, but actually perceiving the pilot directly."}, {"time": 2867, "text": "Yeah, this is one of those cases where you'd like to not take action if you think the pilot's there."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "And it's almost like systems that try to detect if a driver's falling asleep on the road, right?"}, {"time": 2877, "text": "With limited success."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "So, I mean, this is what I call the system of last resort, right?"}, {"time": 2883, "text": "Where if the aircraft has determined that it's going into the terrain, get it out of there."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "And this is not something that we're just doing in the aircraft world."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "And I wanted to highlight, we have a technology we call Matrix, but this is developed at Sikorsky Innovations."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "The whole idea there is what we call optimal piloting."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So not optional piloting or unpiloted, but optimal piloting."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "So an FAA certified system."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "So you have a high degree of confidence."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "It's generally pretty deterministic."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "So we know that it'll do in different situations, but effectively be able to fly a mission with two pilots, one pilot, no pilots."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "And you can think of it almost as like a dial of the level of autonomy that you want, but able, so it's running in the background at all times and able to pick up tasks, whether it's sort of autopilot kinds of tasks or more sophisticated path planning kinds of activities to be able to do things like, for example, land on an oil rig in the North Sea in bad weather, zero, zero conditions."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "And you can imagine, of course, there's a lot of military utility to capability like that."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "You could have an aircraft that you want to send out for a crewed mission, but then at night, if you want to use it to deliver supplies in an unmanned mode, that could be done as well."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "And so there's clear advantages there."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "But think about on the commercial side, if you're an aircraft taken, you're gonna fly out to this oil rig."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "If you get out there and you can't land, then you gotta bring all those people back, reschedule another flight, pay the overtime for the crew that you just brought back because they didn't get where they were going, pay for the overtime for the folks that are out there in the oil rig."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "This is real economic, these are dollars and cents kinds of advantages we're bringing in the commercial world as well."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "So here's a difficult question from the AI space that I would love it if you're able to comment."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "So a lot of this autonomy in AI you've mentioned just now has this empowering effect."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "One is the last resort, it keeps you safe."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "The other is there's a, with the teaming and in general, assistive AI."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "And I think there's always a race."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "So the world is full of, the world is complex."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "It's full of bad actors."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "So there's often a race to make sure that we keep this country safe, right?"}, {"time": 3048, "text": "But with AI, there is a concern that it's a slightly different race."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "Though there's a lot of people in the AI space that are concerned about the AI arms race."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "That as opposed to the United States becoming, having the best technology and therefore keeping us safe, even we lose ability to keep control of it."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "So this, the AI arms race getting away from all of us humans."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "So do you share this worry?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "Do you share this concern when we're talking about military applications that too much control and decision making capabilities giving to software or AI?"}, {"time": 3091, "text": "Well, I don't see it happening today."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And in fact, this is something from a policy perspective, it's obviously a very dynamic space, but the Department of Defense has put quite a bit of thought into that."}, {"time": 3104, "text": "And maybe before talking about the policy, I'll just talk about some of the why."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "And you alluded to it being a sort of a complicated and a little bit scary world out there, but there's some big things happening today."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "You hear a lot of talk now about a return to great powers competition, particularly around China and Russia with the US, but there are some other big players out there as well."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And what we've seen is the deployment of some very, I'd say concerning new weapon systems, particularly with Russia and breaching some of the IRBM, Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile Treaties, that's been in the news a lot."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "The building of islands, artificial islands in the South China Sea by the Chinese and then arming those islands."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "The annexation of Crimea by Russia, the invasion of Ukraine."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "So there's some pretty scary things."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "And then you add on top of that, the North Korean threat has certainly not gone away."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "There's a lot going on in the Middle East with Iran in particular."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "And we see this global terrorism threat has not abated."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "So there are a lot of reasons to look for technology to assist with those problems, whether it's AI or other technologies like hypersonics, which we discussed."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "So now let me give just a couple of hypotheticals."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "So people react sort of in the second timeframe, right?"}, {"time": 3204, "text": "Photon hitting your eye to movement is on the order of a few tenths of a second kinds of processing time."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "Roughly speaking, computers are operating in the nanosecond timescale, right?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "So just to bring home what that means, a nanosecond to a second is like a second to 32 years."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "So seconds on the battlefield, in that sense, literally are lifetimes."}, {"time": 3236, "text": "And so if you can bring an autonomous or AI enabled capability that will enable the human to shrink, maybe you've heard the term the OODA loop."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "So this whole idea that a typical battlefield decision is characterized by observe."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "So information comes in, orient."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "How does that, what does that mean in the context?"}, {"time": 3261, "text": "Decide, what do I do about it?"}, {"time": 3263, "text": "And then act, take that action."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "If you can use these capabilities to compress that OODA loop to stay inside what your adversary is doing, that's an incredible powerful force on the battlefield."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "That's a really nice way to put it, that the role of AI and computing in general has a lot to benefit from just decreasing from 32 years to one second, as opposed to on the scale of seconds and minutes and hours making decisions that humans are better at making."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "And it actually goes the other way too."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "So that's on the short timescale."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "So humans kind of work in the one second, two seconds to eight hours."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "After eight hours, you get tired, you gotta go to the bathroom, whatever the case might be."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "So there's this whole range of other things."}, {"time": 3309, "text": "Think about surveillance and guarding facilities."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "Think about moving material, logistics, sustainment."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "A lot of these, what they call dull, dirty and dangerous things that you need to have sustained activity, but it's sort of beyond the length of time that a human can practically do as well."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "So there's this range of things that are critical in military and defense applications that AI and autonomy are particularly well suited to."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "Now, the interesting question that you brought up is, okay, how do you make sure that stays within human control?"},

actually not gonna be Swift on its own that solves this problem, because the problem is that currently writing a acceptably fast, you know, GPU program is too complicated regardless of what language you use."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "And that's just because if you have to deal with the fact that I've got, you know, 10,000 threads and I have to synchronize between them all and I have to put my thing into grid blocks and think about warps and all this stuff, it's just so much boilerplate that to do that well, you have to be a specialist at that and it's gonna be a year's work to, you know, optimize that algorithm in that way."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "But with things like tensor comprehensions and TILE and MLIR and TVM, there's all these various projects which are all about saying,

came up with such a domain specific language."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "In fact, two, one domain specific language for expressing this is what my tensor computation is and another domain specific language for expressing this is the kind of the way I want you to structure the compilation of that and like do it block by block and do these bits in parallel."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "And they were able to show how you can compress the amount of code by 10X compared to optimized GPU code and get the same performance."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "So that's like, so these other things are kind of sitting on top of that kind of research and MLIR is pulling a lot of those best practices together."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "And now we're starting to see work done on making all of that directly accessible through Swift so that I could use Swift to kind of write those domain specific languages and hopefully we'll get then Swift CUDA kernels written in a very expressive and concise way that looks a bit like J and APL and then Swift layers on top of that and then a Swift UI on top of that."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "And it'll be so nice if we can get to that point."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "Now does it all eventually boil down to CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs?"}, {"time": 1308, "text": "Unfortunately at the moment it does, but one of the nice things about MLIR if AMD ever gets their act together which they probably won't is that they or others could write MLIR backends for other GPUs or rather tensor computation devices of which today there are increasing number like Graph Core or Vertex AI or whatever."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "So yeah, being able to target lots of backends would be another benefit of this and the market really needs competition because at the moment NVIDIA is massively overcharging for their kind of enterprise class cards because there is no serious competition because nobody else is doing the software properly."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "In the cloud there is some competition, right?"}, {"time": 1361, "text": "But... Not really, other than TPUs perhaps, but TPUs are almost unprogrammable at the moment."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "So TPUs have the same problem that you can't?"}, {"time": 1371, "text": "It's even worse."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So TPUs, Google actually made an explicit decision to make them almost entirely unprogrammable because they felt that there was too much IP in there and if they gave people direct access to program them, people would learn their secrets."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So you can't actually directly program the memory in a TPU."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "You can't even directly create code that runs on and that you look at on the machine that has the TPU, it all goes through a virtual machine."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "So all you can really do is this kind of cookie cutter thing of like plug in high level stuff together, which is just super tedious and annoying and totally unnecessary."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "So what was the, tell me if you could, the origin story of fast AI."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "What is the motivation, its mission, its dream?"}, {"time": 1423, "text": "So I guess the founding story is heavily tied to my previous startup, which is a company called Analytic, which was the first company to focus on deep learning for medicine and I created that because I saw that was a huge opportunity to, there's about a 10X shortage of the number of doctors in the world, in the developing world that we need."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "I expected it would take about 300 years to train enough doctors to meet that gap."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "But I guess that maybe if we used deep learning for some of the analytics, we could maybe make it so you don't need as highly trained doctors."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "For diagnosis."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "For diagnosis and treatment planning."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "Where's the biggest benefit just before we get to fast AI, where's the biggest benefit of AI and medicine that you see today?"}, {"time": 1476, "text": "And maybe next time."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Not much happening today in terms of like stuff that's actually out there, it's very early."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "So for example, in Africa, outside of South Africa, there's only five pediatric radiologists for the entire continent."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "So most countries don't have any."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "So if your kid is sick and they need something diagnosed through medical imaging, the person, even if you're able to get medical imaging done, the person that looks at it will be a nurse at best."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "But actually in India, for example, and China, almost no x rays are read by anybody, by any trained professional because they don't have enough."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "So if instead we had a algorithm that could take the most likely high risk 5% and say triage, basically say, okay, someone needs to look at this, it would massively change the kind of way that what's possible with medicine in the developing world."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And remember, they have, increasingly they have money."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "They're the developing world, they're not the poor world, they're the developing world."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So they have the money."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "So they're building the hospitals, they're getting the diagnostic equipment, but there's no way for a very long time will they be able to have the expertise."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "Shortage of expertise, okay."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "And that's where the deep learning systems can step in and magnify the expertise they do have."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "So you do see, just to linger a little bit longer, the interaction, do you still see the human experts still at the core of these systems?"}, {"time": 1618, "text": "Is there something in medicine that could be automated almost completely?"}, {"time": 1621, "text": "I don't see the point of even thinking about that because we have such a shortage of people."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "Why would we want to find a way not to use them?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "We have people, so the idea of like, even from an economic point of view, if you can make them 10X more productive, getting rid of the person, doesn't impact your unit economics at all."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "And it totally ignores the fact that there are things people do better than machines."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "So it's just to me, that's not a useful way of framing the problem."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "I guess, just to clarify, I guess I meant there may be some problems where you can avoid even going to the expert ever, sort of maybe preventative care or some basic stuff, allowing food, allowing the expert to focus on the things that are really that, you know."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "Well, that's what the triage would do, right?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "So the triage would say, okay, there's 99% sure there's nothing here."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "So that can be done on device and they can just say, okay, go home."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "So the experts are being used to look at the stuff which has some chance it's worth looking at, which most things it's not, it's fine."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "Why do you think that is?"}, {"time": 1695, "text": "You know, it's fine."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "Why do you think we haven't quite made progress on that yet in terms of the scale of how much AI is applied in the medical field?"}, {"time": 1707, "text": "Oh, there's a lot of reasons."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "I mean, one is it's pretty new."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "I only started in Liddick in like 2014."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "And before that, it's hard to express to what degree the medical world was not aware of the opportunities here."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "So I went to RSNA, which is the world's largest radiology conference."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "And I told everybody I could, you know, like I'm doing this thing with deep learning, please come and check it out."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And no one had any idea what I was talking about and no one had any interest in it."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "So like we've come from absolute zero, which is hard."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "And then the whole regulatory framework, education system, everything is just set up to think of doctoring in a very different way."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "So today there is a small number of people who are deep learning practitioners and doctors at the same time."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "And we're starting to see the first ones come out of their PhD programs."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "So Zach Kahane over in Boston, Cambridge has a number of students now who are data science experts, deep learning experts, and actual medical doctors."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "Quite a few doctors have completed our fast AI course now and are publishing papers and creating journal reading groups in the American Council of Radiology."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "And like, it's just starting to happen, but it's gonna be a long time coming."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "It's gonna happen, but it's gonna be a long process."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "The regulators have to learn how to regulate this."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "They have to build guidelines."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "And then the lawyers at hospitals have to develop a new way of understanding that sometimes it makes sense for data to be looked at in raw form in large quantities in order to create well changing results."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Yeah, so the regulation around data, all that, it sounds probably the hardest problem, but sounds reminiscent of autonomous vehicles as well."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "Many of the same regulatory challenges, many of the same data challenges."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "Yeah, I mean, funnily enough, the problem is less the regulation and more the interpretation of that regulation by lawyers in hospitals."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "So HIPAA is actually, was designed to pay, and HIPAA does not stand for privacy."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "It stands for portability."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "It's actually meant to be a way that data can be used."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And it was created with lots of gray areas because the idea is that would be more practical and it would help people to use this legislation to actually share data in a more thoughtful way."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "Unfortunately, it's done the opposite because when a lawyer sees a gray area, they say, oh, if we don't know, we won't get sued, then we can't do it."}, {"time": 1882, "text": "So HIPAA is not exactly the problem."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "The problem is more that there's, hospital lawyers are not incented to make bold decisions about data portability."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "Or even to embrace technology that saves lives."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "They more want to not get in trouble for embracing that technology."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "It also saves lives in a very abstract way, which is like, oh, we've been able to release these 100,000 anonymized records."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "I can't point to the specific person whose life that saved."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "I can say like, oh, we ended up with this paper which found this result, which diagnosed a thousand more people than we would have otherwise, but it's like, which ones were helped?"}, {"time": 1925, "text": "It's very abstract."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "And on the counter side of that, you may be able to point to a life that was taken because of something that was."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "Yeah, or a person whose privacy was violated."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "It's like, oh, this specific person was deidentified."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "So, identified."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "Just a fascinating topic."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "We're jumping around."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "We'll get back to fast AI, but on the question of privacy, data is the fuel for so much innovation in deep learning."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "What's your sense on privacy?"}, {"time": 1959, "text": "Whether we're talking about Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, just the technologies like in the medical field that rely on people's data in order to create impact."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "How do we get that right, respecting people's privacy and yet creating technology that is learning from data?"}, {"time": 1983, "text": "One of my areas of focus is on doing more with less data."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "More with less data, which, so most vendors, unfortunately, are strongly incented to find ways to require more data and more computation."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "So, Google and IBM being the most obvious."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "IBM."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "Yeah, so Watson."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "So, Google and IBM both strongly push the idea that you have to be, that they have more data and more computation and more intelligent people than anybody else."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "And so you have to trust them to do things because nobody else can do it."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And Google's very upfront about this, like Jeff Dean has gone out there and given talks and said, our goal is to require a thousand times more computation, but less people."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "Our goal is to use the people that you have better and the data you have better and the computation you have better."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "So, one of the things that we've discovered is, or at least highlighted, is that you very, very, very often don't need much data at all."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And so the data you already have in your organization will be enough to get state of the art results."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "So, like my starting point would be to kind of say around privacy is a lot of people are looking for ways to share data and aggregate data, but I think often that's unnecessary."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "They assume that they need more data than they do because they're not familiar with the basics of transfer learning, which is this critical technique for needing orders of magnitude less data."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "Is your sense, one reason you might wanna collect data from everyone is like in the recommender system context, where your individual, Jeremy Howard's individual data is the most useful for providing a product that's impactful for you."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So, for giving you advertisements, for recommending to you movies, for doing medical diagnosis, is your sense we can build with a small amount of data, general models that will have a huge impact for most people that we don't need to have data from each individual?"}, {"time": 2119, "text": "On the whole, I'd say yes."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "I mean, there are things like, you know, recommender systems have this cold start problem where, you know, Jeremy is a new customer, we haven't seen him before, so we can't recommend him things based on what else he's bought and liked with us."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And there's various workarounds to that."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "Like in a lot of music programs, we'll start out by saying, which of these artists do you like?"}, {"time": 2144, "text": "Which of these albums do you like?"}, {"time": 2146, "text": "Which of these songs do you like?"}, {"time": 2149, "text": "Netflix used to do that, nowadays they tend not to."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "People kind of don't like that because they think, oh, we don't wanna bother the user."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "So, you could work around that by having some kind of data sharing where you get my marketing record from Axiom or whatever, and try to guess from that."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "To me, the benefit to me and to society of saving me five minutes on answering some questions versus the negative externalities of the privacy issue doesn't add up."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "So, I think like a lot of the time, the places where people are invading our privacy in order to provide convenience is really about just trying to make them more money and they move these negative externalities to places that they don't have to pay for them."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "So, when you actually see regulations appear that actually cause the companies that create these negative externalities to have to pay for it themselves, they say, well, we can't do it anymore."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "So, the cost is actually too high."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "But for something like medicine, yeah, I mean, the hospital has my medical imaging, my pathology studies, my medical records, and also I own my medical data."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "So, you can, so I help a startup called Doc.ai."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "One of the things Doc.ai does is that it has an app."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "You can connect to, you know, Sutter Health and LabCorp and Walgreens and download your medical data to your phone and then upload it again at your discretion to share it as you wish."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "So, with that kind of approach, we can share our medical information with the people we want to."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "Yeah, so control."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "I mean, really being able to control who you share it with and so on."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "So, that has a beautiful, interesting tangent to return back to the origin story of Fast.ai."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "Right, so before I started Fast.ai, I spent a year researching where are the biggest opportunities for deep learning?"}, {"time": 2290, "text": "Because I knew from my time at Kaggle in particular that deep learning had kind of hit this threshold point where it was rapidly becoming the state of the art approach in every area that looked at it."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "And I'd been working with neural nets for over 20 years."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "I knew that from a theoretical point of view, once it hit that point, it would do that in kind of just about every domain."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "And so I kind of spent a year researching what are the domains that's gonna have the biggest low hanging fruit in the shortest time period."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "I picked medicine, but there were so many I could have picked."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "And so there was a kind of level of frustration for me of like, okay, I'm really glad we've opened up the medical deep learning world."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "And today it's huge, as you know, but we can't do, I can't do everything."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "I don't even know, like in medicine, it took me a really long time to even get a sense of like what kind of problems do medical practitioners solve?"}, {"time": 2345, "text": "What kind of data do they have?"}, {"time": 2346, "text": "Who has that data?"}, {"time": 2348, "text": "So I kind of felt like I need to approach this differently if I wanna maximize the positive impact of deep learning."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "Rather than me picking an area and trying to become good at it and building something, I should let people who are already domain experts in those areas and who already have the data do it themselves."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "So that was the reason for Fast.ai is to basically try and figure out how to get deep learning into the hands of people who could benefit from it and help them to do so in as quick and easy and effective a way as possible."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "Got it, so sort of empower the domain experts."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "Yeah, and like partly it's because like, unlike most people in this field, my background is very applied and industrial."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "Like my first job was at McKinsey & Company."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "I spent 10 years in management consulting."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "I spend a lot of time with domain experts."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "So I kind of respect them and appreciate them."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "And I know that's where the value generation in society is."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "And so I also know how most of them can't code and most of them don't have the time to invest three years in a graduate degree or whatever."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "So I was like, how do I upskill those domain experts?"}, {"time": 2433, "text": "I think that would be a super powerful thing, the biggest societal impact I could have."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "So yeah, that was the thinking."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "So much of Fast.ai students and researchers and the things you teach are pragmatically minded, practically minded, figuring out ways how to solve real problems and fast."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "So from your experience, what's the difference between theory and practice of deep learning?"}, {"time": 2463, "text": "Well, most of the research in the deep learning world is a total waste of time."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "Right, that's what I was getting at."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "It's a problem in science in general."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "Scientists need to be published, which means they need to work on things that their peers are extremely familiar with and can recognize in advance in that area."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "So that means that they all need to work on the same thing."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "And so it really, and the thing they work on, there's nothing to encourage them to work on things that are practically useful."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "So you get just a whole lot of research, which is minor advances and stuff that's been very highly studied and has no significant practical impact."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "Whereas the things that really make a difference, like I mentioned transfer learning, like if we can do better at transfer learning, then it's this like world changing thing where suddenly like lots more people can do world class work with less resources and less data."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "But almost nobody works on that."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "Or another example, active learning, which is the study of like, how do we get more out of the human beings in the loop?"}, {"time": 2535, "text": "That's my favorite topic."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "Yeah, so active learning is great, but it's almost nobody working on it because it's just not a trendy thing right now."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "You know what somebody, sorry to interrupt, you're saying that nobody is publishing on active learning, but there's people inside companies, anybody who actually has to solve a problem, they're going to innovate on active learning."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "Yeah, everybody kind of reinvents active learning when they actually have to work in practice because they start labeling things and they think, gosh, this is taking a long time and it's very expensive."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "And then they start thinking, well, why am I labeling everything?"}, {"time": 2572, "text": "I'm only, the machine's only making mistakes on those two classes."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "They're the hard ones."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Maybe I'll just start labeling those two classes."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "And then you start thinking, well, why did I do that manually?"}, {"time": 2581, "text": "Why can't I just get the system to tell me which things are going to be hardest?"}, {"time": 2585, "text": "It's an obvious thing to do, but yeah, it's just like transfer learning."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "It's understudied and the academic world just has no reason to care about practical results."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "The funny thing is, like I've only really ever written one paper."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "I hate writing papers."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "And I didn't even write it."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "It was my colleague, Sebastian Ruder, who actually wrote it."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "I just did the research for it, but it was basically introducing transfer learning, successful transfer learning to NLP for the first time."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "The algorithm is called ULM fit."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "And it actually, I actually wrote it for the course, for the Fast AI course."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "I wanted to teach people NLP and I thought, I only want to teach people practical stuff."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "And I think the only practical stuff is transfer learning."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "And I couldn't find any examples of transfer learning in NLP."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "So I just did it."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "And I was shocked to find that as soon as I did it, which, you know, the basic prototype took a couple of days, smashed the state of the art on one of the most important data sets in a field that I knew nothing about."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "And I just thought, well, this is ridiculous."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "And so I spoke to Sebastian about it and he kindly offered to write it up, the results."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "And so it ended up being published in ACL, which is the top computational linguistics conference."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "So like people do actually care once you do it, but I guess it's difficult for maybe like junior researchers or like, I don't care whether I get citations or papers or whatever."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "There's nothing in my life that makes that important, which is why I've never actually bothered to write a paper myself."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "But for people who do, I guess they have to pick the kind of safe option, which is like, yeah, make a slight improvement on something that everybody's already working on."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "Yeah, nobody does anything interesting or succeeds in life with the safe option."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "Although, I mean, the nice thing is, nowadays everybody is now working on NLP transfer learning because since that time we've had GPT and GPT2 and BERT, and, you know, it's like, it's, so yeah, once you show that something's possible, everybody jumps in, I guess, so."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "I hope to be a part of, and I hope to see more innovation and active learning in the same way."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "I think transfer learning and active learning are fascinating, public, open work."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "I actually helped start a startup called Platform AI, which is really all about active learning."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "And yeah, it's been interesting trying to kind of see what research is out there and make the most of it."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "And there's basically none."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "So we've had to do all our own research."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Once again, and just as you described."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "Can you tell the story of the Stanford competition, Dawn Bench, and FastAI's achievement on it?"}, {"time": 2751, "text": "Sure, so something which I really enjoy is that I basically teach two courses a year, the Practical Deep Learning for Coders, which is kind of the introductory course, and then Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders, which is the kind of research level course."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "And while I teach those courses, I basically have a big office at the University of San Francisco, big enough for like 30 people."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "And I invite anybody, any student who wants to come and hang out with me while I build the course."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "And so generally it's full."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "And so we have 20 or 30 people in a big office with nothing to do but study deep learning."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "So it was during one of these times that somebody in the group said, oh, there's a thing called Dawn Bench that looks interesting."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "And I was like, what the hell is that?"}, {"time": 2802, "text": "And they set out some competition to see how quickly you can train a model."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "Seems kind of, not exactly relevant to what we're doing, but it sounds like the kind of thing which you might be interested in."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "And I checked it out and I was like, oh crap, there's only 10 days till it's over."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "It's too late."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "And we're kind of busy trying to teach this course."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "But we're like, oh, it would make an interesting case study for the course."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "It's like, it's all the stuff we're already doing."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "Why don't we just put together our current best practices and ideas?"}, {"time": 2832, "text": "So me and I guess about four students just decided to give it a go."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "And we focused on this small one called Cifar 10, which is little 32 by 32 pixel images."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "Can you say what Dawn Bench is?"}, {"time": 2846, "text": "Yeah, so it's a competition to train a model as fast as possible."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "It was run by Stanford."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And it's cheap as possible too."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "That's also another one for as cheap as possible."}, {"time": 2854, "text": "And there was a couple of categories, ImageNet and Cifar 10."}, {"time": 2858, "text": "So ImageNet is this big 1.3 million image thing that took a couple of days to train."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "Remember a friend of mine, Pete Warden, who's now at Google."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "I remember he told me how he trained ImageNet a few years ago when he basically like had this little granny flat out the back that he turned into his ImageNet training center."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "And he figured, you know, after like a year of work, he figured out how to train it in like 10 days or something."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "It's like, that was a big job."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "Whereas Cifar 10, at that time, you could train in a few hours."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "You know, it's much smaller and easier."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "So we thought we'd try Cifar 10."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "And yeah, I've really never done that before."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "Like I'd never really, like things like using more than one GPU at a time was something I tried to avoid."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "Cause to me, it's like very against the whole idea of accessibility is should better do things with one GPU."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "I mean, have you asked in the past before, after having accomplished something, how do I do this faster, much faster?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "Oh, always, but it's always, for me, it's always how do I make it much faster on a single GPU that a normal person could afford in their day to day life."}, {"time": 2930, "text": "It's not how could I do it faster by, you know, having a huge data center."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "Cause to me, it's all about like, as many people should better use something as possible without fussing around with infrastructure."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "So anyways, in this case it's like, well, we can use eight GPUs just by renting a AWS machine."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "So we thought we'd try that."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "And yeah, basically using the stuff we were already doing, we were able to get, you know, the speed, you know, within a few days we had the speed down to, I don't know, a very small number of minutes."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "I can't remember exactly how many minutes it was, but it might've been like 10 minutes or something."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "And so, yeah, we found ourselves at the top of the leaderboard easily for both time and money, which really shocked me cause the other people competing in this were like Google and Intel and stuff who I like know a lot more about this stuff than I think we do."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "So then we were emboldened."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "We thought let's try the ImageNet one too."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "I mean, it seemed way out of our league, but our goal was to get under 12 hours."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "And we did, which was really exciting."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "But we didn't put anything up on the leaderboard, but we were down to like 10 hours."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "But then Google put in like five hours or something and we're just like, oh, we're so screwed."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "But we kind of thought, we'll keep trying."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "You know, if Google can do it in five, I mean, Google did on five hours on something on like a TPU pod or something, like a lot of hardware."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "But we kind of like had a bunch of ideas to try."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Like a really simple thing was why are we using these big images?"}, {"time": 3030, "text": "They're like 224 or 256 by 256 pixels."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "You know, why don't we try smaller ones?"}, {"time": 3037, "text": "And just to elaborate, there's a constraint on the accuracy that your trained model is supposed to achieve, right?"}, {"time": 3043, "text": "Yeah, you gotta achieve 93%, I think it was, for ImageNet, exactly."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "Which is very tough, so you have to."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "Yeah, 93%, like they picked a good threshold."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "It was a little bit higher than what the most commonly used ResNet 50 model could achieve at that time."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "So yeah, so it's quite a difficult problem to solve."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "But yeah, we realized if we actually just use 64 by 64 images, it trained a pretty good model."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "And then we could take that same model and just give it a couple of epochs to learn 224 by 224 images."}, {"time": 3081, "text": "And it was basically already trained."}, {"time": 3084, "text": "It makes a lot of sense."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "Like if you teach somebody, like here's what a dog looks like and you show them low res versions, and then you say, here's a really clear picture of a dog, they already know what a dog looks like."}, {"time": 3095, "text": "So that like just, we jumped to the front and we ended up winning parts of that competition."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "We actually ended up doing a distributed version over multiple machines a couple of months later and ended up at the top of the leaderboard."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "We had 18 minutes."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "ImageNet."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Yeah, and it was, and people have just kept on blasting through again and again since then, so."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "So what's your view on multi GPU or multiple machine training in general as a way to speed code up?"}, {"time": 3129, "text": "I think it's largely a waste of time."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "Both of them."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "Both multi GPU on a single machine and."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "Yeah, particularly multi machines, cause it's just clunky."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "Multi GPUs is less clunky than it used to be, but to me anything that slows down your iteration speed is a waste of time."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "So you could maybe do your very last, you know, perfecting of the model on multi GPUs if you need to, but."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "So for example, I think doing stuff on ImageNet is generally a waste of time."}, {"time": 3166, "text": "Why test things on 1.3 million images?"}, {"time": 3168, "text": "Most of us don't use 1.3 million images."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "And we've also done research that shows that doing things on a smaller subset of images gives you the same relative answers anyway."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "So from a research point of view, why waste that time?"}, {"time": 3182, "text": "So actually I released a couple of new data sets recently."}, {"time": 3186, "text": "One is called ImageNet, the French ImageNet, which is a small subset of ImageNet, which is designed to be easy to classify."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "What's, how do you spell ImageNet?"}, {"time": 3197, "text": "It's got an extra T and E at the end, cause it's very French."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "And then another one called ImageWolf, which is a subset of ImageNet that only contains dog breeds."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "And that's a hard one, right?"}, {"time": 3211, "text": "That's a hard one."}, {"time": 3211, "text": "And I've discovered that if you just look at these two subsets, you can train things on a single GPU in 10 minutes."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "And the results you get are directly transferable to ImageNet nearly all the time."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "And so now I'm starting to see some researchers start to use these much smaller data sets."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "I so deeply love the way you think, because I think you might've written a blog post saying that sort of going these big data sets is encouraging people to not think creatively."}, {"time": 3244, "text": "So you're too, it sort of constrains you to train on large resources."}, {"time": 3249, "text": "And because you have these resources, you think more research will be better."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "And then you start, so like somehow you kill the creativity."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "Yeah, and even worse than that, Lex, I keep hearing from people who say, I decided not to get into deep learning because I don't believe it's accessible to people outside of Google to do useful work."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "So like I see a lot of people make an explicit decision to not learn this incredibly valuable tool because they've drunk the Google Koolaid, which is that only Google's big enough and smart enough to do it."}, {"time": 3282, "text": "And I just find that so disappointing and it's so wrong."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "And I think all of the major breakthroughs in AI in the next 20 years will be doable on a single GPU."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "Like I would say, my sense is all the big sort of."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "Well, let's put it this way."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "None of the big breakthroughs of the last 20 years have required multiple GPUs."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "So like batch norm, ReLU, Dropout."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "To demonstrate that there's something to them."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "Every one of them, none of them has required multiple GPUs."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "GANs, the original GANs didn't require multiple GPUs."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "Well, and we've actually recently shown that you don't even need GANs."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "So we've developed GAN level outcomes without needing GANs."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "And we can now do it with, again, by using transfer learning, we can do it in a couple of hours on a single GPU."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "You're just using a generator model without the adversarial part?"}, {"time": 3332, "text": "Yeah, so we've found loss functions that work super well without the adversarial part."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "And then one of our students, a guy called Jason Antich, has created a system called dealtify, which uses this technique to colorize old black and white movies."}, {"time": 3348, "text": "You can do it on a single GPU, colorize a whole movie in a couple of hours."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "And one of the things that Jason and I did together was we figured out how to add a little bit of GAN at the very end,

done on his home machine on a single GPU in his lounge room."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "And if you think about colorizing Hollywood movies, that sounds like something a huge studio would have to do,

higher quality audio from multiple sources."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "Because right now I haven't seen the work from, okay, we can say even expensive mics automatically combining audio from multiple sources to improve the combined audio."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "People haven't done that."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "And that feels like a learning problem."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "So hopefully somebody can."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "Well, I mean, it's evidently doable and it should have been done by now."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "I felt the same way about computational photography four years ago."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "Why are we investing in big lenses when three cheap lenses plus actually a little bit of intentional movement, so like take a few frames, gives you enough

thing with audio."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "I think it's madness that it hasn't been done yet."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "Is there progress on the photography company?"}, {"time": 3453, "text": "Yeah, photography is basically standard now."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "So the Google Pixel Night Light, I don't know if you've ever tried it, but it's astonishing."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "You take a picture in almost pitch black and you get back a very high quality image."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "And it's not because of the lens."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "Same stuff with like adding the bokeh to the background blurring, it's done computationally."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "This is the pixel right here."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "Yeah, basically everybody now is doing most of the fanciest stuff on their phones with computational photography and also increasingly people are putting more than one lens on the back of the camera."}, {"time": 3491, "text": "So the same will happen for audio for sure."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "And there's applications in the audio side."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "If you look at an Alexa type device, most people I've seen, especially I worked at Google before, when you look at noise background removal, you don't think of multiple sources of audio."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "You don't play with that as much as I would hope people would."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "But I mean, you can still do it even with one."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "Like again, not much work's been done in this area."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "So we're actually gonna be releasing an audio library soon, which hopefully will encourage development of this because it's so underused."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "The basic approach we used for our super resolution and which Jason uses for dealtify of generating high quality images, the exact same approach would work for audio."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "No one's done it yet, but it would be a couple of months work."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "Okay, also learning rate in terms of Dawn Bench."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "There's some magic on learning rate that you played around with that's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "Yeah, so this is all work that came from a guy called Leslie Smith."}, {"time": 3549, "text": "Leslie's a researcher who, like us, cares a lot about just the practicalities of training neural networks quickly and accurately, which I think is what everybody should care about, but almost nobody does."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And he discovered something very interesting, which he calls super convergence, which is there are certain networks that with certain settings of high parameters could suddenly be trained 10 times faster by using a 10 times higher learning rate."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "Now, no one published that paper because it's not an area of kind of active research in the academic world."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "No academics recognize that this is important."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "And also deep learning in academia is not considered a experimental science."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "So unlike in physics where you could say like, I just saw a subatomic particle do something which the theory doesn't explain, you could publish that without an explanation."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "And then in the next 60 years, people can try to work out how to explain it."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "We don't allow this in the deep learning world."}, {"time": 3616, "text": "So it's literally impossible for Leslie to publish a paper that says, I've just seen something amazing happen."}, {"time": 3623, "text": "This thing trained 10 times faster than it should have."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "I don't know why."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "And so the reviewers were like, well, you can't publish that because you don't know why."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "That's important to pause on because there's so many discoveries that would need to start like that."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "Every other scientific field I know of works that way."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "I don't know why ours is uniquely disinterested in publishing unexplained experimental results, but there it is."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "So it wasn't published."}, {"time": 3651, "text": "Having said that, I read a lot more unpublished papers than published papers because that's where you find the interesting insights."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "So I absolutely read this paper."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "And I was just like, this is astonishingly mind blowing and weird and awesome."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "And like, why isn't everybody only talking about this?"}, {"time": 3672, "text": "Because like, if you can train these things 10 times faster, they also generalize better because you're doing less epochs, which means you look at the data less, you get better accuracy."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "So I've been kind of studying that ever since."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "And eventually Leslie kind of figured out a lot of how to get this done."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "And we added minor tweaks."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "And a big part of the trick is starting at a very low learning rate, very gradually increasing it."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "So as you're training your model, you would take very small steps at the start and you gradually make them bigger and bigger until eventually you're taking much bigger steps than anybody thought was possible."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "There's a few other little tricks to make it work, but basically we can reliably get super convergence."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "And so for the Dawn Bench thing, we were using just much higher learning rates than people expected to work."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "What do you think the future of, I mean, it makes so much sense for that to be a critical hyperparameter learning rate that you vary."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "What do you think the future of learning rate magic looks like?"}, {"time": 3733, "text": "Well, there's been a lot of great work in the last 12 months in this area."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "And people are increasingly realizing that optimize, like we just have no idea really how optimizers work."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "And the combination of weight decay, which is how we regularize optimizers, and the learning rate, and then other things like the epsilon we use in the Adam optimizer, they all work together in weird ways."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And different parts of the model, this is another thing we've done a lot of work on is research into how different parts of the model should be trained at different rates in different ways."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "So we do something we call discriminative learning rates, which is really important, particularly for transfer learning."}, {"time": 3773, "text": "So really, I think in the last 12 months, a lot of people have realized that all this stuff is important."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "There's been a lot of great work coming out and we're starting to see algorithms appear, which have very, very few dials, if any, that you have to touch."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "So I think what's gonna happen is the idea of a learning rate, well, it almost already has disappeared in the latest research."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And instead, it's just like we know enough about how to interpret the gradients and the change of gradients we see to know how to set every parameter in an optimal way."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "So you see the future of deep learning where really, where's the input of a human expert needed?"}, {"time": 3814, "text": "Well, hopefully the input of a human expert will be almost entirely unneeded from the deep learning point of view."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "So again, like Google's approach to this is to try and use thousands of times more compute to run lots and lots of models at the same time and hope that one of them is good."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "AutoML kind of thing?"}, {"time": 3831, "text": "Yeah, AutoML kind of stuff, which I think is insane."}, {"time": 3836, "text": "When you better understand the mechanics of how models learn, you don't have to try a thousand different models to find which one happens to work the best."}, {"time": 3871, "text": "Yeah, the data side."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "How often do you work with data these days in terms of the cleaning, looking at it?"}, {"time": 3877, "text": "Like Darwin looked at different species while traveling about."}, {"time": 3882, "text": "Do you look at data?"}, {"time": 3885, "text": "Have you in your roots in Kaggle?"}, {"time": 3888, "text": "Always, yeah."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "Look at data."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it's a key part of our course."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "It's like before we train a model in the course, we see how to look at the data."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "And then the first thing we do after we train our first model, which we fine tune an ImageNet model for five minutes."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "And then the thing we immediately do after that is we learn how to analyze the results of the model by looking at examples of misclassified images and looking at a classification matrix, and then doing research on Google to learn about the kinds of things that it's misclassifying."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "So to me, one of the really cool things about machine learning models in general is that when you interpret them, they tell you about things like what are the most important features, which groups are you misclassifying, and they help you become a domain expert more quickly because you can focus your time on the bits that the model is telling you is important."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "So it lets you deal with things like data leakage, for example, if it says, oh, the main feature I'm looking at is customer ID."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "And you're like, oh, customer ID should be predictive."}, {"time": 3947, "text": "And then you can talk to the people that manage customer IDs and they'll tell you like, oh yes, as soon as a customer's application is accepted, we add a one on the end of their customer ID or something."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "So yeah, looking at data, particularly from the lens of which parts of the data the model says is important is super important."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "Yeah, and using the model to almost debug the data to learn more about the data."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "What are the different cloud options for training your own networks?"}, {"time": 3980, "text": "Last question related to DawnBench."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "Well, it's part of a lot of the work you do, but from a perspective of performance, I think you've written this in a blog post."}, {"time": 3989, "text": "There's AWS, there's TPU from Google."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "What the future holds?"}, {"time": 3994, "text": "What would you recommend now in terms of training?"}, {"time": 3997, "text": "So from a hardware point of view, Google's TPUs and the best Nvidia GPUs are similar."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "I mean, maybe the TPUs are like 30% faster, but they're also much harder to program."}, {"time": 4009, "text": "There isn't a clear leader in terms of hardware right now, although much more importantly, the Nvidia GPUs are much more programmable."}, {"time": 4019, "text": "They've got much more written for all of them."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "So like that's the clear leader for me and where I would spend my time as a researcher and practitioner."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "But then in terms of the platform, I mean, we're super lucky now with stuff like Google GCP, Google Cloud, and AWS that you can access a GPU pretty quickly and easily."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "But I mean, for AWS, it's still too hard."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "Like you have to find an AMI and get the instance running and then install the software you want and blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "GCP is currently the best way to get started on a full server environment because they have a fantastic fast AI in PyTorch ready to go instance, which has all the courses preinstalled."}, {"time": 4071, "text": "It has Jupyter Notebook pre running."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "Jupyter Notebook is this wonderful interactive computing system, which everybody basically should be using for any kind of data driven research."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "But then even better than that, there are platforms like Salamander, which we own and Paperspace, where literally you click a single button and it pops up a Jupyter Notebook straight away without any kind of installation or anything."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "And all the course notebooks are all preinstalled."}, {"time": 4105, "text": "So like for me, this is one of the things we spent a lot of time kind of curating and working on."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "Because when we first started our courses, the biggest problem was people dropped out of lesson one because they couldn't get an AWS instance running."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "So things are so much better now."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "And like we actually have, if you go to course.fast.ai, the first thing it says is here's how to get started with your GPU."}, {"time": 4130, "text": "And there's like, you just click on the link and you click start and you're going."}, {"time": 4135, "text": "You'll go GCP."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "I have to confess, I've never used the Google GCP."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "Yeah, GCP gives you $300 of compute for free, which is really nice."}, {"time": 4143, "text": "But as I say, Salamander and Paperspace are even easier still."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "So from the perspective of deep learning frameworks, you work with fast.ai, if you go to this framework, and PyTorch and TensorFlow."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "What are the strengths of each platform in your perspective?"}, {"time": 4165, "text": "So in terms of what we've done our research on and taught in our course, we started with Theano and Keras, and then we switched to TensorFlow and Keras, and then we switched to PyTorch, and then we switched to PyTorch and fast.ai."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "And that kind of reflects a growth and development of the ecosystem of deep learning libraries."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "Theano and TensorFlow were great, but were much harder to teach and to do research and development on because they define what's called a computational graph upfront, a static graph, where you basically have to say, here are all the things that I'm gonna eventually do in my model, and then later on you say, okay, do those things with this data."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "And you can't like debug them, you can't do them step by step, you can't program them interactively in a Jupyter notebook and so forth."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "PyTorch was not the first, but PyTorch was certainly the strongest entrant to come along and say, let's not do it that way, let's just use normal Python."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "And everything you know about in Python is just gonna work, and we'll figure out how to make that run on the GPU as and when necessary."}, {"time": 4240, "text": "That turned out to be a huge leap in terms of what we could do with our research and what we could do with our teaching."}, {"time": 4249, "text": "Because it wasn't limiting."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it was critical for us for something like DawnBench to be able to rapidly try things."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "It's just so much harder to be a researcher and practitioner when you have to do everything upfront and you can't inspect it."}, {"time": 4263, "text": "Problem with PyTorch is it's not at all accessible to newcomers because you have to like write your own training loop and manage the gradients and all this stuff."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "And it's also like not great for researchers because you're spending your time dealing with all this boilerplate and overhead rather than thinking about your algorithm."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "So we ended up writing this very multi layered API that at the top level, you can train a state of the art neural network in three lines of code."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "And which kind of talks to an API, which talks to an API, which talks to an API, which like you can dive into at any level and get progressively closer to the machine kind of levels of control."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "And this is the fast AI library."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "That's been critical for us and for our students and for lots of people that have won deep learning competitions with it and written academic papers with it."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "It's made a big difference."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "We're still limited though by Python."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "And particularly this problem with things like recurrent neural nets say where you just can't change things unless you accept it going so slowly that it's impractical."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "So in the latest incarnation of the course and with some of the research we're now starting to do, we're starting to do stuff, some stuff in Swift."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "I think we're three years away from that being super practical, but I'm in no hurry."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "I'm very happy to invest the time to get there."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "But with that, we actually already have a nascent version of the fast AI library for vision running on Swift and TensorFlow."}, {"time": 4364, "text": "Cause a Python for TensorFlow is not gonna cut it."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "It's just a disaster."}, {"time": 4369, "text": "What they did was they tried to replicate the bits that people were saying they like about PyTorch, this kind of interactive computation, but they didn't actually change their foundational runtime components."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "So they kind of added this like syntax sugar they call TF Eager, TensorFlow Eager, which makes it look a lot like PyTorch, but it's 10 times slower than PyTorch to actually do a step."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "So because they didn't invest the time in like retooling the foundations, cause their code base is so horribly complex."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "Yeah, I think it's probably very difficult to do that kind of retooling."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "Yeah, well, particularly the way TensorFlow was written, it was written by a lot of people very quickly in a very disorganized way."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "So like when you actually look in the code, as I do often, I'm always just like, Oh God, what were they thinking?"}, {"time": 4418, "text": "It's just, it's pretty awful."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "So I'm really extremely negative about the potential future for Python for TensorFlow."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "But Swift for TensorFlow can be a different beast altogether."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "It can be like, it can basically be a layer on top of MLIR that takes advantage of, you know, all the great compiler stuff that Swift builds on with LLVM and yeah, I think it will be absolutely fantastic."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "Well, you're inspiring me to try."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "I haven't truly felt the pain of TensorFlow 2.0 Python."}, {"time": 4457, "text": "It's fine by me, but of... Yeah, I mean, it does the job if you're using like predefined things that somebody has already written."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "But if you actually compare, you know, like I've had to do, cause I've been having to do a lot of stuff with TensorFlow recently, you actually compare like, okay, I want to write something from scratch and you're like, I just keep finding it's like, Oh, it's running 10 times slower than PyTorch."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "So is the biggest cost, let's throw running time out the window."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "How long it takes you to program?"}, {"time": 4489, "text": "That's not too different now, thanks to TensorFlow Eager, that's not too different."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "But because so many things take so long to run, you wouldn't run it at 10 times slower."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "Like you just go like, Oh, this is taking too long."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "And also there's a lot of things which are just less programmable, like tf.data, which is the way data processing works in TensorFlow is just this big mess."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "It's incredibly inefficient."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "And they kind of had to write it that way because of the TPU problems I described earlier."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "So I just, you know, I just feel like they've got this huge technical debt, which they're not going to solve without starting from scratch."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "So here's an interesting question then, if there's a new student starting today, what would you recommend they use?"}, {"time": 4537, "text": "Well, I mean, we obviously recommend Fastai and PyTorch because we teach new students and that's what we teach with."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "So we would very strongly recommend that because it will let you get on top of the concepts much more quickly."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "So then you'll become an actual, and you'll also learn the actual state of the art techniques, you know, so you actually get world class results."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "Honestly, it doesn't much matter what library you learn because switching from the trainer to MXNet to TensorFlow to PyTorch is gonna be a couple of days work as long as you understand the foundation as well."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "But you think will Swift creep in there as a thing that people start using?"}, {"time": 4582, "text": "Not for a few years, particularly because like Swift has no data science community, libraries, schooling."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "And the Swift community has a total lack of appreciation and understanding of numeric computing."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "So like they keep on making stupid decisions, you know, for years, they've just done dumb things around performance and prioritization."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "That's clearly changing now because the developer of Swift, Chris Latner, is working at Google on Swift for TensorFlow."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "So like that's a priority."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "It'll be interesting to see what happens with Apple because like Apple hasn't shown any sign of caring about numeric programming in Swift."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "So I mean, hopefully they'll get off their ass and start appreciating this because currently all of their low level libraries are not written in Swift."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "They're not particularly Swifty at all, stuff like CoreML, they're really pretty rubbish."}, {"time": 4650, "text": "So yeah, so there's a long way to go."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "But at least one nice thing is that Swift for TensorFlow can actually directly use Python code and Python libraries in a literally the entire lesson one notebook of fast AI runs in Swift right now in Python mode."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "So that's a nice intermediate thing."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "How long does it take?"}, {"time": 4673, "text": "If you look at the two fast AI courses, how long does it take to get from point zero to completing both courses?"}, {"time": 4683, "text": "It varies a lot."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "Somewhere between two months and two years generally."}, {"time": 4693, "text": "So for two months, how many hours a day on average?"}, {"time": 4696, "text": "So like somebody who is a very competent coder can do 70 hours per course and pick up 70."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "70, seven zero, that's it, okay."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "So part of it's just like doing a lot more writing."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "What do you find is the bottleneck for people usually except getting started and setting stuff up?"}, {"time": 4751, "text": "I would say coding."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "Yeah, I would say the best, the people who are strong coders pick it up the best."}, {"time": 4758, "text": "Although another bottleneck is people who have a lot of experience of classic statistics can really struggle because the intuition is so the opposite of what they're used to."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "They're very used to like trying to reduce the number of parameters in their model and looking at individual coefficients and stuff like that."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "So I find people who have a lot of coding background and know nothing about statistics are generally gonna be the best off."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "So you taught several courses on deep learning and as Feynman says, best way to understand something is to teach it."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "What have you learned about deep learning from teaching it?"}, {"time": 4800, "text": "That's a key reason for me to teach the courses."}, {"time": 4803, "text": "I mean, obviously it's gonna be necessary to achieve our goal of getting domain experts to be familiar with deep learning, but it was also necessary for me to achieve my goal of being really familiar with deep learning."}, {"time": 4818, "text": "I mean, to see so many domain experts from so many different backgrounds, it's definitely, I wouldn't say taught me, but convinced me something that I liked to believe was true, which was anyone can do it."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "So there's a lot of kind of snobbishness out there about only certain people can learn to code."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "Only certain people are gonna be smart enough like do AI, that's definitely bullshit."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "I've seen so many people from so many different backgrounds get state of the art results in their domain areas now."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "It's definitely taught me that the key differentiator between people that succeed and people that fail is tenacity."}, {"time": 4860, "text": "That seems to be basically the only thing that matters."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "A lot of people give up."}, {"time": 4866, "text": "But of the ones who don't give up, pretty much everybody succeeds."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "Even if at first I'm just kind of like thinking like, wow, they really aren't quite getting it yet, are they?"}, {"time": 4878, "text": "But eventually people get it and they succeed."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "So I think that's been, I think they're both things I liked to believe was true, but I don't feel like I really had strong evidence for them to be true, but now I can say I've seen it again and again."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "I've seen it again and again."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "So what advice do you have for someone who wants to get started in deep learning?"}, {"time": 4902, "text": "Train lots of models."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "That's how you learn it."}, {"time": 4907, "text": "So I think, it's not just me, I think our course is very good, but also lots of people independently have said it's very good."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "It recently won the COGx award for AI courses as being the best in the world."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "So I'd say come to our course, course.fast.ai."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "And the thing I keep on hopping on in my lessons is train models, print out the inputs to the models, print out to the outputs to the models, like study, change the inputs a bit, look at how the outputs vary, just run lots of experiments to get an intuitive understanding of what's going on."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "To get hooked, do you think, you mentioned training, do you think just running the models inference, like if we talk about getting started?"}, {"time": 4955, "text": "No, you've got to fine tune the models."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "So that's the critical thing, because at that point you now have a model that's in your domain area."}, {"time": 4963, "text": "So there's no point running somebody else's model because it's not your model."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "So it only takes five minutes to fine tune a model for the data you care about."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "And in lesson two of the course, we teach you how to create your own data set from scratch by scripting Google image search."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "So, and we show you how to actually create a web application running online."}, {"time": 4982, "text": "So I create one in the course that differentiates between a teddy bear, a grizzly bear and a brown bear."}, {"time": 4988, "text": "And it does it with basically 100% accuracy, took me about four minutes to scrape the images from Google search in the script."}, {"time": 4995, "text": "There's a little graphical widgets we have in the notebook that help you clean up the data set."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "There's other widgets that help you study the results to see where the errors are happening."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "And so now we've got over a thousand replies in our share your work here thread of students saying, here's the thing I built."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "And so there's people who like, and a lot of them are state of the art."}, {"time": 5017, "text": "Like somebody said, oh, I tried looking at Devangari characters and I couldn't believe it."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "The thing that came out was more accurate than the best academic paper after lesson one."}, {"time": 5026, "text": "And then there's others which are just more kind of fun, like somebody who's doing Trinidad and Tobago hummingbirds."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "She said that's kind of their national bird and she's got something that can now classify Trinidad and Tobago hummingbirds."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "So yeah, train models, fine tune models with your data set and then study their inputs and outputs."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "How much is Fast.ai courses?"}, {"time": 5047, "text": "Free."}, {"time": 5048, "text": "Everything we do is free."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "We have no revenue sources of any kind."}, {"time": 5052, "text": "It's just a service to the community."}, {"time": 5055, "text": "You're a saint."}, {"time": 5056, "text": "Okay, once a person understands the basics, trains a bunch of models, if we look at the scale of years, what advice do you have for someone wanting to eventually become an expert?"}, {"time": 5071, "text": "But specifically train lots of models in your domain area."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "So an expert what, right?"}, {"time": 5077, "text": "We don't need more expert, like create slightly evolutionary research in areas that everybody's studying."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "We need experts at using deep learning to diagnose malaria."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "Or we need experts at using deep learning to analyze language to study media bias."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "So we need experts in analyzing fisheries to identify problem areas in the ocean."}, {"time": 5111, "text": "That's what we need."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "So become the expert in your passion area."}, {"time": 5117, "text": "And this is a tool which you can use for just about anything and you'll be able to do that thing better than other people, particularly by combining it with your passion and domain expertise."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "So that's really interesting."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "Even if you do wanna innovate on transfer learning or active learning, your thought is, I mean, it's one I certainly share, is you also need to find a domain or data set that you actually really care for."}, {"time": 5142, "text": "If you're not working on a real problem that you understand, how do you know if you're doing it any good?"}, {"time": 5148, "text": "How do you know if your results are good?"}, {"time": 5149, "text": "How do you know if you're getting bad results?"}, {"time": 5150, "text": "Why are you getting bad results?"}, {"time": 5152, "text": "Is it a problem with the data?"}, {"time": 5154, "text": "Like, how do you know you're doing anything useful?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "Yeah, to me, the only really interesting research is, not the only, but the vast majority of interesting research is like, try and solve an actual problem and solve it really well."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "So both understanding sufficient tools on the deep learning side and becoming a domain expert in a particular domain are really things within reach for anybody."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "Yeah, I mean, to me, I would compare it to like studying self driving cars, having never looked at a car or been in a car or turned a car on, which is like the way it is for a lot of people, they'll study some academic data set where they literally have no idea about that."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "By the way, I'm not sure how familiar with autonomous vehicles, but that is literally, you describe a large percentage of robotics folks working in self driving cars is they actually haven't considered driving."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "They haven't actually looked at what driving looks like."}, {"time": 5210, "text": "They haven't driven."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "And it's a problem because you know, when you've actually driven, you know, like these are the things that happened to me when I was driving."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "There's nothing that beats the real world examples of just experiencing them."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "You've created many successful startups."}, {"time": 5224, "text": "What does it take to create a successful startup?"}, {"time": 5228, "text": "Same thing as becoming a successful deep learning practitioner, which is not giving up."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "So you can run out of money or run out of time or run out of something, you know, but if you keep costs super low and try and save up some money beforehand so you can afford to have some time, then just sticking with it is one important thing."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "Doing something you understand and care about is important."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "By something, I don't mean, the biggest problem I see with deep learning people is they do a PhD in deep learning and then they try and commercialize their PhD."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "It is a waste of time because that doesn't solve an actual problem."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "You picked your PhD topic because it was an interesting kind of engineering or math or research exercise."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "And then I think just, yeah, being, just be pragmatic and try and stay away from venture capital money as long as possible, preferably forever."}, {"time": 5319, "text": "So yeah, on that point, do you venture capital?"}, {"time": 5323, "text": "So did you, were you able to successfully run startups with self funded for quite a while?"}, {"time": 5328, "text": "Yeah, so my first two were self funded and that was the right way to do it."}, {"time": 5332, "text": "Is that scary?"}, {"time": 5334, "text": "No, VC startups are much more scary because you have these people on your back who do this all the time and who have done it for years telling you grow, grow, grow, grow."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "And they don't care if you fail."}, {"time": 5347, "text": "They only care if you don't grow fast enough."}, {"time": 5349, "text": "So that's scary."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "Whereas doing the ones myself, well, with partners who were friends was nice because like we just went along at a pace that made sense and we were able to build it to something which was big enough that we never had to work again but was not big enough that any VC would think it was impressive."}, {"time": 5371, "text": "And that was enough for us to be excited, you know?"}, {"time": 5375, "text": "So I thought that's a much better way to do things than most people."}, {"time": 5380, "text": "In generally speaking, not for yourself but how do you make money during that process?"}, {"time": 5384, "text": "Do you cut into savings?"}, {"time": 5387, "text": "So yeah, so for, so I started Fast Mail and Optimal Decisions at the same time in 1999 with two different friends."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "And for Fast Mail, I guess I spent $70 a month on the server."}, {"time": 5404, "text": "And when the server ran out of space I put a payments button on the front page and said, if you want more than 10 mega space you have to pay $10 a year."}, {"time": 5416, "text": "So run low, like keep your costs down."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "Yeah, so I kept my costs down."}, {"time": 5419, "text": "And once, you know, once I needed to spend more money I asked people to spend the money for me."}, {"time": 5425, "text": "And that, that was that."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "Basically from then on, we were making money and I was profitable from then."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "For Optimal Decisions, it was a bit harder because we were trying to sell something that was more like a $1 million sale."}, {"time": 5442, "text": "But what we did was we would sell scoping projects."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "So kind of like prototypy projects but rather than doing it for free we would sell them 50 to $100,000."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "So again, we were covering our costs and also making the client feel like we were doing something valuable."}, {"time": 5460, "text": "So in both cases, we were profitable from six months in."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "Ah, nevertheless, it's scary."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "I mean, yeah, sure."}, {"time": 5470, "text": "I mean, it's, it's scary before you jump in and I just, I guess I was comparing it to the scarediness of VC."}, {"time": 5478, "text": "I felt like with VC stuff, it was more scary."}, {"time": 5480, "text": "Kind of much more in somebody else's hands, will they fund you or not?"}, {"time": 5486, "text": "And what do they think of what you're doing?"}, {"time": 5487, "text": "I also found it very difficult with VCs, back startups to actually do the thing which I thought was important for the company rather than doing the thing which I thought would make the VC happy."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "And VCs always tell you not to do the thing that makes them happy."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "But then if you don't do the thing that makes them happy they get sad, so."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "And do you think optimizing for the, whatever they call it, the exit is a good thing to optimize for?"}, {"time": 5513, "text": "I mean, it can be, but not at the VC level because the VC exit needs to be, you know, a thousand X."}, {"time": 5519, "text": "So where else the lifestyle exit, if you can sell something for $10 million, then you've made it, right?"}, {"time": 5526, "text": "So I don't, it depends."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "If you want to build something that's gonna, you're kind of happy to do forever, then fine."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "If you want to build something you want to sell in three years time, that's fine too."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "I mean, they're both perfectly good outcomes."}, {"time": 5541, "text": "So you're learning Swift now, in a way."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "I mean, you've already."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "I'm trying to."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "And I read that you use, at least in some cases, space

tedious."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "He wrote down random sequences of letters on cards and tested how well he would remember those random sequences a day later, a week later, whatever."}, {"time": 5603, "text": "He discovered that there was this kind of a curve where his probability of remembering one of them would be dramatically smaller the next day and then a little bit smaller the next day and a little bit smaller the next day."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "What he discovered is that if he revised those cards after a day, the probabilities would decrease at a smaller rate."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "And then if you revise them again a week later, they would decrease at a smaller rate again."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "And so he basically figured out a roughly optimal equation for when you should revise something you wanna remember."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "So space repetition learning is using this simple algorithm, just something like revise something after a day and then three days and then a week and then three weeks and so forth."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "And so if you use a program like Anki, as you know, it will just do that for you."}, {"time": 5652, "text": "And it will say, did you remember this?"}, {"time": 5654, "text": "And if you say no, it will reschedule it back to appear again like 10 times faster than it otherwise would have."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "It's a kind of a way of being guaranteed to learn something because by definition, if you're not learning it, it will be rescheduled to be revised more quickly."}, {"time": 5673, "text": "Unfortunately though, it's also like, it doesn't let you fool yourself."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "If you're not learning something, you know like your revisions will just get more and more."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "So you have to find ways to learn things productively and effectively like treat your brain well."}, {"time": 5690, "text": "So using like mnemonics and stories and context and stuff like that."}, {"time": 5697, "text": "So yeah, it's a super great technique."}, {"time": 5699, "text": "It's like learning how to learn is something which everybody should learn before they actually learn anything."}, {"time": 5705, "text": "But almost nobody does."}, {"time": 5707, "text": "So what have you, so it certainly works well for learning new languages for, I mean, for learning

Michael Nielsen."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "So Michael started doing this recently and has been writing about it."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "So the kind of today's Ebbinghaus is a guy called Peter

5755, "text": "He's basically lived his life with space repetition learning for everything."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "I, and sort of like, Michael's only very recently got into this, but he started really getting excited about doing it for a lot of different things."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "For me personally, I actually don't use it for anything except Chinese."}, {"time": 5776, "text": "And the reason for that is that Chinese is specifically a thing I made a conscious decision that I want to continue to remember, even if I don't get much of a chance to exercise it, cause like I'm not often in China, so I don't."}, {"time": 5793, "text": "Or else something like programming languages or papers."}, {"time": 5798, "text": "I have a very different approach, which is I try not to learn anything from them, but instead I try to identify the important concepts and like actually ingest them."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "So like really understand that concept deeply and study it carefully."}, {"time": 5814, "text": "I will decide if it really is important, if it is like incorporated into our library, you know, incorporated into how I do things or decide it's not worth it, say."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "So I find, I find I then remember the things that I care about because I'm using it all the time."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "So I've, for the last 25 years, I've committed to spending at least half of every day learning or practicing something new, which is all my colleagues have always hated because it always looks like I'm not working on what I'm meant to be working on, but it always means I do everything faster because I've been practicing a lot of stuff."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "So I kind of give myself a lot of opportunity to practice new things."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "And so I find now I don't, yeah, I don't often kind of find myself wishing I could remember something because if it's something that's useful, then I've been using it a lot."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "It's easy enough to look it up on Google, but speaking Chinese, you can't look it up on Google."}, {"time": 5879, "text": "Do you have advice for people learning new things?"}, {"time": 5881, "text": "So if you, what have you learned as a process as a, I mean, it all starts with just making the hours and the day available."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "Yeah, you got to stick with it, which is again, the number one thing that 99% of people don't do."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "So the people I started learning Chinese with, none of them were still doing it 12 months later."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "I'm still doing it 10 years later."}, {"time": 5900, "text": "I tried to stay in touch with them, but they just, no one did it."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "For something like Chinese, like study how human learning works."}, {"time": 5908, "text": "So every one of my Chinese flashcards is associated with a story."}, {"time": 5913, "text": "And that story is specifically designed to be memorable."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "And we find things memorable, which are like funny or disgusting or sexy or related to people that we know or care about."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "So I try to make sure all of the stories that are in my head have those characteristics."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "Yeah, so you have to, you know, you won't remember things well if they don't have some context."}, {"time": 5936, "text": "And yeah, you won't remember them well if you don't regularly practice them, whether it be just part of your day to day life or the Chinese and me flashcards."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "I mean, the other thing is, I'll let yourself fail sometimes."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "So like I've had various medical problems over the last few years."},

diseases."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And I just want to say that as I got more into this field, I realized that cancer is of course terrible disease, but there are really the whole slew of terrible diseases out there like neurodegenerative diseases and others."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So we, of course, a lot of us are fixated on cancer because it's so prevalent in our society."}, {"time":

cancer?"}, {"time": 1315, "text": "So for many cancers today, we really don't know what is your likelihood to get cancer."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And for the vast majority of patients, especially

the hospital, they, it should be easy for them to donate their data for research and it can be different kind of, do they only give you a test results or only mammogram or only imaging data or the whole medical record?"}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Because at the end, we all will benefit from all this insights."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "And it's not like you say, I want to keep my data private, but I would really love to get it from other people because other people are thinking the same way."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So if there is a mechanism to do this donation and the patient has an ability to say how they want to use their data for research, it would be really a game changer."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "People, when they think about this problem, there's a, it depends on the population, depends on the demographics, but there's some privacy concerns generally, not just medical data, just any kind of data."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "It's what you said, my data, it should belong kind of to me."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "I'm worried how it's going to be misused."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "How do we alleviate those concerns?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "Because that seems like a problem that needs to be, that problem of trust, of transparency needs to be solved before we build large data sets that help detect cancer, help save those very people in the future."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "So I think there are two things that could be done."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "There is a technical solutions and there are societal solutions."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "So on the technical end, we today have ability to improve disambiguation."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "Like, for instance, for imaging, it's, you know, for imaging, you can do it pretty well."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "What's disambiguation?"}, {"time": 1676, "text": "And disambiguation, sorry, disambiguation, removing the identification, removing the names of the people."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "There are other data, like if it is a raw tax, you cannot really achieve 99.9%, but there are all these techniques that actually some of them are developed at MIT, how you can do learning on the encoded data where you locally encode the image, you train a network which only works on the encoded images and then you send the outcome back to the hospital and you can open it up."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "So those are the technical solutions."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "There are a lot of people who are working in this space where the learning happens in the encoded form."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "We are still early, but this is an interesting research area where I think we'll make more progress."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "There is a lot of work in natural language processing community how to do the identification better."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "But even today, there are already a lot of data which can be deidentified perfectly, like your test data, for instance, correct, where you can just, you know the name of the patient, you just want to extract the part with the numbers."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "The big problem here is again, hospitals don't see much incentive to give this data away on one hand and then there is general concern."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Now, when I'm talking about societal benefits and about the education, the public needs to understand that I think that there are situation and I still remember myself when I really needed an answer, I had to make a choice."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "There was no information to make a choice, you're just guessing."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "And at that moment you feel that your life is at the stake, but you just don't have information to make the choice."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "And many times when I give talks, I get emails from women who say, you know, I'm in this situation, can you please run statistic and see what are the outcomes?"}, {"time": 1797, "text": "We get almost every week a mammogram that comes by mail to my office at MIT, I'm serious."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "That people ask to run because they need to make life changing decisions."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "And of course, I'm not planning to open a clinic here, but we do run and give them the results for their doctors."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "But the point that I'm trying to make, that we all at some point or our loved ones will be in the situation where you need information to make the best choice."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "And if this information is not available, you would feel vulnerable and unprotected."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And then the question is, you know, what do I care more?"}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Because at the end, everything is a trade off, correct?"}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Just out of curiosity, it seems like one possible solution, I'd like to see what you think of it, based on what you just said, based on wanting to know answers for when you're yourself in that situation."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Is it possible for patients to own their data as opposed to hospitals owning their data?"}, {"time": 1861, "text": "Of course, theoretically, I guess patients own their data, but can you walk out there with a USB stick containing everything or upload it to the cloud?"}, {"time": 1870, "text": "Where a company, you know, I remember Microsoft had a service, like I try, I was really excited about and Google Health was there."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "I tried to give, I was excited about it."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "Basically companies helping you upload your data to the cloud so that you can move from hospital to hospital from doctor to doctor."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "Do you see a promise of that kind of possibility?"}, {"time": 1892, "text": "I absolutely think this is, you know, the right way to exchange the data."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "I don't know now who's the biggest player in this field, but I can clearly see that even for totally selfish health reasons, when you are going to a new facility and many of us are sent to some specialized treatment, they don't easily have access to your data."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "And today, you know, we might want to send this mammogram, need to go to the hospital, find some small office which gives them the CD and they ship as a CD."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "So you can imagine we're looking at kind of decades old mechanism of data exchange."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "So I definitely think this is an area where hopefully all the right regulatory and technical forces will align and we will see it actually implemented."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "It's sad because unfortunately, and I need to research why that happened, but I'm pretty sure Google Health and Microsoft Health Vault or whatever it's called both closed down, which means that there was either regulatory pressure or there's not a business case or there's challenges from hospitals, which is very disappointing."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "So when you say you don't know what the biggest players are, the two biggest that I was aware of closed their doors."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "So I'm hoping, I'd love to see why and I'd love to see who else can come up."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "It seems like one of those Elon Musk style problems that are obvious needs to be solved and somebody needs to step up and actually do this large scale data collection."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So I know there is an initiative in Massachusetts, I think, which you led by the governor to try to create this kind of health exchange system where at least to help people who kind of when you show up in emergency room and there is no information about what are your allergies and other things."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "So I don't know how far it will go."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "But another thing that you said and I find it very interesting is actually who are the successful players in this space and the whole implementation, how does it go?"}, {"time": 2017, "text": "To me, it is from the anthropological perspective, it's more fascinating that AI that today goes in healthcare, we've seen so many attempts and so very little successes."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "And it's interesting to understand that I've by no means have knowledge to assess it, why we are in the position where we are."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "Yeah, it's interesting because data is really fuel for a lot of successful applications."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And when that data acquires regulatory approval, like the FDA or any kind of approval, it seems that the computer scientists are not quite there yet in being able to play the regulatory game, understanding the fundamentals of it."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "I think that in many cases when even people do have data, we still don't know what exactly do you need to demonstrate to change the standard of care."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "Like let me give you an example related to my breast cancer research."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "So in traditional breast cancer risk assessment, there is something called density, which determines the likelihood of a woman to get cancer."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "And this pretty much says, how much white do you see on the mammogram?"}, {"time": 2094, "text": "The whiter it is, the more likely the tissue is dense."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "And the idea behind density, it's not a bad idea."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "In 1967, a radiologist called Wolf decided to look back at women who were diagnosed and see what is special in their images."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "Can we look back and say that they're likely to develop?"}, {"time": 2114, "text": "So he come up with some patterns."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "And it was the best that his human eye can identify."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "Then it was kind of formalized and coded into four categories."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "And that's what we are using today."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "And today this density assessment is actually a federal law from 2019, approved by President Trump and for the previous FDA commissioner, where women are supposed to be advised by their providers if they have high density, putting them into higher risk category."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And in some states, you can actually get supplementary screening paid by your insurance because you're in this category."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "Now you can say, how much science do we have behind it?"}, {"time": 2156, "text": "Whatever, biological science or epidemiological evidence."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So it turns out that between 40 and 50% of women have dense breasts."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "So about 40% of patients are coming out of their screening and somebody tells them, you are in high risk."}, {"time": 2175, "text": "Now, what exactly does it mean if you as half of the population in high risk?"}, {"time": 2179, "text": "It's from saying, maybe I'm not, or what do I really need to do with it?"}, {"time": 2183, "text": "Because the system doesn't provide me a lot of the solutions because there are so many people like me, we cannot really provide very expensive solutions for them."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And the reason this whole density became this big deal, it's actually advocated by the patients who felt very unprotected because many women went and did the mammograms which were normal."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "And then it turns out that they already had cancer, quite developed cancer."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "So they didn't have a way to know who is really at risk and what is the likelihood that when the doctor tells you, you're okay, you are not okay."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "So at the time, and it was 15 years ago, this maybe was the best piece of science that we had."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "And it took quite 15, 16 years to make it federal law."}, {"time": 2232, "text": "But now this is a standard."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "Now with a deep learning model, we can so much more accurately predict who is gonna develop breast cancer just because you're trained on a logical thing."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "And instead of describing how much white and what kind of white machine can systematically identify the patterns, which was the original idea behind the thought of the cardiologist, machines can do it much more systematically and predict the risk when you're training the machine to look at the image and to say the risk in one to five years."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "Now you can ask me how long it will take to substitute this density, which is broadly used across the country and really is not helping to bring this new models."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "And I would say it's not a matter of the algorithm."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "Algorithms use already orders of magnitude better than what is currently in practice."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "I think it's really the question, who do you need to convince?"}, {"time": 2284, "text": "How many hospitals do you need to run the experiment?"}, {"time": 2287, "text": "What, you know, all this mechanism of adoption and how do you explain to patients and to women across the country that this is really a better measure?"}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And again, I don't think it's an AI question."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "We can work more and make the algorithm even better, but I don't think that this is the current, you know, the barrier, the barrier is really this other piece that for some reason is not really explored."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "It's like anthropological piece."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And coming back to your question about books, there is a book that I'm reading."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "It's called American Sickness by Elizabeth Rosenthal."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "And I got this book from my clinical collaborator, Dr. Connie Lehman."}, {"time": 2333, "text": "And I said, I know everything that I need to know about American health system, but you know, every page doesn't fail to surprise me."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "And I think there is a lot of interesting and really deep lessons for people like us from computer science who are coming into this field to really understand how complex is the system of incentives in the system to understand how you really need to play to drive adoption."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "You just said it's complex, but if we're trying to simplify it, who do you think most likely would be successful if we push on this group of people?"}, {"time": 2369, "text": "Is it the doctors?"}, {"time": 2370, "text": "Is it the hospitals?"}, {"time": 2371, "text": "Is it the governments or policymakers?"}, {"time": 2374, "text": "Is it the individual patients, consumers?"}, {"time": 2378, "text": "Who needs to be inspired to most likely lead to adoption?"}, {"time": 2385, "text": "Or is there no simple answer?"}, {"time": 2387, "text": "There's no simple answer, but I think there is a lot of good people in medical system who do want to make a change."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "And I think a lot of power will come from us as consumers because we all are consumers or future consumers of healthcare services."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "And I think we can do so much more in explaining the potential and not in the hype terms and not saying that we now killed all Alzheimer and I'm really sick of reading this kind of articles which make these claims, but really to show with some examples what this implementation does and how it changes the care."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "Because I can't imagine, it doesn't matter what kind of politician it is, we all are susceptible to these diseases."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "There is no one who is free."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "And eventually, we all are humans and we're looking for a way to alleviate the suffering."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "And this is one possible way where we currently are under utilizing, which I think can help."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "So it sounds like the biggest problems are outside of AI in terms of the biggest impact at this point."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "But are there any open problems in the application of ML to oncology in general?"}, {"time": 2463, "text": "So improving the detection or any other creative methods, whether it's on the detection segmentations or the vision perception side or some other clever of inference?"}, {"time": 2476, "text": "Yeah, what in general in your view are the open problems in this space?"}, {"time": 2480, "text": "Yeah, I just want to mention that beside detection, not the area where I am kind of quite active and I think it's really an increasingly important area in healthcare is drug design."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "Because it's fine if you detect something early, but you still need to get drugs and new drugs for these conditions."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "And today, all of the drug design, ML is non existent there."}, {"time": 2508, "text": "We don't have any drug that was developed by the ML model or even not developed, but at least even knew that ML model plays some significant role."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "I think this area with all the new ability to generate molecules with desired properties to do in silica screening is really a big open area."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "To be totally honest with you, when we are doing diagnostics and imaging, primarily taking the ideas that were developed for other areas and you applying them with some adaptation, the area of drug design is really technically interesting and exciting area."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "You need to work a lot with graphs and capture various 3D properties."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "There are lots and lots of opportunities to be technically creative."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "And I think there are a lot of open questions in this area."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "We're already getting a lot of successes even with kind of the first generation of these models, but there is much more new creative things that you can do."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "And what's very nice to see is that actually the more powerful, the more interesting models actually do do better."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "So there is a place to innovate in machine learning in this area."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "And some of these techniques are really unique to, let's say, to graph generation and other things."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "So... What, just to interrupt really quick, I'm sorry, graph generation or graphs, drug discovery in general, how do you discover a drug?"}, {"time": 2611, "text": "Is this chemistry?"}, {"time": 2613, "text": "Is this trying to predict different chemical reactions?"}, {"time": 2617, "text": "Or is it some kind of... What do graphs even represent in this space?"}, {"time": 2622, "text": "Oh, sorry, sorry."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "And what's a drug?"}, {"time": 2625, "text": "Okay, so let's say you're thinking there are many different types of drugs, but let's say you're gonna talk about small molecules because I think today the majority of drugs are small molecules."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "So small molecule is a graph."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "The molecule is just where the node in the graph is an atom and then you have the bonds."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "So it's really a graph representation."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "If you look at it in 2D, correct, you can do it 3D, but let's say, let's keep it simple and stick in 2D."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "So pretty much my understanding today, how it is done at scale in the companies, without machine learning, you have high throughput screening."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "So you know that you are interested to get certain biological activity of the compound."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "So you scan a lot of compounds, like maybe hundreds of thousands, some really big number of compounds."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "You identify some compounds which have the right activity and then at this point, the chemists come and they're trying to now to optimize this original heat to different properties that you want it to be maybe soluble, you want it to decrease toxicity, you want it to decrease the side effects."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "Are those, sorry again to interrupt, can that be done in simulation or just by looking at the molecules or do you need to actually run reactions in real labs with lab coats and stuff?"}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So when you do high throughput screening, you really do screening."}, {"time": 2706, "text": "It's in the lab."}, {"time": 2707, "text": "It's really the lab screening."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "You screen the molecules, correct?"}, {"time": 2710, "text": "I don't know what screening is."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "The screening is just check them for certain property."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "Like in the physical space, in the physical world, like actually there's a machine probably that's actually running the reaction."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "Actually running the reactions, yeah."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "So there is a process where you can run and that's why it's called high throughput that it become cheaper and faster to do it on very big number of molecules."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "You run the screening, you identify potential good starts and then when the chemists come in who have done it many times and then they can try to look at it and say, how can you change the molecule to get the desired profile in terms of all other properties?"}, {"time": 2753, "text": "So maybe how do I make it more bioactive and so on?"}, {"time": 2756, "text": "And there the creativity of the chemists really is the one that determines the success of this design because again, they have a lot of domain knowledge of what works, how do you decrease the CCD and so on and that's what they do."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "So all the drugs that are currently in the FDA approved drugs or even drugs that are in clinical trials, they are designed using these domain experts which goes through this combinatorial space of molecules or graphs or whatever and find the right one or adjust it to be the right ones."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "It sounds like the breast density heuristic from 67 to the same echoes."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "It's not necessarily that."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "It's really driven by deep understanding."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "It's not like they just observe it."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "I mean, they do deeply understand chemistry and they do understand how different groups and how does it changes the properties."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "So there is a lot of science that gets into it and a lot of kind of simulation, how do you want it to behave?"}, {"time": 2821, "text": "It's very, very complex."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "So they're quite effective at this design, obviously."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "Now effective, yeah, we have drugs."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "Like depending on how do you measure effective, if you measure it in terms of cost, it's prohibitive."}, {"time": 2833, "text": "If you measure it in terms of times, we have lots of diseases for which we don't have any drugs and we don't even know how to approach and don't need to mention few drugs or neurodegenerative disease drugs that fail."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "So there are lots of trials that fail in later stages, which is really catastrophic from the financial perspective."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "So is it the effective, the most effective mechanism?"}, {"time": 2859, "text": "Absolutely no, but this is the only one that currently works."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "And I was closely interacting with people in pharmaceutical industry."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "I was really fascinated on how sharp and what a deep understanding of the domain do they have."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "It's not observation driven."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "There is really a lot of science behind what they do."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "But if you ask me, can machine learning change it, I firmly believe yes, because even the most experienced chemists cannot hold in their memory and understanding everything that you can learn from millions of molecules and reactions."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "And the space of graphs is a totally new space."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "I mean, it's a really interesting space for machine learning to explore, graph generation."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "Yeah, so there are a lot of things that you can do here."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So we do a lot of work."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "So the first tool that we started with was the tool that can predict properties of the molecules."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So you can just give the molecule and the property."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "It can be by activity property, or it can be some other property."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "And you train the molecules and you can now take a new molecule and predict this property."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "Now, when people started working in this area, it is something very simple."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "They do kind of existing fingerprints, which is kind of handcrafted features of the molecule."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "When you break the graph to substructures and then you run it in a feed forward neural network."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "And what was interesting to see that clearly, this was not the most effective way to proceed."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "And you need to have much more complex models that can induce a representation, which can translate this graph into the embeddings and do these predictions."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "So this is one direction."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "Then another direction, which is kind of related is not only to stop by looking at the embedding itself, but actually modify it to produce better molecules."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "So you can think about it as machine translation that you can start with a molecule and then there is an improved version of molecule."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "And you can again, with encoder translate it into the hidden space and then learn how to modify it to improve the in some ways version of the molecules."}, {"time": 2989, "text": "So that's, it's kind of really exciting."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "We already have seen that the property prediction works pretty well."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And now we are generating molecules and there is actually labs which are manufacturing this molecule."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "So we'll see where it will get us."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Okay, that's really exciting."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "There's a lot of promise."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "Speaking of machine translation and embeddings, I think you have done a lot of really great research in NLP, natural language processing."}, {"time": 3019, "text": "Can you tell me your journey through NLP?"}, {"time": 3021, "text": "What ideas, problems, approaches were you working on?"}, {"time": 3025, "text": "Were you fascinated with, did you explore before this magic of deep learning reemerged and after?"}, {"time": 3034, "text": "So when I started my work in NLP, it was in 97."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "This was very interesting time."}, {"time": 3039, "text": "It was exactly the time that I came to ACL."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "And at the time I could barely understand English, but it was exactly like the transition point because half of the papers were really rule based approaches where people took more kind of heavy linguistic approaches for small domains and try to build up from there."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "And then there were the first generation of papers which were corpus based papers."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "And they were very simple in our terms when you collect some statistics and do prediction based on

now there are alternatives that are that, you know, people work to make alternatives that are by their nature closer to what we observe directly."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "Can you describe the alternatives?"}, {"time": 3273, "text": "I don't think we touched on it, sort of the Copenhagen interpretation and the many worlds."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "Maybe there's a difference between the Everettian many worlds and many worlds as it is now, like has the idea sort of developed and so on."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "And just in general, what is the space of promising contenders?"},

candidates on stage for the debate?"}, {"time": 3302, "text": "So if you had a debate between quantum mechanical contenders, there'd be no problem getting 12 people up there on stage, but there would still be only three front runners."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "And right now the front runners would be Everett, hidden variable theories are another one."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "So the hidden variable theories say that the wave function is real, but there's something in addition to the wave function."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "The wave function is not everything, it's part of reality, but it's not everything."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "What else is there?"}, {"time": 3330, "text": "We're not sure, but in the simplest version of the theory, there are literally particles."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "So many worlds says that quantum systems are sometimes are wave like in some ways and particle like in another because they really, really are waves, but under certain observational circumstances they look like particles."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "Whereas hidden variable says they look like waves and particles because there are both waves and particles involved in the dynamics."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "And that's easy to do if your particles are just non relativistic Newtonian particles moving around."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "They get pushed around by the wave function roughly."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "It becomes much harder when you take quantum field theory or quantum gravity into account."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "The other big contender are spontaneous collapse theories."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "So in the conventional textbook interpretation, we say when you look at a quantum system, its wave function collapses and you see it in one location, a spontaneous collapse theory says that every particle has a chance per second of having its wave function spontaneously collapse."}, {"time": 3396, "text": "The chance is very small for a typical particle, it will take hundreds of millions of years before it happens even once, but in a table or some macroscopic object, there are way more than a hundred million particles and they're all

3414, "text": "That's a spontaneous collapse theory."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "There are also induced collapse theories like Roger Penrose thinks that when the gravitational difference between two parts of the wave function becomes too large, the wave function collapses automatically."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "So those are basically in my mind, the three big alternatives, many worlds, which is just there's a wave function and always obeys the Schrodinger equation, hidden variables."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "There's a wave function that always obeys the Schrodinger equation, but there are also new variables or collapse theories, which the wave function sometimes obeys the Schrodinger equation and sometimes it collapses."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "So you can see that the alternatives are more complicated in their formalism than many worlds is, but they are closer to our experience."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "So just this moment of collapse, do you think of it as a wave function, fundamentally sort of a probabilistic description of the world and this collapse sort of reducing that part of the world into something deterministic, where again, you can now describe the position and the velocity in this simple classical model?"}, {"time": 3476, "text": "Well there is... Is that how you think about collapse?"}, {"time": 3478, "text": "There is a fourth category, there's a fourth contender, there's a mayor Pete of quantum mechanical interpretations, which are called epistemic interpretations."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "And what they say is all the wave function is, is a way of making predictions for experimental outcomes."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "It's not mapping onto an element of reality in any real sense."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "And in fact, two different people might have two different wave functions for the same physical system because they know different things about it, right?"}, {"time": 3505, "text": "The wave function is really just a prediction mechanism."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And then the problem with those epistemic interpretations is if you say, okay, but it's predicting about what, like what is the thing that is being predicted?"}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And they say, no, no, no, that's not what we're here for."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "We're just here to tell you what the observational outcomes are going to be."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "But the other, the other interpretations kind of think that the wave function is real."}, {"time": 3530, "text": "So that's an ontic interpretation of the wave function, ontology being the study of what is real, what exists, as opposed to an epistemic interpretation of the wave function, epistemology being the study of what we know."}, {"time": 3542, "text": "That would actually just love to see that debate on stage."}, {"time": 3546, "text":

elaborate, why do you find many worlds so compelling?"}, {"time": 3579, "text": "Well, there's two reasons actually."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "One is, like I said, it is the simplest, right?"}, {"time": 3585, "text": "It's like the most bare bones, austere, pure version of quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "And I am someone who is very willing to put a lot of work into mapping the formalism onto reality."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "I'm less willing to complicate the formalism itself."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "But the other big reason is that there's something called modern physics with quantum fields and quantum gravity and holography and space time doing things like that."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "And when you take any of the other versions of quantum theory, they bring along classical baggage, all of the other versions of quantum mechanics, prejudice or privilege some version of classical reality like locations in space, okay?"}, {"time": 3626, "text": "And I think that that's a barrier to doing better at understanding the theory of everything and understanding quantum gravity and the emergence of space time."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "Whenever if you change your theory from, you know, here's a harmonic oscillator, oh, there's a spin, here's an electromagnetic field, in hidden variable theories or dynamical collapse theories."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "You have to start from scratch."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "You have to say like, well, what are the hidden variables for this theory or how does it collapse or whatever?"}, {"time": 3649, "text": "Whereas many worlds is plug and play."}, {"time": 3650, "text": "You tell me the theory and I can give you as many worlds version."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "So when we have a situation like we have with gravity and space time, where the classical description seems to break down in a dramatic way, then I think you should start from the most quantum theory that you have, which is really many worlds."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "So start with the quantum theory and try to build up a model of space time, the emergence of space time."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "So I thought space time was fundamental."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "So this sort of dream that Einstein had that everybody had and everybody has of, you know, the theory of everything."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "So how do we build up from many worlds from quantum mechanics, a model of space time model of gravity?"}, {"time": 3698, "text": "Well, yeah, I mean, let me first mention very quickly why we think it's necessary."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "You know, we've had gravity in the form that Einstein bequeathed it to us for over a hundred years now, like 1915 or 1916, he put general relativity in the final form."}, {"time": 3712, "text": "So gravity is the curvature of space time and there's a field that pervades all the universe that tells us how curved space time is."}, {"time": 3720, "text": "And that's a fundamentally classical."}, {"time": 3721, "text": "That's totally classical."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "But we also have a formalism, an algorithm for taking a classical theory and quantizing it."}, {"time": 3730, "text": "This is how we get quantum electrodynamics, for example."}, {"time": 3733, "text": "And it could be tricky."}, {"time": 3734, "text": "I mean, you think you're quantizing something, so that means taking a classical theory and promoting it to a quantum mechanical theory."}, {"time": 3742, "text": "But you can run into problems."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "So they ran into problems and they did that with electromagnetism, namely that certain quantities were infinity and you don't like infinity, right?"}, {"time": 3750, "text": "So Feynman and Tominaga and Schwinger won the Nobel Prize for teaching us how to deal with the infinities."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And then Ken Wilson won another Nobel Prize for saying you shouldn't have been worried about those infinities after all."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "But still, that was the, it's always the thought that that's how you will make a good quantum theory."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "You'll start with a classical theory and quantize it."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "So if we have a classical theory, general relativity, we can quantize it or we can try to, but we run into even bigger

successful theory of gravity, quantum gravity, by starting with classical general relativity and quantizing it."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "And there's evidence that, there's a good reason why this is true, that whatever the quantum theory of gravity is, it's not a field theory."}, {"time": 3797, "text": "It's something that has weird nonlocal features built into it somehow that we don't understand."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "We get this idea from black holes and Hawking radiation and information conservation and a whole bunch of other ideas I talk about in the book."}, {"time": 3810,

classical precursor and quantizing it."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "So the only sensible thing, or at least the next obvious sensible thing to me would be to say, okay, let's just start intrinsically quantum and work backwards, see if we can find a classical limit."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "So the idea of locality, the fact that locality is not fundamental to the nature of our existence, I guess in that sense, modeling everything as a field makes sense to me."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "Stuff that's close by interacts, stuff that's far away doesn't."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "So what's locality and why is it not fundamental?"}, {"time": 3855, "text": "And how is that even possible?"}, {"time": 3857, "text": "I mean, locality is the answer to the question that Isaac Newton was worried about back in the beginning of our conversation, right?"}, {"time": 3862, "text": "I mean, how can the earth know what the gravitational field of the sun is?"}, {"time": 3867, "text": "And the answer as spelled out by Laplace and Einstein and others is that there's a field in between."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "And the way a field works is that what's happening to the field at this point in space only depends directly on what's happening at points right next to it."}, {"time": 3881, "text": "But what's happening at those points depends on what's happening right next to those, right?"},

happens here is only affected by what's happening right next to it."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "That's locality."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "The idea of locality is built into every field theory,

feature of black holes that, again, it's totally a thought experiment feature because we haven't gone and probed any yet."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "But there seems to be one way of thinking about what happens inside a black hole as seen by an observer who's falling in, which is actually pretty normal."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "Like everything looks pretty normal until you hit the singularity

more subtly when we quantize gravity."}, {"time": 4022, "text": "And because you can describe everything that's going on in the three dimensional space by looking at the two dimensional projection of it, it means that locality doesn't, it's not necessary."}, {"time": 4034, "text": "Well, it means that somehow it's only a good approximation."}, {"time": 4038, "text": "It's not really what's going on."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "How are we supposed to feel about that?"}, {"time": 4042, "text": "We're supposed to feel liberated."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "You know, space is just a good

quantum mechanics, but our ordinary notions of space time don't really quite work."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "And there's a principle that goes hand in hand with holography called complementarity,

answer is nothing special is happening."}, {"time": 4165, "text": "It's still just the Schrodinger equation, but you have a wave function too."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And that's a different answer than would be given in hidden variables or dynamical collapse theories or whatever."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "So the entire point of many worlds is to explain what we observe, but it tries to explain

when I first, as like a little kid, learned about these surfaces and shapes, like a mobius strip and a torus."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "Like what you learn is, oh, this mobius strip, you take a piece of paper, put a twist, glue it together, and now you have a shape with one edge and just one side."}, {"time": 2573, "text": "And as a student, you should think, who cares, right?"}, {"time": 2578,

doing something."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "It's not just playing with construction paper."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "And the way that it solves the problem is really beautiful."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "So kind of putting all of that down and concretizing it, right?"}, {"time": 2605, "text": "Like I was talking about how when you have to put visuals to it, it demands that what's on screen is a very specific example of what you're describing."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "The construction here is very abstract in nature."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "You describe this very abstract kind of surface in 3D space."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "So then when I was finding myself, in this case, I wasn't programming, I was using a grapher that's like built into OSX for the 3D stuff to draw that surface, you realize, oh man, the topology argument is very non constructive."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "I have to make a lot of, you have to do a lot of extra work in order to make the surface show up."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "But then once you see it, it's quite pretty and it's very satisfying to see a specific instance of it."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "And you also feel like, ah, I've actually added something on top of what the original paper was doing that it shows something that's completely correct."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "That's a very beautiful argument, but you don't see what it looks like."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "And I found something satisfying in seeing what it looked like that could only ever have come about from the forcing function of getting some kind of image on the screen to describe the thing I was talking about."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "So you almost weren't able to anticipate what it's gonna look like."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "I had no idea."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "And it was wonderful, right?"}, {"time": 2668, "text": "It was totally, it looks like a Sydney Opera House or some sort of Frank Gehry design."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "And it was, you knew it was gonna be something and you can say various things about it."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "Like, oh, it touches the curve itself."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "It has a boundary that's this curve on the 2D plane."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "It all sits above the plane."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "But before you actually draw it, it's very unclear what the thing will look like."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "And to see it, it's very, it's just pleasing, right?"}, {"time": 2690, "text": "So that was fun to make, very fun to share."}, {"time": 2693, "text": "I hope that it has elucidated for some people out there where these constructs of topology come from, that it's not arbitrary play with construction paper."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "So let's, I think this is a good sort of example to talk a little bit about your process."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "You have a list of ideas."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "So that's sort of the curse of having an active and brilliant mind is I'm sure you have a list that's growing faster than you can utilize."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "Now I'm ahead, absolutely."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "But there's some sorting procedure depending on mood and interest and so on."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "But okay, so you pick an idea and then you have to try to write a narrative arc that sort of, how do I elucidate?"},

parts of that process?"}, {"time": 2758, "text": "Well, the most painful is if you've chosen a topic that you do want to do, but then it's hard to think of, I guess how to structure the script."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "This is sort of where I have been on one for like the last two or three months."}, {"time": 2772, "text": "And I think that ultimately the right resolution is just like set it aside and instead do some other things where the script comes more naturally."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "Because you sort of don't want to overwork a narrative."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "The more you've thought about it, the less you can empathize with the student who doesn't yet understand the thing you're trying to teach."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "Who is the judger in your head?"}, {"time": 2791, "text": "Sort of the person, the creature, the essence that's saying this sucks or this is good."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "And you mentioned kind of the student you're thinking about."},

three months."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "I think it's my past self."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "I think that's the entity that I'm most trying to empathize with is like you take who I was, because that's kind of the only person I know."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "Like you don't really know anyone other than versions of yourself."}, {"time": 2825, "text": "So I start with the version of myself that I know who doesn't yet understand the thing, right?"}, {"time": 2830, "text": "And then I just try to view it with fresh eyes, a particular visual or a particular script."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "Like, is this motivating?"}, {"time": 2838, "text": "Does this make sense?"}, {"time": 2840, "text": "Which has its downsides, because sometimes I find myself speaking to motivations that only myself would be interested in."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "I don't know, like I did this project on quaternions where what I really wanted was to understand what are they doing in four dimensions?"}, {"time": 2854, "text": "Can we see what they're doing in four dimensions, right?"}, {"time": 2857, "text": "And I came up with a way of thinking about it that really answered the question in my head that made me very satisfied and being able to think about concretely with a 3D visual, what are they doing to a 4D sphere?"}, {"time": 2868, "text": "And so I'm like, great, this is exactly what my past self would have wanted, right?"}, {"time": 2871, "text": "And I make a thing on it."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "And I'm sure it's what some other people wanted too."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "But in hindsight, I think most people who wanna learn about quaternions are like robotics engineers or graphics programmers who want to understand how they're used to describe 3D rotations."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "And like their use case was actually a little bit different than my past self."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "And in that way, like, I wouldn't actually recommend that video to people who are coming at it from that angle of wanting to know, hey, I'm a robotics programmer."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "Like, how do these quaternion things work to describe position in 3D space?"}, {"time": 2902, "text": "I would say other great resources for that."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "If you ever find yourself wanting to say like, but hang on, in what sense are they acting in four dimensions?"}, {"time": 2910, "text": "Then come back."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "But until then, that's a little different."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "Yeah, it's interesting because you have incredible videos on neural networks, for example."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "And from my sort of perspective, because I've probably, I mean, I looked at the, is sort of my field and I've also looked at the basic introduction of neural networks like a million times from different perspectives."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "And it made me realize that there's a lot of ways to present it."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "So you were sort of, you did an incredible job."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "I mean, sort of the, but you could also do it differently and also incredible."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "Like to create a beautiful presentation of a basic concept requires sort of creativity, requires genius and so on, but you can take it from a bunch of different perspectives."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "And that video on neural networks made me realize that."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "And just as you're saying, you kind of have a certain mindset, a certain view, but from a, if you take a different view

build the LHC, so they're people much, much better at this stuff than I."}, {"time": 686, "text": "For sure, but maybe."}, {"time": 690, "text": "But from your sort of intuition, from the echoes of what you understand, what you heard of how it's designed, what's your sense?"}, {"time": 700, "text": "What's the engineering aspects of it?"}, {"time": 703, "text": "The acceleration bit is not challenging."}, {"time": 705, "text": "Okay, I mean, okay, there's always challenges with everything, but basically you have these, the beams that go around the LHC, the beams of particles are divided into little bunches."}, {"time": 715, "text": "So they're called, they're a bit like swarms of bees, if you like, and there are around, I think it's something of the order 2000 bunches spaced around the ring."}, {"time": 725, "text": "And they, if you're at a given point on the ring, counting bunches, you get 40 million bunches passing you every second."}, {"time": 731, "text": "So they come in like cars going past on a very fast motorway."}, {"time": 736, "text": "So you need to have, if you're an electric field that you're using to accelerate the particles, that needs to be timed so that as a bunch of protons arrives, it's got the right sign to attract them and then flips at the right moment."}, {"time": 747, "text": "But I think the voltage in those boxes oscillates at hundreds of megahertz."}, {"time": 751, "text": "So the beams are like 40 megahertz, but it's oscillating much more quickly than the beam."}, {"time": 755, "text": "So I think it's difficult engineering, but in principle, it's not a really serious challenge."}, {"time": 761, "text": "The bigger problem."}, {"time": 762, "text": "There's probably engineers like screaming at you right now."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Probably, but I mean, okay."}, {"time": 766, "text": "So in terms of coming back to this thing, why is it so big?"}, {"time": 768, "text": "Well, the reason is you wanna get the particles through that accelerating element over and over again."}, {"time": 774, "text": "So you wanna bring them back round."}, {"time": 775, "text": "So that's why it's round."}, {"time": 776, "text": "The question is why couldn't you make it smaller?"}, {"time": 778, "text": "Well, the basic answer is that these particles are going unbelievably quickly."}, {"time": 783, "text": "So they travel at 99.9999991% of the speed of light in the LHC."}, {"time": 791, "text": "And if you think about, say, driving your car around a corner at high speed, if you go fast, you need a lot of friction in the tires to make sure you don't slide off the road."}, {"time": 801, "text": "So the limiting factor is how powerful a magnet can you make because what we do is magnets are used to bend the particles around the ring."}, {"time": 810, "text": "And essentially the LHC, when it was designed, was designed with the most powerful magnets that could conceivably be built at the time."}, {"time": 817, "text": "And so that's your kind of limiting factor."}, {"time": 820, "text": "So if you wanted to make the machine smaller, that means a tighter bend, you need to have a more powerful magnet."},

be."}, {"time": 831, "text": "The smaller the tunnel, the stronger they've gotta be."}, {"time": 834, "text": "Okay, so maybe can we backtrack to the Standard Model and say what kind of particles there are, period, and maybe the history of kind of assembling that the Standard Model of physics and then how that leads up to the hopes and dreams and the accomplishments of the Large Hadron Collider."}, {"time": 852, "text": "Yeah, sure, okay."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So all of 20th century physics in like five minutes."}, {"time": 857, "text": "Okay, so, okay, the story really begins properly."}, {"time": 861, "text": "End of the 19th century, the basic view of matter is that matter is made of atoms and the atoms are indestructible, immutable little spheres like the things we were talking about that don't really exist."}, {"time": 872, "text": "And there's one atom for every chemical element."}, {"time": 875, "text": "So there's an atom for hydrogen, for helium, for carbon, for iron, et cetera, and they're all different."}, {"time": 879, "text": "Then in 1897, experiments done at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, which is where I'm still, where I'm based, showed that there are actually smaller particles inside the atom, which eventually became known as electrons."}, {"time": 891, "text": "So these are these negatively charged things that go around the outside."}, {"time": 894, "text": "A few years later, Ernest Rutherford, very famous nuclear physicist, one of the pioneers of nuclear physics shows that the atom has a tiny nugget in the center, which we call the nucleus, which is a positively charged object."}, {"time": 905, "text": "So then by like 1910, 11, we have this model of the atom that we learn in school, which is you've got a nucleus, electrons go around it."}, {"time": 913, "text": "Fast forward a few years, the nucleus, people start doing experiments with radioactivity where they use alpha particles that are spat out of radioactive elements as bullets, and they fire them at other atoms."}, {"time": 926, "text": "And by banging things into each other, they see that they can knock bits out of the nucleus."}, {"time": 931, "text":

less, a neutral particle is discovered called the neutron."}, {"time": 943, "text": "So those are the three basic building blocks of atoms."}, {"time": 947, "text": "You have protons and neutrons in the nucleus that are stuck together by something called the strong force, the strong nuclear force, and you have electrons in orbit around that, held in by the electromagnetic force, which is one of the forces of nature."}, {"time": 960, "text": "That's sort of where we get to by like 1932, more or less."}, {"time": 964, "text": "Then what happens is physics is nice and neat."}, {"time": 967, "text": "In 1932, everything looks great, got three particles and all the atoms are made of, that's fine."}, {"time": 971, "text": "But then cloud chamber experiments."}, {"time": 973, "text": "These are devices that can be used to, the first device is capable of imaging subatomic particles so you can see their tracks."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And they're used to study cosmic rays, particles that come from outer space and bang into the atmosphere."}, {"time": 985, "text": "And in these experiments, people start to see a whole load of new particles."}, {"time": 989, "text": "So they discover for one thing antimatter, which is the sort of a mirror image of the particles."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So we discovered that there's also, as well as a negatively charged electron, there's something called a positron, which is a positively charged version of the electron."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "And there's an antiproton, which is negatively charged."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And then a whole load of other weird particles start to get discovered."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "And no one really knows what they are."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "This is known as the zoo of particles."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "Are these discoveries from the first theoretical discoveries or are they discoveries in an experiment?"}, {"time": 1018, "text": "So like, yeah, what's the

getting hands on with the phenomena, figuring out what these things are."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "And the theory comes a bit later."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "That's not always the case."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "So in the discovery of the anti electron, the positron, that was predicted from quantum mechanics and relativity by a very clever theoretical physicist called Paul Dirac, who was probably the second brightest physicist of the 20th century, apart from Einstein, but isn't anywhere near as well known."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "So he predicted the existence of the anti electron

too."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "So you basically want to remove every other distraction and really focus on this collision."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "How difficult of an engineering challenge is that?"}, {"time": 1206, "text": "Just to get a sense."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "And it is very hard."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "I mean, in the early days, particularly when the first accelerators are

of problem."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And it's tuning those magnetic fields, getting the magnetic fields powerful enough that you squash the beams and focus them so that you get enough collisions."},

happens."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "And we still have never actually managed to do that."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "So the way that it's done in the end is this machine that's built in California at the Stanford Lab, Stanford Linear Accelerator, which is essentially a gigantic, three kilometer long electron gun."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "It fires electrons, almost the speed of light, at protons."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "And when you do these experiments, what you find is at very high energy, the electrons bounce off small, hard objects inside the proton."}, {"time": 1645, "text":

like ball bearings, if you like."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "So you actually, that way, they resolve that there are three things inside the proton, which are quarks, the quarks that Gellman and Zweig had predicted."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "So that's really the evidence that convinces people that these things are real."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "The fact that we've never seen one in an experiment directly, they're always stuck inside other particles."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "And the reason for that is essentially to do with a strong force."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "The strong force is the force that holds quarks together."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "And it's so strong that it's impossible to actually liberate a quark."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "So if you try and pull a quark out of a

powerful spring."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "You pull and pull and pull, more and more energy gets stored in that bond, like stretching a spring, and eventually the tension gets so great, the spring

successes that you can use it to predict the existence of new particles that hadn't been seen."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "So, and it basically, there's lots of data basically showing from, you know, when we fire protons at each other at the LHC, a lot of quarks get knocked all over the place."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And every time they try and escape from, say, one of their protons, they make a whole jet of quarks that go flying off, bound up in other sorts of particles made of quarks."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "So all the sort of the theoretical predictions from the basic theory of the strong force and the quarks all agrees with what we are seeing in experiments."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "We've just never seen an actual quark on its own because unfortunately it's impossible to get them out on their own."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "So quarks, these crazy smaller things that are hard to imagine are real."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "What else is part of the story here?"}, {"time": 1789, "text": "So the other thing that's going on at the time, around the 60s, is an attempt to understand the forces that make these particles interact with each other."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "So you have the electromagnetic force, which is the force that was sort of discovered to some extent in this room, or at least in this building."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "So the first, what we call quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force is developed in the 1940s and 50s by Feynman, Richard Feynman amongst other people, Julian Schrodinger, Tom Onaga, who come up with the first, what we call a quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "And this is where this description of, which I gave you at the beginning, that particles are ripples in fields."},

attempt then is made to try, well, can we come up with a quantum field theory of the other forces, of the strong force and the weak, the third force, which we haven't discussed, which is the weak force, which is a nuclear force."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "We don't really experience it in our everyday lives, but it's responsible for radioactive decay."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "It's the force that allows, you know, on a radioactive atom to turn into a different element, for example."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And I don't know if you've explicitly mentioned, but so there's technically four forces."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "I guess three of them would be in the standard model, like the weak, the strong, and the electromagnetic, and then there's gravity."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "And there's gravity, which we don't worry about that, because it's too hard."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "It's too hard."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "Well, no, maybe we bring that up at the end, but yeah."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "Gravity, so far, we don't have a quantum theory of, and if you can solve that problem, you'll win a Nobel Prize."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "Well, we're gonna have to bring up the graviton at some point, I'm gonna ask you, but let's leave that to the side for now."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "So those three, okay, Feynman, electromagnetic force, the quantum field, and where does the weak force come in?"}, {"time": 1901, "text": "So yeah, well, first of all, I mean, the strong force is the easiest."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "The strong force is a little bit like the electromagnetic force."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "It's a force that binds things together."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "So that's the force that holds quarks together inside the proton, for example."},

{"time": 1933, "text": "So just like there's an electromagnetic field, there's something called a gluon field, which is also all around us."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "So some of these particles, I guess, are the force carriers or whatever."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "They carry the force."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "It depends how you want to think about it."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "I mean, really the field, the strong force field, the gluon field is the thing that binds the quarks together."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "The gluons are the little ripples in that field."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So that like, in the same way that the photon is a ripple in the electromagnetic field."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "But the thing that really does the binding is the field."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "I mean, you may have heard people talk about things like you've heard the phrase virtual particle."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "So sometimes in some, if you hear people describing how forces are exchanged between particles, they quite often talk about the idea that if you have an electron and another electron, say, and they're repelling each other through the electromagnetic force, you can think of that as if they're exchanging photons."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "So they're kind of firing photons backwards and forwards between each other."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "And that causes them to repel."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "That photon is then a virtual particle."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "Yes, that's what we call a virtual particle."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "In other words, it's not a real thing, it doesn't actually exist."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "So it's an artifact of the way theorists do calculations."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "So when they do calculations in quantum field theory, rather than, no one's discovered a way of just treating the whole field."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "You have to break the field down into simpler things."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "So you can basically treat the field as if it's made up of lots of these virtual photons, but there's no experiment that you can do that can detect these particles being exchanged."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "What's really happening in reality is that the electromagnetic field is warped by the charge of the electron and that causes the force."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "But the way we do calculations involves particles."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "So it's a bit confusing, but it's really a mathematical technique."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "It's not something that corresponds to reality."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "I mean, that's part, I guess, of the Feynman diagrams."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "Is this these virtual particles, okay."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "Some of these have mass, some of them don't."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "What does that even mean, not to have mass?"}, {"time": 2049, "text": "And maybe you can say which one of them have mass and which don't."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "And why is mass important or relevant in this field view of the universe?"}, {"time": 2062, "text": "Well, there are actually only two particles in the standard model that don't have mass, which are the photon and the gluons."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "So they are massless particles, but the electron, the quarks, and there are a bunch of other particles I haven't discussed."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "There's something called a muon and a tau, which are basically heavy versions of the electron that are unstable."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "You can make them in accelerators, but they don't form atoms or anything."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "They don't exist for long enough."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "But all the matter particles, there are 12 of them, six quarks and six, what we call leptons, which includes the electron and its two heavy versions and three neutrinos, all of them have mass."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "And so do, this is the critical bit."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So the weak force, which is the third of these quantum forces, which is one of the hardest to understand, the force particles of that force have very large masses."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "And there are three of them."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "They're called the W plus, the W minus, and the Z boson."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "And they have masses of between 80 and 90 times that of the protons."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "They're very heavy."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "They're very heavy things."}, {"time": 2127, "text": "So they're what, the heaviest, I guess?"}, {"time": 2129, "text": "They're not the heaviest."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "The heaviest particle is the top quark, which has a mass of about 175 ish protons."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "So that's really massive."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "And we don't know why it's so massive, but coming back to the weak force, so the problem in the 60s and 70s was that the reason that the electromagnetic force is a force that we can experience in our everyday lives."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "So if we have a magnet and a piece of metal, you can hold it, you know, a meter apart if it's powerful enough and you'll feel a force."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "Whereas the weak force only becomes apparent when you basically have two particles touching at the scale of a nucleus."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "So we just get to very short distances before this force becomes manifest."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "It's not, we don't get weak forces going on in this room."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "We don't notice them."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And the reason for that is that the particle, well, the field that transmits the weak force, the particle that's associated with that field has a very large mass, which means that the field dies off very quickly."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "So as you, whereas an electric charge, if you were to look at the shape of the electromagnetic field, it would fall off with this, you have this thing called the inverse square law, which is the idea that the force halves every time you double the distance."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "No, sorry, it doesn't half."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "It quarters every time you double the distance between say the two particles."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "Whereas the weak force kind of, you move a little bit away from the nucleus and just disappears."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "The reason for that is because these fields, the particles that go with them have a very large mass."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "But the problem that theorists faced in the 60s was that if you tried to introduce massive force fields, the theory gave you nonsensical answers."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "So you'd end up with infinite results for a lot of the calculations you tried to do."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "So the basically, it seemed that quantum field theory was incompatible with having massive particles, not just the force particles actually, but even the electron was a problem."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "So this is where the Higgs that we sort of alluded to comes in."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "And the solution was to say, okay, well, actually all the particles in the Standard Model are mass."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "They have no mass."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "So the quarks, the electron, they don't have a mass."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "Neither do these weak particles."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "They don't have mass either."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "What happens is they actually acquire mass through another process."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "They get it from somewhere else."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "They don't actually have it intrinsically."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "So this idea that was introduced by, well, Peter Higgs is the most famous, but actually there are about six people that came up with the idea more or less at the same time, is that you introduce a new quantum field, which is another one of these invisible things that's everywhere."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "And it's through the interaction with this field that particles get mass."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "So you can think of say an electron in the Higgs field, the Higgs field kind of bunches around the electron."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "It's sort of drawn towards the electron."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And that energy that's stored in that field around the electron is what we see as the mass of the electron."}, {"time": 2299, "text": "But if you could somehow turn off the Higgs field, then all the particles in nature would become massless and fly around at the speed of light."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So this idea of the Higgs field allowed other people, other theorists to come up with a, well, it was another, basically a unified theory of the electromagnetic force and the weak force."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "So once you bring in the Higgs field, you can combine two of the forces into one."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "So it turns out the electromagnetic force and the weak force are just two aspects of the same fundamental force."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And at the LHC, we go to high enough energies that you see these two forces unifying effectively."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "So first of all, it started as a theoretical notion, like this is some, and then, I mean, wasn't the Higgs called the God particle at some point?"}, {"time": 2350, "text": "It was by a guy trying to sell popular science books, yeah."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "Yeah, but I mean, I remember because when I was hearing it, I thought it would, I mean, that would solve a lot of, that unify a lot of our ideas of physics was my notion."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "But maybe you can speak to that."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "Is it as big of a leap as a God particle or is it a Jesus particle, which, you know, what's the big contribution of Higgs in terms of this unification power?"}, {"time": 2380, "text": "Yeah, I mean, to understand that, it maybe helps know the history a little bit."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "So when the, what we call electroweak theory was put together, which is where you unify electromagnetism with the weak force and Higgs is involved in all of that."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "So that theory, which was written in the mid 70s, predicted the existence of four new particles, the W plus boson, the W minus boson, the Z boson and the Higgs boson."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "So there were these four particles that came with the theory, that were predicted by the theory."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "In 1983, 84, the W's and the Z particles were discovered at an accelerator at CERN called the super proton synchrotron, which was a seven kilometer particle collider."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "So three of the bits of this theory had already been found."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "So people were pretty confident from the 80s that the Higgs must exist because it was a part of this family of particles that this theoretical structure only works if the Higgs is there."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "So what then happens, and so you've got this question about why is the LHC the size it is?"}, {"time": 2439, "text": "Well, actually the tunnel that the LHC is in was not built for the LHC."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "It was built for a previous accelerator called the large electron positron collider."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "So that began operation in the late 80s, early 90s."}, {"time": 2453, "text": "They basically, that's when they dug the 27 kilometer tunnel."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "They put this accelerator into it, the collider that fires electrons and anti electrons at each other, electrons and positrons."}, {"time": 2462,

didn't have enough energy to do it in the end."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "But the main thing it achieved was it studied the W and the Z particles at very high precision."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "So it made loads of these things."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "Previously, you can only make a few of them at the previous accelerator."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "So you could study these really, really precisely."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "And by studying their properties, you could really test this electroweak theory that had been invented in the 70s and really make sure that it worked."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "So actually by 1999, when this machine turned off, people knew, well, okay, you never know until you find the thing."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "But people were really confident this electroweak theory was right."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "And that the Higgs almost, the Higgs or something very like the Higgs had to exist because otherwise the whole thing doesn't work."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "It'd be really weird if you could discover and these particles, they all behave exactly as your theory tells you they should."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "But somehow this key piece of the picture is not there."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "So in a way, it depends how you look at it."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "The discovery of the Higgs on its own is obviously a huge achievement in many, both experimentally and theoretically."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "On the other hand, it's like having a jigsaw puzzle where every piece has been filled in."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "You have this beautiful image, there's one gap and you kind of know that piece must be there somewhere."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "So the discovery in itself, although it's important, is not so interesting."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "It's like a confirmation of the obvious at that point."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "But what makes it interesting is not that it just completes the standard model, which is a theory that we've known had the basic layout offs for 40 years or more now."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "It's that the Higgs actually is a unique particle."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "It's very different to any of the other particles in the standard model."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "And it's a theoretically very troublesome particle."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "There are a lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs, but also opportunities."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "So that we basically, we don't really understand how such an object can exist in the form that it does."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "So there are lots of reasons for thinking that the Higgs must come with a bunch of other particles or that it's perhaps made of other things."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "So it's not a fundamental particle, that it's made of smaller things."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "I can talk about that if you like a bit."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "That's still a notion, so the Higgs might not be a fundamental particle, that there might be some, it might, oh man."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "So that is an idea, it's not been demonstrated to be true."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "But I mean, all of these ideas basically come from the fact that this is a problem that motivated a lot of development in physics in the last 30 years or so."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "And it's this basic fact that the Higgs field, which is this field that's everywhere in the universe, this is the thing that gives mass to the particles."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "And the Higgs field is different from all the other fields in that, let's say you take the electromagnetic field, which is, if we actually were to measure the electromagnetic field in this room, we would measure all kinds of stuff going on because there's light, there's gonna be microwaves and radio waves and stuff."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "But let's say we could go to a really, really remote part of empty space and shield it and put a big box around it and then measure the electromagnetic field in that box."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "The field would be almost zero, apart from some little quantum fluctuations, but basically it goes to naught."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "The Higgs field has a value everywhere."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "So it's a bit like the whole, it's like the entire space has got this energy stored in the Higgs field, which is not zero, it's finite, it's a bit like having the temperature of space raised to some background temperature."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "And it's that energy that gives mass to the particles."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "So the reason that electrons and quarks have mass is through the interaction with this energy that's stored in the Higgs field."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "Now, it turns out that the precise value this energy has has to be very carefully tuned if you want a universe where interesting stuff can happen."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "And at that point, if the Higgs field was that strong, even an electron would become so massive that it would collapse into a black hole."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "And then you have a universe made of black holes and nothing like us."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So it seems that the strength of the Higgs field is to achieve the value that we see requires what we call fine tuning of the laws of physics."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "You have to fiddle around with the other fields in the Standard Model and their properties to just get it to this right sort of Goldilocks value that allows atoms to exist."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "This is deeply fishy."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "People really dislike this."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "Well, yeah, I guess, so what would be, so two explanations."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "One, there's a god that designed this perfectly, and two is there's an infinite number of alternate universes, and we just happen to be in the one in which life is possible, complexity."}, {"time": 2772, "text": "So when you say, I mean, life, any kind of complexity, that's not either complete chaos or black holes."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "I mean, how does that make you feel?"}, {"time": 2783, "text": "That's such a fascinating notion that this perfectly tuned field that's the same everywhere is there."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "Yeah, what do you make of that?"}, {"time": 2794, "text": "I mean, yeah, so you laid out two of the possible explanations."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "Some, well, yeah, I mean, well, someone, some cosmic creator went, yeah, let's fix that to be at the right level."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "That's one possibility, I guess."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "It's not a scientifically testable one, but theoretically, I guess, it's possible."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "Sorry to interrupt, but there could also be not a designer, but couldn't there be just, I guess I'm not sure what that would be, but some kind of force that, that some kind of mechanism by which this kind of field is enforced in order to create complexity, basically forces that pull the universe towards an interesting complexity."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "I mean, yeah, I mean, there are people who have those ideas."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "I don't really subscribe to them."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "As I'm saying, it sounds really stupid."}, {"time": 2845, "text": "No, I mean, there are definitely people that make those kind of arguments."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "There's ideas that, I think it's Lee Smolin's idea, or one, I think, that universes are born inside black holes."}, {"time": 2858, "text": "And so, universes, they basically have like Darwinian evolution of the universe, where universes give birth to other universes."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "And if universes where black holes can form are more likely to give birth to more universes, so you end up with universes which have similar laws."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "I mean, I don't know, whatever."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "Well, I talked to Lee recently on this podcast, and he's a reminder to me that the physics community has like so many interesting characters in it."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "Anyway, sorry, so."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "I mean, as an experimentalist, I tend to sort of think, these are interesting ideas, but they're not really testable, so I tend not to think about them very much."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "So, I mean, going back to the science of this, there is an explanation."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "There is a possible solution to this problem of the Higgs, which doesn't involve multiverses or creators fiddling about with the laws of physics."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "If the most popular solution was something called supersymmetry, which is a theory which involves a new type of symmetry of the universe."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "In fact, it's one of the last types of symmetries that it's possible to have that we haven't already seen in nature, which is a symmetry between force particles and matter particles."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "So what we call fermions, which are the matter particles and bosons, which are force particles."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "And if you have supersymmetry, then there is a super partner for every particle in the standard model."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "And without going into the details, the effect of this basically is that you have a whole bunch of other fields, and these fields cancel out the effect of the standard model fields, and they stabilize the Higgs field at a nice sensible value."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "So in supersymmetry, you naturally, without any tinkering about with the constants of nature or anything, you get a Higgs field with a nice value, which is the one we see."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "So this is one of the, and supersymmetry's also got lots of other things going for it."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "It predicts the existence of a dark matter particle, which would be great."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "It potentially suggests that the strong force and the electroweak force unify at high energy."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "So lots of reasons people thought this was a productive idea."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "So it was kind of thought, you discover the Higgs, you probably discover super partners as well."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "So once you start creating ripples in this Higgs field, you should be able to see these kinds of, you should be, yeah."}, {"time": 3009, "text": "So the super fields would be there."}, {"time": 3011,

found."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "So supersymmetry is not the only thing that can do this."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "There are other theories that involve additional dimensions of space or potentially involve the Higgs boson being made of smaller things, being made of other particles."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "Yeah, that's an interesting, you know, I haven't heard that before."},

{"time": 3068, "text": "Well, so the oldest, I think the original ideas about this was these theories called technicolor, which were basically like an analogy with the strong force."}, {"time": 3077, "text": "So the idea was the Higgs boson was a bound state of two very strongly interacting particles that were a bit like quarks."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "So like quarks, but I guess higher energy things with a super strong force."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "So not the strong force, but a new force that was very strong."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "And the Higgs was a bound state of these, these objects."}, {"time": 3096, "text": "And the Higgs would in principle, if that was right, would be the first in a series of technicolor particles."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "Technicolor, I think not being a theorist, but it's not, it's basically not done very well, particularly since the LHC found the Higgs, that kind of, it rules out, you know, a lot of these technicolor theories, but there are other things that are a bit like technicolor."}, {"time": 3115, "text": "So there's a theory called partial composite, which is an idea that some of my colleagues at Cambridge have worked on, which is a similar sort of idea that the Higgs is a bound state of some strongly interacting particles, and that the standard model particles themselves, the more exotic ones like the top quark are also sort of mixtures of these composite particles."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Is it possible that the deeper order includes like almost a single entity, so like something that I guess like string theory dreams about, is this essentially the dream, is to discover something simple, beautiful and unifying?"}, {"time": 3340, "text": "Yeah, probably ever."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "By the way, so sorry to take a million tangents, but is there room for complete innovation of how to build a particle collider that could give us an order of magnitude increase in the kind of energies, or do we need to keep just increasing the size of things?"}, {"time": 3358, "text": "I mean, maybe, yeah, I mean, there are ideas, to give you a sense of the gulf that has to be bridged."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "So the LHC collides particles at an energy of what we call 14 tera electron volts, so that's basically the equivalent if you've accelerated a proton through 14 trillion volts."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "That

called the Planck scale, which I think is of the order 10 to the, hang on, get this right, it's 10 to the 18 giga electron volts, so about 10 to the 15 tera electron volts."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "So you're talking trillions of times more energy."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "Yeah, 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 14th larger, I don't even."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "It's of that order."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "It's a very big number."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "So we're not talking just an order of magnitude increase in energy, we're talking 14 orders of magnitude energy increase."}, {"time":

a hunter and you're kind of like, let's say there's the relevance, very rare."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "You don't know where in the jungle, the jungle's big."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "So there's two

that's sort of what we do."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "We are the footprint people."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "We are, we're looking for the footprints, the impressions that quantum fields that we haven't managed to directly create the particle of, the effects these quantum fields have on the ordinary standard model fields that we already know about."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "So these B particles, the way they behave can be influenced by the presence of say, super fields or dark matter fields or whatever you like."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "And the way they decay and behave can be

moment where there's fairly compelling evidence that there might be something beyond the standard model is in these B, these beauty quarks decays."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "Just to clarify, which is the difference between the different, the four experiments, for example, that you mentioned, is it the kind of particles that are being collided?"}, {"time": 3744, "text": "Is it the energies which they're collided?"}, {"time": 3747, "text": "What's the fundamental difference between the different experiments?"}, {"time": 3750, "text": "The collisions are the same."}, {"time": 3752, "text":

are basically barrel shaped machines and the collisions happen in the middle of the barrel and the barrel captures all the particles that go flying out in every direction."}, {"time": 3768, "text":

recording?"}, {"time": 3777, "text": "Oh, so these detectors, if you've seen pictures of them, they're huge, like Atlas is 25 meters high and 45 meters long, they're vast machines, instruments, I guess you should call them really."}, {"time": 3789, "text": "They are, they're kind of like onions."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "So they have layers, concentric layers of detectors, different sorts of detectors."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "So close into the beam pipe, you have what are called usually made of silicon, they're tracking detectors."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "So they're little made of strips of silicon or pixels of silicon."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "And when a particle goes through the silicon, it gives a little electrical signal and you get these dots, electrical dots through your detector, which allows you to reconstruct the trajectory of the particle."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "So that's the middle and then the outsides of these detectors, you have things called calorimeters, which measure the energies of the particles and the very edge you have things called muon chambers, which basically these muon particles, which are the heavy version of the electron, they're like high velocity bullets and they can get right to the edge of the detectors."}, {"time": 3830, "text": "If you see something at the edge, that's a muon."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "So that's broadly how they work."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "And all of that is being recorded."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "That's all being fed out to, you know, computers."}, {"time": 3838, "text": "Data must be awesome, okay."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "So LHCb is different."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "So we, because we're looking for these be quarks, be quarks tend to be produced along the beam line."},

just looks in one direction."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "So we ignore, if you have your collision, stuff goes everywhere."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "We ignore all the stuff over here and going off sideways."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "We're just looking in this little region close to the beam pipe where most of these be quarks are made."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "So is there a different aspect of the sensors involved in the collection of the be quark trajectories?"}, {"time": 3877, "text": "There are some differences."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "So one of the differences is that, one of the ways you know you've seen a be quark is that be quarks are actually quite long lived by particle standards."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "So they live for 1.5 trillionths of a second, which is if you're a fundamental particle is a very long time."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "Cause the Higgs boson, I think lives for about a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, or maybe even less than that."},

you're lucky, then they'll decay into other stuff."}, {"time": 3907, "text": "So what we need to do in the middle of the detector, you wanna be able to see, you have your place where the protons crash into each other and that produces loads of particles that come flying out."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "So you have loads of lines, loads of tracks that point back to that proton collision."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "And then you're looking for a couple of other tracks, maybe two or three that point back to a different place that's maybe a few centimeters away from the proton collision."}, {"time":

proton collision from the B particle decay."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "So the middle of our detector is very sensitive and it gets very close to the collision."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "So you have this really beautiful delicate silicon detector that sits, I think it's seven millimeters from the beam."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "And the LHC beam has as much energy as a jumbo jet at takeoff."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "So it's enough to melt a ton of copper."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "So you have this furiously powerful thing sitting next to this tiny delicate silicon sensor."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "So those aspects of our detector that are specialized to measure these particular B quarks that we're interested in."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "And is there, I mean, I remember seeing somewhere that there's some mention of matter and antimatter connected to the B, these beautiful quarks."}, {"time": 3978, "text": "Is that, what's the connection?"}, {"time": 3983, "text": "Yeah, what's the connection there?"}, {"time": 3985, "text": "Yeah, so there is a connection, which is that when you produce these B particles, these particles, because you don't see the B quark, you see the thing that B quark is inside."}, {"time": 3995, "text": "So they're bound up inside what we call beauty particles, where the B quark is joined together with another quark or two, maybe two other quarks, depending on what it is."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "They're a particular set of these B particles that exhibit this property called oscillation."}, {"time": 4009, "text": "So if you make a, for the sake of argument, a matter version of one of these B particles, as it travels, because of the magic of quantum mechanics, it oscillates backwards and forwards between its matter and antimatter versions."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "So it does this weird flipping about backwards and forwards."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "And what we can use this for is a laboratory for testing the symmetry between matter and antimatter."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "So if the symmetry between antimatter is precise, it's exact, then we should see these B particles decaying as often as matter, as they do as antimatter, because this oscillation should be even."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "It should spend as much time in each state."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "But what we actually see is that one of the states, it spends more time and it's more likely to decay in one state than the other."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "So this gives us a way of testing this fundamental symmetry between matter and antimatter."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "So what can you, sort of returning to the question before about this fundamental symmetry, it seems like if there's perfect symmetry between matter and antimatter, if we have the equal amount of each in our universe, it would just destroy itself."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "And just like you mentioned, we seem to live in a very unlikely universe where it doesn't destroy itself."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "So do you have some intuition about why that is?"}, {"time": 4087, "text": "I mean, well, I'm not a theorist."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "I don't have any particular ideas myself."}, {"time": 4108, "text": "They always come together."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "They always annihilate together."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "So there's no way of making more matter than antimatter that we've discovered so far."}, {"time": 4115, "text": "So that means in the Big Bang, you get equal amounts of matter and antimatter."}, {"time": 4118, "text": "As the universe expands and cools down during the Big Bang, not very long after the Big Bang, I think a few seconds after the Big Bang, you have this event called the Great Annihilation, which is where all the particles and antiparticles smack into each other, annihilate, turn into light mostly, and you end up with a universe later on."}, {"time": 4135, "text": "If that was what happened, then the universe we live in today would be black and empty, apart from some photons, that would be it."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "So there is stuff in the universe."}, {"time": 4143, "text": "It appears to be just made of matter."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "So there's this big mystery as to how did this happen?"}, {"time": 4148, "text": "And there are various ideas, which all involve sort of physics going on in the first trillionth of a second or so of the Big Bang."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "So it could be that one possibility is that the Higgs field is somehow implicated in this, that there was this event that took place in the early universe where the Higgs field basically switched on, it acquired its modern value."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "And when that happened, this caused all the particles to acquire mass and the universe basically went through a phase transition where you had a hot plasma of massless particles."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "And then in that plasma, it's almost like a gas turning into droplets of water."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "You get kind of these little bubbles forming in the universe where the Higgs field has acquired its modern value, the particles have got mass."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "And this phase transition in some models can cause more matter than antimatter to be produced, depending on how matter bounces off these bubbles in the early universe."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "So that's one idea."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "There's other ideas to do with neutrinos, that there are exotic types of neutrinos that can decay in a biased way to just matter and not to antimatter."}, {"time": 4210, "text": "So, and people are trying to test these ideas."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "That's what we're trying to do at LHCb."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "There's neutrino experiments planned that are trying to do these sorts of things as well."}, {"time": 4217, "text": "So yeah, there are ideas, but at the moment, no clear evidence for which of these ideas might be right."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "So we're talking about some incredible ideas."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "By the way, never heard anyone be so eloquent about describing even just the standard model."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "So I'm in awe just listening."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "Oh, thank you."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "Yeah, just having fun enjoying it."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "So the, yes, the theoretical, the particle physics is fascinating here."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "To me, one of the most fascinating things about the Large Hadron Collider is the human side of it."}, {"time": 4247, "text": "That a bunch of sort of brilliant people that probably have egos got together and were collaborate together and countries, I guess, collaborate together for the funds and everything's just collaboration everywhere."}, {"time": 4263, "text": "Cause you may be, I don't know what the right question here to ask, but almost what's your intuition about how it was possible to make this happen and what are the lessons we should learn for the future of human civilization in terms of our scientific progress?"}, {"time": 4277, "text": "Cause it seems like this is a great, great illustration of us working together to do something big."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "Yeah, I think it's possibly the best example."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "Maybe I can think of international collaboration that isn't for some unpleasant purpose, basically."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "You know, I mean, so when I started out in the field in 2008 as a new PhD student, the LHC was basically finished."}, {"time": 4301, "text": "So I didn't have to go around asking for money for it or trying to make the case."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "So I have huge admiration for the people who managed that."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "Cause this was a project that was first imagined in the 1970s, in the late 70s was when the first conversations about the LHC were mooted and it took two and a half decades of campaigning and fundraising and persuasion until they started breaking ground and building the thing in the early noughties in 2000."}, {"time": 4328, "text": "So, I mean, I think the reason just from a sort of, from the point of view of the sort of science, the scientists there, I think the reason it works ultimately is that everywhere, everyone there is there for the same reason, which is, well, in principle, at least they're there because they're interested in the world."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "They want to find out, you know, what are the basic ingredients of our universe?"}, {"time": 4349, "text": "What are the laws of nature?"}, {"time": 4351, "text": "And so everyone is pulling in the same direction."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "Now, of course, everyone has their own things they're interested in."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "Everyone has their own careers to consider."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "And, you know, I wouldn't pretend that there isn't also a lot of competition."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "So there's this funny thing in these experiments where your collaborators, your 800 collaborators in LHCb, but you're also competitors because your academics in your various universities and you want to be the one that gets the paper out on the most exciting, you know, new measurements."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "So there's this funny thing where you're kind of trying to stake out your territory while also collaborating and having to work together to make the experiments work."}, {"time": 4380, "text": "And it does work amazingly well, actually considering all of that."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "And I think there was actually, I think McKinsey or one of these big management consultancy firms went into CERN maybe a decade or so ago to try to understand how these organizations function."}, {"time": 4395, "text": "Did they figure it out?"}, {"time": 4396, "text": "I don't think they could."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "I mean, I think one of the things that's interesting, one of the other interesting things about these experiments is, you know, they're big operations like say Atlas has 3000 people."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "Now there was a person nominally who was the head of Atlas, they're called the spokesperson."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "And the spokesperson is elected by, usually by the collaboration, but they have no actual power really."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "I mean, they can't fire anyone."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "They're not anyone's boss."}, {"time": 4419, "text": "So, you know, my boss is a professor at Cambridge, not the head of my experiments."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "The head of my experiment can't tell me what to do really."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "And there's all these independent academics who are their own bosses who, you know, so that somehow it, nonetheless, by kind of consensus and discussion and lots of meetings, these things do happen and it does get done, but."}, {"time": 4441,

her, no."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "No, we don't elect her."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "But everybody seems to love her."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "I don't know, from my outside perspective."},

said just there, just the brilliant people thing."}, {"time": 4465, "text": "Cause I'm not saying that people aren't great."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "But I think there is this sort of impression that physicists all have to be brilliant or geniuses, which is not true actually."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "And you know, you have to be relatively bright for sure."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "But you know, a lot of people, a lot of the most successful experimental physicists are not necessarily the people with the biggest brains."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "They're the people who, you know, particularly one of the skills that's most important in particle physics is the ability to work with others and to collaborate and exchange ideas and also to work hard."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And it's a sort of, often it's more a determination or a sort of other set of skills."}, {"time": 4497, "text": "It's not just being, you know, kind of some great brain."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "So, I mean, there's parallels to that in the machine learning world."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "If you wanna solve any real world problems, which I see as the particle accelerators, essentially a real world instantiation of theoretical physics."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "And for that, you have to not necessarily be brilliant, but be sort of obsessed, systematic, rigorous, sort of unborable, stubborn, all those kind of qualities that make for a great engineer."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "So, scientists purely speaking, that practitioner of the scientific method."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "But

happen that have a huge impact."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "To me, that's the Edison."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "That to me is a brilliant work, but to him, it's messy details that somebody will figure out anyway."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "I mean, I don't know whether you think there is a actual difference in temperament between say a physicist and an engineer, whether it's just what you got

building detectors."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "So, there's not such a clear divide, I think."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "I mean, but there does seem to be, like you work with data."}, {"time": 4617,

theory."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "Like I'm not afraid of data."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "I love data."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "And there's a lot of people in machine learning who are more like, they're basically afraid of data collection, afraid of data sets, afraid of all of that."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "They just want to stay in more than theoretical and they're really good at it, space."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "So, I don't know if that's the genetic, that's your upbringing, the way you go to school, but looking into the future of LHC and other colliders."}, {"time": 4653,

expanded?"}, {"time": 4679, "text": "Well, in the near future, the LHC is gonna get an upgrade."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "So, that's pretty much confirmed."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "I think it is confirmed, which is, it's not an energy upgrade."}, {"time": 4688, "text": "It's what we call a luminosity upgrade."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "So, it basically means increasing the data collection rates."}, {"time": 4693, "text": "So, more collisions per second, basically, because after a few years of data taking, you get this law of diminishing returns where each year's worth of data is a smaller and smaller fraction of the lot you've already got."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "So, to get a real improvement in sensitivity, you need to increase the data rate by an order of magnitude."},

larger rate than we could before."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "So, that will make us sensitive to whole loads of new processes that we weren't able to study before."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "And I mentioned briefly these anomalies that we've seen."}, {"time": 4725, "text": "So, we've seen a bunch of very intriguing anomalies in these b quark decays, which may be hinting at the first signs of this kind of the elephant, the signs of some new quantum field or fields maybe beyond the standard model."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "It's not yet at the statistical threshold where you can say that you've observed something, but there's lots of anomalies in many measurements that all seem to be consistent with each other."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "So, it's quite interesting."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "So, the upgrade will allow us to really home in on these things and see whether these anomalies are real, because if they are real, and this kind of connects to your point about the next generation of machines, what we would have seen then is, we would have seen the tail end of some quantum field in influencing these b quarks."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "What we then need to do is to build a bigger collider to actually make the particle of that field."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "So, if these things really do exist."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "So, that would be one argument."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "I mean, so at the moment, Europe is going through this process of thinking about the strategy for the future."}, {"time": 4787, "text": "So, there are a number of different proposals on the table."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "One is for a sort of higher energy upgrade of the LHC, where you just build more powerful magnets and put them in the same tunnel."}, {"time": 4796,

technology to accelerate at shorter distances."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "We're still talking kilometers long, but not like 100 kilometers long."}, {"time": 4819, "text": "And then probably the project that is, I think getting the most support, it'd be interesting to see what happens, something called the Future Circular Collider, which is a really ambitious longterm multi decade project to build a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel under the Geneva region."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "The LHC would become a kind of feeding machine."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "It would just feed."},

under Lake Geneva and round to the Alps, basically, up to the edge of the Geneva basin."}, {"time": 4852, "text": "So it's basically the biggest tunnel you can fit in the region based on the geology."}, {"time": 4857, "text": "100 kilometers."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "Yeah, so it's big."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "It'd be a long drive if your experiment's on one side."}, {"time": 4861,

"text": "The first thing you would do is put an electron positron machine in the 100 kilometer tunnel to study the Higgs."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "So you'd make lots of Higgs bows and study it really precisely in the hope that you see it misbehaving and doing something it's not supposed to."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "And then in the much longer term, 100, that machine gets taken out, you put in a proton proton machine."}, {"time": 4886, "text": "So it's like the LHC, but much bigger."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "And that's the way you start going and looking for dark matter, or you're trying to recreate this phase transition that I talked about in the early universe, where you can see matter anti matter being made, for example."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "There's lots of things you can do with these machines."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "The problem is that they will take, you know, the most optimistic, you're not gonna have any data from any of these machines until 2040, or, you know, because they take such a long time to build and they're so expensive."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "So you have, there'll be a process of R&D design, but also the political case being made."}, {"time": 4917, "text": "So LHC, what costs a few billion?"}, {"time": 4921, "text": "Depends how you count it."}, {"time": 4923, "text": "I think most of the sort of more reasonable estimates that take everything into account properly, it's around the sort of 10, 11, 12 billion euro mark."}, {"time": 4930, "text": "What would be the future, sorry, I forgot the name already."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "Future Circular Collider."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "Presumably they won't call it that when it's built, cause it won't be the future anymore."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "But I don't know, I don't know what they'll call it then."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "The very big Hadron Collider, I don't know."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "But that will, now I should know the numbers, but I think the whole project is estimated at about 30 billion euros, but that's money spent over between now and 2070 probably, which is when the last bit of it would be sort of finishing up, I guess."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "So you're talking a half a century of science coming out of this thing, shared by many countries."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "So the actual cost, the arguments that are made is that you could make this project fit within the existing budget of CERN, if you didn't do anything else."}, {"time": 4977, "text": "And CERN, by the way, we didn't mention, what is CERN?"}, {"time": 4980,

in the forties was, a lot of particular Jewish scientists, but a lot of scientists from central Europe had fled to the United States and Europe had sort of seen this brain drain."}, {"time": 5007,

like, I think the UK's contribution is a hundred or 200 million quid or something like that."}, {"time": 5034, "text": "Yeah, which is quite a lot, but not so."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "I mean, just the whole thing that is possible, it's beautiful."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "It's a beautiful idea, especially when there's no wars on the line, it's not like we're freaking out, as we're actually legitimately collaborating to do good science."}, {"time": 5049, "text": "One of the things I don't think we really mentioned is on the final side, that sort of the data analysis side, is there breakthroughs possible there and the machine learning side, like is there a lot more signal to be mined in more effective ways from the actual raw data?"}, {"time": 5065, "text": "Yeah, a lot of people are looking into that."}, {"time": 5067, "text": "I mean, so I use machine learning in my data analysis, but pretty naughty, basic stuff, cause I'm not a machine learning expert."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "I'm just a physicist who had to learn to do this stuff for my day job."}, {"time": 5078, "text": "So what a lot of people do is they use kind of off the shelf packages that you can train to do signal noise."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "Just clean up all the data."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "But one of the big challenges, the big challenge of the data is A, it's volume, there's huge amounts of data."}, {"time": 5093, "text": "So the LHC generates, now, okay, I try to remember what the actual numbers are, but if you, we don't record all our data, we record a tiny fraction of the data."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "It's like of order one 10,000th or something, I think."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "Is that right?"}, {"time": 5105, "text": "Around that."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "So

not."}, {"time": 5155, "text": "But also maybe even lower down than that, which is the point where there's this, so generally how the data is reconstructed is you start off with a set of digital hits

why they're losing, right?"}, {"time": 1303, "text": "Inevitably, it's because they don't have a great quarterback, they don't have a great coach, and they don't have a great general manager who knows how to hire the best talent."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Those are the three reasons why a team fails, right?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Because there are salary caps, so every team pays a certain amount of money for all their players."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "So it's gotta be those three positions."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "So if you're talking with somebody like that, inevitably, even though it's not structured, you'll know how their team's doing and you'll know pretty much why."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And if you start asking questions about that, they're typically very happy to talk about it because they haven't solved that problem."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "In some cases, they don't even know that's the problem."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "It's pretty easy to see it."},

when you're smart, for smart people, it's hard to escape their own ego and the space of their own problems, which is what's required to think about other people's problems."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "It requires for you to let go of the fact that your own problems are all important and then to talk about your, I think while it seems obvious and I think quite brilliant, it's just a difficult leap for many people, especially smart people, to empathize with, truly empathize with the problems of others."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "Well, I have a competitive advantage, which is, I don't think I'm so smart."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "So, you know, it's not a problem for me."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "Well, the truly smartest people I know say that exact same thing."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "Yeah, being humble is really useful, competitive advantage, as you said."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "How do you stay humble?"}, {"time": 1424, "text": "Well, I haven't changed much."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "Since?"}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Since I was in my mid teens."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "You know, I was raised partly in the city and partly in the suburbs."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "And,

I've never changed, why would I?"}, {"time": 1454, "text": "That's who I am."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And so the accoutrement of, you know, the rest of your life has gotta be put on the same, you know, like solid foundation of who you are."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "Because if you start losing who you really are, who are you?"}, {"time": 1472, "text": "So I've never had the desire to be somebody else."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "I just do other things now that I wouldn't do as a, you know, sort of as a middle class kid from Philadelphia."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "I mean, my life has morphed on a certain level."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "But part of the strength of having integrity of personality is that you can remain in touch with everybody who comes from that kind of

perspective."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "You can put it in any kind of terms, but it's philanthropy that focuses on maximizing impact."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "How do you see the goal of philanthropy, both from a personal motivation perspective and the societal big picture impact perspective?"}, {"time": 1553, "text": "Yeah, I don't think about philanthropy the way you would expect me to, okay?"}, {"time": 1558, "text": "I look at, you know, sort of solving big issues, addressing big issues, starting new organizations to do it, much like we do in our business."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "You know, we keep growing our business not by taking the original thing and making it larger, but continually seeing new things and building those."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "And, you know, sort of marshaling financial resources, human resources, and in our case, because we're in the investment business, we find something new that looks like it's gonna be terrific and we do that and it works out really well."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "All I do in what you would call philanthropy is look at other opportunities to help society."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "And I end up starting something new, marshaling people, marshaling a lot of money, and then at the end of that kind of creative process, somebody typically asks me to write a check."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "I don't wake up and say, how can I give large amounts of money away?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "I look at issues that are important for people."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "In some cases, I do smaller things."},

{"time": 1657, "text": "So, you know, at MIT, I'm a little bit you know, at MIT, I've done a big thing, you know, helping to start this new school of computing."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "And I did that because, you know, I saw that, you know, there's sort of like a global race on in AI, quantum, and other major technologies."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "And I thought that the US could use more enhancement from a competitive perspective."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "And I also, because I get to China a lot and I travel around a lot compared to a regular person, you know, I can see the need to have control of these types of technologies."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "So when they're introduced, we don't create a mess like we did with the internet and with social media."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "Unintended consequence, you know, that's creating all kinds of issues and freedom of speech and the functioning of liberal democracies."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "So with AI, it was pretty clear that there was enormous difference of views around the world by the relatively few practitioners in the world who really knew what was going on."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "And by accident, I knew a bunch of these people, you know, who were like big famous people."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "And I could talk to them and say, why do you think this is a force for bad?"}, {"time": 1745, "text": "And someone else, why do you feel this is a force for good?"}, {"time": 1748, "text": "And how do we move forward with the technology by the same time, make sure that whatever is potentially, you know, sort of on the bad side of this technology with, you know, for example, disruption of workforces and things like that, that could happen much faster than the industrial revolution."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "What do we do about that?"}, {"time": 1773, "text": "And how do we keep that under control so that the really good things about these technologies, which will be great things, not good things are allowed to happen?"}, {"time": 1784, "text": "So to me, you know, this was one of the great issues facing society."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "The number of people who were aware of it were very small."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "I just accidentally got sucked into it."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "And as soon as I saw it, I went, oh my God, this is mega, both on a competitive basis globally, but also in terms of protecting society and benefiting society."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So that's how I got involved."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "And at the end, you know, sort of the right thing that we figured out was, you know, sort of double MIT's computer science faculty and basically create the first AI enabled university in the world."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "And, you know, in effect, be an example, a beacon to the rest of the research community around the world academically, and create, you know, a much more robust U.S. situation, competitive situation among the universities."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "Because if MIT was going to raise a lot of money and double its faculty, well, you could bet that, you know, a number of other universities were going to do the same thing."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "At the end of it, it would be great for knowledge creation, you know, great for the United States, great for the world."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "And so I like to do things that I think are really positive, things that other people aren't acting on, that I see for whatever the reason."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "First, it's just people I meet and what they say, and I can recognize when something really profound is about to happen or needs to."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "And I do it, and at the end of the situation, somebody says, can you write a check to help us?"}, {"time": 1903, "text": "And then the answer is sure."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "I mean, because if I don't, the vision won't happen."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "But it's the vision of whatever I do that is compelling."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "And essentially, I love that idea of whether it's small at the individual level or really big, like the gift to MIT to launch the College of Computing."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "It starts with a vision, and you see philanthropy as, the biggest impact you can have is by launching something new, especially on an issue that others aren't really addressing."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "And I also love the notion, and you're absolutely right, that there's other universities, Stanford, CMU, I'm looking at you, that would essentially, the seed will create other, it'll have a ripple effect that potentially might help US be a leader or continue to be a leader in AI."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "It's potentially a very transformative research direction."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "Just to linger on that point a little bit, what is your hope long term for the impact the college here at MIT might have in the next five, 10, even 20, or let's get crazy, 30, 50 years?"}, {"time": 1983, "text": "Well, it's very difficult to predict the future when you're dealing with knowledge production and creativity."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "MIT has, obviously, some unique aspects."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "Globally, there's four big academic surveys."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "I forget whether it was QS, there's the Times in London, the US News, and whatever."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "And one of these recently, MIT, was ranked number one in the world."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "So leave aside whether you're number three somewhere else, in the great sweep of humanity, this is pretty amazing."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "So you have a really remarkable aggregation of human talent here."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "And where it goes, it's hard to tell."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "You have to be a scientist to have the right feel."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "But what's important is you have a critical mass of people."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "And I think it breaks into two buckets."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "One is scientific advancement."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "And if the new college can help either serve as a convening force within the university or help coordination and communication among people, that's a good thing, absolute good thing."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "The second thing is in the AI ethics area, which is, in a way, equally important."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "Because if the science side creates blowback so that science is a bit crippled in terms of going forward because society's reaction to knowledge advancement in this field becomes really hostile, then you've sort of lost the game in terms of scientific progress and innovation."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "And so the AI ethics piece is super important because in a perfect world, MIT would serve as a global convener."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "Because what you need is you need the research universities."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "You need the companies that are driving AI and quantum work."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "You need governments who will ultimately be regulating certain elements of this."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "And you also need the media to be knowledgeable and trained so we don't get overreactions to one situation, which then goes viral and it ends up shutting down avenues that are perfectly fine to be walking down or running down that avenue."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "But if enough discordant information, not even correct necessarily, sort of gets pushed around society, then you can end up with a really hostile regulatory environment and other things."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "So you have four drivers that have to be sort of integrated."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "And so if the new school of computing can be really helpful in that regard, then that's a real service to science."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "And it's a service to MIT."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "So that's why I wanted to get involved for both areas."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "And the hope is for me, for others, for everyone, for the world, is for this particular college of computing to be a beacon and a connector for these ideas."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "I mean, I think MIT is perfectly positioned to do that."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "So you've mentioned the media, social media, the internet as this complex network of communication with flaws, perhaps, perhaps you can speak to them."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "But I personally think that science and technology has its flaws, but ultimately is, one, sexy, exciting."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "It's the way for us to explore and understand the mysteries of our world."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "And two, perhaps more importantly for some people, it's a huge way to, a really powerful way to grow the economy, to improve the quality of life for everyone."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "So how do we get, how do you see the media, social media, the internet as a society having a healthy discourse about science, first of all, one that's factual and two, one that finds science exciting, that invests in science, that pushes it forward, especially in this science fiction, fear filled field of artificial intelligence?"}, {"time": 2323, "text": "Well, I think that's a little above my pay grade because trying to control social media to make it do what you want to do appears to be beyond almost anybody's control."}, {"time": 2336, "text": "And the technology is being used to create what I call the tyranny of the minorities."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "A minority is defined as two or three people on a street corner."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "Doesn't matter what they look like."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "Doesn't matter where they came from."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "They're united by that one issue that they care about."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "And their job is to enforce their views on the world."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "And in the political world, people just are manufacturing truth."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "And they throw it all over."}, {"time": 2376, "text": "And it affects all of us."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "And sometimes people are just hired to do that."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "And you think it's one person."}, {"time": 2388, "text": "It's really just sort of a front for a particular point of view."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "And this has become exceptionally disruptive for society."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "And it's dangerous."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "And it's undercutting the ability of liberal democracies to function."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "And I don't know how to get a grip on this."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "And I was really surprised when we was up here for the announcement last spring of the College of Computing."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "And they had all these famous scientists, some of whom were involved with the invention of the internet."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "And almost every one of them got up and said, I think I made a mistake."}, {"time": 2439, "text": "And as a non scientist, I never thought I'd hear anyone say that."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "And what they said is, more or less, to make it simple, we thought this would be really cool inventing the internet."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "We could connect everyone in the world."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "We can move knowledge around."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "It was instantaneous."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "It's a really amazing thing."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "He said, I don't know that there was anyone who ever thought about social media coming out of that and the actual consequences for people's lives."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "There's always some younger person."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "I just saw one of these yesterday."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "It's reported on the national news who killed himself when people use social media to basically sort of ridicule him or something of that type."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "This is dead."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "This is dangerous."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "And so I don't have a solution for that other than going forward, you can end up with this type of outcome using AI."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "To make this kind of mistake twice is unforgivable."}, {"time": 2516, "text": "So interestingly, at least in the West and parts of China, people are quite sympathetic to the whole concept of AI ethics and what gets introduced when and cooperation within your own country, within your own industry, as well as globally to make sure that the technology is a force for good."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "And that really interesting topic."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "Since 2007, you've had a relationship with senior leadership with a lot of people in China and an interest in understanding modern China, their culture, their world, much like with Russia."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "I'm from Russia originally."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "Americans are told a very narrow, one sided story about China that I'm sure misses a lot of fascinating complexity, both positive and negative."}, {"time": 2573, "text": "What lessons about Chinese culture, its ideas as a nation, its future do you think Americans should know about, deliberate on, think about?"}, {"time": 2582, "text": "Well, it's sort of a wide question that you're asking about."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "China is a pretty unusual place."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "First, it's huge."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "It's physically huge."},

people are amazingly energetic."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "If you're one of a billion three people, one of the things you've got to be focused on is how do you make your way through a crowd of a billion 2.99999 other people."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "No, the word for that is competitive."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "Yes, they are individually highly energetic, highly focused, always looking for some opportunity for themselves because they need to, because there's an enormous amount of just literally people around."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "And so what I've found is they'll try and find a way to win for themselves."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "And their country is complicated because it basically doesn't have the same kind of functional laws that we do in the United States and the West."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "And the country is controlled really through a web of relationships you have with other people and the relationships that those other people have with other people."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "So it's an incredibly dynamic culture where if somebody knocks somebody up on the top who's three levels above you and is, in effect, protecting you, then you're like a floating molecule there without tethering except the one or two layers above you."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "But that's going to get affected."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "So it's a very dynamic system."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "And getting people to change is not that easy because if there aren't really functioning laws, it's only the relationships that everybody has."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "And so when you decide to make a major change and you sign up for it, something is changing in your life."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "There won't necessarily be all the same people on your team."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "And that's a very high risk enterprise."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "So when you're dealing with China, it's important to know almost what everybody's relationship is with somebody."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "So when you suggest doing something differently, you line up these forces."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "In the West, it's usually you talk to a person and they figure out what's good for them."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "It's a lot easier."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "And in that sense, in a funny way, it's easier to make change in the West, just the opposite of what people think."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "But once the Chinese system adjusts to something that's new, everybody's on the team."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "It's hard to change them."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "But once they're changed, they are incredibly focused in a way that it's hard for the West to do in a more individualistic culture."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "So there are all kinds of fascinating things."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "One thing that might interest the people who are listening who are more technologically based than some other group."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "I was with one of the top people in the government a few weeks ago, and he was telling me that every school child in China is going to be taught computer science."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "Now, imagine 100% of these children."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "This is such a large number of human beings."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "Now, that doesn't mean that every one of them will be good at computer science."}, {"time": 2845, "text": "But if it's sort of like in the West, if it's like math or English, everybody's going to take it."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "Not everybody's great at English."},

faster."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "They're simpler so they could go faster, but you have to do more of them."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "So what's that trade off look like?"}, {"time": 1025, "text": "And it ended up that we ended up executing maybe 50% more instructions, maybe a third more instructions, but they ran four times faster."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "So this risk, controversial risk ideas proved to be maybe factors of three or four better."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "I love that this idea was controversial and almost kind of like rebellious."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "So that's in

did that happen?"}, {"time": 1099, "text": "And maybe I can sort of say a bunch of dumb things that could lay the land for further commentary."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So to me, this is kind of an interesting thing."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "If you look at C++ versus C, with modern compilers, you really could write faster code with C++."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "So relying on the compiler to reduce your complicated code into something simple and fast."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "So let's try and split that into two pieces."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "So if the compiler can do that for you, if the compiler can take, you know, a complicated program and produce simpler instructions, then the programmer doesn't care, right?"}, {"time": 1169, "text": "I don't care just how fast is the computer I'm using, how much does it cost?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "And so what happened kind of in the software industry is right around before the 1980s, critical pieces of software were still written not in languages like C or C++, they were written in what's called assembly language, where there's this kind of humans writing exactly at the instructions at the level that a computer can understand."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So they were writing add, subtract, multiply, you know, instructions."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "It's very tedious."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "But the belief was to write this lowest level of software that people use, which are called operating systems, they had to be written in assembly language because these high level languages were just too inefficient."},

all the operating systems today."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So Unix demonstrated that you could write something as complicated as an operating system in a language like C.

level languages."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So it's one step of a translation, but you can still build many layers of abstraction of software on top of that."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And that's how things are done today."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "So still today, many of the layers that you'll deal with, you may deal with debuggers, you may deal with linkers, there's libraries."}, {"time": 1405,

kind of really, you know, taste and hunches to quantifiable."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "And in fact, he and I wrote a textbook at the end of the 1980s called Computer Architecture, A Quantitative Approach."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "I heard of that."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "And it's the thing, it had a pretty big impact in the field because we went from textbooks that kind of listed, so

things."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "So specifically for instruction sets, what we do and some other fields do is we agree upon a set of programs, which we call benchmarks, and a suite of programs, and then you develop both the hardware and the compiler and you get numbers on how well your computer does given its instruction set and how well you implemented it in your microprocessor and how good your compilers are."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "In computer architecture, you know, using professor's terms, we grade on a curve rather than grade on an absolute scale."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "So

time."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "So the best way we know how to turn it into a kind of more science and experimental and quantitative is to compare yourself to other computers of the same era that

features that you were thinking about."}, {"time": 1916, "text": "And the other side is what are the metrics that you're thinking about when looking at these tradeoffs?"}, {"time": 1928, "text": "Yeah, let's talk about the metrics."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "So during these debates, we actually had kind of a hard time explaining, convincing people the ideas, and partly we didn't have a formula to explain it."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And a few years into it, we hit upon a formula that helped explain what was going on."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And I think if we can do this, see how it works orally to do this."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "So if I can do a formula orally, let's see."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "So fundamentally, the way you measure performance is how long does it take a program to run?"}, {"time": 1960, "text": "A program, if you have 10 programs, and typically these benchmarks were sweet because you'd want to have 10 programs so they could represent lots of different applications."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "So for these 10 programs, how long does it take to run?"}, {"time": 1971, "text": "Well now, when you're trying to explain why it took so long, you could factor how long it takes a program to run into three factors."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "One of the first one is how many instructions did it take to execute?"}, {"time": 1981, "text": "So that's the what we've been talking about, you know, the instructions of Alchemy."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "How many did it take?"}, {"time": 1986, "text": "The next question is how long did each instruction take to run on average?"}, {"time": 1991, "text": "So you multiply the number of instructions times how long it took to run, and that gets you time."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "Okay, so that's, but now let's look at this metric of how long did it take the instruction to run."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "Well, it turns out, the way we could build computers today is they all have a clock, and you've seen this when you, if you buy a microprocessor, it'll say 3.1 gigahertz or 2.5 gigahertz, and more gigahertz is good."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "Well, what that is is the speed of the clock."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "So 2.5 gigahertz turns out to be 4 billionths of instruction or 4 nanoseconds."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "So that's the clock cycle time."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "But there's another factor, which is what's the average number of clock cycles it takes per instruction?"}, {"time": 2034, "text": "So it's number of instructions, average number of clock cycles, and the clock cycle time."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "So in these risk sis debates, they would concentrate on, but risk needs to take more instructions, and we'd argue maybe the clock cycle is faster, but what the real big difference was was the number of clock cycles per instruction."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "Per instruction, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "What about the mess of, the beautiful mess of parallelism in the whole picture?"}, {"time": 2065, "text": "Parallelism, which has to do with, say, how many instructions could execute in parallel and things like that, you could think of that as affecting the clock cycles per instruction, because it's the average clock cycles per instruction."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So when you're running a program, if it took 100 billion instructions, and on average it took two clock cycles per instruction, and they were four nanoseconds, you could multiply that out and see how long it took to run."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "And there's all kinds of tricks to try and reduce the number of clock cycles per instruction."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "But it turned out that the way they would do these complex instructions is they would actually build what we would call an interpreter in a simpler, a very simple hardware interpreter."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "But it turned out that for the sis constructions, if you had to use one of those interpreters, it would be like 10 clock cycles per instruction, where the risk constructions could be two."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "So there'd be this factor of five advantage in clock cycles per instruction."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "We have to execute, say, 25 or 50 percent more instructions, so that's where the win would come."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "And then you could make an argument whether the clock cycle times are the same or not."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "But pointing out that we could divide the benchmark results time per program into three factors, and the biggest difference between RISC and SIS was the clock cycles per, you execute a few more instructions, but the clock cycles per instruction is much less."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "And that was what this debate, once we made that argument, then people said, oh, okay, I get it."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "And so we went from, it was outrageously controversial in, you know, 1982 that maybe probably by 1984 or so, people said, oh, yeah, technically, they've got a good argument."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "What are the instructions in the RISC instruction set, just to get an intuition?"}, {"time": 2165, "text": "1995, I was asked to predict the future of what microprocessor could future."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "So I, and I'd seen these predictions and usually people predict something outrageous just to be entertaining, right?"}, {"time": 2180, "text": "And so my prediction for 2020 was, you know, things are going to be pretty much, they're going to look very familiar to what they are."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "And they are, and if you were to read the article, you know, the things I said are pretty much true."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "The instructions that have been around forever are kind of the same."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And that's the outrageous prediction, actually."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "Given how fast computers have been going."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "Well, and you know, Moore's law was going to go on, we thought for 25 more years, you know, who knows, but kind of the surprising thing, in fact, you know,

we had back then."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "But what are the basic constructions and how do they change over the years?"}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So we're talking about addition, subtraction, these are the specific."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So the things that are in a calculator are in a computer."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "So any of the buttons that are in the calculator in the computer, so

remember in a calculator, there's a memory key."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "So you want to have intermediate calculation and bring it back later."}, {"time": 2284, "text": "So you'd hit the memory plus key M plus maybe, and it would put that into memory and then you'd hit an RM like recurrence section and then bring it back on the display."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "So you don't have to type it."},

temporary storage and bring it back when you need it later."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "So that's memory and loads and stores."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "But the big thing, the difference between a computer and a calculator is that the computer can make decisions."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "And amazingly, decisions are as simple as, is this value less than zero?"}, {"time": 2315, "text": "Or is this value bigger than that value?"}, {"time": 2321, "text": "And those instructions, which are called conditional branch instructions, is what give computers all its power."}, {"time": 2327, "text":

{"time": 2431, "text": "So this is an instruction set."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "So it's a vocabulary, it's not hardware, but by having an open instruction set, we can have open source implementations, open source processors that people can use."}, {"time": 2447, "text": "Where do you see that going?"}, {"time": 2454, "text": "It's a really exciting possibility, but you're just like in the scientific American, if you were to predict 10, 20, 30 years from now, that kind of ability to utilize open source instruction set architectures like RISC 5, what kind of possibilities might that unlock?"}, {"time": 2473, "text": "And so just to make it clear, because this is confusing, the specification of RISC 5 is something that's like in a textbook, there's books about it."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "So that's defining an interface."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "There's also the way you build hardware is you write it in languages that are kind of like C, but they're specialized for hardware that gets translated into hardware."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "And so these implementations of this specification are the open source."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "So they're written in something that's called Verilog or VHDL, but it's put up on the web, just like you can see the C++ code for Linux on the web."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "So that's the open instruction set enables open source implementations of RISC 5."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "So you can literally build a processor using this instruction set."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "People are, people are."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "So what happened to us that the story was this was developed here for our use to do our research."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "And we made it, we licensed under the Berkeley Software Distribution License, like a lot of things get licensed here."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "So other academics use it, they wouldn't be afraid to use it."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "And then about 2014, we started getting complaints that we were using it in our research and in our courses."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And we got complaints from people in industries, why did you change your instruction set between the fall and the spring semester?"}, {"time": 2552, "text": "And well, we get complaints from industrial time."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "Why the hell do you care what we do with our instruction set?"}, {"time": 2557, "text": "And then when we talked to him, we found out there was this thirst for this idea of an open instruction set architecture."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "And they had been looking for one."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "They stumbled upon ours at Berkeley, thought it was, boy, this looks great."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "We should use this one."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "And so once we realized there is this need for an open instruction set architecture, we thought that's a great idea."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "And then we started supporting it and tried to make it happen."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "So this was kind of, we accidentally stumbled into this and to this need and our timing was good."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "And so it's really taking off."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "There's, you know, universities are good at starting things, but they're not good at sustaining things."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "So like Linux has a Linux foundation, there's a RISC 5 foundation that we started."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "There's an annual conferences."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "And the first one was done, I think, January of 2015."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "And the one that was just last December in it, you know, it had 50 people at it."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "And this one last December had, I don't know, 1700 people were at it and the companies excited all over the world."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "So if predicting into the future, you know, if we were doing 25 years, I would predict that RISC 5 will be, you know, possibly the most popular instruction set architecture out there, because it's a pretty good instruction set architecture and it's open and free."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "And there's no reason lots of people shouldn't use it."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "And there's benefits just like Linux is so popular today compared to 20 years ago."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "And, you know, the fact that you can get access to it for free, you can modify it, you can improve it for all those same arguments."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "And so people collaborate to make it a better system for everybody to use."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "And that works in software."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "And I expect the same thing will happen in hardware."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "So if you look at ARM, Intel, MIPS, if you look at just the lay of the land, and what do you think, just for me, because I'm not familiar how difficult this kind of transition would, how much challenges this kind of transition would entail, do you see, let me ask my dumb question in another way."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "No, that's, I know where you're headed."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "Well, there's a bunch, I think the thing you point out, there's these very popular proprietary instruction sets, the x86."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "And so how do we move to RISC 5 potentially in sort of in the span of 5, 10, 20 years, a kind of unification, given that the devices, the kind of way we use devices, IoT, mobile devices, and the cloud keeps changing?"}, {"time": 2720, "text": "Well, part of it, a big piece of it is the software stack."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "And right now, looking forward, there seem to be three important markets."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "There's the cloud."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "And the cloud is simply companies like Alibaba and Amazon and Google, Microsoft, having these giant data centers with tens of thousands of servers in maybe a hundred of these data centers all over the world."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "And that's what the cloud is."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "So the computer that dominates the cloud is the x86 instruction set."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "So the instruction sets used in the cloud are the x86, almost 100% of that today is x86."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "The other big thing are cell phones and laptops."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "Those are the big things today."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "I mean, the PC is also dominated by the x86 instruction set, but those sales are dwindling."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "You know, there's maybe 200 million PCs a year, and there's one and a half billion phones a year."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "There's numbers like that."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "So for the phones, that's dominated by ARM."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "And now, and a reason that I talked about the software stacks, and the third category is Internet of Things, which is basically embedded devices, things in your cars and your microwaves everywhere."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "So what's different about those three categories is for the cloud, the software that runs in the cloud is determined by these companies, Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Microsoft."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "So they control that software stack."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "For the cell phones, there's both for Android and Apple, the software they supply, but both of them have marketplaces where anybody in the world can build software."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And that software is translated or, you know, compiled down and shipped in the vocabulary of ARM."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "So that's what's referred to as binary compatible because the actual, it's the instructions are turned into numbers, binary numbers, and shipped around the world."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "And sorry, just a quick interruption."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "So ARM, what is ARM?"}, {"time": 2841, "text": "ARM is an instruction set, like a risk based... Yeah, it's a risk based instruction set."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "It's a proprietary one."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "ARM stands for Advanced Risk Machine."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "ARM is the name where the company is."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "So it's a proprietary risk architecture."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "So, and it's been around for a while and it's, you know, the, surely the most popular instruction set in the world right now."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "They, every year, billions of chips are using the ARM design in this post PC era."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "Was it one of the early risk adopters of the risk idea?"}, {"time": 2876, "text": "The first ARM goes back, I don't know, 86 or so."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "So Berkeley instead did their work in the early 80s."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "The ARM guys needed an instruction set and they read our papers and it heavily influenced them."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "So getting back to my story, what about Internet of Things?"}, {"time": 2897, "text": "Well, software is not shipped in Internet of Things."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "It's the embedded device people control that software stack."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "So the opportunities for risk five, everybody thinks, is in the Internet of Things embedded things because there's no dominant player like there is in the cloud or the smartphones."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "And, you know, it's, it's, doesn't have a lot of licenses associated with, and you can enhance the instruction set if you want."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "And it's, and people have looked at instruction sets and think it's a very good instruction set."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "So it appears to be very popular there."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "It's possible that in the cloud people, those companies control their software stacks."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "So it's possible that they would decide to use risk five if we're talking about 10 and 20 years in the future."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "The one that would be harder would be the cell phones."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "Since people ship software in the ARM instruction set that you'd think be the more difficult one."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "But if risk five really catches on and, you know, you could, in a period of a decade, you can imagine that's changing over too."}, {"time": 2960, "text": "Do you have a sense why risk five or ARM has dominated?"}, {"time": 2965, "text": "You mentioned these three categories."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "Why has, why did ARM dominate, why does it dominate the mobile device space?"}, {"time": 2971, "text": "And maybe my naive intuition is that there are some aspects of power efficiency that are important that somehow come along with risk."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "Well, part of it is for these old CIS construction sets, like in the x86, it was more expensive to these for, you know, they're older, so they have disadvantages in them because they were designed 40 years ago."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "But also they have to translate in hardware from CIS constructions to risk constructions on the fly."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "And that costs both silicon area that the chips are bigger to be able to do that."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "And it uses more power."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "So ARM has, which has, you know, followed this risk philosophy is seen to be much more energy efficient."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "And in today's computer world, both in the cloud and the cell phone and, you know, things, it isn't, the limiting resource isn't the number of transistors you can fit in the chip."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "It's what, how much power can you dissipate for your application?"}, {"time": 3034, "text": "So by having a reduced instruction set, that's possible to have a simpler hardware, which is more energy efficient."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "And energy efficiency is incredibly important in the cloud."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "When you have tens of thousands of computers in a data center, you want to have the most energy efficient ones there as well."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "And of course, for embedded things running off of batteries, you want those to be energy efficient and the cell phones too."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "So I think it's believed that there's a energy disadvantage of using these more complex instruction set architectures."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "So the other aspect of this is if we look at Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei, all use the ARM architecture, and yet the performance of the systems varies."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "I mean, I don't know whose opinion you take on, but you know, Apple for some reason seems to perform better in terms of these implementation, these architectures."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "So where's the magic and show the picture."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "How's that happen?"}, {"time": 3090, "text": "So what ARM pioneered was a new business model."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "As they said, well, here's our proprietary instruction set, and we'll give you two ways to do it."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "We'll give you one of these implementations written in things like C called Verilog, and you can just use ours."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Well, you have to pay money for that."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Not only you pay, we'll give you their, you know, we'll license you to do that, or you could design your own."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "And so we're talking about numbers like tens of millions of dollars to have the right to design your own, since they, it's the instruction set belongs to them."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "So Apple got one of those, the right to build their own."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "Most of the other people who build like Android phones just get one of the designs from ARM to do it themselves."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "So Apple developed a really good microprocessor design team."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "They, you know, acquired a very good team that had, was building other microprocessors and brought them into the company to build their designs."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "So the instruction sets are the same, the specifications are the same, but their hardware design is much more efficient than I think everybody else's."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "And that's given Apple an advantage in the marketplace in that the iPhones tend to be the faster than most everybody else's phones that are there."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "It'd be nice to be able to jump around and kind of explore different little sides of this, but let me ask one sort of romanticized question."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "What to you is the most beautiful aspect or idea of RISC instruction set?"}, {"time": 3187, "text": "Most beautiful aspect or idea of RISC instruction set or instruction sets or this work that you've done?"}, {"time": 3193, "text": "You know, I'm, you know, I was always attracted to the idea of, you know, small is beautiful, right?"}, {"time": 3200, "text": "Is that the temptation in engineering, it's kind of easy to make things more complicated."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "It's harder to come up with a, it's more difficult, surprisingly, to come up with a simple, elegant solution."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "And I think that there's a bunch of small features of RISC in general that, you know, where you can see this examples of keeping it simpler makes it more elegant."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "And then they provide optional features that could accelerate the performance instructions that if you needed them could be very helpful, but you don't need to have them."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "And that's a new, really a new idea."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "So RISC 5 has right now maybe five optional subsets that you can pull in, but the software runs without them."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "If you just want to build the, just the core 40 instructions, that's fine."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "So this is fantastic educationally is you can explain computers."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "You only have to explain 40 instructions and not thousands of them."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "Also, if you invent some wild and crazy new technology like, you know, biological computing, you'd like a nice, simple instruction set and you can, RISC 5, if you implement those core instructions, you can run, you know, really interesting programs on top of that."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "So this idea of a core set of instructions that the software stack runs on and then optional features that if you turn them on, the compilers were used, but you don't have to, I think is a powerful idea."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "What's happened in the past for the proprietary instruction sets is when they add new instructions, it becomes required piece."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "And so that all microprocessors in the future have to use those instructions."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "So it's kind of like, for a lot of people as they get older, they gain weight, right?"}, {"time": 3333, "text": "That weight and age are correlated."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "And so you can see these instruction sets getting bigger and bigger as they get older."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "So RISC 5, you know, lets you be as slim as you as a teenager."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "And you only have to add these extra features if you're really going to use them rather than you have no choice."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "You have to keep growing with the instruction set."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "I don't know if the analogy holds up, but that's a beautiful notion that there's, it's almost like a nudge towards here's the simple core."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "That's the essential."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "And I think the surprising thing is still if we brought back, you know, the pioneers from the 1950s and showed them the instruction set architectures, they'd understand it."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "They'd say, wow, that doesn't look that different."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "Well, you know, I'm surprised."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "And it's, there's, it may be something, you know, to talk about philosophical things."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "I mean, there may be something powerful about those, you know, 40 or 50 instructions that all you need is these commands like these instructions that we talked about."}, {"time": 3395, "text": "And that is sufficient to build, to bring up on, you know, artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 3402, "text": "And so it's a remarkable, surprising to me that as complicated as it is to build these things, you know, microprocessors where the line widths are are narrower than the wavelength of light, you know, is this amazing technologies at some fundamental level."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "The commands that software executes are really pretty straightforward and haven't changed that much in decades."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "What a surprising outcome."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "So underlying all computation, all Turing machines, all artificial intelligence systems, perhaps might be a very simple instruction set like a RISC5 or it's."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "I mean, that's kind of what I said."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "I was interested to see, I had another more senior faculty colleague and he had written something in Scientific American and, you know, his 25 years in the future and his turned out about when I was a young professor and he said, yep, I checked it."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "And so I was interested to see how that was going to turn out for me."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "And it's pretty held up pretty well, but yeah, so there's, there's probably, there's some, you know, there's, there must be something fundamental about those instructions that we're capable of creating, you know, intelligence from pretty primitive operations and just doing them really fast."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "You kind of mentioned a different, maybe radical computational medium like biological, and there's other ideas."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "So there's a lot of spaces in ASIC, domain specific, and then there could be quantum computers."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "And so we can think of all of those different mediums and types of computation."}, {"time": 3505, "text": "What's the connection between swapping out different hardware systems and the instruction set?"}, {"time": 3513, "text": "Do you see those as disjoint or are they fundamentally coupled?"}, {"time": 3513, "text": "So what's, so kind of, if we go back to the history, you know, when Moore's Law is in full effect and you're getting twice as many transistors every couple of years, you know, kind of the challenge for computer designers is how can we take advantage of that?"}, {"time": 3531, "text": "How can we turn those transistors into better computers faster typically?"}, {"time": 3536, "text": "And so there was an era, I guess in the 80s and 90s where computers were doubling performance every 18 months."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "And if you weren't around then, what would happen is you had your computer and your friend's computer, which was like a year, a year and a half newer, and it was much faster than your computer."}, {"time": 3558, "text": "And he or she could get their work done much faster than your computer because it was newer."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "So people took their computers, perfectly good computers, and threw them away to buy a newer computer because the computer one or two years later was so much faster."}, {"time": 3573, "text": "So that's what the world was like in the 80s and 90s."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "Well, with the slowing down of Moore's Law, that's no longer true, right?"}, {"time": 3579, "text": "Now with, you know, not desk side computers with the laptops, I only get a new desk laptop when it breaks, right?"}, {"time": 3591, "text": "Oh damn, the disk broke or this display broke, I gotta buy a new computer."}, {"time": 3591, "text": "But before you would throw them away because it just, they were just so sluggish compared to the latest computers."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "So that's, you know, that's a huge change of what's gone on."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "So, but since this lasted for decades, kind of programmers and maybe all of society is used to computers getting faster regularly."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "We now believe, those of us who are in computer design, it's called computer architecture, that the path forward is instead is to add accelerators that only work well for certain applications."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "So since Moore's Law is slowing down, we don't think general purpose computers are going to get a lot faster."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "So the Intel processors of the world are not going to, haven't been getting a lot faster."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "They've been barely improving, like a few percent a year."}, {"time": 3651, "text": "It used to be doubling every 18 months and now it's doubling every 20 years."}, {"time": 3651, "text": "So it was just shocking."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "So to be able to deliver on what Moore's Law used to do, we think what's going to happen, what is happening right now is people adding accelerators to their microprocessors that only work well for some domains."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "And by sheer coincidence, at the same time that this is happening, has been this revolution in artificial intelligence called machine learning."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "So with, as I'm sure your other guests have said, you know, AI had these two competing schools of thought is that we could figure out artificial intelligence by just writing the rules top down, or that was wrong."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "You had to look at data and infer what the rules are, the machine learning, and what's happened in the last decade or eight years as machine learning has won."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "And it turns out that machine learning, the hardware you build for machine learning is pretty much multiply."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "The matrix multiply is a key feature for the way machine learning is done."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "So that's a godsend for computer designers."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "We know how to make matrix multiply run really fast."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "So general purpose microprocessors are slowing down."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "We're adding accelerators for machine learning that fundamentally are doing matrix multiplies much more efficiently than general purpose computers have done."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "So we have to come up with a new way to accelerate things."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "The danger of only accelerating one application is how important is that application."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "Turns out machine learning gets used for all kinds of things."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "So serendipitously, we found something to accelerate that's widely applicable."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And we don't even, we're in the middle of this revolution of machine learning."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "We're not sure what the limits of machine learning are."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "So this has been a kind of a godsend."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "If you're going to be able to excel, deliver on improved performance, as long as people are moving their programs to be embracing more machine learning, we know how to give them more performance even as Moore's law is slowing down."}, {"time": 3778, "text": "And counterintuitively, the machine learning mechanism you can say is domain specific, but because it's leveraging data, it's actually could be very broad in terms of in terms of the domains it could be applied in."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "Sort of, it's almost sort of people sometimes talk about the idea of software 2.0."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "We're almost taking another step up in the abstraction layer in designing machine learning systems, because now you're programming in the space of data, in the space of hyperparameters, it's changing fundamentally the nature of programming."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "And so the specialized devices that accelerate the performance, especially neural network based machine learning systems might become the new general."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "So the thing that's interesting point out these are not coral, these are not tied together."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "The enthusiasm about machine learning about creating programs driven from data that we should figure out the answers from data rather than kind of top down, which classically the way most programming is done and the way artificial intelligence used to be done."}, {"time": 3850, "text": "That's a movement that's going on at the same time."}, {"time": 3854, "text": "Coincidentally, and the first word machine learning is machines, right?"}, {"time": 3854, "text": "So that's going to increase the demand for computing, because instead of programmers being smart, writing those those things down,

well, a couple of things that happened, what we did had a modest amount of storage."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "So as redundancy, as people built bigger and bigger storage systems, they've added more redundancy so they could add more failures."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "And the biggest thing that happened in storage is for decades, it was based on things physically spinning called hard disk drives

last, I'd say about decade is increasing fraction of all the computers in the world are using semiconductor for storage, the flash drive, instead of being magnetic, they're optical, well, they're a

frontier."}, {"time": 4841, "text": "So in terms of these peeling off layers of complexity, somewhere between the cognitive layer and the reasoning layer or the computational layer, there's still some stuff to be figured out there."}, {"time": 4854, "text": "And I think that's the final frontier of sort of completing our journey through that matrix."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "And maybe duplicating

little parameters there and there's like six billion parameters and once you've learned them, we kind of understand the layers."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "But that's an oversimplification."}, {"time": 4910, "text": "It's like saying, oh, of course, humans, we understand humans, they're just made out of neurons and layers of cortex and there's a visual area."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "But every human is encoded by a ridiculously small number of genes compared to the complexity of our cognitive apparatus."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "20,000 genes is really not that much out of which a tiny

now just program the primitives and then it learns from that."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "So even though the origins are humble, just like it is for our genetic code, for AI, even though the origins are humble, the result of it being deployed into the world is infinitely complex."}, {"time": 4996, "text": "And yet, it's not yet able to be cognizant of all the other layers of its, you know, it's

can do."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "They don't have algorithms at all that are able to process the content of the video."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "So they try to also infer information based on if

maybe from a more mathematical perspective or can we say something about how much scalability is needed for a world that is big?"}, {"time": 927, "text": "Well, it really depends how many transactions you want, but remember that I think right now yet to go into at least 1000s of transactions per second, even if you look at credit cards, we are going to go from an average of 1600 to peaks of 20,000 or 40,000, something like this."}, {"time": 954, "text": "But remember, it's not only a question of a transaction per se, but the value is that the transaction is actually being shared and visible to everybody and the certainty that that is the case."}, {"time": 968, "text": "I can print on my own printer way more transactions, but nobody has the time to see or to inspect."}, {"time": 975, "text": "That doesn't count."}, {"time": 975, "text": "So you want scalability at this common knowledge level."}, {"time": 982, "text": "I also meant from a perspective of like a complexity analysis."},

scalable?"}, {"time": 1002, "text": "I took a little bit implicitly that the people transacting are actually very different."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "So if there is a two people who can do thousands of transactions per second with each other, this is not so interesting."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "What do we really need is to say there are billions of people at any point in time, you know, thousands and thousands of them want to transact with each other and you want to support to that."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "So Algorand, it solves, so that's the company, the team of cryptographers

achieve scalability in the space of blockchain, in the space of cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 1045, "text": "So scalability, security, remember, and decentralization, right?"}, {"time": 1051, "text":

think about how do we achieve it?"}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Well, to achieve it one at a time is perhaps easy, even security."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "If nobody transacts, nobody loses money."},

what you want is that the vesselager that we discussed before cannot be tampered with."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "So you must think of it as a special link that nobody can erase."}, {"time": 1084,

it's very important to do that."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "And that is the quintessential problem in a blockchain."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And people have thought about it to say, it's not me, it's not you."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "But for instance, in proof of work, what people say is, okay, it's not me, it's not you, you know what it is?"}, {"time": 1198, "text": "We make a very difficult, we invented a cryptographic puzzle, very hard to solve."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "The first one to solve it has the right to add one page to the ledger on behalf of everybody else."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "That now seems okay, because sometimes I solve a puzzle before you do, sometimes you solve before I do, or before somebody else solves it, it's okay."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "And presumably, the effort you put in is somehow correlated with how much trust you should be given to add to the ledger."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Yeah, so somehow you want to make sure that you need to work because you want to prevent, you want to make sure that you get one solution every 10 minutes, say, like in a particular example of Bitcoin, so that it is very rare that two pages are added at the same time."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "Because if I solve a puzzle at the same time you do, it could happen that if it happens once or twice, we can survive it."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "But if it happens every other page is a double page, then which of the two is the real page, it becomes a problem."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "So that's why in Bitcoin, it is important to have a substantial amount of work so that no matter how many people try on Earth to solve a puzzle, you have one solution out of how many people are trying every 10 minutes."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "So that you have, you distance these pages, and you have the time to propagate through the network a solution and the page attached to it."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And therefore, there is one page at a time that is added."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And you say, well, why don't we do it?"}, {"time": 1298, "text": "We have a solution."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "Well, first of all, a page every 10 minutes is not fast enough."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "It's a question of scalability."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "And second of all, to ensure that no matter how many people try, you get one page every 10 minutes,

1439, "text": "So if you look at when people rebelled to centralize power, I don't know, the French revolutions, okay?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "There was a monarch and the nobles."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Were there 21 nobles?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "No, there were thousands of them, but there were millions and millions of disempowered citizens."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "So one is centralized, 21 is also centralized, right?"}, {"time": 1458, "text": "So that's delegated proof of stake."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "Delegated."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "It's kind of like

"text": "Well, it's better than the single monarch, right?"}, {"time": 1469, "text": "There's problems."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "There are problems."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And so we were looking for a different, when thinking about Algorand, for a different approach."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "And so we have an approach that is really, really decentralized because essentially it works as follows."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "You have a bunch of tokens, right?"}, {"time": 1496, "text": "These are the tokens that have equal power."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And you have say 10 billions of tokens distributed to the entire world."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "And the owners, each token has a chance to add the ledger, equal probability to everybody else."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "In fact, actually, if you want, here is how it works."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "So think about by some magic cryptographic process, which is not magic, it's mathematics, but think of it as magic."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "Assume that you select a thousand tokens and so sometimes a random, okay?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And you have a guarantee that the random selected."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "And then the owners of these 1000 tokens somehow agree on the next page, they all sign it, and that is the next page."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So it is clear that nobody has the power but in a while, one of your tokens is selected and you are in charge of this committee to select the next page."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "But this goes around very quickly."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "So, and if you look at this, the equation really is that it's not really centralized."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "And because for agreeing on the same page, it is important that the 1000 tokens that you randomly selected are in honest ends, the majority of them."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "So which, if the majority of the tokens are in honest ends, that is essentially true because if the majority of the tokens are in honest ends, if you select, say 90% of the people are, 90% of the tokens are in honest ends."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "So can you randomly select a thousand, in this thousand you find the 501 tokens in bad ends."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "Very, very improbable."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "So basically, when a large fraction of people are honest, then you can use randomness as a powerful tool to get decentralization."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "So what does honesty mean?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "And now we're into the social side of things, which is how do we know that like the fraction, a large fraction of people or participating parties are honest?"}, {"time": 1643, "text": "That is an excellent question."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So by the way, first of all, we should realize that the same thing is for every other system."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "When you look at proof of work, you rely that the majority of the mining power is in honest ends."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "When you look at delegated proof of stake, you rely that the majority of these 21 people are honest."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "What is the difference?"}, {"time": 1667, "text": "The difference is that in these other systems, you should say the whole economy is secure if the majority of this small piece of economy are honest."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "And that is a big question."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "But instead, in Algorand, in our approach, we say the whole economy is secure if the majority of the economy is honest."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "In other words, who can subvert Algorand is not a majority of a small group, but is a majority of the token holders had to conspire with each other in order to sink the very economy for which they own the majority of."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "That I think it is a bit harder to... Like a self destructive majority, essentially."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "And you're also making me realize that basically every system that we have in the world today assumes that the majority of participants is honest."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "The only difference is the majority of whom."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "And in some cases, the majority of a club and in our case is the majority of the whole system."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "The whole system."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "So through that kind of random sampling, you can achieve decentralization."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "You can achieve..."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So the scalability, I understand."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And then the security that you're referring to, basically the security comes from the fact that the sample selected would likely include honest people."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "So it's very difficult to..."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "So by the way, the security, as you mentioned, you're referring to is basically security against dishonesty, right?"}, {"time": 1771, "text": "Or manipulation or whatever."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "So essentially when what you're going to do is to the following and say, well, Silvio, I understood what you're saying, but somebody has to randomly randomly selected these tokens, then I believe you."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "So then who does this random selection?"}, {"time": 1786, "text": "And in Algorand, we do something a little bit unorthodox."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "Essentially is the token choose themselves at random."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "And you say, if you think about it, that seems to be a terrible idea."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "Because if you want to say, choose yourself at random, and whoever chooses himself is a thousand people committee, you choose the page for the rest of us."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "And because if I'm a bad person, I'm going to select myself over and over again, because I want to be part of the committee every single time."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "But not so fast."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "So what do we do in Algorand?"}, {"time": 1822, "text": "What does it mean that I select myself?"}, {"time": 1822, "text": "That each one of us, in the privacy of our own computer, actually a laptop, what you do is that you execute your own individual lottery."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And think about that you pull a lever of a slot machine, you can only pull the lever once, not until you win, not enough times until you win."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "And when you pull the lever, case one, either you win, in such a case, you have a winning ticket."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "Or you lose, you don't get any winning ticket."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "So if you don't have a winning ticket, you can say anything you want about the next page in the ledger, nobody pays attention."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "But if you ever win a ticket, people say, Oh, wow, this is one of the 1000 winning tickets, we better pay attention to what he or she says."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "And that's how it works."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "And the lottery is a cryptographic lottery, which means that even if I am an entire nation, extremely powerful, with incredible computing powers, I don't have the ability to improve even minimally my probability of one of my token winning the lottery."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "And that's how it happens."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "So everybody pulls the lever, the 1000 random winners say, Oh, here is my winning ticket."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "And here is my opinion up or down about the block."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "These are the ones that count."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "And if you think about it, while this is distributed, because there is, in the case of Algon, there is 10 billion tokens and you selected 1000 of them more distributed than this, you cannot get."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "And then why is this scalable?"}, {"time": 1919, "text": "Because what do you have to do?"}, {"time": 1919, "text": "Okay, you have to do the lottery."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "How long the lottery takes?"}, {"time": 1926, "text": "It takes actually one microsecond."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "Whether you have one token or two tokens or a billion tokens is always one microsecond of computation, which is very fast."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "We don't hit the planet with a microsecond of computation."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "And finally, why is this secure?"}, {"time": 1947, "text": "Because even if I were a very evil and very, very powerful individual, I'm so powerful that I can corrupt anybody I want instantaneously in the world, whom would I want to corrupt?"}, {"time": 1955, "text": "The people in the committee so that I can choose the page of the ledger."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "But I do have a problem."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "I do not know whom I should corrupt."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "Should I corrupt this lady in Shanghai, this other guy in Paris?"}, {"time": 1976, "text": "Because I don't know."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "The winners are random, so I don't know whom I should corrupt."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "But once the winner comes forward and says, here is my winning ticket, and you propagate your winning ticket across the network, together with your opinion about the block, now I know who they are."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "For sure, I can corrupt all 1000 of them given to my incredible powers."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "Whatever they said, they already said, and their winning tickets and their opinions are virally propagated across the network."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "And I do not have the power, no more than the US government or any government has the power, to put back in the

2056, "text": "Okay, so the first thing that Bitcoin got right is to understand that there was the need of a cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "And that, in my opinion, they deserve all the

somebody got it right there."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "So hat off to Bitcoin for that."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "And so what they got right is that it is hard to subvert and change the ledger, to cancel a transaction."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "It's not impossible."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "That is very hard."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "What they did not get right is somehow that it is a great

well use Bitcoin."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "I mean, it's the plan."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "But if you don't look at that for a moment, at least it's a great store of value."}, {"time": 2127,

2174, "text": "Well, that is difficult to do."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "So you're talking to somebody that when I decided to throw my heart in the arena and I decided, first of all, as I said before, I much admire my predecessors."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "I mean, they got it right, a lot of things."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And I really admire for that."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "But I had a choice to make."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "Either I patch something that has holes all over the place or I start from scratch."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "I decided to start from scratch because sometimes it's a better way."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "So what about Ethereum, which looks like proof of stake and a lot of different innovative ideas that kind of improve or seek to improve on some of the flaws of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "Ethereum made another great idea."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "So they figured out that money and payments are important as they are."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "They are only the first level, the first stepping stone."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "The next level are smart contracts."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "And they were at the vision to say the

because mediators are hard to find."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "And in fact, maybe even impossible to find if you live in Thailand and I live in New Zealand, maybe we don't have a common person that we

into financial friction, which is essentially third party."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "So the head of right of the world needed that."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "But again, the scalability is not there."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "And the system of smart contracts in Ethereum is slow and expensive."}, {"time": 2284, "text": "And I believe that is not enough to satisfy the appetite and the need that we have for smart contracts."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "Well, what do you make of just as a small sort of aside in human history, perhaps it's a big one is NFT, the non fungible tokens."},

NFTs are actually great."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "So you are an artist to create a song or it could be a piece of art."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "He has many unique representations of a unique piece where there is an artifact of something dreamed up by you and has unique representations that now you can trade."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "And the important part is that now you have this is not only the NFTs themselves, but the ability to trade them quickly, fast, securely, knowing who owns which rights."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "And that gives a totally new opportunity for content creators to be remunerated for what they do."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "But ultimately, you still have to have that scalability, security and decentralization to make it, you know, to make it work for bigger and bigger applications."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "I still wonder what kind of applications are yet to be like enabled by it because so much."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "The interesting thing about NFTs, you know, if you look outside of art is just like money, you can start playing with different social constructs, is you can start playing with the ideas."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "You can start playing with even like investing."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "Somebody was talking about almost creating an economy out of like creative people or influencers."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "Like if you start a YouTube channel or something like that, you can invest in that person and you can start trading their creations."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "And then almost like create a market out of people's ideas, out of people's creations, out of the people themselves that generate those creations."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "And there's a lot of interesting possibilities of what you can do with that."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "I mean, it seems ridiculous, but you're basically creating a hierarchy of value, maybe artificial in the digital world and are trading that."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "But in so doing are inspiring people to create."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "So maybe as a sort of our economy gets better and better and better where actual work in the physical space becomes less and less in terms of its importance, maybe we'll completely be operating in the digital space where these kinds of economies have more and more power."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "And then you have to have this kind of blockchains to the scalability, security, and decentralization."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "And then decentralization is of course the tricky one because people in power start to get nervous."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "Once in power, you're always nervous that you'll be supplanted by somebody else."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "But this is your job."}, {"time": 2489, "text":

power?"}, {"time": 2502, "text": "Do you think that's something that we can actually achieve given that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, and it's so wonderful to be absolutely powerful?"}, {"time": 2517, "text": "Well, good question."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "So first of all, I believe that by the way, there is a complex question, Lex, and like all the rest of your questions."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "I'm so very sorry."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "I am enjoying it."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "So there are two things."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "First of all, power has been centralized for a variety of reasons."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "When you want to get it, it's easier for somebody, even a single person, to grab power."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "But there is also some kind of a technology, lack thereof, that justified having power."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "Because in a society in which even communication, never mind blockchain, which is common knowledge, but even simple unilateral communication is hard, it is much easier to say, you do as I say."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "So there is a little bit of a technology barrier."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "But I think that now to get to this common knowledge, it is a totally different story."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "Now we have finally the technology for doing this."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "So that is one part."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "But I really believe that by having a distributed system, you have actually a much more stable and durable system."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "Because not only for corruption, but even for things that go astray, and given a long enough time by a strange version of Murphy's law, whatever goes wrong, goes wrong."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "And if the power is diffused, you actually are much more stable."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "If you look at any complex living being, it's distributed."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "I mean, I don't have somebody who

"Help me in the guts."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "We are in a soup that somehow keeps us alive."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "So strange enough, however, when we design systems, we design them centralized."}, {"time": 2639, "text": "We ourselves are distributed beings."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "And when we plan to say, okay, I want to create an architecture, how about I make a pyramid, I put this on the top and the power flows down."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "And so again, it's a little bit perhaps of a technology problem."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "But now the technology is there."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "So that is a big challenge to rethink how we want to organize power in a very large system and distribute a system, in my opinion, much more resilient."}, {"time": 2677,

it, it's so easy to keep the population."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "While instead these other things are much more resilient."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "When the power is distributed, it's going to be lasting for a much longer time."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "And ultimately maybe the human spirit wants that kind of resilience, wants that kind of distribution."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "It's just

colloquial way to say that we cannot somehow pin it down."}, {"time": 4478, "text": "Do you ever, again, just to stay unphilosophical for a bit, for a brief moment, do you ever think about free will

core."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "I mean, that's against the debate, but if it is in fact deterministic at the lowest possible level, at the physics level, how do you make, if it is deterministic, how

a gut reaction to the question."}, {"time": 4525, "text": "And the gut reaction is that it is important that we believe that there exists free will."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "And second of all,

that you have a one way function, they multiply."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "So, okay, so they particularly candidates of one way function, they not only candidates of one way function, they not be one

kind of truth does that allow us to arrive at?"}, {"time": 5117, "text": "So it enlarges the realm of what is provable because in some sense of the classical way of proving things was extremely

proof system is something that allows me to convince you of a true statement, but does not allow me to convince you of a false statement, and that at the end is proof."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "Proof can be beautiful, should be elegant, but at the end is true or false."}, {"time": 5195, "text": "It is possible to prove the truth and it should be impossible or statistically extremely hard to prove something false."}, {"time": 5203, "text": "And if you do this, you can prove way, way more once you understand this."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "And on top of it, we got some insight like in this zero

assertion is correct without having any idea why this is so."}, {"time": 5231, "text": "And so people failed to say, if you want to verify something, you have to have the proof."}, {"time": 5238,

actually, you know, at the beginning, we labored to find the first zero knowledge proof."}, {"time": 5267, "text": "Then we found a second, then we found a third."}, {"time": 5267, "text": "And then a few years later, actually, we proved a theorem which essentially says every theorem, no matter what about, can be explained in a zero knowledge way."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "So it's not a class of theorem, but all theorems."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "And it's a very powerful thing."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "So we were really, for thousands of years, bought this identity between knowledge and

on technology because it makes us more human and make us understand more things than before."}, {"time": 5308, "text": "And I think that's a good thing."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "So this interactive proof process, there's power in games."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "And you've recently gotten into, recently, I'm not sure you can correct me, mechanism design."}, {"time": 5330, "text": "So first of all, maybe you can explain what mechanism design is and the fascinating space of playing with games and designing games."}, {"time": 5343, "text": "Mechanism design is that you want a certain behavior

money."}, {"time": 5366, "text": "The more money, the better, so to speak."}, {"time": 5372, "text": "I'm exaggerating."}, {"time": 5376, "text": "Self interest in whatever way then."}, {"time": 5379,

want."}, {"time": 5396, "text": "That is really the best type of thing."}, {"time": 5396, "text": "And it is a very hard science and art to design these games."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "And it challenges us to actually come up with solution concepts for a way to analyzing the games that need to be broader."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "And I think game theory has developed a bunch of very compelling ways to analyze the game, that if the game has the best property, you can have a pretty good guarantee that it's going to be played in a given way."}, {"time": 5437, "text": "But as it turns out, and not surprisingly, these tools have a range of action like anything else."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "All these so called the technical resolution concept, the way to analyze the game, like dominant strategy equilibrium, if something comes to mind, would be very meaningful."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "But as a limited power, in some sense, the games that can be admit to such a way to be analyzed."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "There's a very specific kind of games and the rules are set, the constraints are set, the utilities are all set."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "So if you want to reason, if there is a way, say, that you can analyze a restricted class of games this way, but most games don't fall into this restricted class, then what do I do?"}, {"time": 5486, "text": "When you need to enlarge a way what a rational player can do."}, {"time": 5486, "text": "So for instance, in my opinion, at least in some of my, I played with this for a few years, and I was doing some exoteric things, I'm sure, in the space that was not exactly mainstream."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "And then I changed my interest in blockchain."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "But what I'm saying for a while I was doing."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "So for instance, to me, is a way in which I design the game, and you don't have the best move for you."}, {"time": 5518, "text": "The best move is the move that is best for you, no matter what the other players are doing."}, {"time": 5524, "text": "Sometimes a game doesn't have that, okay, it's too much to ask."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "But I can design the game such that given the option in front of you say, oh, these are really stupid for me, take them aside."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "But these, these are not stupid."}, {"time": 5541, "text": "So if you design the game so that in any combination of non stupid things that the player can do, I achieve what I want, I'm done."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "I don't care to find the very unique equilibrium."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "I don't give a damn."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "I want to say, well, as long as you don't do stupid things, and nobody else does stupid things, good social things outcome arise, I should be equally happy."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "And so I really believe that this type of analysis is possible and has a bigger radius."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "So it reaches more games, more classes or games."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "And after that, we have to enlarge it again."}, {"time": 5581, "text": "And it's going to be, we're going to have fun because human behavior can be conceptualized in many ways."}, {"time": 5587, "text": "And it's a long game."}, {"time": 5596, "text": "It's a long game."}, {"time": 5596, "text": "Do you have favorite games that you're looking at now?"}, {"time": 5596, "text": "I mean, I suppose your work with blockchain and Algorand is a kind of game that you're basically this mechanism design, design the game such that it's scalable, secure and decentralized, right?"}, {"time": 5606, "text": "And very often you have to say, and you must also design so that the incentives are, and tell you the truth, whatever little I learned from my venture in mechanism design is that incentives are very hard to design because people are very complex creatures."}, {"time": 5631, "text": "And so somehow the way we design Algorand is a totally different way, essentially with no incentives, essentially."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "But technically speaking, there is a notion that is actually believable, right?"}, {"time": 5648, "text": "So that to say people want to maximize their utility."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "Up to a point."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "Let me tell you."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "Assume that if you are honest, you make a hundred bucks."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "But if you are dishonest, no matter how dishonest you are, you can only make a hundred bucks and one cent."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "What are you going to be?"}, {"time": 5670, "text": "I'm saying, you know what?"}, {"time": 5675, "text": "Technically speaking, even that one cent, nobody bothers and say, how much am I going to make by

incentives is actually a good thing because prevent people from reasoning, how else are you going to gain the system?"}, {"time": 5707, "text": "But why can we achieve an algorithm to have no incentives and in Bitcoin instead, you have to pay the miners because they do a tremendous amount of work."}, {"time": 5718, "text": "Because if you have to do a lot of work, then you demand to be paid accordingly."}, {"time": 5726, "text": "Because you, right?"}, {"time": 5726, "text": "But if I'm going to say you have to add two and two equal to four, how much you want me to pay for this?"},

about growing."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "It's about learning from each of these communities and iterating."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "I think it's quite likely there are going to be all sorts of

I should say that I guess there was controversial, I don't know, I didn't look at the details, but I'm guessing there's a bunch of racism and hate speech and all that kind of stuff that emerged on Yik

do better?"}, {"time": 5041, "text": "Yeah, Yik Yak had a lot of problems, content problems, but the content problems go deeper than maybe what the press would reveal."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "There's a lot to say and part of it is parsing exactly what to talk about when it comes to Yik Yak and when you talk about startups, I mean you know this, you know startups, and you look at the postmortem, it's almost never what people think it is."}, {"time": 5067, "text": "And oftentimes these things are somewhat unknowable and the degree to which people seeking confirmation bias to somebody, seeking closure, look to find a singular attribute that caused the failure."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "It feels like the little details often make all the difference."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "Yes, and I think the details are so little that as humans we are not capable of parsing even what they are."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "But I'll tell you my perspective on it, knowing that I am also a human with biases."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "In this particular case, very significant biases."}, {"time": 5108, "text": "So I started building Librex for its own merits."}, {"time": 5108, "text": "At first I wasn't aware of Yik Yak, but as I started to talk to people about this platform I was building, I was made aware of Yik Yak and I built it from day one with a lot of the issues Yik Yak had in mind."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "So as you said, the one difference between Yik Yak is the geographical versus community based aspect."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "Going along with that, one thing I realized by researching social media sites is that the majority of the negative content, the content that's terrible and breaking all the rules is created by really, and the people who are not reformable, so to speak, the people who are not showing the best part of the human experience."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "It's a really small minority, right?"}, {"time": 5154, "text": "I remember, I was listening to the founder of 4ChamMoot talk about this, how like one guy was able to basically destroy like large swaths of his community."}, {"time": 5170, "text": "Yeah, that's part of what makes it exciting for that minority is how much power they can have."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "So if you're predisposed to think in this way, it's exciting that you can walk into, like I mentioned the party before, you have a party of a lot of positive people and it feels, especially if you don't have much power in this world, it feels exceptionally empowering to just, to destroy like the lives of many."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "And if you think this way, it's a problem."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "But I'm hopeful that you're right, that in most cases it's going to be a minority of people."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "And that's what the research has showed."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "And one really powerful thing is that we can really actively control who comes in and out of our community based on the.edu verification."}, {"time": 5224, "text": "And we can also control who's not in our community because we have that lever where each account is associated with a.edu."}, {"time": 5230, "text": "So that's the first point I would point out there."}, {"time": 5236, "text": "Second point is controlled expansion, meaning that we have community moderation."}, {"time": 5242, "text": "We have this panel that allows the moderators to see all of the highly downloaded content, all of the reported content, all the flagged content and look through it and decide what they like and what's appropriate and what's not appropriate."}, {"time": 5254, "text": "And we have, we ping every moderator when there's a report."}, {"time": 5260, "text": "So things are taken down pretty quickly."},

than that, frankly."}, {"time": 5285, "text": "And I think that shows in the people who self select to be on that app, to be on Librex and to be on Yik Yak, respectively."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "The last thing I'll say is Yik Yak was very few characters."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "It was a Twitter esque platform."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "And that doesn't allow for a tremendous amount of nuance."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "It doesn't allow for a tremendous amount of conversation."}, {"time": 5302, "text": "Librex is much more long form."}, {"time": 5308, "text": "And so the kind of posts that you'll get on Librex can span pages."}, {"time": 5308, "text": "What people are starting to realize is that they can reach a lot more people at a lot more pertinent of a time a lot more quickly by posting their thoughts on Librex than if they went to their school newspaper."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "And I think the school newspapers might be a little worried about that."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "But more importantly, we're connecting people in this way where long form communication with nuance that takes into account everything that's happening in the community temporally is really available at Librex and not really communicable in 240 or 480 or whatever the number of characters the yaks were bound to."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "And I could talk about the history of Yik Yak if you want me to go further."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "They started, I think they were at 12 schools."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "And then spring break hit."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "People told their friends, look at this app."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "A thousand schools signed up and had active communities."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "They had a problem on their hands."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "And then the high schools come on board."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "I think a lot of the things you said ring true to me, but especially the vision one, which I do think having a vision in the leadership, having a mission makes all the difference in the world."}, {"time": 5382, "text": "That's both for the engineers that are building, like the team that's building the app, the moderation and users because they kind of, the mission carries itself through the behavior of the people on the social network."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "As a small tangent, let me ask you something about Parler, but it's less about Parler, more about AWS."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "So AWS removed Parler from his platform, you know, for whatever reasons, it doesn't really matter."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "But the fact that AWS would do this was really, really bothered me personally, because I saw AWS as the computing infrastructure and I always thought that part could not put a finger on its scale."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "And I don't know what your thoughts are."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "Like, were you bothered by Parler being removed from AWS?"}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And how does that affect how you think about the computing infrastructure on which Librex is based?"}, {"time": 5445, "text": "I was bothered not so much by Parler specifically being taken out of AWS, but more the fact that something that's like a highway, something that people rely on, that people build on top of, that people assume is going to be somewhat position agnostic, like a road that people drive on, is becoming ideologically sort of discriminatory."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "And of course, mind you, Amazon can do what it wants."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "It's a private company and I support the rights of private companies."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "I just, on an ethical and sort of a deep moral level, I wonder, like, at what point should a company sort of be agnostic in that regard and let developers build on top of their infrastructure?"}, {"time": 5487, "text": "And where does that responsibility hold?"}, {"time": 5496, "text": "Yes, it makes you hope that there's going to be, from a capitalistic sense, competitors to AWS would say, like, we're not going to put our finger on the scale."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "I mean, on the highway is a good sort of example."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "It's like if a privately owned highway said, you know, we're no longer going to allow, we're only going to allow electric vehicles."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "And a bunch of people in this world would be like, yes, because electric is good for the environment."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "And, you know, I think that's a good example."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "You know, yes, but then you have to consider the, like, the slippery slope nature of it, but also like the negative impact on the lives of many others and what that means for innovation and for, like, competition, again, in a capitalistic sense."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "So, there's some nature, there's some level to this hierarchy of our existence that we should not allow to manipulate what's built on top of it."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "It should be truly infrastructure."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "And it feels like compute is storage and compute is that layer."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "Like, it shouldn't be messed with."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "I haven't seen anybody really complain about it, like, in terms of government."}, {"time": 5573, "text": "And I'm not even sure government is the right mechanism through policy and regulation to step in."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "Because again, they do a messy job of fixing things."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "But I do hope there's competitors to AWS to make AWS then step up."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "Because I do think, you know, I'm a fan of AWS, except this."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "Good service."}, {"time": 5593, "text": "It's a good service until this."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "Until, yeah, until they rip out the rug."}, {"time": 5600, "text": "And the point is, it's not that necessarily their decision was a bad one with Parler, in particular."}, {"time": 5606, "text": "It's that, like, the slippery slope nature of it, but also the, it takes the good actors that are creating amazing products and makes them more fearful."}, {"time": 5618, "text": "And when you're more fearful, it's the same reason that anonymity is a tool that you don't create the best thing you could possibly create."}, {"time":

it a little bit."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "I talked to a guy named Ronald Sullivan, who's a faculty at Harvard, a law professor."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "He was on the legal defense team."},

figures because he believes like that's the way you test that we believe in the rule of law."}, {"time": 5660, "text": "But he was, there's a big protest in Harvard to get him, basically censor him and to get him to no longer be faculty dean, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "And it was by a minority of students, but there's a huge blowback, obviously in the public, but also inside Harvard, like that's not okay."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "He stands for the very principles at the founding of Harvard and at the principles of the founding of this country and the law and so on."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "But the basic argument is that it was about safe spaces, that it's unsafe to have somebody who is basically supporting Harvey Weinstein, right?"}, {"time": 5705, "text": "What do you think about this whole idea of safe spaces on college campuses?"}, {"time": 5705, "text": "Because it feels like the mission of Librex is pushing back against the idea of safe spaces."},

problem becomes when the institution starts encouraging or backing safe spaces because what are people being safe from?"}, {"time": 5728, "text": "And oftentimes, it seems like there's this idea that the harm that's being attempted to be mitigated is the harm of confronting opinions you disagree with, opinions you might find repugnant."}, {"time": 5752, "text": "And if this is conflated with a need for safety, then that's where the idea of liberal arts education sort of dies."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "Of course, it's complicated and we still want to have safe intellectual environments."},

Librex is really exciting, is it's pushing those difficult conversations."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "And I'd love to see, ultimately, there does seem to be an asymmetry of power that results in the concept of safe spaces and hate speech being redefined in the slippery slope kind of way where it means basically anything you want it to mean."}, {"time": 5799, "text": "And it basically is used to silence people, to silence people."}, {"time": 5804, "text": "They're like good, thoughtful experts."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "I mean, you don't have to slip that far to see why that's a problem."},

a really fascinating, strong community there."}, {"time": 6716, "text": "But speaking of like bringing out the best of human nature, it's a community that's currently struggling a little bit in terms

lot of love in their hearts and minds, but they just kind of naturally, naturally, because the world has been like institutions and the centralized powers have been sort of mocking and fighting them

a creative person."}, {"time": 6918, "text": "I mean, chess doesn't really reward creativity as much as a lot of other things, especially entrepreneurial pursuits, which I think is part of the reason

901, "text": "And the first time I realized YouTube is not forever is when a lot of the Joe Rogan experience library was pulled from YouTube as part of the Spotify deal."}, {"time": 913, "text": "And it made me realize we need to, it's like the realization that fiat money is centralized is realizing that, you know, this is not forever and you might want to come up with schemes to distribute it, to decentralize the control of it in a way that audio for podcasts is just an RSS feed."}, {"time": 935, "text": "And I think one of the kind of philosophical things that I hope to achieve is kind of decouple the concept of public goods, which are incredibly important and are the lifeblood of modern civilization from the idea that there is or can be one central organization that represents the public and like perfectly understands and can impose their idea of what is the good, right?"}, {"time": 958, "text": "Like it's, when people talk about public goods, it just often comes with this baggage of, you know, either centralization or conformism."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And I think like it doesn't have to, right?"}, {"time": 969, "text": "Like often the most important public goods are the ones that are created by, you know, the crazy individualists that disagree with everyone else."}, {"time": 977, "text": "So trying to make this kind of synthesis where you combine the values of decentralization and the values of open source, but you're not naive about it."}, {"time": 989, "text": "And like, you know, you realize that for these things to be produced, there needs to be a way for it to be sustainable."}, {"time": 996, "text": "There needs to be some way of supporting people who are working these projects."}, {"time": 999, "text": "But at the same time, you want to

grand experiment in crypto is about."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "And like, we are doing things in different kinds of things for this, right?"}, {"time": 1022, "text": "Like there's the Gitcoin Grants quadratic funding in the Ethereum ecosystem."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "There's obviously these dog coins that just happens, I guess, accidentally."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "There's other projects that, like for example, you know, Uniswap has their Uniswap DAO that just has a huge amount of funding."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "And like, we haven't seen yet how that's going to be deployed, but, you know, it could be potentially deployed to do lots of really good and amazing things."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "Do you see Ethereum as essentially a mechanism to fight for social causes?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "I definitely see Ethereum as being a mechanism to fight for definitely some specific things that are social causes."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "Like just, you know, the fact of creating an open financial system that anyone can participate in no matter where they are in the world, that's a social cause."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "Just, you know, giving people the ability to organize and create projects, even if it's five people in five different countries."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "I think that kind of inclusiveness, I think that's a social cause and it's a core crypto value."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "But then at the same time, like the other important and if part of the magic of Ethereum that you have to balance that against is that it is also this open platform where ultimately, you know, the things that are on Ethereum is just the things that the community makes of it."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Well, you kind of briefly opened the door, so let's go there."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "When it comes to government regulation of crypto, what's the best case scenario?"}, {"time": 1126, "text": "What's the worst case scenario?"}, {"time": 1128, "text": "In terms of, you know, as you've kind of mentioned, Ethereum challenges the power centers of the world and how do you see the interplay between governments and this new technology that resists centralized power?"}, {"time": 1146, "text": "Best case and worst case."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "Like, you know, the concept of corporate taxes, for example, right?"}, {"time": 1248, "text": "And, you know, there are going to be things that people are unhappy about."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "There's always gonna be the people that, you know, wants to surveil everyone but if the kind of effect of crypto from just empowering people is greater than that and greater than that in a way that people can just easily see, then, you know, that would be a good scenario, right?"}, {"time": 1269, "text": "And we'll just become kind of incorporated and accepted the same way as happened with the internet."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "But in the worst case scenario would, of course, be just like people suddenly, you know, flipping and going into moral panic mode and just, you know, oh my God, like this technology is used by like, you know, insert bad group over the day."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And then I don't think governments have the ability to ban crypto to the extent of just complete like preventing blockchains from existing but they definitely have the ability to really marginalize it, right?"}, {"time": 1302, "text": "Like if you just ban all exchanges, like in ban all links from the Fiat ecosystem to crypto and, you know, you ban all kind of mainstream employers from accepting or paying in cryptocurrency, then like you can successfully like turn it into a, like, you know, a fairly kind of niche countercultural thing that has much less impact than otherwise would."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "So it's somewhere between the good scenario and the bad scenario."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "I'm obviously hoping for the good."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "Well, that's interesting also the tension between governments and companies."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "Like if you have a bunch of billionaires or a bunch of companies like Tesla investing in Bitcoin and

little tangent that you brought up, this is almost an outdated idea, but it's still with us, which is cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activity, for drugs, for crime, and so on."}, {"time": 1382,

possibility, but like at the same time, I think if you look at, you know, the world as a whole and like the way all the other technological trends are going, like, you know, in person surveillance is just going up every year, right?"}, {"time": 1410, "text": "Like if you commit a crime in, you know, meat space, it's getting harder and harder to get away with it."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "So like, you know, if you wants to do something, and this is something that's just like happening as a result of, you know, just better technology and information transparency, like a lot of it's hard to

you know, oh my God, the criminals are committing crimes with impunity and we can't see anything, like that just seems unlikely."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "But, you know, on the other hand, like the world where there just, you know, is no privacy, for example, or the world where there just like is no ability to kind of act outside of the confines of, you know, mainstream institutions, like that's something that's more realistic and that seems like something that could lead to a lot of kind of a lot of scary things, right?"}, {"time": 1480, "text": "And like, even from a government's point of view, right?"}, {"time": 1482, "text": "Like I think governments over the last few years, a lot of them, they're very worried about sovereignty."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "You know, they're worried about like, if their country is economies and, you know, social environments are just completely dependent on basically foreign tech companies controlled by foreign governments, like, you know, governments are not on team government, right?"}, {"time": 1501, "text": "It's like, you know, the Indian government is on, you know, team India, then the Russian government is on team Russia and so forth, right?"}, {"time": 1508, "text": "So like, you know, they don't want the US to be able to like have this big backdoor into everything."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "So, I mean, I do think that a balance is needed, but at the same time, I do think, I guess I definitely like worry more about the possibility that just like without things to like crypto kind of acting outside of institutions becomes too impossible."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "And I don't even necessarily mean outside of governments, even just, you know, outside of corporations, like becomes too impossible."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "And there's just like terrible things that come as a result."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "I mean, if things going in the other direction, like it obviously is a risk, but no, at the same time, I think in the longterm, like a crypto can potentially even like offer defenses as much as attacks against that sort of thing."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Yeah, many throughout history, many of the most destructive things came from centralized institutions versus sort of from the people operating in the shadows."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "And, you know, I've been talking to a bunch of psychedelics folks that people doing researches like Rick Doblin in Johns Hopkins, there's a lot of exciting research on psychedelics."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "And one thing you could say about operating at the edge of legality, it could actually accelerate the adoption of particular things like whether it's marijuana or psychedelics, they can help people out."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "It's almost accelerates the policy."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "It forces the policy to catch up to where the people stand."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "So there's a positive way of doing things that are in the gray area of legality and creating a market that allows people to in a safe way be able to participate in this gray area of legality."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "The other thing to keep in mind, of course, is that the set of like the kinds of things that just like payment processors as companies try to restrict you from is much larger than the set of things that's illegal, right?"}, {"time": 1628, "text": "Like part of that is because they wanna be super conservative and like the more layers you have, the more they're like conservative because they're scared of what the layer below them will do to them."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "Sometimes they have their own moral opinions of various kinds."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "They go after lots of people, right?"}, {"time": 1644, "text": "Like they make life really hard for sex workers, for example, psychedelics, as you mentioned, there's a lot of activity, even including stuff that is totally legal that just there's this like shadow like PayPal credit card governments or whatever you wanna call it."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "And that makes it just hard to participate in this stuff."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "So I think like reducing the number of intermediaries is definitely normally a good thing."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "All right, let's talk about one of the most exciting technologies like technically, philosophically, like socially, financially in every way, which is Ethereum 2.0."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "There's a million things to talk about, but step one is probably a good thing to do, which is can you briefly summarize your vision how Ethereum 2.0 will make Ethereum more scalable, secure and sustainable?"}, {"time": 1703, "text": "Sure, so I think recently we've actually been kind of deemphasizing the ETH 2.0 branding, I guess."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "So the reason behind that was that originally we envisioned something more like a big grand event where all the good things would happen at the same time and it would be a new blockchain, and it would be a new protocol and people would have to take a lot of effort to migrate over."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "But later we've slowly changed the roadmap over to something that's much more incremental, right?"}, {"time": 1733, "text": "So proof of stake happens kind of over time and then sharding gets added over time and all of these features get added over time."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "And so the experience for just a regular Ethereum user still feels very seamless, right?"}, {"time": 1744, "text": "It's like maybe a little bit more complex than the hard forks that we've already done from a user's point of view, but not by that much, right?"}, {"time": 1753, "text": "So the big two things that are happening, right?"}, {"time": 1757, "text": "These are what used to be considered the two flagship features of ETH 2.0 and now they're just the flagship features of the next devolution of Ethereum, as proof of stake and sharding."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "So proof of stake is a consensus algorithm."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "It's a, or a consensus mechanism, I should say."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "The difference is that like an algorithm is something that you run by yourself."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "A mechanism is like interactions between people and it could even include incentives and all of that."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "So a consensus mechanism, so by which nodes in the network agree on which blocks came in, which transactions came in, what order, make sure that once a block gets accepted, it can't get reverted and all of these things that we expect from a blockchain."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "So existing blockchains, including Bitcoin, including the Ethereum of today, and including a lot of them, they use proof of work, right?"}, {"time": 1813, "text": "So the reason why we need proof of anything is because they serve this function that I call an economic civil resistance."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "So that's obviously a big word for, especially if you've never heard of symbols before, but like the basic idea is, right, that you have a network and you have lots of computers that agree on like which blocks to accept."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "And sometimes you get two blocks that get published at the same time and you just have to agree on an order."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "So there has to be some kind of voting game."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "But then the question is, well, in this voting game, who gets to vote, who gets to participate?"}, {"time": 1849, "text": "Now, you can't say one person, one vote, right?"}, {"time": 1852, "text": "The reason why you cannot say one person, one vote is because you need some kind of like authority or some kind of mechanism to say who the humans are."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "And if you don't have that, then a bad guy could just come in with a virtual machine or with a computer that has on it 10 billion virtual machines that have 10 billion virtual nodes."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "And then just like say, look, I'm 99% of the network, I should control everything."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "So to prevent this, what proof of work and proof of stake both do is they basically say, well, the weight of your vote, like how much influence your votes have in the consensus is proportional to like what quantity of economic resources you bring in."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "So in the case of proof of work, you prove what economic resources you have because your economic resources are computers and you prove that you have them by just running them 24 seven using these hash algorithms, right?"}, {"time": 1902, "text": "So this does solve the problem, right?"}, {"time": 1905, "text": "Because in order to attack the network, you have to come in with more computers and more money invested into computers and electricity than the rest of the network puts together."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "And that's extremely expensive."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "In proof of stake, instead of relying on people with computers that are just constantly cranking out hashes 24 seven, as you're like a unit of economic resources, you just use like holdings of coins inside the system, right?"}, {"time": 1931, "text": "So all of these blockchains, they have some kind of coin in them."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "Bitcoin has Bitcoin, Ethereum has ether, they all have a coin."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So why not just use that as the economic resource that you're using to measure participation."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "So that's like the core distinction between proof of work and proof of stake."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "I like proof of stake and I've liked proof of stake for many years, basically because like it just requires much less ongoing resource consumption, right?"}, {"time": 1961, "text": "Like with proof of work, you have to like actually go and buy these physical computers and these days, they have specialized hardware, ASICs, application specific integrated circuits."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "You have to go produce them and you have to go buy them."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "And unless you have millions of dollars, you have to buy them from one of these other people who creates them and those other people often end up taking a huge cut of the profits themselves."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "And then you have to plug them in, you have to just burn all of this electricity that's just running 24 seven."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "So it consumes a huge amount of energy, right?"}, {"time": 1994, "text": "And not just energy, it also, just to create the hardware, right?"}, {"time": 1999, "text": "Like people focus a lot on energy, but like actually about half the cost of proof of work mining is the cost of the hardware."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "So hardware is a very big deal too."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "And you need this really big and powerful, very specialized hardware, another kind that fills up these big warehouses."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "So proof of stake, you don't really need that much electricity, you just need just a little bit to run a regular computer."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "You can run proof of stake validators on computers that you already have."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "So it's just much less resource intensive."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "And like, this is good for a few reasons, right?"}, {"time": 2033, "text": "Like one is, you know, the kind of environmental rationale that, you know, you're not breaking the environment."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "The second is that you're not taking away electricity and like other resources from other people."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "I mean, like right now there's, I think just today I saw a story about like Iran wanting to shut down some Bitcoin mining because it was just grabbing up so much electricity that it was, you know, outbidding the nearby towns and they just didn't have enough."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "And then there was like Chia, the one that's doing proof of like hard disk mining basically is just like grabbing up so many hard disks, there's a shortage, right?"}, {"time": 2068, "text": "So that's the second reason."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "And then the third more selfish reason is that because participating in consensus does not require so much energy expenditure, you don't need to pay people as much to participate, right?"}, {"time": 2080, "text": "So like Bitcoin and Ethereum, they both issue somewhere around 4% of the total supply every year right now to miners."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "So Ethereum is about 4.7 million ether and the current supply is about 115 million."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "But with proof of stake, like we expect it'll be somewhere between 500,000 and one million per year."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "So that means, you know, the supply doesn't have to increase so quickly."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "One of the pros that the people sort of argue for the proof of work is that it is secure because it's much more difficult to sort of, as you've highlighted, it's difficult to participate."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "Is there, what are your thoughts about the security of the proof of stake mechanism?"}, {"time": 2128, "text": "Is there ways to make it secure?"}, {"time": 2130, "text": "So I think proof of stake is very secure because in order to be able to attack the system, you needs to have like basically as much stake as the rest of the network, right?"}, {"time": 2141, "text": "So that means like right now, for example, we have 5 million eth staking."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "So you have to come up with 5 million eth and then join the network."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And then the other, so 5 million eth is a lot, right?"}, {"time": 2151, "text": "It's like, how much is it now?"}, {"time": 2153, "text": "Like $15 billion."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "So that's actually more than I believe the cost of attacking the Bitcoin network."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "And then the second thing is that recovering from attacks is much easier in proof of stake than in proof of work, right?"}, {"time": 2165, "text": "Because in proof of stake, you have, like, first of all, we have for many kinds of attacks that you do against this network, we have this concept of like automatic slashing, right?"}, {"time": 2174, "text": "Which basically means that in order to like revert a finalized block, so if there's one block that's like accepted by the network and you try to convince the network to kind of revert that block and accept a different block, in order to make that kind of attack, you basically have to have your validator, like a big portion of your validator assigned to conflicting messages."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "And this is something that like once these messages are on the network, like you can go and prove, like, look, these people did it."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "And so we have this feature in the protocol called slashing where you basically take all these people who provably misbehaved and you burn their coins, right?"}, {"time": 2208, "text": "And you don't burn anyone else's coins."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "Now, there are other cases, like for example, if instead of reverting blocks, the attack just tries to censor everyone, right?"}, {"time": 2217, "text": "Then everyone who got censored would just like basically create the minority chain and then the community would basically have to do a soft fork, right?"}, {"time": 2226, "text": "They would just have to say like, look, this chain is clearly attacking us, this chain is the one not attacking us, and so we're gonna join this chain."}, {"time": 2232, "text": "And then what happens is that on that new chain, the attackers also lose a lot of coins, right?"}, {"time": 2237, "text": "So the difference between proof of stake and proof of work is that in a proof of stake system, like you can identify specific participants and you can say, you know, these, and like this isn't like, you know, a human going in and saying, I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you, this is like automated, right?"}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So the slashing process is automated."}, {"time": 2257, "text": "So that's a painful process where the coins are burned."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "It is painful, yes."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "I think, I mean, the one big unknown, of course, is like if an attack actually happens and like if an attack happens that requires the community to actually choose one of these minority forks, then like what would the community actually successfully coordinating on this look like, right?"}, {"time": 2279, "text": "Like it's like, you know, we can talk about it and we can, you know, write like science fiction novels about it, but like until it's happened, you don't really know the details of like what it looks like and how difficult it is."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "What are the channels of communication for the community?"}, {"time": 2293, "text": "If you can enlighten me a little bit, like what, you know, in many ways in the political realm, Twitter is often used as a way to kind of have these emerging phenomena of large groups of people coming to a consensus about a particular idea."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "And then there's battle for consensus."}, {"time": 2310, "text": "What's in the Ethereum community, how do people, what are the sources of natural language based communication that have an emergent belief structure that you would say?"}, {"time": 2323, "text": "Or is it all through money?"}, {"time": 2325, "text": "Is it all through trading that the communication happens?"}, {"time": 2328, "text": "There's definitely talking as well."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "I mean, like we have to agree on protocol changes somehow, right, like there's Twitter, there's Reddit, there's GitHub, there's all of the various Ethereum forums, Ethereum magicians, Ethereum research."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "There's just in person communication."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "Then there's just kind of like the hidden web of everyone talking to everyone on Telegram or Signal."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "So it's like some of everything, right?"}, {"time": 2354, "text": "But I think like the thing to emphasize around like, can you actually come to consensus on, you know, whether or not to fork the chain because the attacker is censoring everyone, just for example, is like everyone who's running a node is going to see almost the same thing, right?"}, {"time": 2370, "text": "Like they're gonna be off by a few seconds and like maybe they'll be off by a few minutes, they'll disagree by a few minutes."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "But like if it's a serious attack, you know, people are gonna know, right?"}, {"time": 2378, "text": "It's not like one of those things where, you know, oh, we're trying to agree on like, I don't know, did Epstein kill himself or like some random political fact where like in reality, no one knows a single thing about what's actually going on and they're all speculating."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "Like it is much more visible, right?"}, {"time": 2394, "text": "So we do have that, but you know, at the same time, I'm happy to admit that like, these are fairly untested mechanisms, but like at the same time, they're also untested mechanisms in Proof of Work, right?"}, {"time": 2405, "text": "And like in Proof of Work, it's even harder because in Proof of Work, you don't have the ability to like identify and say, like, you know, I'm going to these miners attacked and so we're not gonna let these miners in, these miners did not attack, so we're gonna keep them in."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "Like you have to pretty much, you know, either take out none of the miners or you do a fork that changes the Proof of Work algorithm which takes out all of the miners, right?"}, {"time": 2428, "text": "So the economics of like recovering from attacks in Proof of Work, at least to me, actually do seem like more unfavorable, but you know, I'm sure the Proof of Work people you talk to will give a very different and contradictory opinions and that's totally fine and amazing."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "Some people describe MEV, minor extractable value, as an existential risk to Ethereum."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "What is MEV?"}, {"time": 2452, "text": "How important is it to solve MEV?"}, {"time": 2455, "text": "If it's important, what ideas do you have?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Sure, how about after this one, we'll also talk about sharding because it's amazing and it's part of you too."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "Yes, we'll return back to sharding which is, we'll return to the big picture of the scaling problem as you mentioned."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "I love this conversation, you know, depth first search instead of breadth first."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "So basically, okay, MEV, minor extractable value, it is not different in Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, right, so like if you want to call it, you know, block proposer extractable value, like it sounds a lot sexy, but you know, we can call it BPEV instead of MEV, who cares?"}, {"time": 2487, "text": "So this is a problem in both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake?"}, {"time": 2490, "text": "Yes, so the basic idea is that if you have the ability to choose which transactions go into a block and in what order, then you have the ability to like take advantage of that position for economic gain and for economic gain in a lot more ways than just collecting transaction fees, right?"}, {"time": 2510, "text": "Like for example, there's decentralized exchanges on chain like Uniswap and like let's say the price of ETH versus USDC was 2,700 the previous block, but then there was a bit of a market drop and now it's 2,680 where you can go on Uniswap and you can just like gobble up the entire part of, you know, the automated order book that's like between 2,700 and 2,680, right?"}, {"time": 2533, "text": "And that's, and then at the same time, you like run a bot and you know, you buy some ETH back at 2,680 and you've just like made about $10 of profit, right?"}, {"time": 2541, "text": "So, or well, $10 times, you know, whatever the depth is."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "Right, so there's lots of little things like that."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "There's also things that involve like front running other people's transactions."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "Then you get to make a little bit of money that way."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "Exactly, so there's a lot of these different like arbitrage, front running, back running, these different tricks that allow block proposers to."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "To get some percentage on top, like overhead."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "Because if you're just collecting transaction fees, there aren't really economies of scale, there aren't really benefits to centralizing, right?"}, {"time": 2629, "text": "Because it's a very simple formula, you just like grab up the transactions that pay you the most."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "But with MEV, there's all these sophisticated algorithms and if you have lots of money, then you can hire really smart people to make amazing algorithms and then you can use the other half of your money to get a lot of mining power or a lot of stake and you get a lot of opportunities to use your even better algorithms."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "So there's this risk that like as a result of this, mining is basically, or even validating proof of stake is going to centralize."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "So I think the ecosystem is best replied to this sort of risk and it's the direction where projects like Flashbots are going already is if you can't eliminate the centralization, then you try to firewall it, right?"}, {"time": 2675, "text": "And the way that you firewall it is you basically say, we're going to try to deliberately create a marketplace where people can just do the complicated work of creating what are called bundles, like bundles of transactions that are very profitable, right?"}, {"time": 2691, "text": "And then at the other side of the market, you just have like block proposes reminders that are just dumb notes."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "And they go and ask the what are called searchers, the bundle creators, and they just ask like, hey, like how much can you give me if I put in your bundle?"}, {"time": 2705, "text": "And then they just take the highest offer, right?"}, {"time": 2707, "text": "So you sort of separate out the task and you have the easy part and then you have the hard part and you have like this special class of actor called a searcher that does the hard part and then the easy part, the people doing the easy part, which is just miners and validators, they kind of just talk to all the different people doing the searching and they just accept the highest bidder."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "So this is also just like an interesting example of like economic design philosophy, right?"}, {"time": 2735, "text": "Like sometimes you can't just like make centralization go away, sometimes it's inevitable, but no, at least you can try to kind of contain it, you can direct it or you can even sort of firewall it away from core consensus, the parts that really do need to be decentralized."}, {"time": 2751, "text": "But you don't see it as an existential risk, it's just a bit of a problem that it has to be constantly dealt with."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "It's a risk, like there's obviously a risk that it's a very severe problem and that even this flash bots approach has some fatal flaw or whatever."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "But we're definitely approaching it with the mindset of this is a problem and like, yes, we do have to do some work to solve it, but we're doing it and so far it's being solved."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "Okay, let's talk about the other really, really fascinating part of the future of Ethereum."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Let's not call it Ethereum 2.0, but the future of Ethereum that also may require a hard fork, I don't know, you can correct me on this, is well, broadly ideas for scaling."}, {"time": 2800, "text": "And more specifically sort of layer two or layer one and two intersection ideas of how to achieve scaling."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "And at the core of that is the idea of sharding."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "So first, what is sharding?"}, {"time": 2815, "text": "Okay, so there's two major paradigms for scaling blockchains, right?"}, {"time": 2821, "text": "As you said, layer one and layer two."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And layer one basically means make the blockchain itself capable of processing more transactions by having some mechanism by which it can do that despite the fact that there's a limit to the capacity of each participant in the blockchain."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "And then layer two says, well, we're gonna keep the blockchain as is, but we're gonna create clever protocols that sit on top of the blockchain that still use the blockchain and then still kind of inherit things like the security guarantees of a blockchain."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "But at the same time, a lot of things are done off chain."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "And so you get more scalability that way."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "So in Ethereum, the most popular paradigm for layer two is rollups and the most popular paradigm for layer one is sharding."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "So one way to achieve layer one scaling is to increase the block size."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "Block size wars, quote, unquote."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "And you actually tweeted something about, people are saying that Vitalik changed his mind about, he went from being a small blocker to a big to small."}, {"time": 2885, "text": "But you said, I've been a medium blocker all along."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "So maybe you can also comment on where, on the very basic aspect before we even get to sharding of where you stand on this block size debate."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "So the way that I think about the trade off is I think about it as a trade off between making it easy to write to the blockchain and making it easy to read the blockchain."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So when I say read, I just mean, have a node and actually verify it and make sure that it's correct and all of those things."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "And then by write, I mean send transactions."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So I think for decentralization, it's important for both of these tasks to be accessible."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "And I think that they're about equally importance."}, {"time": 2923, "text": "If you have a chain that's too expensive to read, then everyone will just trust a few people to read for them."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "And then those people can change the rules without anyone else's permission."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "But if on the other hand, it becomes really expensive to write, then everyone will move on to basically second layer systems that are incredibly centralized."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "And that takes away from decentralization and self sovereignty as well."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "So this has been my viewpoints pretty much the whole time, right?"}, {"time": 2949, "text": "It's like, you need this balance and going in one direction or the other direction is very unhealthy."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "In the Bitcoin case, basically what happened was that Bitcoin originally, at the very beginning, it didn't really have a block size."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "It just had an accidental block size of 32 meg, or block size limit of 32 megabytes because that just happens to be the limit of the peer to peer messages."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "But then..."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "Interesting, I didn't even know that part."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "Yeah, but then Satoshi back in 2010 was worried that even 32 megabyte blocks would be too hard to process."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "So he put the limit down to one megabyte."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "And I think the..."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "I put, you mean sneaked in there."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "Yeah, just like made an update to the Bitcoin software that made blocks bigger than one, I think it's a million bytes invalid."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "And I think the impression that most people had at the time is that this is just a temporary safety measure."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "And over time, as we become more confident in the software, that limit would be raised somewhat."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "But then when the actual usage of the blockchain started going up, and then it started going up first to 100 kilobytes per block, then to 250 kilobytes per block, then to 500 kilobytes per block, there started coming out of the woodworks this opinion that no, that limit should just not be increased."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "And then there are all of these attempts at compromising."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "First, there was a proposal for 20 megabyte blocks."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "Then there was the 248 proposal, which is a bit ironic because the 248 proposal started off being a small block negotiating position."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "But then when the big block people came back and said, hey, aren't we gonna do this?"}, {"time": 3053, "text": "They're like, oh, no, no, no, we don't want them."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "We don't want the block size increases anymore."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "So there were these two different positions, the small blockers."}, {"time": 3062, "text": "I think they valued one megabyte blocks for two reasons."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "One is that they just really, really believe in the importance of being able to read the chain."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "But two is that a lot of them really believe in maintaining this norm of never hard forking, right?"}, {"time": 3078, "text": "So the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork is basically that in a soft fork, any block that's valid under the new rules was still valid under the old rules."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "So if you have a client that verifies according to the old rules, then you'll still be able to accept the chain that follows the new rules."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "Whereas with a hard fork, you have to update your code in order to stay on the chain."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "And look, they have this belief that soft forks are kind of either less coercive than hard forks, which by the way, I completely disagree with."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "I actually think soft forks are more coercive because basically they force everyone who disagrees to sort of go along by default."}, {"time": 3119, "text": "But, or they have this opinion that there's like, it's more difficult to abuse soft forks to do really mean things like, or that like completely violate people's expectations, like increasing the supply, which is like, I think there is some truth to that."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "So because of these reasons, they just say we're only going to do soft forks and we want to just not do any hard forks."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "And they eventually discovered this idea called segregated witness that allows for like a very tiny block size increase to like the equivalent of about two megabytes with a soft fork."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "It's this really like weird and devious trick."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "Like basically what they do is they take the signatures of transactions and then they put them outside of the block."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "And then they add an extra rule that says that like every, for a block to be valid, the block has to come with a separate, like basically extension block that contains all of the transaction signatures, right?"}, {"time": 3178, "text": "So when you measure it, according to the old rules, like, hey, it adds up to less than a million, but actually there's this extension block that the old protocol doesn't even know about."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "It's a hack that seemed to work to in a small way extend the size of the block size."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "So the small block side was like happy with these very low levels of block size."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "And then the big block side wanted to expand to, at the very least go to four megabytes, then maybe go maybe eight, 20."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "There's disagreements within there as well."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "I definitely was favoring the big side the whole way through, as you can probably tell, but."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "Even though, so the argument against the big is that it makes things more centralized."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "Yes, because fewer people can run a note that verifies the chain."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "And also because any of these things would require a hard fork and hard forks are inherently risky."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "Do you think there's truth to that?"}, {"time": 3231, "text": "I'm pro hard fork."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "I think hard forks are actually like in a political economic sense, they're better than soft forks."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "Well, let's, okay, okay."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "I think that's a beautiful principle as stated that soft forks may be more coercive than hard forks."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "This is not just about cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "This is about politics and life."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "So you're okay with hard forks."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "In fact, you think hard forks is the right way to make changes because then everybody's forced to make a decision."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "Do you accept this change or not as opposed to ideas being sneaked in behind the door and that decision is forced on you?"}, {"time": 3276, "text": "Okay, so, but hard forks, some people say, this is when they talk about sort of Ethereum, is there's some aspect to a hard fork where you're trying to upgrade a, what is it, airplane while it's flying."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "I think soft forks are also upgrading an airplane while it's flying."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "But it's a smaller upgrades."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "That's, there's some truth to that."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "Like there's definitely a bit more risk of like a split as a result of a hard fork than as a result of a soft fork."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "And the split is highly undesirable, right?"}, {"time": 3310, "text": "Well, it depends."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "Like if it's a split because of a bug, then that's horrible."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "If it's a split as a result of political differences, then I think like a split is better than, you know, one side being forced to basically just like suck it up and accept the majority position even if it really hates it."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "Well, there's also political connections throughout the history of the United States."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "It's like sometimes groups of people that strongly disagree with each other should be forced to work it out."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "Even if they, even when a split seems like an easy thing in the short term."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "And I think like, well, for blockchains in particular, the costs of people being able to like peacefully do their, go off and do their own thing are much lower, right?"}, {"time": 3352, "text": "Like, you know, okay, if you have a country and you have two groups, then like often enough, like fighting out the new rules requires, you know, a civil war requires everyone to move and so forth."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "But no, on a blockchain, like, you know, the costs are lower and so."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "So if you were to look at the way things worked out with the block size wars and there was a split, what is it, Bitcoin Cash and all this?"}, {"time": 3375, "text": "In Bitcoin."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "Would you, like you looking, putting on your historian hat, you mentioned offline you like Dan Carlin."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "So if Dan Carlin wanted to do an episode on the block size wars, do you think it could've turned out better or do you, are you okay with the way it turned out?"}, {"time": 3397, "text": "I'm definitely disappointed with what happens with the block, with the big block side."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "I think the source of my disappointment is that like, one of the things that you notice when just looking at like this political disagreements generally, especially when you have environments where, you know, they're authoritarian or like single party dominated and then there's some opposition party and the opposition often has like very legitimate grievances."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "But at the same time, the thing you notice is that often enough the opposition just sucks, right?"}, {"time": 3427, "text": "Like it just doesn't have, you know, political capacity."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "It doesn't have like the ability to come up with policy because it's entire culture is like designed around resisting much more than it's designed around like, you know, actually debating serious policy trade offs."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "And I worry or I guess not so much worry because it's already happened."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "I unfortunately think that Bitcoin Cash ended up being a victim of this, right?"}, {"time": 3454, "text": "Like first, no, there was a split with Bitcoin Cash."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "And then of course, Craig Wright came in and you know, Craig Wright was this basically scammer who just keeps on pretending that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "Hey, Craig Wright's legal team, do you hear me?"}, {"time": 3469, "text": "Yes, I still think your client is a scammer."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "So sue me."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "This is definitely gonna be death for a search because I gotta ask you about Craig."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "I guess these people have been contacting me and I'm trying to figure out like, what is up with this human being?"}, {"time": 3482, "text": "So for people who don't know, there's somebody who is, let's start this Satoshi Nakamoto, who is the creator of Bitcoin, who's anonymous."}, {"time": 3491, "text": "And actually most really big people in the cryptocurrency space do not like yourself and others do not dare claim that they are even for fun Satoshi Nakamoto."}, {"time": 3505, "text": "In fact, if Satoshi Nakamoto is still alive and is like, if say you were Satoshi Nakamoto, it seems like the thing he would do is probably or she is trying to remain anonymous."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "On the flip side of that, there's a guy named Craig Wright who continually keeps claiming that he is in fact Satoshi Nakamoto and keeps suing a lot of people."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "So on him, if we could just linger on him, what do you make of this character?"}, {"time": 3532, "text": "What are we supposed to make of this character?"}, {"time": 3534, "text": "Should he be ignored?"}, {"time": 3536, "text": "Is there any possible truth to his claims?"}, {"time": 3541, "text": "The analogy that's at the top of my head will get a bit political, but that's fine."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "You've had Michael Malice."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "So I guess I view Craig Wright as being kind of like a Donald Trump figure in that he's not very intellectual, but I think he gets a big audience because he says things that play to the resentments that people have and he says things that people wants to hear."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "Like in the wake of this block size war, the big blockers did feel very disenchanted."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "They felt that Bitcoin always had this vision that we were supposed to just keep increasing the block size and Bitcoin is peer to peer cash."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "It says so in the white paper."}, {"time": 3580, "text": "And then this elitist clique of core devs just came in and said, no, no, no, we're gonna impose this totally different vision."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "And if you ever want your scalability, you'll have to wait for us to create this totally unproven fancy technology called the lightning network that works under completely different principles."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "And they were very angry at this."}, {"time": 3598, "text": "And I mean, I think a lot of that anger is justified, but at the same time, when people are in that mental state, like it's very easy for you to just kind of like latch on."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "And if you find someone who expresses anger at the same things that you're angry at, and also like it seems like someone who's strong and seems like someone who might be good to rally around, it's very easy to just like get behind that."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "But that extra part about it where he's Satoshi Nakamura, I don't understand why that's necessary."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "I think that's, he could have done it without that, but that just, it's a marketing strategy."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "Like it sort of gives him more salience."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "Like there's other big block personalities, right?"}, {"time": 3640, "text": "Well, what's the difference with Craig Wright?"}, {"time": 3643, "text": "He's not just a big block personality, he's potentially Satoshi."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "And he did say all the big block things, right?"}, {"time": 3652, "text": "Like he talked about how, oh, the concept of a fee market is fundamentally like economically wrong and it should be a free market and you should be able to have blocks as big as you want."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "So like he repeated all the talking points."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "And so a lot of people were kind of sucked into that, right?"}, {"time": 3667, "text": "And so he unfortunately was able to basically dominate a big part of the Bitcoin cash community for a long time."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "And then eventually, of course, more and more people started to catch on."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "He would just say technical things that are completely wrong, right?"}, {"time": 3684, "text": "Like one example of this that I remember is that he mixed up the concept of 256 bits and two to the power of 256 bits, right?"}, {"time": 3696, "text": "So the difference is, it's like the difference between 80 and the concept of 80 digit numbers, right?"}, {"time": 3702, "text": "And because of this, like he made this arguments that said that Bitcoin's elliptic curve is friendly to cryptographic pairings."}, {"time": 3712, "text": "Like you don't have to understand what that is, but if you want to know, I have articles on both at Vitalik.ca."}, {"time": 3718, "text": "But basically he made this like technical argument that really hedged on this point."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "And then when people pressed him on, it was like, yes, but no, no, like what?"}, {"time": 3726, "text": "Look, exactly, the height is like what?"}, {"time": 3729, "text": "Two to the 256 bits."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "That's a very tiny amount of information."}, {"time": 3734, "text": "No, no, no, no, two to the 256 bits is more than the amount of information in the universe."}, {"time": 3739, "text": "And like he equivocated and kind of like preyed on people's inability to understand that mathematical nuance."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "And I called him out."}, {"time": 3747, "text": "And eventually I even called him out in person at this conference in Seoul."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "Like I just stood up and asked, hey, conference organizer, why are you letting this fraud speak at this conference?"}, {"time": 3759, "text": "And I remember even some big blockers at the time getting angry at me."}, {"time": 3764, "text": "But eventually they did get rid of him."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "And then Craig, well, basically Craig Wright was forced to split off because the rest of the community refused to accept some network change that he wanted."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "And so then there was the BCH and BSP."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "And then in the Bitcoin Cash community, there was this drama of, are they going to add a developer fund where they redirect 12 and a half percent of the revenue from the miners to the devs?"}, {"time": 3788, "text": "And according to the libertarian not aggression principle, is this technically theft?"}, {"time": 3792, "text": "Like his understanding of the technical depths of cryptocurrency was lacking in a way that Satoshi Nakamoto certainly would not."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "But the point is that even after Craig Wright got expunged, the Bitcoin Cash community kept having these disagreements."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "And now after this development funds dispute, there was a further split between Bitcoin Cash and ABC."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "So the branch continues to extend."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "So in that way, it's disappointing to see those kinds of splitting that was never resolved."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "I would have definitely like wanted to see more of a kind of like the principled coin with like tries to be Bitcoin, but follows consistent big block values."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "But I know maybe I should just like stop expecting projects that I have no involvement in to care at all about what my values are."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "And like maybe Ethereum just like is."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "I think you have a powerful voice and you can inspire other projects to live up to their best possible selves."}, {"time": 3859, "text": "Okay, so that's the layer one approach."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "The other layer one within Ethereum is the idea of sharding."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "What the heck is sharding?"}, {"time": 3872, "text": "What does the future of sharding look like?"}, {"time": 3873, "text": "Right, so to summarize that big long tangent that we just went into."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "It's a beautiful tangent by the way."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "It's the basic tangent."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "And I think like crypto is just one of the most underrated aspects of crypto is I think how you can like analyze the sociology and the politics and the anthropology."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "And I'm sure Dan Carlin would have fun exploring the space at some point."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "But like the core trade off, right?"}, {"time": 3896, "text": "Is that if you scale blockchains the dumb way just by increasing the parameters, then eventually you just make it harder and harder to participate as a node and you end up with a system where there's like 20 computers running the whole thing."}, {"time": 3907, "text": "And it's just very centralized."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "So sharding basically says, well, instead of just increasing the parameters, what we're going to do is we're going to change the blockchain architecture in such a way that each individual node in the blockchain only needs to store a small portion of the data and only needs to process a small portion of the transactions."}, {"time": 3928, "text": "So you can think about it as being like inspired by BitTorrent, right?"}, {"time": 3931, "text": "Like on BitTorrent, there's no such thing as a BitTorrent full node that has every movie, right?"}, {"time": 3935, "text": "You know, the work is like split up among a huge number of computers and like that makes sense."}, {"time": 3940, "text": "That's, you know, the only sane way to scale a system like that."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "And if they actually tried making a version of BitTorrent that required full nodes that store every movie, then, you know, it would have like zero censorship resistance and it would just like, you know, be dead in an instant."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "So the challenge with taking that model and applying it to blockchains, right?"}, {"time": 3961, "text": "Is that blockchains aren't just about like spreading data around, they're about agreeing on exactly what data was spread around and ensuring that everything that you agree on actually is correct."}, {"time": 3972, "text": "And so you have this paradox where let's say you want to have a system that supports 10,000 transactions a second, but each computer in the network can only personally verify a hundred transactions a second."}, {"time": 3985, "text": "So how can each computer get a guarantee about the other 9,900 without actually going and verifying them themselves?"}, {"time": 3993, "text": "And it turns out that there are some, like a bundle of different tricks that can do that, right?"}, {"time": 4000, "text": "So like one of them is just random sampling."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "So the idea behind random sampling is like, let's say for simplicity, this is a proof of stake chain and you have 10,000 validators, validators are like, you know, the stakers and like for simplicity, we'll assume they all have the same number of coins, right?"}, {"time": 4017, "text": "If someone has more coins, we'll just kind of split them up and pretend they're 10 stakers."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "Then you do like some random shuffling and you basically say, these random hundred validators are assigned to validate this block."}, {"time": 4030, "text": "These random hundred validators are assigned to validate this block."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "And so each individual computer only gets assigned to validate like a small piece, but then the way that the information about like what's valid gets passed around, right?"}, {"time": 4045, "text": "Is that when these hundred participants validate a block, they all sign a message basically saying like, yes, we agree that this block is valid."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "And then like they combine that signature into one and then they broadcast that signature."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "And then everyone else, instead of verifying the blocks directly, just verifies that signature, right?"}, {"time": 4064, "text": "And so if I see the signature, I'm not directly convinced that that block is valid, but what I am convinced of is that out of this committee of this randomly selected group of a hundred validators, let's say at least 70 of them agree that this block is valid."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "And so if I trust that the majority of these participants are all honest, then because it's all randomly selected, the attacker can't just like force themselves into one committee."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "And so the attacker is gonna be evenly spread out too."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "And so if the entire set of validators is mostly honest, every committee is gonna be mostly honest."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "And so like bad blocks are not gonna go through, right?"}, {"time": 4102, "text": "So that's like one simple form of sharding."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "There was also other more clever things that you can do."}, {"time": 4106, "text": "So for example, there's this concept of a ZK snarks, right?"}, {"time": 4109, "text": "I'll call it as your knowledge proofs."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "So this is the idea that you can make a cryptographic proof that says, I verified or I ran some complex computation on this piece of data and I got this answer."}, {"time": 4123, "text": "And so if you make these kinds of proofs, then like if you see a ZK snark that says some block is valid, then you're convinced that that block is valid."}, {"time": 4131, "text": "And even if everyone in that committee is evil, like they have no way of making a valid proof for a bad block, right?"}, {"time": 4139, "text": "Like, because the proof itself, like it is a proof that you did the computation where that proof is much easier to verify than just running the computation yourself."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "And there's once again, super awesome mathematical or cryptographic magic behind making ZK snarks work."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "But it gives you a little bit of a leg up over the 51% honest assumption."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "So it's a little hack that improves upon the random sampling thing."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "And like, there's other hacks, right?"}, {"time": 4168, "text": "Like there is another hack called data availability sampling that allows you to make sure that the data in the blocks was actually published."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "But like, basically, like if you stack a couple of these tricks on top of each other, you can create a system where like I, as an individual participant can be convinced that everything that's going on in this distributed blockchain thing is correct without actually personally checking more than like a percent of it."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "So that's sharding."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "That's sharding."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "But the, as I understand, maybe correct me on this, is in the space of Ethereum, the sharding happens on some fixed number."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "Like the split is on some fixed number."}, {"time": 4207, "text": "I think it's 64 is the currently sort of proposed number."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "So how does that help scaling?"}, {"time": 4215, "text": "Is it just the fixed constant scaling by 64?"}, {"time": 4219, "text": "And is that a way to achieve those crazy, the crazy amount of scaling that seems to be required to use cryptocurrency for purchasing?"}, {"time": 4228, "text": "So doing like competing with credit cards and Visa and so on."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "So first, I think like the 64 can be hard forked up over time."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "So we've set it so that like there's theoretically space in the data structure for 1024 shards, it's just that 64 of them are turned on."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "There are challenges with having more shards because like you have to have logic that just like checks and manages all of those shards."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "And if there's too many of them, then that becomes too expensive."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "But even still, you can improve quite a bit."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "And then the other thing that we're doing is if what we're getting maximum scalability by combining rollups and sharding."}, {"time": 4265, "text": "So this might be a good time to talk about rollups."}, {"time": 4267, "text": "What are rollups?"}, {"time": 4269, "text": "Now we're moving into layer two ideas."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "So the idea behind a rollup is basically that, so instead of just publishing transactions directly on chain and having everyone do all of the checking of those transactions, what you do is you create a system where users send their transactions to some central party called an aggregator."}, {"time": 4297, "text": "And like, well, theoretically, you can have a system where like the aggregator switches around or where anyone can be an aggregator."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "So it's still like permissionless to send things."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "Then what the aggregator does is they strip out all of the transaction data that like is not relevant to helping people update the state."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "So when I say the state, this is a very important kind of technical term for blockchains."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "I mean, like account balances, code, like things that are like memory, internal memory of smart contracts, like basically everything the blockchain actually has to keep track of and remember, right?"}, {"time": 4334, "text": "So you just put in, you take all these transactions, strip out all the data that's not relevant to telling people how to update the state."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "And then you take the data that's needed to update the state, and then you like really compress it, right?"}, {"time": 4349, "text": "So like, for example, if we say, I, Vitalik, have an account that's 0xAB58, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's 20 bytes."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "Well, instead we can say, well, I have an account that is number 1874224 in the tree."}, {"time": 4364, "text": "And that goes down from 20 bytes to just like an index and a position, which is three bytes, right?"}, {"time": 4369, "text": "So you use all sorts of these fancy compression tricks, and you basically just, instead of publishing all these transactions, you publish this like tiny compressed blob, right?"}, {"time": 4378, "text": "So the amount of data that goes on chain goes down by maybe about a factor of 10, right?"}, {"time": 4382, "text": "And then the second thing is that you don't do the computation on chain, instead you do the computation off chain, and there's one of two ways to do this, right?"}, {"time": 4391, "text": "One is called a ZK rollup, which is you just provide a ZK SNARK that basically says, hey, look, I did this computation, and I have this proof that here's, you know, some hash of the result and it's correct."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "And then you stick it on chain, and everyone verifies this one proof instead of verifying all these transactions."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "And then the other approach is called an optimistic rollup, which is basically made of the scheme where, like, first someone says like, hey, this is what I think the result of applying these transactions is."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "And then someone else can say, I disagree, the result is different."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "And only if two people disagree, do you actually just like publish all of the data and run that whole block on chain."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "So if there's disagreements, then you just like run everything on chain and whoever was wrong, like loses a lot of money, right?"}, {"time": 4438, "text": "So like disagreements are very rare and they're very expensive."}, {"time": 4441, "text": "And then a ZK rollup, you don't even rely on this like challenging game at all, you just rely on a proof."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "So the core principle is basically that instead of lots of transactions and everyone verifies every transaction, it is you take the transactions, you strip them down and compress them as much as possible, then stick that on the blockchain."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "You do need to stick something on the blockchain just so that everyone else can like keep up to date with the state so they know what all the contracts are, what all the balances are and all of this, but it's a very small amount of data."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "And then you use one of these other off chain games, could be this optimistic game, could be a ZK snark to just prove that somebody out there did the computation and the result is correct, right?"}, {"time": 4484, "text": "So you're pushing like 90% of the work off chain and then, well, 90% of the data and 99% of the computation off chain, and then you still have 10% of the data and 1% of the computation on chain."}, {"time": 4496, "text": "And so your scalability goes up by a factor of about 100."}, {"time": 4499, "text": "So these systems are already alive for some applications, right?"}, {"time": 4505, "text": "So there's something called loopering, which is just a ZK roll up for payments, right?"}, {"time": 4510, "text": "So you can have assets inside of the loopering system and you can go around and transfer them, and you get like much lower transaction fees, right?"}, {"time": 4524, "text": "Like instead of $5, you'd have to pay like less than 5 cents."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "But the only problem is that this only supports a couple of applications right now, like making one that supports anything that you can do on Ethereum just takes a bit more work, but that's being done as well, right?"}, {"time": 4540, "text": "So like within a few months, I'm expecting fully Ethereum capable roll ups to be available as well."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "So roll ups, just summarizing, do most of the work off chain, put only a little bit on chain, factor of 100 scaling, sharding, another factor of 100 scaling, 100 times 100 factor of 10,000, hundreds of thousands of transactions a second, and like, you know, there's your scalability."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "Okay, so you achieve scalability, you can do a large number of transactions very quickly and the cost of doing those transactions are much lower."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "You wrote that in the long term ZK roll ups are going to win in terms of layer two technology."}, {"time": 4578, "text": "Specifically you wrote, in general, my own view is that in the short term, optimistic roll ups, as you were saying, are likely to win out of general purpose EVM computation and ZK roll ups are likely to win out for simple payments, exchange and other application specific use cases, just as you were saying."}, {"time": 4599, "text": "But in the medium to long term, ZK roll ups will win out in all use cases as ZK SNARK technology improves."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "Why do you think ZK roll ups are going to win the big picture battle over layer two technologies?"}, {"time": 4615, "text": "So I think ZK roll ups, like once you accept that the technology works are just like conceptually simpler and they have nicer properties."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "The reason is that they do not have this concept of a challenge game, right?"}, {"time": 4628, "text": "Like, as I mentioned in an optimistic roll up, the way that you ensure that the results are correct is that you let one person submit and like they just submit with no proof."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "They just say, here's what I think the result is."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "And then if someone else disagrees, they make their own submission."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "And then if you have two disagreeing submissions, then you actually publish it on Chase."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "And then you see who's right."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "But for this to work, like you need to actually wait for someone to disagree, right?"}, {"time": 4652, "text": "So like, for example, if I have an asset inside of an optimistic roll up and I wants to withdraw it, then I actually have to wait a week to withdraw it."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "Because like, if the block that contains my withdrawal turned out to be invalid, then there needs to be space for someone to disagree with it, right?"}, {"time": 4667, "text": "Whereas with a ZK roll up, like you don't need time for disagreeing because you just have a proof, right?"}, {"time": 4671, "text": "As soon as a block is submitted, there's a proof and you know it's correct."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "So if disagreements, especially in the longterm are sparse, then you don't want to do the optimistic, the game theoretic thing, you wanna do the ZK stock."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "Right, the ZK stuff is just, like you can win a ZK roll up, you can withdraw immediately."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "You don't have to like worry about the economics of proving as much, right?"}, {"time": 4695, "text": "There's just like fewer issues."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "The reason why ZK roll ups are not winning everywhere today is because ZK stocks are still a crazy new technology, right, like this is something that 10 years ago, it existed only in theory and there was none in practice."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "Then, eight years ago, people were just getting excited about it in Bitcoin conferences for the first time."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "Like four years, starting four years ago or three and a half years ago even, that was the first time you were able to make any ZK stock based anything on Ethereum."}, {"time": 4726, "text": "And then people started making them and ZK technology has only really become efficient enough to do a lot of things within the past maybe one and a half years."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "So it's new technology, it's crazy technology, it's admittedly scary technology."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "If you wanna learn more, I also have an article about this on Vitality.ca."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "It's actually really, really good."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "You're, most of your writing, it goes, it's technical but it's accessible."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "I highly, highly recommend to check out Vitality's articles and blogs, whatever you call them on the website."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "It's brilliant summary of the work."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "Actually, Ethereum documentation period is really good."}, {"time": 4765, "text": "I think that's somewhat crowdsourced."}, {"time": 4768, "text": "That documentation is really, really accessible and brilliant."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "But let me ask about sort of other approaches to layer two, like side chains."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "So the one popular one is Polygon."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "What are your thoughts about Polygon, which is a layer two network?"}, {"time": 4788, "text": "Is it positive?"}, {"time": 4789, "text": "Is it negative for Ethereum?"}, {"time": 4792, "text": "Does it have a future?"}, {"time": 4793, "text": "Which is its own chain, but it's using Ethereum."}, {"time": 4798, "text": "It's like based on Ethereum essentially."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "Or maybe you can describe what it is."}, {"time": 4802, "text": "So I think there's a really big and important difference in security models between rollups and side chains, which is basically that rollups inherit from the security of Ethereum, right?"}, {"time": 4813, "text": "So if I have coins inside of Loopring or Optimism or Arbitrum or ZK Sync, then even if everyone else in the world who is participating in these ecosystems hates me and wants to steal my money, I can still personally make sure that no matter what happens, I get my money out."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "It might be a bit expensive for me to get my money out and I have to do transactions on the main chain, but I'll be able to do it."}, {"time": 4839, "text": "Whereas in Polygon, which is a side chain, and so instead of being secured by Ethereum, it's also in part secured by its own proof of stake consensus with its own token."}, {"time": 4850, "text": "So if 70% of the whole, or even 51% of the holders of Polygon tokens wanted to take my money in Polygon, they can, right?"}, {"time": 4859, "text": "So that's the, and like, to be fair, like there aren't even, like the supply, I don't think is even that widely distributed, right?"}, {"time": 4868, "text": "So like potentially you could, this idea of 51% of the token holders coming together and stealing everything, like it's not impossible, right?"}, {"time": 4879, "text": "Where does the scaling of Polygon come from?"}, {"time": 4881, "text": "Like why is it able to process much more transactions than the Ethereum main chain?"}, {"time": 4888, "text": "What's the idea there?"}, {"time": 4889, "text": "I think in part, like I imagine, I'm not sure exactly what its capacity level is, but like I imagine it has a higher capacity because it's a bit more willing to take centralization trade offs."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "And then another thing is that like, if the Ethereum ecosystem, like even if it did not do that, right?"}, {"time": 4906, "text": "If you think about an Ethereum ecosystem hypothetically scaling with side chains, then you would have a hundred copies of Polygon and they would each have their own tokens, they would each have their own chains."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "And so even if each one of those chains was only as scalable as Ethereum, you could still, like the total sum of them would still be a hundred times more than Ethereum."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "The thing that I want to say in Polygon's favor just to be very fair to them, like I really, you know, I definitely really, you know, respect the work that they're doing."}, {"time": 4936, "text": "So, you know, start with a bit with that word of not criticism caution, right?"}, {"time": 4943, "text": "Like it's that they made this kind of deliberate trade off for very pragmatic reasons, which is that the Ethereum ecosystem needs to scale now."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "And there are applications that want to do something now."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "And, you know, if there aren't Ethereum friendly options for them, then like, they're not going to just wait peacefully and do nothing for 12 months."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "And they're going to go to, you know, either Binance Smart Chain or, you know, one of some other system or potentially something that just has totally no alignment with Ethereum values whatsoever."}, {"time": 4975, "text": "But whereas, you know, with Polygon, like the best thing that you can say in Polygon's favor and against optimism is that, you know, optimism is not live and Polygon is live, right?"}, {"time": 4985, "text": "Like it just takes more work to create a system that has these extra rollups, security features."}, {"time": 4992, "text": "And so Polygon just said, we're going to be the system that makes the pragmatic trade off."}, {"time": 4996, "text": "We're going to go, you know, functionality first, and then, you know, we can talk about adding back the security later."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "So I've talked to them and like, in principle, I think they're very, you know, open to the idea of like adding more security and like becoming more, becoming a rollup or at least, you know, adding a Polygon chain that's a rollup at some point in the future, which is definitely something I think they, you know, absolutely should follow through on."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "But like the fact that like they exist now, and so, you know, applications can kind of bootstrap now on a chain that, you know, even though its security isn't perfect, at least it exists and people can go use it."}, {"time": 5035, "text": "And then over time, you know, the chain matures as the applications mature."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "Like, you know, it's, I think a very reasonable strategy and I'm definitely really happy that they're part of the ecosystem."}, {"time": 5048, "text": "Yeah, it's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 5049, "text": "The history of cryptocurrency has this tension of really good ideas that are hard to implement."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "So they take longer to implement and ideas that are not as good, but are faster to implement."}, {"time": 5063, "text": "This is like the story of like, you have like JavaScript that basically took over the world because it was quick to implement within 10 days."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "And then like later kept fixing itself."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "Sort of from an engineering perspective, I'm more and more becoming comfortable and accepting the fact that our whole world will run a technology that's not as good as it could have been."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "Just because the crappy solution is faster to implement and it sticks."}, {"time": 5095, "text": "I think the compromise that we've been taking within Ethereum is like when we have to take the crappy solution, we look for crappy solutions that are forward compatible with becoming good over time."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "When you build the quick and dirty thing, you would still already have ideas in your head about what the more complete thing with all the security features added on would look like."}, {"time": 5118, "text": "Even if it requires a hard fork?"}, {"time": 5123, "text": "For example, with sharding, I think it's likely that the first version of sharding that comes out is not going to have zkstarks and data availability sampling, for example."}, {"time": 5132, "text": "But we know what these technologies are."}, {"time": 5134, "text": "We feel like we have wrapped our heads around them."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "And so we know how to build a system where we can put all the pieces in place so that it becomes very easy to bolt those components on in the future."}, {"time": 5146, "text": "So if you do things that way, then at the beginning, you can have your system that has the functionality, but say has less security or less sustainability or less of something else."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "But then over time, it's designed in such a way that it has this easy on ramp to adding those things."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "And if you don't think explicitly about being future compatible, then you do often end up with a quick and dirty solution that backs you into a corner."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And then there are definitely cases where I think the Ethereum ecosystem has suffered from that."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "And we have had to expand pretty significant effort on, for example, removing features that we didn't realize that we actually can't sustain."}, {"time": 5189, "text": "Like one big example is just increasing the gas costs."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "So like making some operations more expensive because they should be expensive because they actually take a lot of time in the process."}, {"time": 5200, "text": "So that's making something more expensive, kind of like taking some functionality away."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "So if you can like be cognizant of where you're likely going into the future, and if you don't know, like even be cognizant of both the most likely paths that you'll take in the future and coming, like thinking about your roadmap and coming up with a roadmap where you know that like if you wants to do either of those things, then you have a clean path toward it."}, {"time": 5226, "text": "That's probably the best kind of practical way to get the best of both worlds that we have."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "Okay, let's talk about this wonderful process of merging."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "Okay, so there's the main net, which is the Ethereum 1.0 chain, or the, what should we say, the chain that uses proof of work as a consensus mechanism."}, {"time": 5250, "text": "And then there's, what is it called?"}, {"time": 5253, "text": "The beacon chain that uses the proof of stake mechanism."}, {"time": 5260, "text": "And I believe the beacon has been deployed successfully, is working, so that was in December of 2020."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "There's a bunch of questions around that that's fascinating as well, but I think the most fascinating question is about merging those two."}, {"time": 5278, "text": "When do the two chains, one that's proof of work, one that's proof of stake, merge?"}, {"time": 5286, "text": "And what are the most difficult parts of this process?"}, {"time": 5290, "text": "Right, so as you've said, right, the way that we have set up this proof of stake transition is that at first, the proof of stake chain just launches on its own, right?"}, {"time": 5299, "text": "And this is the thing that happened in December."}, {"time": 5302, "text": "And the proof of stake chain has been running for close to six months now."}, {"time": 5308, "text": "I mean, by the time people watch this, it might actually be six months."}, {"time": 5313, "text": "But it isn't actually coming to consensus on anything except for itself, right?"}, {"time": 5317, "text": "So the idea behind that is to just give the proof of stake chain time to mature, time for people to build the ecosystem around it, time to make sure that there aren't any bugs, and just like prove to the community that no proof of stake actually is real, and a full transition is realistic, because the thing that you're transitioning to already exists and already works."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "And then at some point in the future, you have this event called the merge, where you basically take the activity that's being done inside of the proof of work chain, and you actually move it over into the proof of stake chain, so you get rid of the proof of work side completely."}, {"time": 5353, "text": "So the way that the merge will work is, it's definitely gone through a few different iterations."}, {"time": 5362, "text": "Like the earlier versions of this actually required more work for users and more work for clients."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "It was much more like, oh, there's this new chain, there's this old chain, and then everyone has to migrate from the old chain to the new chain, and then at some point we'll forget about the old chain."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "The new version is designed to be much more seamless for users, right?"}, {"time": 5383, "text": "So basically what actually happens is that the old chain basically becomes embedded inside the new chain, right?"}, {"time": 5390, "text": "So starting from the merge transition block, every proof of stake chain block is going to contain a block of the, what we consider now to be, what we consider to be the Ethereum chain today, but we'll call it the execution chain."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "And then at the same time, to create one of these blocks, you're not going to need proof of work anymore, right?"}, {"time": 5410, "text": "So basically at the same time, you would both get rid of the proof of work requirements for one of these blocks to be valid, but instead you require these blocks to be embedded inside of the proof of stake blocks, right?"}, {"time": 5421, "text": "So you basically have like a chain inside a chain."}, {"time": 5424, "text": "And this is, from an architecture perspective, you might think it's a little bit suboptimal, but it actually has some nice properties and makes it easier to kind of think about the consensus and think about what we call the execution layer, like transactions and contracts kind of separately and upgrade them separately."}, {"time": 5442, "text": "And it also just means that the upgrade process is extremely seamless, right?"}, {"time": 5447, "text": "Because from the point of view of a client that's following the chain, you basically have to update nothing, right?"}, {"time": 5453, "text": "You're still following the same chain and follows the same rules, except instead of checking proof of work, you'll switch to checking that these blocks are embedded inside of blocks of the proof of stake chain."}, {"time": 5463, "text": "So there'll be this merge block that will mark this transition."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "And over time, I guess the new chain will contain the full record of all the transactions that's ever happened on the previous chain, on the old chain."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "So maybe I'm asking a dumb question here, but in this process, is the new chain going to have all the information of the past transactions?"}, {"time": 5489, "text": "The new chain is not going to hold information from what happened in the Ethereum chain before the merge, right, so Ethereum clients that people are going to use around the time of the merge and soon after the merge, they're probably just going to sync and check the proof of work chain up to the merge, and then they're gonna check the proof of stake chain."}, {"time": 5512, "text": "But at some point in the future, I think people will just stop bothering checking the proof of work before the merge."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "Got it, so that old history information is not important for the future, like if you're operating actively on the new chain, that history is not important to you."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "It's not important, so it's not strictly important for just like any smart contract or just like applications that run on the blockchain."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "It can be important to users, and it can be important for some applications, but we're basically saying that like maintaining and serving that is not going to be a simultaneous with the responsibility of every Ethereum node."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "If you want that information, there can be separate protocols for backing it up."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "And like these other protocols actually exist, right?"}, {"time": 5558, "text": "Like there's something called the graph, which is doing some history retrieval."}, {"time": 5562, "text": "Potentially, you can just take that entire chain and stake it on BitTorrent."}, {"time": 5565, "text": "Like there's lots of ways to like archive it and create kind of customized search protocols for it."}, {"time": 5571, "text": "So what's your sense why, so there's a Python 2 and Python 3, and it took forever for people to switch."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "What's your sense why this merge has been taking longer than perhaps was expected?"}, {"time": 5585, "text": "I think the biggest reason is just we've been underestimating the technical complexity."}, {"time": 5591, "text": "There's a lot of technical complexity in making a successful proof of stake chain."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "There's a lot of technical complexity in actually figuring out the transition process."}, {"time": 5602, "text": "So that's bigger than social complexity."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "So the technical complexity you would say is the bigger reason for any delays than the social complexity?"}, {"time": 5611, "text": "I actually think so."}, {"time": 5612, "text": "I think we've been very fortunate to not have too much social complexity around the merge."}, {"time": 5617, "text": "So not much drama."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "I think the biggest part of the reason is just because we have been talking about proof of stake and sharding as being part of the roadmap since almost the very beginning of the project, right?"}, {"time": 5629, "text": "Like the very first proof of stake blog post is from January 2014, which was two months after the project started and maybe even a day after the announcement."}, {"time": 5641, "text": "So proof of stake was not something that we kind of put on anybody by surprise."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "And then when the Dow fork happened and the people on the ETC side split off, I think it also just happens that a lot of the people that were not willing to stomach the Dow fork and then join the ETC side, they were the more Bitcoiny types."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "And the more Bitcoiny types do also tend to like proof of work more."}, {"time": 5666, "text": "And so like that also sort of ended up, sort of like purifying the communities on both sides, I guess."}, {"time": 5673, "text": "So Ethereum Classic is not switching to proof of stake and they're happy with their setup."}, {"time": 5678, "text": "And by the time that it came to the beacon chain launching into now, I think the community is very strongly in favor of the proof of stake switch."}, {"time": 5690, "text": "But let me ask the question that no engineer wants to hear, which is the question of timeline."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "When do you think the merge will happen?"}, {"time": 5703, "text": "Do you have a sense it might happen this year?"}, {"time": 5706, "text": "Do you have a sense it might be pushed towards next year, 2022 or even beyond?"}, {"time": 5714, "text": "I think early 2022 is the most realistic."}, {"time": 5720, "text": "There's definitely still like an optimistic case of it happening this year, but the realistic thing to count on is definitely the very early part of next year."}, {"time": 5731, "text": "Is there specific things that stand out to you that will make you feel good about progress if you see it happening?"}, {"time": 5740, "text": "So the thing that we had last month is we had this online hackathon called Rayanism, where basically a bunch of the different client developers that are going to be part of the transition, like hacks together some test nets of the post merge Ethereum chain."}, {"time": 5757, "text": "So these were only test nets of what would happen after the merge."}, {"time": 5761, "text": "They were not test nets of the transition itself."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "So the thing that people are working on now actually is the transition."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "So having a full specification of both the transition and post transition, and we have specifications now, but in a realistic way, they'll probably needs to have a couple of changes and have things that continue to be ironed out, and then have a test net that does both the transition and the post transition."}, {"time": 5787, "text": "And then once you have a test network, then you just have to do a lot of testing and audit it, and then do some runs on not just a specialized test network but on say an existing test network like a Robson or Rinkeby that Ethereum people already significantly use."}, {"time": 5805, "text": "And if it works, then you can deploy the transition on mainnet."}, {"time": 5809, "text": "Just as a quick comment, because this is fascinating."}, {"time": 5812, "text": "In August of last year, there was this Medalla."}, {"time": 5817, "text": "I believe it's pronounced Medasha."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "It's a South American subway station."}, {"time": 5822, "text": "I forget where."}, {"time": 5823, "text": "But spelled with two Ls."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "Yeah, yeah, because that's how Spanish works, right?"}, {"time": 5827, "text": "Like the two Ls have a... Medasha."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "Anyway, but I read about it in middle of August, August 14th, there was an incident on that test net."}, {"time": 5837, "text": "How does this process work?"}, {"time": 5842, "text": "What do you learn from those kinds of incidents when stuff goes wrong in the test process?"}, {"time": 5847, "text": "I think that incident was that there was a consensus failure of some kind as I remember."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "Basically just different clients interpreting things in different ways, and then one of them getting kicked off the network."}, {"time": 5859, "text": "And then it ended up taking a while to actually get everyone to get back online."}, {"time": 5865, "text": "A big part of the reason why it took weeks to resolve is because it's on a test network, like the coins are valueless."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And so there's not really this big push of any kind for people to actually go and download the new clients so they can start participating again."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "And so it definitely took a while until the chain started finalizing again."}, {"time": 5886, "text": "And then also there was, I think, another round of just not finalizing in October, as I remember."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "There were definitely things that we learned."}, {"time": 5897, "text": "Like there were a lot of things, especially that client developers just learned about like optimization and how to build their clients in a way that they can process things efficiently."}, {"time": 5908, "text": "There's a lot that we learned from just like seeing the full life cycle of what happens when more than a third of the validators go offline and then finalization stops."}, {"time": 5917, "text": "And then that kind of weird unusual state of the chain continues for a while."}, {"time": 5923, "text": "And then eventually everyone who is not participating just gets enough of their stake."}, {"time": 5928, "text": "Like we don't use the word slashed, we use the word leaked for this, but like basically also burned until the people who are participating go back up to two thirds and then the chain goes back to finalizing."}, {"time": 5939, "text": "So just seeing all of those edge cases play out live, I think actually helped a lot and probably helped to really contribute to making us feel better about Mainnet."}, {"time": 5948, "text": "I mean, there's also an incident just recently in April 24th of 2021 where this was on Beacon, I guess."}, {"time": 5958, "text": "There was a bug discovered in the software client Prism that prevented roughly 70% of validators on the network from producing blocks."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "I mean, maybe you can comment on what happened, but broadly like the big picture, what kind of stuff are you worried about in terms of problems that might arise?"}, {"time": 5979, "text": "Are we talking about small bugs?"}, {"time": 5981, "text": "Are we talking about like emergent social, unexpected social bugs?"}, {"time": 5988, "text": "What are the things that worry you about the future of Ethereum that you want to make sure you construct mechanisms that prevent those things from happening?"}, {"time": 5995, "text": "So one of the lucky things there was that this particular bug only prevented proposed self blocks."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "It did not prevent attestations."}, {"time": 6003, "text": "So attestations is just a mechanism for voting on blocks."}, {"time": 6006, "text": "And it's the attestations that are actually responsible for the chain finalizing."}, {"time": 6009, "text": "So like coming to this more permanence agreements on blocks."}, {"time": 6012, "text": "So the chain was actually quite stable all the way through."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "I think the thing that we generally learned from these experiences is just how valuable it is to have this multi client network."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "So this is one of these areas where I think Ethereum distinguishes itself from like Bitcoin, for example."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "That in Ethereum, we don't have one single client that everyone just runs, right?"}, {"time": 6041, "text": "There's multiple implementations of the protocol."}, {"time": 6044, "text": "And these multiple implementations, they all process and verify the blocks that each other can verify, right?"}, {"time": 6052, "text": "So they all speak the same language."}, {"time": 6054, "text": "Now, sometimes when there's a bug, they disagree."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "And when two clients disagree because of a bug, we call this a consensus failure."}, {"time": 6061, "text": "And consensus failures are pretty serious, right?"}, {"time": 6063, "text": "And when you have a client's monoculture like Bitcoin does, then it's more rare to have consensus failures."}, {"time": 6072, "text": "Though you still have them actually."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "Bitcoin had a consensus failure between two different versions of the same client back in 2013, but they're less likely to happen."}, {"time": 6081, "text": "But the interesting thing is that the multi client architecture has actually, I think, saved Ethereum much more than it's heard it."}, {"time": 6090, "text": "So even in this most recent incident, right?"}, {"time": 6091, "text": "Like Prism was not producing blocks, but all the other clients were still producing blocks."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "There's four others, right?"}, {"time": 6098, "text": "Yes, it's a Prism, Nimbus, Teku, and the Lighthouse."}, {"time": 6103, "text": "And then also Ethereum back in 2016 had this fun events that we call the Shanghai DOS attacks."}, {"time": 6109, "text": "They're called that because the attacks started right on the first day of our annual conference at DEF CON that happens to be in Shanghai that year."}, {"time": 6119, "text": "So what happened basically was that someone came up with a way to create blocks that were very slow for one client to process, but not the other client."}, {"time": 6130, "text": "So at that time, there were basically two Ethereum clients."}, {"time": 6132, "text": "They were called Geth and Parity."}, {"time": 6135, "text": "Right now, I think the top three ones are Geth, Nethermind, and Basu."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "But what happened as a result of us having two clients is that the attacker was just not able to come up with blocks that both clients were completely failing at processing."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "And so a lot of the miners and a lot of network participants, they just kept on switching between the two implementations depending on which one worked."}, {"time": 6159, "text": "And that actually really helped the chain survive through that month of attacks as the attacker just kept on hammering at our system and identifying all of the weaknesses and just forcing our clients to do this rapid sprint of just optimizing the hell out of everything and make sure there aren't any of those DOS blocks or DOS bugs remaining."}, {"time": 6182, "text": "So that was another example."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "And then as a counter example, so something that also shows the point from the other side, Bitcoin had this bug in 2010, the balance overflow bug."}, {"time": 6195, "text": "Basically someone created a transaction that had two outputs and those outputs were both of a few billion Bitcoin."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "So like about two to the power of 63 Satoshis."}, {"time": 6207, "text": "And then if you add those numbers together, you'll go above two to the power of 64."}, {"time": 6211, "text": "And of course, computers like once you go above to the power of 64, you wrap around."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "And so the Bitcoin nodes thought that there was enough money to pay for the transaction because it was asking for, let's say like a billion Satoshis or something, but actually it was asking for two to the power of 64 plus a billion."}, {"time": 6228, "text": "And so the attacker just managed to create like billions of Bitcoin out of thin air."}, {"time": 6233, "text": "And this was not only discovered and fixed after something like 12 hours, but if there had been, if Bitcoin had been a multiple implementation system, then what would have almost certainly happened is like one of the clients would have bugged out, but the other clients would have probably actually had a check for that, right?"}, {"time": 6255, "text": "And so there would have been a consensus failure, but at least that would have like alerted everyone that there is a problem very quickly."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "And it also would have given everyone just like obvious social permission to go and, you know, pick whichever one of the chains is correct and solve the problem."}, {"time": 6271, "text": "So like, that's, I think a big learning that we've had from multiple of our experiences in the Ethereum ecosystem, just like validating this multi client model."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "And like, to be fair, it's a model that we get criticized for a lot, right?"}, {"time": 6286, "text": "Like Bitcoin people talk about, you know, the risk of consensus failures that this creates."}, {"time": 6291, "text": "VC types are like, well, you know, isn't it expensive and wasteful to fund three software teams where you could just be making, you know, one quote focused effort, you know, they love the word focused."}, {"time": 6300, "text": "And like, you know, Ethereum is not that, but it's amazing despite not being that."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "Basically, yeah, so that was interesting."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "And then there have definitely been other learnings as well, just from like seeing the chain live and seeing what actually is the staking experience like, what are the actual incentives for all the different participants."}, {"time": 6326, "text": "So I definitely feel like we're gaining a lot from this sort of one year of trial running the chain before we actually make all of Ethereum depend on it."}, {"time": 6335, "text": "Let me ask perhaps a strange question, but you know, proponents of Bitcoin will say things like, Bitcoin fixes everything."}, {"time": 6344, "text": "So why do we need Ethereum?"}, {"time": 6347, "text": "Versus like Bitcoin plus lightning network for scalability and then using Bitcoin for, with this proof of work for security."}, {"time": 6358, "text": "So in this kind of, it is perhaps sort of a strange question, but it's a high level question."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "Why do we need another technology?"}, {"time": 6367, "text": "Yes, it has a bunch of nice features, but like doesn't Bitcoin fix everything already?"}, {"time": 6373, "text": "So the thing that always attracted me about Bitcoin is these values of decentralization, creating these open provisional systems that anyone can participate in and that aren't just going to flop over and die if whoever created them gets bored and that are resistant to like whoever runs them breaking the rules and all of these things."}, {"time": 6395, "text": "And I think that pretty strongly that these principles are like really valid in importance to much more things than just money, right?"}, {"time": 6402, "text": "Like Bitcoin is the blockchain for money and Ethereum was built from the start as a general purpose blockchain, right?"}, {"time": 6409, "text": "There is ether the asset on Ethereum, but then you can also make decentralized financial things, what we call DeFi today."}, {"time": 6418, "text": "You can make like ENS, the decentralized domain name system."}, {"time": 6422, "text": "You can put, make prediction markets on it."}, {"time": 6425, "text": "You can make totally nonfinancial systems that just like keep track of whether or not some certificate was signed or whether or not some like cryptographic key got revoked."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "There's this big long list of like just interesting things that you could use about blockchains to do, right?"}, {"time": 6443, "text": "Like basically they are sort of the missing piece that where without them, the kinds of things that a decentralized computer network can do is very limited."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "And once you have them, a lot of those limitations end up going away."}, {"time": 6456, "text": "And so Ethereum was like always from the beginning about that, right?"}, {"time": 6463, "text": "It's about like, hey, this isn't just money."}, {"time": 6496, "text": "Hence the smart contracts as being a sort of a core technology as part of Ethereum."}, {"time": 6502, "text": "Smart contracts, the computer programs that are running on Ethereum, they are like the core of what makes Ethereum general purpose."}, {"time": 6509, "text": "Yeah, so I do think that there's a lot more wrong with the world than just money, right?"}, {"time": 6517, "text": "Like I'm not one of these people who thinks that if you get rid of fiat currency and you replace it with cryptocurrency, then suddenly wars are gonna go away, right?"}, {"time": 6525, "text": "Because like, first of all, like say your average revenue is only a small portion of government revenue, right?"}, {"time": 6531, "text": "It's like what, 5%, 10%, something like that."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "Second of all, like if you are the sort of, this is one of the things I don't even get about their philosophy."}, {"time": 6541, "text": "Like, let's say you're the sort of person who is an extreme and very distrusting libertarian and you think that these governments are terrible, right?"}, {"time": 6549, "text": "Like we know today that governments find a combination of things like welfare and things like the military that goes and like bombs people in Afghanistan, right?"}, {"time": 6561, "text": "And so the question you have to ask is like, okay, you with your new, you know, magic newfangled cyber currency that takes over the world, take away the government's ability to have seniorized revenue and so you reduce the government's revenue by 10%."}, {"time": 6577, "text": "If the government is that evil, which portion of its expenses is it gonna take that 10% from?"}, {"time": 6583, "text": "Is it gonna stop the bombing people in Afghanistan or is it gonna cut welfare?"}, {"time": 6587, "text": "If you think it's the first, you have a very optimistic view of the government, right?"}, {"time": 6591, "text": "So that's, I guess, my perspective on like why the whole, you know, we're going to save the world and create peace by like denying governments the right to stealth taxation kind of perspective doesn't really make much sense for me."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "And I do think that there is real value that comes from a decentralized and open currency."}, {"time": 6614, "text": "Like just the fact that there is a financial infrastructure that anyone in the world can go ahead and use, right?"}, {"time": 6621, "text": "It's, that's something that can easily be a big boon for people, right?"}, {"time": 6625, "text": "There's a lot of places where the currency and is much less stable than the dollar."}, {"time": 6632, "text": "And, you know, these people like they don't like, well, if they use Bitcoin, their only option is to get Bitcoins, right?"}, {"time": 6639, "text": "Which, you know, are also pretty volatile."}, {"time": 6642, "text": "If they use Ethereum, then, you know, they can get ether, but then they can also get stable coins, right?"}, {"time": 6646, "text": "And you might think that, you know, oh, you're not being ideologically pure."}, {"time": 6649, "text": "Now you're giving them stable coins, which are mirroring dollars."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "And obviously dollars are going to collapse too."}, {"time": 6654, "text": "But the reality is that dollars are vastly more stable than the Venezuelan Bolivar."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "So like, there are really meaningful and beneficial things that you can give to people by having a global and open financial system."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "But I think if you want to actually do that, like you have to have much more than just a currency, right?"}, {"time": 6674, "text": "And then if you want to go beyond financial things, then, you know, you have to obviously have much more than a currency and then, you know, you also have to actually take scalability seriously because the nonfinancial applications, like nobody's going to pay $5 a transaction for them."}, {"time": 6691, "text": "Can we return to dogs?"}, {"time": 6694, "text": "Woof, woof."}, {"time": 6700, "text": "The other one's categorically forbidden."}, {"time": 6701, "text": "Yeah, categorically forbidden."}, {"time": 6703, "text": "Is there any cryptocurrency based on cats actually?"}, {"time": 6705, "text": "I think there are."}, {"time": 6706, "text": "Like, there was cat coin, there was nan coin."}, {"time": 6709, "text": "For some reason, they just didn't catch on as much as the dog coins did."}, {"time": 6713, "text": "Okay, so let's talk about Dogecoin and Elon Musk."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "Elon said that, quote,

network type of ideas into Ethereum?"}, {"time": 7334, "text": "I personally would prefer the Ethereum base layer, like stay away from trying to provide too much functionality because like once you have the Ethereum base layer making a claim about like say the US dollar to Ethereum price, like at some sense, you're basically saying that like Ethereum as a base platform starts making what could be geopolitical statements, right?"}, {"time": 7360, "text": "Like for example, imagine if there was some civil war and the US split up and you had two currencies that both claims to be the US dollar, well, Ethereum would have to pick one for the sake of everyone who was already using that oracle."}, {"time": 7373, "text": "So does that mean that the blockchain would be taking a position in this big mega political debate?"}, {"time": 7379, "text": "So I think like for just those kinds of reasons, I would personally like prefer Ethereum itself to be more of this sort of pure platform that just analyzes transactions just mathematically using deterministic consensus rules."}, {"time": 7397, "text": "And then if you need the oracles, that can be layer twos."}, {"time": 7400, "text": "Like I think Ethereum like benefits from not trying to do everything at layer one and having this like very robust layer two ecosystem where you have all these projects doing interesting things."}, {"time":

themselves."}, {"time": 7508, "text": "Is there something you could say about your thoughts about the Cardano project that Charles Hoskinson leads?"}, {"time": 7515, "text": "They've worked on some interesting ideas that mirror some of the ideas in Ethereum, proof of stake, working on smart contracts and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 7528, "text": "Is there something, again, positive, inspiring that you could say?"}, {"time": 7533, "text": "Are they a competitor?"}, {"time": 7537, "text": "There's definitely interesting ideas in there."}, {"time": 7540, "text": "I do think Cardano takes a bit of a different approach than Ethereum in that they really emphasize having these big academic proofs for everything, whereas Ethereum tends to be more okay with heuristic arguments in part because it's just trying to do more faster."}, {"time": 7555, "text": "But there's definitely very interesting things that come out of IOHK research."}, {"time": 7563, "text": "Can you comment on that kind of idea?"}, {"time": 7565, "text": "I, as sort of having a foot in research, enjoy Charles's kind of emphasis on papers and deep academic rigor."}, {"time": 7575, "text": "What's the role of deep research rigor in the world of cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 7581, "text": "I'm actually the sort of person who thinks deep rigor is overrated."}, {"time": 7585, "text": "The reason why I think deep rigor is overrated is because I think in terms of why protocols fail, I think the number of failures that are outside the model is even more important, is bigger and more important than the failures that are inside the model."}, {"time": 7601, "text": "So if you take selfish mining, for example, that original discovery from 2013 that showed how Bitcoin does, even if it has a 50% fault tolerance, assuming everyone's honest, it only has a zero to 33% fault tolerance, depending on your network model, if you assume rational actors."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "And to me, that was a great example of an outside the model failure, right?"}, {"time": 7630, "text": "Because traditional consensus research, just up until or before the blockchain days, did not think about like incentivization much, right?"}, {"time": 7639, "text": "There was a little bit of thought about incentivization."}, {"time": 7641, "text": "There's like a couple of papers on the Byzantine altruist rational model, but it wasn't that deep."}, {"time": 7646, "text": "It was mostly operating under the assumption that we're gonna make consensus between 15 participants and these are institutions."}, {"time": 7654, "text": "And if something goes wrong, then we can figure out whether or not it was deliberate offline."}, {"time": 7660, "text": "And if they did something evil, we can sue them."}, {"time": 7662, "text": "Whereas in the crypto world, you can't sue that, right?"}, {"time": 7664, "text": "And so that whole discovery basically arose just because the model of traditional consensus research just didn't cover those possibilities."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "And then once you go out of the model, those other issues do exist, right?"}, {"time": 7679, "text": "So, but then at the same time, there definitely are protocols that turn out to be, that do have failures inside the model."}, {"time": 7688, "text": "Like this reminds me of the time when I think I found a bug in a proposed consensus implementation from either BitShares or EOS."}, {"time": 7698, "text": "This happened around the end of 2017."}, {"time": 7701, "text": "So that was definitely inside the model because like they had a very clear idea of what they were trying to achieve."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "They had a very clear description and like there's a very clear mathematical argument for why the description doesn't lead to what they're trying to achieve."}, {"time": 7713, "text": "But ultimately what you're trying to achieve can never be fully described in formal language, right?"}, {"time": 7718, "text": "Like I think this is the big discovery of, the AI safety people, for example, right?"}, {"time": 7723, "text": "Like just having a specification of what you want is an insanely hard problem."}, {"time": 7729, "text": "And like the more powerful the optimizer that you're giving the instructions to, the more you have to be careful."}, {"time": 7735, "text": "And so, I think there are the kind of these two sides."}, {"time": 7742, "text": "And then the other thing is that a lot of the academic approach ends up basically optimizing for other people inside of the academic system."}, {"time": 7752, "text": "And it doesn't really optimize for like curious outsiders."}, {"time": 7757, "text": "Whereas like I personally totally optimize for curious outsiders, or at least I feel like I strive to."}, {"time": 7763, "text": "So I guess like that's my case for why I like tends to behave in ways that, you know, occasionally traditional academic types criticize as being reckless."}, {"time": 7775, "text": "But I mean, on the other hand, you know, there's definitely real benefits that come from like just taking a rigorous approach, especially when, you know, you know what the thing, like, you know what the specification is of what you're trying to get."}, {"time": 7793, "text": "And like, you're trying to kind of improve your ways or provide protocols that actually provide that."}, {"time": 7798, "text": "And like, you know exactly what you're looking for."}, {"time": 7800, "text": "I feel like realistically, you probably wants to do both kinds of analysis."}, {"time": 7806, "text": "And like, sometimes you even want to do both kinds of analysis in stages, right?"}, {"time": 7809, "text": "Like you have, you want to do more quick and dirty things and even wants public feedback on the quick and dirty stuff."}, {"time": 7814, "text": "And then later on you formalize it more and then you get more feedback."}, {"time": 7818, "text": "Like in general, I guess I feel like the norms of research in the future, like the internet has just changed so much."}, {"time": 7827, "text": "There's no way that it's not going."}, {"time": 7829, "text": "And you know, it's even changed like collaboration structures and like the patterns in which we work with each other."}, {"time": 7835, "text": "There's no way that the correct structure for collaborative research is the same as what it was 15 years ago."}, {"time": 7842, "text": "But like, what combination of these existing components and of new ideas it is, like that's something that's, you know, totally legitimate to kind of fight it out."}, {"time": 7852, "text": "And I think it's great that there's different ecosystems that have different attitudes to things."}, {"time": 7856, "text": "Like, you know, I think, you know, there's a big possibility that, you know, things that the Ethereum, ways that the Ethereum ecosystem approaches some problems is totally wrong."}, {"time": 7864, "text": "And if there's other ecosystems with different principles and they do well, that's something that we can learn from."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "In the spirit of the depth for a search, can you comment on AI safety?"}, {"time": 7873, "text": "And some people are really worried about the existential risks of artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 7878, "text": "Is there something you could say that's hopeful about how we avoid in the same kind of line of reasoning about creating formal models versus kind of looking outside the model into what the real world actually is like?"}, {"time": 7893, "text": "Is there some lessons from that we can take and map onto the AI safety world where the potentials of the technology, whether it's in autonomous weapon systems or just the paperclip problem that we can avoid AI destroying the world?"}, {"time": 7911, "text": "So my impression is actually that, like, this is more of a kind of far away impression and it could be wrong, that it might even be that one of the challenges is that AI is not formal enough."}, {"time": 7921, "text": "Like, because AI is very practitioner oriented, right?"}, {"time": 7925, "text": "Like, it's all about like, hey, I found a couple of hacks and look, I ran them and look, they seem to improve classification accuracy from 0.684 to 0.773."}, {"time": 7935, "text": "So a lot of the time there just isn't actual science behind why this hack works and why this other hack doesn't work."}, {"time": 7943, "text": "You just sort of like trial and error your way into it."}, {"time": 7947, "text": "And I could see how that approach works, but at the same time, like, that approach is not good for eligibility, for example."}, {"time": 7954, "text": "Like, it's not good for like understanding what the heck is actually going on, like how these kinds of systems conceivably might fail."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "Like, there's even, you know, a debate on like, can you take GPT3 like things and just scale them up and their intelligence will continue to improve or is there just like some types of reasoning that they're fundamentally bad at and like they're not gonna get good at it no matter how much you like scale this exact same approach and add more hardware to it."}, {"time": 7981, "text": "So having like thinking about what's going on more explicitly, I mean, my understanding is that a big part of AI safety research is trying to do that sort of stuff, right?"}, {"time": 7993, "text": "Formalize."}, {"time": 7994, "text": "Yeah, formalize, try to improve just AI eligibility, like trying to understand, you know, if the AI makes some classification so we can actually see like what happens and like what's going on in the middle, right?"}, {"time": 8007, "text": "Whereas with crypto or with traditional cryptography, you know, it's like very much not, well, okay, I mean, I shouldn't quite say that."}, {"time": 8015, "text": "It's, traditional cryptography is this interesting mix of being very formal and being very informal because it's very formal with, given these security assumptions, prove that the protocol works under these security assumptions."}, {"time": 8027, "text": "The places where it's very informal is like, well, how do we even know that there isn't an efficient algorithm for factoring numbers?"}, {"time": 8033, "text": "Yeah, we kind of tried it for 40 years."}, {"time": 8036, "text": "And then, you know, so far, no one's found anything better than the general number field sieve."}, {"time": 8040, "text": "And like, okay, fine, we'll just assume it's fine."}, {"time": 8043, "text": "You know, how do we know you can't find the discrete log between two elliptic curve points?"}, {"time": 8048, "text": "Like, nope, did it a couple of decades, no one's found anything faster than like baby step, giant step stuff."}, {"time": 8055, "text": "So that's, and like, there's definitely ways in which that approach really makes sense, right?"}, {"time": 8065, "text": "Because at least you can concentrate your analysis on a small number of building blocks."}, {"time": 8070, "text": "And like, you know, you do have some intuitive reasoning about those building blocks, but like at least there is a small number of building blocks and lots of people are looking at them."}, {"time": 8078, "text": "And then everything else just sort of gets formally built on top and you actually can like mathematically reduce the security of big things to building blocks, right?"}, {"time": 8085, "text": "Like you can have mathematical proofs that say, you know, if you make a ZK Synarch of a yes statement when in reality that statement is false, then you can use that to like extract information out of elliptic curves that, you know, it completely breaks the problem or something like that."}, {"time": 8104, "text": "So ZK Synarch is an example where formalism is beneficial."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "And so maybe you can have the same kind of stuff in the AI safety within AI systems that you can get a hold of some kind of aspect of the systems that you can control provably."}, {"time": 8121, "text": "And then in blockchains and cryptocurrency, I think the one area where consensus mechanisms is still more an art than a science is that these aren't just like technological systems, they're crypto economic systems, right?"}, {"time": 8133, "text": "And they make assumptions about people."}, {"time": 8135, "text": "And which assumptions you can make about people is not something that you can prove with math."}, {"time": 8139, "text": "Right, even just the

people who produce them, right?"}, {"time": 8306, "text": "Because if you don't have that, then either the public goods just don't get produced at all or people make like centralized versions that have some of the properties and try to be substitutes, but actually just like concentrate control in a very small group, right?"}, {"time": 8321, "text": "And both of those things are not very nice."}, {"time": 8323, "text": "So the nice thing about NFTs would be, well, if you're an artist and you can just mint NFTs and this is a source of revenue, then like great, that's another stream of

not, or how to use the right kind of language when talking about them?"}, {"time": 8401, "text": "Because there's the harshness of the language from the Bitcoin maximalists that doesn't just say everything's a scam, including Ethereum, but they use terms like shit coin that says it's not only a scam, it's like a waste of time."}, {"time": 8414, "text": "I mean, every word you can use, they say that."}, {"time": 8417, "text": "That's very harsh."}, {"time": 8418, "text": "And then some people just apply the word scam much, much more conservatively and just refer to coins that

of these pure, completely scammy coins."}, {"time": 8484, "text": "And that was definitely really terrible."}, {"time": 8487, "text": "And I feel like we have less, despite cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger, we actually have quite a bit less of that now."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "So if you wanna go a step, like if that's 100% scam, then what would I call say 80% scam?"}, {"time": 8529,

8569, "text": "So the humans of a particular cryptocurrency is what makes for a scam and not like the humans at the top that have a voice guiding the community."}, {"time": 8578, "text": "Yeah, I think in the case of BSV, the humans, they make just completely wrong and just obviously wrong claims about what BSV is capable of accomplishing and what it can say we could accomplish."}, {"time": 8592, "text": "And there's just a lot of aspects of it that make it feel like a money grab."}, {"time": 8598, "text": "And then you gotta go a bit further and then you have the trons of the world."},

like are scammy have a large community of people that are super positive about it."}, {"time": 8633, "text": "Like, and they'll write to me."}, {"time": 8636, "text": "Now that said, sort of on the flip side of that, Bitcoin people are also very positive."}, {"time": 8644, "text": "There's some sense in..."}, {"time": 8645, "text": "The reason I was having like squinty eyes looking at Bitcoin

in an obsession of like when you can artificially conjure up a truth, which is why I was a little bit like worried about Bitcoin."}, {"time": 8671, "text": "I think I've learned a lot since then to where like, I learned to separate the community from the ideas."}, {"time": 8679, "text": "And I think Bitcoin is a revolutionary idea on many fronts, but still a community that's like dogmatically

skeptical."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "But it also makes me difficult to decide what is this scam or not, because some of the most exciting ideas in this world have a community of people who are excited about it, right?"}, {"time": 8709, "text": "Because it's, I don't know."}, {"time": 8712, "text": "I think space exploration is super exciting."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "And there's people, I know a lot of them that are exceptionally excited about space exploration."}, {"time": 8721, "text": "Does that mean it's a scam?"}, {"time": 8724, "text": "So I don't know what to do with that."},

the case of Bitcoin, like I would definitely not call Bitcoin a scam."}, {"time": 8737, "text": "But I would also not call Litecoin a scam."}, {"time": 8743, "text": "There's people who call Litecoin a scam because they just like say, oh, look, it has no fundamental use case."}, {"time": 8749, "text": "And the concept of being silver to Bitcoin's gold is just like stupid."}, {"time": 8753, "text":

8766, "text": "And like they're trying to just like make Litecoin be a Litecoin as best as they can."}, {"time": 8771, "text": "Then like, to me that's enough for it to not be a scam."}, {"time": 8777, "text": "And then, so yeah, I think the biggest gray area is definitely between like projects that are earnest but they have just all sorts of these like different combinations of flawed qualities to them."}, {"time": 8794, "text": "I mean, the ones that legitimately is a scam is when the key people that are at the head of the project are intentionally lying."}, {"time": 8802, "text":

navigate, I mean, it's in some ways the reflection of the world at large."}, {"time": 8830, "text": "Yeah, and as we've said, maybe offline that the fact that money is involved makes it a little bit more complicated that lives can be ruined by the choice of technologies that are taken on."}, {"time": 8845, "text": "So it makes it more real, more painful, more like elevated the impact of this."}, {"time": 8851, "text": "Like imagine like Mac versus PC wars if everyone who bought a MacBook had 10 Apple shares inside of it, and everyone who had a PC had 10 Microsoft shares inside of it."}, {"time": 8862, "text": "And then you had the elites who bought their Macs back in 1983, and then they spent $500 debt, and now they have $40 million, and they just think that they're these gurus who understands the future of finance and geopolitics, and they make theories about why Apple is the one that's gonna bring freedom to the world, and Windows is secretly allied with the axis of evil."}, {"time": 8886, "text": "So yeah, this is so brilliant."}, {"time": 8887, "text": "So I think the right way to think about this is we map some of the cryptocurrency battles into the space of like EMAX versus VIM, or Apple versus PC, if there were some stock that came along with each implementation of each PC, each Mac, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 8905, "text": "This is 100% correct, 100% correct."}, {"time": 8908, "text": "Because then that really energizes the armies of people debating over this in a way that something without money does not."}, {"time": 8915, "text": "Okay, let me ask you about something really fascinating that you are also excited about, which is longevity, antiaging."}, {"time": 8924, "text": "You have donated money to the SENS Foundation, so you have an interest in this whole space of lifespan research."}, {"time": 8933, "text": "What's your vision here?"}, {"time": 8934, "text": "Or what do you hope to see in antiaging and longevity research?"},

have from Nick Bostrom, the essay pinned in your Twitter argues that essentially death is almost unethical."}, {"time": 8973, "text": "The fact that we don't do something about this thing that, this,

the 45?"}, {"time": 9038, "text": "Well, let's start, as I tweeted today, eventually everything, the universe will be filled with supermassive black holes."}, {"time": 9044, "text": "So that forever, maybe like backtracking to where."}, {"time": 9049, "text": "We'll have 10 to the 16 years to figure it out."}, {"time": 9055, "text": "Yeah, maybe travel between the multiverse, between the different universes of the multiverse."}, {"time": 9062, "text": "I mean, but forever meaning like, you know, millennia."}, {"time": 9071, "text": "I definitely think that we can get there."}, {"time": 9073, "text": "I definitely think that it's the sort of thing that's going to take an insanely huge amount of work."}, {"time": 9079, "text": "And I definitely think it's the sort of thing where once we figure out the first crop of problems and like people start living to 150, we'll just realize that there's like 10 other problems that kill you half as slowly and we'll have to do more work."}, {"time": 9092, "text": "But the good news is that this is Aubrey's longevity escape velocity argument that if you get everyone to live to 150 now, then you have half a century to fix all those other problems as well."}, {"time": 9104, "text": "So I'm optimistic for that reason."}, {"time": 9107, "text": "I think you definitely do not want to underestimate human ingenuity, especially over the longterm."}, {"time": 9114, "text": "Like just to look at what happens to computers between the ENIAC in 1950 and we're around 2020, right?"}, {"time": 9120, "text": "Like that's a span of 70 years."}, {"time": 9122, "text": "So like, you know, both of us, I think, with just present day technology, I have like at least 70 more years to live."}, {"time": 9131, "text": "So just like imagine what kind of sea change will happen in biomedicine during that time."}, {"time": 9136, "text": "And the other thing that made me optimistic is that I actually think COVID has been this kind of event that's really kind of pushed biomedicine and especially like activist approaches to biomedicine really into the public consciousness, right?"}, {"time": 9152, "text": "Like it basically, it's put people into this mindset that, you know, wait, but like, you know, it's not just like, you know, the bits and tweets that are gonna save the world, you know, the bio is actually like super important and huge."}, {"time": 9166, "text": "And, you know, ultimately what's ending COVID basically, you know, is the vaccines and the vaccines have just been, you know, amazing."}, {"time": 9208, "text": "And like this exists everywhere in the political spectrum."}, {"time": 9211, "text": "So there's nature as in literal nature."}, {"time": 9213, "text": "And my view is that like the right wing version of that is markets as nature, right?"}, {"time": 9217, "text": "Like, you know, the way that like that kind of philosophy talks about, you know, markets and like the goal of not interfering with them, like, you know, it is very kind of like nature styled."}, {"time": 9231, "text": "And then of course, you know, the conservative one, which is like traditional culture that existed before the activists started controlling everything as also being a kind of nature."}, {"time": 9241, "text": "But the 21st century attitude and like really COVID, you know, has flipped a lot of minds

millions of people dying."}, {"time": 9259, "text": "The only way out for us is through like basically human ingenuity."}, {"time": 9265, "text": "And that frame of mind is one that's like much more friendly to one, this other change of minds that I want to see, which is like basically treating aging as an engineering problem, right?"}, {"time": 9279, "text": "Like the default is all 7.8 billion human beings that are currently on this earth are gonna die and they're gonna live their last decade of life in debilitating pain."}, {"time": 9288, "text": "And the only way to stop that is human ingenuity."}, {"time": 9291, "text": "And, you know, we don't have that solution yet, but, you know, if we work hard, we will."}, {"time": 9296, "text": "And more and more people on the biology side,

the proteins, all those kinds of things, once that conversion happens, you can now apply the tools that we know how to solve engineering problems to solving it that way."}, {"time": 9318, "text": "And then there's also the other version, which is, you know, why do we romanticize this meat vehicle that ultimately is just the thing that carries the brain, maybe we can more and more convert ourselves

and eventually, hopefully sometime in the future, you know, Hal Finney is gonna be able to wake up, all of this, you know, anyone who gets cryo chronically frozen today will be able to wake up, but you know, that's a bet, right?"}, {"time": 9377, "text": "That's the last resort."}, {"time": 9378, "text": "And then the other interesting thing about the like extreme uploading approach, right, is we're excited about space."}, {"time": 9387, "text": "And one of the points that a lot of science or like hard science fiction types make is that, you know, if you want to explore space, that's a lot easier if you're not a human, right?"}, {"time": 9398, "text": "Like one example of this is that, you know, in the context of humans, we're talking about like, oh, we're gonna be able to go to the moon, oh, we're gonna be able to go to Mars, but there's this project called Starshot, I believe, right?"}, {"time": 9409, "text": "That's basically trying to send spacecraft to mini spacecrafts to Alpha Centauri, and they literally believe that they're going to be able to get spacecraft over to Alpha Centauri like four light years away by like the 2060s."}, {"time": 9423, "text": "Now, I mean."}, {"time": 9424, "text": "By traveling close to the speed of light, yeah."}, {"time": 9425, "text": "Exactly, like, so the way it works is, you know, you have these light sails, like you basically take these a spacecraft and you shine a laser at it, and the laser is insanely strong, quickly accelerated at a hundred Gs or, no, I think it was 10,000 Gs until it gets to 20% of the speed of light, and then, you know, it goes on your merry way, right?"}, {"time": 9442, "text": "So if you wants to be in, like personally explore the Alpha Centauri system within like two centuries or one century, then, you know, being a robot is like, by far the most practical way to do it, because there's no way that a human being can survive 10,000 Gs."}, {"time": 9462, "text": "So it's definitely interesting longterm, but at the same time, there's definitely a lot of like psychological hangups and a lot of like deep philosophy that we'll just have to grapple with to get there."}, {"time": 9475, "text": "I think what it hangs on the topic of whether we can convert consciousness into an engineering problem."}, {"time": 9481, "text": "So like, is consciousness tied to our biology?"},

that."}, {"time": 9511, "text": "I'm definitely in the camp that consciousness is a property of the algorithm and not a property of a brain structure."}, {"time": 9518, "text": "The other fun, like the kinds of philosophical things we'd have to grapple with is like, once you upload yourself, like you can hit Control C, you know, like it wouldn't be lovely to have like 10 copies of Alex Friedman

think it'd be wonderful, first of all."}, {"time": 9542, "text": "So in the following way, and this has to do with immortality as well, there's something about scarcity that creates value."}, {"time":

does in fact give meaning to life?"}, {"time": 9602, "text": "I guess like the one historical parallel, and this might be a bit unfair, is that there have been philosophers that have said things like, war gives meaning to human collectives, and the struggle for supremacy between nations and races is this big driver of progress that ensures that everyone strives to be their best."}, {"time": 9625,

sense."}, {"time": 10290, "text": "It's actually interesting, because in some ways, I feel like even my first five years of doing Ethereum things, my life was not even all that self directed, because

folks, they just want to be like, kind of like drilled."}, {"time": 490, "text": "They want to be like yelled at and said, like, get going, get doing this."}, {"time": 490, "text": "And that helps and

better in which situation."}, {"time": 543, "text": "So the quitting thing that you mentioned, the, like the final stage, which actually I get to much quicker than you seem to, which is like, why am I doing this?"}, {"time": 553, "text": "I get there with basically anything I do."}, {"time": 559, "text": "It's like, this is, this is probably the stupidest thing I've ever done is the feeling I get

587, "text": "Like, so maybe do you still go through that process and and by way of advice for people that are more sort of amateurish like me, how to deal with that quitting voice?"}, {"time": 601, "text": "I think a lot of times when the quitting voice kind of comes in, it, what it does is it kind of just, it comes in with the added disadvantage, I guess, in this situation of being kind of a narrow scoped view where you're looking at like, what it's doing to you in the moment or how you're feeling in the moment versus how are you feeling about the whole process?"}, {"time": 623, "text": "So one thing that I started doing in 2019, and I think, I don't think it's necessarily, I think, I think, I think this was a big reason why I had one of my best racing seasons in 2019 that I'd had to that date."}, {"time": 637, "text": "It was part of it was I started, I think, putting a little more emphasis on the big picture versus putting emphasis on like, this is one opportunity or one day of work."}, {"time": 649, "text": "And this is one, one emotional kind of flare up."}, {"time": 657, "text": "But how does that actually relate to my general broader picture?"}, {"time": 657, "text": "So when I decide to do a race or an event or something like that, it's often four, six months out ahead of time, you're planning to like kind of do a series of workouts and a flow of things where you're going through the process of getting fit, getting ready, preparing for the specifics of the day and all that stuff."}, {"time": 676, "text": "And then you get to the race itself or the event itself."}, {"time": 676, "text": "And it's very easy to look at that and think that's an isolation."}, {"time": 680, "text": "Like I'm going to run 12 hours today, or I'm going to run a hundred miles today or whatever it ends up being."}, {"time": 686, "text": "And it's a lot easier to quit when you think to yourself, I'm 40 miles into a hundred mile race."}, {"time": 691, "text": "You know, that's just a 40 mile run, which sounds kind of silly to most people, but in perspective, then we're talking about the ultra marathon running community."}, {"time": 703, "text": "You know, it's a lot easier just to say like, well, you know, I'll scrap this 40 miles and try again."}, {"time": 707, "text": "It's a lot harder to say I'm going to scrap the entire last four months, the entire reason why I was doing it, the countless hours I spent in there."}, {"time": 718, "text": "So I think I just try to reposition it of like, I'm in a bad place right now, maybe in my head or I'm not, I'm hitting a low point here, but I'm 99% of the way towards the goal I set out four months ago when I add in all the work I did leading up to that."}, {"time": 732, "text": "So I think it's important to ask yourself why, because, I mean, there are times when you're doing something and you ask yourself why, and you don't have a good reason."}, {"time": 738, "text": "And then maybe it is advantageous to step back and really reflect on that and decide, is this something I actually want to invest time and energy into?"}, {"time": 747, "text": "Because, you know, someone like yourself who is very much into a variety of different things, it can be easy probably to overextend and get, I mean, I'm a very curious person."}, {"time": 760, "text": "So there's like a hundred things I would love to do if I wasn't doing what I'm doing."}, {"time": 764, "text": "And I know how to enjoy all of them."}, {"time": 764, "text": "So at a certain point though, you have to say, okay, which one is going to be the most meaningful for me?"}, {"time": 769, "text": "And if the answer keeps coming back to saying, I guess this is still the most meaningful to me out of that a hundred things that I could otherwise be doing, then I know that I'm in it for the right reason."}, {"time": 782, "text": "Then I just need to identify some of those things like, well, why did this one take the top spot out of the hundred things that I could have picked from?"}, {"time": 787, "text": "And keeping like a list of those in your head so that when you get to that point where you start saying, why am I doing this?"}, {"time": 791, "text": "Why am I here?"}, {"time": 796, "text": "You just have those kind of ready loaded in your head to say, well, I already took inventory on that before I started this."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And I knew this voice was going to come at some point, whether it's early, middle or late."}, {"time": 803, "text": "And then you just remind yourself kind of what you were thinking when you had a little more of a level head."}, {"time": 808, "text": "Well, there's something about the thing you mentioned when you mentioned the death march."}, {"time": 812, "text": "It seems extremely valuable to just never quitting."}, {"time": 812, "text": "Like in the moment, if you decide to do something, like never quitting, even if you do go through the process and realize that it's not the wisest thing to be doing within the full context of your life."}, {"time": 833, "text": "Like once you decide to do it, it seems like never quitting prevents you from sort of having that escape clause from other things in your life."}, {"time": 840, "text": "So I've quit on a few things in my life."}, {"time": 840, "text": "And I think I still, I deeply regret that because it opened that door."}, {"time": 846, "text": "It's almost like a muscle."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So I think I'm, I don't know, maybe everyone is, but I think I'm kind of a quitter."}, {"time": 861, "text": "Like I'm really good at coming up with reasons to quit."}, {"time": 867, "text": "My mind is really good at that."}, {"time": 867, "text": "And I, it feels like I have to come up with, like really work hard to make sure that there's no quit."}, {"time": 873, "text": "That I never allow myself to quit no matter how stupid the thing I'm doing is."}, {"time": 879, "text": "I don't know if that any of that makes sense, but it just, maybe to rephrase this whole thing."}, {"time": 885, "text": "Do you think it's good to live life by the ethos of never quit?"}, {"time": 892, "text": "Yeah, that's a really interesting thing."}, {"time": 892, "text": "And I think it actually resonates with a lot of ultra marathon runners because there seems to be a trend when you have someone who's been in the sport for a long time where there's a point where they start the sport, right?"}, {"time": 903, "text": "And they're like, super excited about everything."}, {"time": 908, "text": "Everything's new."}, {"time": 908, "text": "It's very easy not to quit because you're like, Oh, this is the first time I've ever run a 50 case."}, {"time": 913, "text": "The first time I ever run a 50 miles, the first time I ever in a hundred case, first time I ever in a hundred miles and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And when you're doing that for the first time, I think there's a heightened motivation to not quit because you don't want your first attempt to be a failure."}, {"time": 927, "text": "And then you get a little further along and you start reflecting on the landscape and all the opportunities that are out there and you find yourself quitting on an event."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And there does seem to be a trend where once you do that once, now all of a sudden, like you, like you described perfectly that quit pops up in your head maybe a little sooner than next time or maybe a little bit before."}, {"time": 950, "text": "And I've certainly had these experiences in my career as well."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And what happens, I think if you stick with it, again, I think it is important to assess whether you really want to be doing what you're doing."}, {"time": 961, "text": "But if you start recognizing that about yourself in a certain activity where it's like, I think I might be pulling the plug early on some of this stuff."}, {"time": 970, "text": "I think you just need to kind of get into a position where you just at that point, you need to make a decision."}, {"time": 976, "text": "Do I want to keep doing this?"}, {"time": 976, "text": "If the answer is yes, you hold yourself accountable to not quitting."}, {"time": 980, "text": "And eventually what will happen is you'll find yourself in a position where I'll use ultra marathons, for example, where you're just clicking on all cylinders for that day."}, {"time": 990, "text": "And you still get those scenarios where doubt creeps in your mind."}, {"time": 990, "text": "You have these low points, but for whatever reason, when those low points are high, you're going to find yourself in a reason when those low points come, you're able to push through them better than you would have in the past."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And then you push through maybe two or three more than you did after you had quit the time before."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Then it's accountability time, right?"}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Because then you have to look back at that and say, well, why did this time, was I able to be mentally more strong and kind of push through those extra opportunities to quit when I wasn't before?"}, {"time": 1022, "text": "And it can be easy to look back and say, and live kind of retroactively in the sense where you're regretting, well, why did I drop out of those races?"}, {"time": 1032, "text": "Why did I do this wrong there?"}, {"time": 1032, "text": "And I just think that's where you have to kind of catch yourself and say, no, those things happened to me in order to put me in a position where I decided, well, this time I'm not going to quit no matter what, minus my leg falling off."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "I'm not going to quit."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "And then you put yourself in a position to have that day where you push through more times than you ever have before."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And you just redefine what you're capable of."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And then once I think you do that, you start looking at those earlier lessons as, as lessons, you know, were they failures on paper at the time?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "But can you pull things from them to learn as to like, well, where is your actual threshold?"}, {"time": 1067, "text": "Where is the limit actually for you?"}, {"time": 1067, "text": "And then kind of start redefining that stuff."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Um, so I think like the never quit mentality can be good in certain situations, but I don't think it's necessarily like a, like a holistic thing where you need to be in something where it's never quit, always do more."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Cause then you end up in a situation where you find this like margin of diminishing returns, especially when it comes to training and workouts and things like that, where there are times where often there are times where you want to actually quit a little bit before you would have to, because the stress that was required to elicit a, a growth response has already occurred."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "And then just to do more is just going to require more recovery time to get back and do it again."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "This is the tricky trade off living by the never quit mentality."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "You're not going to achieve optimal performance in your head."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "You might."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "It seems like when you look at the full arc of human history, the people who do great things are more leaning towards the never quit."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "Like, uh, I feel like at any one moment you're more in danger of quitting than you are being suboptimal."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "So like, um, in terms of advice, it just feels like never quitting is always the right advice."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "Unless you deeply know the person, maybe this is like wrestling mentality."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "I've seen too many, and because I'm annoyed with the current culture telling me to relax and, and, uh, have a work life balance and all those kinds of things, uh, which all have a deep, deep truth to them."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "But the reality is like, there's not enough people that walk up to me and like slap me and say, get your shit together."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Like don't quit, work harder."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "I think we need to hear that more."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "I, and like, I remember that, um, from the wrestling rooms, like that when you're pushed that way, when you're forced to the very limit and you don't quit, that makes better humans."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "I think people need to get that in their life."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "I think they need to have situations where that becomes kind of the reality for them so they can see that avenue, experience that avenue, um, where I think it's maybe to the extreme as if it becomes like your entire life philosophy where like every little thing you do is never quit."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "But life is short, Zach."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "I mean, this is the problem I have."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "This is probably the programming thing too is over optimization is dangerous."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "Uh, it's like every once in a while, I mean, you're, you do this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "You're not, for example, with a hundred mile run, you're, I mean, you could just be doing that for the rest of your life and do like the most optimal hundred mile run ever, but you keep taking on like new challenges and there's a lot more chaos in that."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "And there it feels like the muscle of never quit will be much more important than the optimality of your training."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "So there's probably a couple sides to me with that kind of a thing where for one, I think when we talked about the why, so like, I think the why can kind of shift a bit and it probably will if you do something long enough or evolve maybe is a better way to call it, to put it."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "And for me, like one of my my big drives and one of my big passions within ultra running is to first of all, find an event that I really, really love to train for and participate in."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "So for me, I feel like I've kind of identified that to a degree and that's kind of runnable hundred milers."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "So once I found that it became more of a driver for me to see like, well, how fast can I run a hundred miles in a very controlled environment?"}, {"time": 1291, "text": "So let's eliminate weather, let's eliminate, you know, elevation, let's eliminate like having to wait extra long to get crew or support and that sort of thing."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And that's how you find yourself on a 400 meter track running a hundred miles."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "But for me, like the important part of that is that I can control the environment enough where if I come back year after year, I can retest myself and have a decent ability to kind of say I improved or I regressed or I stayed stagnant."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And I think that's a big driver for me."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "But one thing I've recognized within that is if you just keep doing that, like if I could probably pick three flat runnable hundred milers a year and optimally prepare, race, recover and repeat without like burning myself out."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "So almost like happiness."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "Well, here's the example."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "Like, I mean, I love running in trails to most people would consider me a flat road track runner, runnable ultra runner."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "But I like to do trail runs too."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So and at the end of two thousand and eighteen, I recognized that I had been kind of pushing the gas pedal on trying to run fast hundred milers for quite a while without really a break in that where it was like, OK, I did one."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "Now I'm going to take a brief off season, but then I'm going to ultimately build up and peak for another one."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "I might introduce some fun trail races in the context, but they're going to be races are going to be training races, time on feet type of stuff that are going to kind of mimic like a long run, essentially."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And but the main focus always in the back of my mind was like getting on the track and seeing how much faster I can run a hundred miles."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "And that just kind of that energy that it takes to continually think by that, that I think the motivation to keep that stoke high enough to really meet your full potential fades if you don't step away from it for a little bit."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "So I took essentially half a year away from runnable stuff and just decided I'm going to prepare for the San Diego hundred mile, which is like a much more elevation, technical trail type of an event."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "Is that a trail run or no?"}, {"time": 1435, "text": "It's a trail hundred miler actually just kind of just outside of San Diego."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "And yeah, it goes through it goes over part of the Pacific Crest Trail and stuff."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "So it's very different than running on a runnable surface."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "So to give you some context, like I ran was I think just under 17 hours for that race, whereas on a flat surface I can run 11 hours and 19 minutes."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "So just the environment alone added an extra, you know, five plus hours to the day."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "So it's just a different experience, different skill set."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "And what it did is it allowed me to kind of step away from kind of focusing on like splits on a track, running flat stuff, like preparing for things specifically for a flat environment and start training for something that's more climbing and descending, more technical running skill sets and things like that."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "And the cool part about it was, first of all, you know, when you step away from something and after something a lot different, I mean, it's still running."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "There's still a huge advantage I had from the running I'd done in the past that was going to put me in a good position to be successful."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "But there was a much higher or a much bigger range of potential improvement for me."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "So through the like four plus months I spent preparing for that race, you know, I noticed, oh wow, I'm getting faster on this climb or I'm getting better at descending this technical trail."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "It was one of the most fun races I've run actually."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "So it was kind of a cool experience."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "I ended up taking the lead at like 93 miles."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "So you were racing, racing, like you were trying to get first."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "So it's still a race."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "So what was the enjoyable aspect of it?"}, {"time": 1531, "text": "I don't think I've recognized it so much while I was doing it actually."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "It surfaced afterwards."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "I mean, the enjoyment of the race itself is like when you find yourself in a position where you're sitting in basically second place all day long and then you take the lead at 90, I think it was like 91 or 92 miles."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "It's like, yeah, that's kind of a cool way to race."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "But afterwards I recognized a few things just about kind of pacing and you know, how to maybe pace the first half of a hundred miler versus a second half."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "I also recognized shortly thereafter once I finished or covered and decided my next event was going to be a flat runnable race that, wow, I really was way more excited to do the workouts that I needed to do to get ready to run a fast, flat hundred miler."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "And I don't think that would have been the case had I just tried to do another flat, fast hundred miler earlier or during that year and end up in a situation where like I maybe had like normalized a suboptimal like outlook on like something that I had just done so many times already."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "And I recognize that it was just every workout I did."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "I was like, I did this workout a year ago and it was not nearly this much fun."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "And our, you know, the interesting thing about these track hundreds too, is like you find yourself doing like your peaking phase where you're running your long runs, which for me are usually like, you know, around 30 miles or so, and I'll do them on back to back days."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "And you know, I try to replicate the environment I'm going to race on."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "So I'm finding myself on a 400 meter track."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And it's like when I started doing that again, I just felt like I was super motivated to go out there Saturday and Sunday and do those back to back long runs and see the progress and then head out again the next week and do it again."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "So I had some of my more enjoyable long runs, which are going to be the most specific to the race day environment that I had in quite some time."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "And I think that was really beneficial and kind of putting me in the right spot to be able to push through barriers on race day and put me in a position where quitting was going to be much less of a likelihood, given the enjoyment I had in the months leading into the race itself."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "Yeah, even the thought of quitting."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "So you mentioned the track, you've also ran 100 miles on the treadmill, and the trail 100 mile."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "Broadly, if we zoom out, what does it take to run 100 miles?"}, {"time": 1658, "text": "For most of the world, that seems like a crazy distance to run."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "So maybe it's interesting to ask, not only is just setting the world record, but purely running, what does it take to run that far?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think people probably overestimate what it takes in terms of just getting it done."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "I think this is consistent in just running in general."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "I think the marathon was always a big one with that where people thought like, well, you have to do this training, or you just literally won't physically be able to complete a marathon."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "And then we got into an era of kind of like, running as more of an enjoyment thing versus a performance thing."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And then you'd have people running, granted much slower."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "I think if you look at the Boston Marathon average finishing times, it goes from like, or maybe it wasn't the Boston Marathon, it might have been marathons in general, went from like three hours to five hours or something like that."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "So it's like, people, I think got past the fact that you can only do it if you're optimally prepared to, well, I can do it and maybe not meet my full potential if I'm going to like, not do much training, which I wouldn't necessarily advise."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "But I mean, I've I've talked to people who basically run 100 miles, sometimes almost off the couch."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "And it's like, it's, to me, what that says is just the human body is incredible, and what it can tolerate above and beyond what it's been exposed to, if it has to, or if it feels like it has to."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "So that's the basic sort of getting from point A, from the start to the finish."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "It's the human body and the human mind is capable of doing it without much preparation."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "But then you start to increase the goal of performance, and you try to get actually a good, like, the most out of your body that you can."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "How does that start to change then?"}, {"time": 1756, "text": "Yeah, going from fun to performance?"}, {"time": 1756, "text": "Yeah, I think once you start putting marks or goals on outside of just finishing, that's where it starts getting interesting."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "Because now you could maybe go on with multiple goals where like, if one falls off due to something that you didn't expect, then you have another one to target."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "But you can always build those up and try to think like, well, I want to run faster than last time, or I want to, you know, break a course record or an age group record or something like that."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And that that I think is just going to be a little bit of a different mindset."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "Because now you're looking at every little thing from what do I need to do to prepare as well as what I need to do to be efficient on the day itself."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "So like transitioning aid stations and things like that, or do I want a pacer or not?"}, {"time": 1801, "text": "Or does this race allow someone to like hand me a bottle at a certain spot?"}, {"time": 1801, "text": "Or do I have to be in specific areas to get that type of stuff?"}, {"time": 1807, "text": "And it what ends up doing is it ends up bringing a lot more variables to the table."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "And I think it's interesting, because there's always going to be more variables on the day than you are able to account for."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "So at a certain degree, you have to kind of find yourself in a position where I'm going to make sure I take care of the big ones, or the ones that are like, obviously, I need to be ready for like, my fueling strategy, my hydration strategy, my pacing strategy, what workouts are going to put me in a position to physiologically have this process go as well as possible?"}, {"time": 1838, "text": "How am I going to like, you know, hold myself accountable in aid station transition, so I'm not like having a ton of non moving time versus moving time and things like that."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "So there's these like, big variables that you're aware of, and you're trying to optimize over the space of variables."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "So you get to start to play with that."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "When you're looking for performance, it's almost like moving from checkers to chess, right?"}, {"time": 1879, "text": "Or, you know, which one of these pacing strategies is going to get me to the finish line faster than the other one and that sort of stuff."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "So it gets more complicated, more interesting, and in my opinion, anyway, also, there's I mean, but there's a breaking point with that too, because, like I said, there's an endless number of variables you could account for."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "And there's a distance gets longer, that list gets longer too."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "So you find yourself in this position where, where you have to at some point say, okay, I've accounted for everything I can reasonably account for."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "Now I need to be in a mental space where when something happens that I wasn't able to account for, I'm able to respond to it with the right decision and keep going and not dwell on it."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "Because that's another thing."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "I mean, you're running slow enough when you're doing 100 miles, where if you make a mistake, you can sit there and just fixate on that mistake and say, why did I do that?"}, {"time": 1928, "text": "That cost me 10 minutes, blah, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "When in reality, what you need to do is that happened."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "Everyone else out here is gonna have a situation like that at some point."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "Mine happened now."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "I need to figure out how I can move forward at the fastest sustainable pace and not think about what happened back there."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "And that's where I think it gets really interesting."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "What would you say it takes to set a world record in the 100 miler?"}, {"time": 1948, "text": "First of all, I think you probably have to focus on that specific event."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "I mean, there's the interesting thing about ultra running where it maybe deviates a bit from just other endurance sports is there's such a wide range."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "I mean, we talked about a little bit when I talked about the San Diego 100 versus kind of flat runnable stuff."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "So can you maybe paint a picture of what are there's a huge range of different kinds of ultra marathon events?"}, {"time": 1975, "text": "What are like, the big ones in your mind?"}, {"time": 1975, "text": "So marathon, we know the distance for a marathon."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "There's 50k, what are different kinds of there's 100 mile that in your mind, like kind of these islands where, where people gather off?"}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So there's a few that really stand out."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "I would say the three biggest ultra marathons right now, even from a historic, maybe not necessarily a historical standpoint, but in modern day ultra running is going to be the Western States 100."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "That's the biggest, most competitive 100 miler."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "It's on the trail side of things in the United States."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "Then there's ultra trail Mount Blanc, which is probably the most competitive 100 miler on the planet right now."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "In previous years, it's been debatable as whether Western States or ultra trail Mount Blanc is more competitive."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "I think in the most recent few years, you're just seeing a lot more like of the bulk of international talent on the trail side of the sport heading over that way."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "And then you have the road running side of things where the comrades marathon, which is technically 56 miles, but they call it the comrades marathon, is going to generally be the most competitive ultra marathon."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "The weird thing is the distance thing, right?"}, {"time": 2041, "text": "Cause most people in the think of endurance sports, they're thinking about precise distances, like five kilometers, 10 kilometers and all that stuff."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And then, then you get into the ultra running world and it's like, sometimes it's the event."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "So like the Western course itself is much more important than the distance, right?"}, {"time": 2052, "text": "So the Western States 100 is actually 100.2 miles, which isn't that big of a deviation when you think about it, especially when you figure like tangents are going to probably account for more than 0.2 miles on a hundred mile race."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "But the ultra trail Mount Blanc, you know, that's listed as a hundred mile, but it's actually, I think like 104, 105 miles."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "So, you know, it's more, there's different cultures too."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "So the United States is definitely more motivated, I think, to try to get as close to the exact distance."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "You're going to hear maybe a little more grumbling."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "If someone says, I signed up for this hundred mile and it turned out to be 103 miles versus like over in Europe, they don't really care too much about the distance."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "They're more interested in like a specific route or a loop."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "Is consistency important in terms of the exact length of the, of the route?"}, {"time": 2095, "text": "So like you can compare performances from previous years, or are they a little bit more flexible?"}, {"time": 2098, "text": "Like they redefine the trail from year to year."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "I mean, it's definitely hard to compare."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "I mean, there's events that take, for example, I would say the best ultra marathoner in the world today on the men's side is Jim Walmsley."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "The reason I think Jim Walmsley is the best is because he is the most versatile and not only the most versatile, but he's arguably the best at almost everything up to a hundred miles."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "So there's a race called the Angela's crest hundred miler."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "They, the trail has drastically changed from when they originally had that event and it's a different time of year."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "So it's much warmer on that course."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And Jim's not the kind of guy who would sit back and say like, I can't chase that record."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "But I think Angela crest, when he looks at the segments and the pacing for that one, he's like, that one is maybe not even the same event anymore."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "So you have that, you have some that are a little more controlled and a little more kind of like preserved, I guess you would say, but I think it gets really rare on the trail side."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "I mean, comrades is going to be very comparable from one year to the next because that's a road race."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "And that's where you get, you maybe get like the split in the sport from people who really want that kind of like, I want to compare myself to someone who ran this course in 1970 versus like someone who just says, I want to be competitive today."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And you know, maybe the weather is going to be 30 degrees different from one year to the next on this course."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "But if I beat everyone on this day, then I'm the champion of that big name race, like ultra trail Montblanc or Western States, 100."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "And my legacy will be cemented because I won that big race."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "And it doesn't matter when or how the course was or what the time even was to some degree."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "When you were optimizing for trying to set the world record in the hundred miler, were you doing like analysis of maybe like what were the variables you were looking at?"}, {"time": 2203, "text": "Is it more in the realm of the actual race day, the track, what it looks like versus like the variables of the training leading up to the, to the race?"}, {"time": 2216, "text": "I mean, it evolved a bit."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "Like, I think the, as I learned more about just like, what is required to kind of really do that stuff."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "So there's some variables you can control for, you know, I try to control for as many as I can."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "The big one that kind of stands out that you can't necessarily control for is it's pretty rare where you get an event where they're just doing a hundred miles on a track."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "It's usually like a, like an event of like a series of different events where they might be like some people out there doing 50 K, some people out there doing 24 or something like the event I did at, there was six day folks out there."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "They're trying to see how far they could get in six days."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "So you have like this much wider range of pacing just due to like the distance."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "So, you know, track protocol is always like you pass on the outside."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "So if you're running one of the faster paces of the day, which when you go on up to six days, you're going to, and you're doing a hundred miles, you're probably going to be running faster than most people out there."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "Then, you know, you just end up running more because you end up running in lane two around the turns and then sometimes lane three around the turns."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "So it's down to those little details that have a big impact."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "So I had to build that into my pacing strategy."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "I also have to build into the pacing strategy, like relative nonmoving time."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "You know, I did a race just recently, it was the US track and field hundred mile road championships."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "And I did not stop once other than like, I guess I technically stopped like in the aid station for like a few seconds to like grab bottles and get myself wet."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "Cause it was like 94 degrees that day, but I didn't like stop at all during that race from like what I would say is like a long period of time where we're getting up to like a minute, but that's pretty rare."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "Even on the track, like when I ran 11 hours and 19 minutes, I think I stopped three times for maybe a total of like, I believe I have to look back for sure, but I think it was like three to four minutes or something like that."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "So you got to, you got to figure that into your pacing strategy, especially if you're chasing a specific time."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "Cause you know, if I'm pacing for, you know, at the time the world record was 1128."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "So if I'm pacing for say 1127, 30 or something like that, and I don't account for that three minutes of stoppage, then I might run the exact pace I had planned on, but then I'm a minute off of the world record."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "So 1128, we're talking about 11 hours, we're talking about a hundred miles."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "Can you mention what the world record was?"}, {"time": 2347, "text": "What kind of world record you set?"}, {"time": 2347, "text": "Can you tell your own story here of what you were able to accomplish that world record that I broke actually just recently got rebroke by a guy over in Lithuania, Alex Sorkin, phenomenal race."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "I mean, he's won the 24 hour world championships."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "He's won the Spartathlon, which is another big historic ultra marathon rates, 153 miles."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "So it's getting a little more lengthy than some of the stuff that I've traditionally done."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "He ran 1114, I believe it was 56 or 57."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "So his pace was 645 per mile."}, {"time": 2375, "text": "Mine was 647 and a half in terms of just like the pacing strategy."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "I mean, it's, it's just really cool because for me, the motivation with chasing the world record was, it was multifaceted."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "I think there was, as I kind of moved through, cause I mean, it took me almost six years from the day I decided I wanted to chase that time to the day I actually did it."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "And through that five to six years, I think I merged from just like my number one goal was to try to break the world record to my number one goal is how fast can I run this thing?"}, {"time": 2416, "text": "And then ultimately what needs to be done for a human to break 11 hours in a hundred miles."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "Cause I think that's going to be, I think that's going to happen soon."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "I think it's going to happen in the next few years."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "What pace would that be?"}, {"time": 2431, "text": "Sub 11 would be, I think like, I think it's like 635 right about per mile."}, {"time": 2431, "text": "You're moving quick, but not so quick that like you're, you're, you know, void of being able to think about everything as it's happening."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "So what's the pace in terms of, if you look for each of the one mile segments for the hundred miles, is it pretty steady six, like in order to break 11 hours, would it be pretty steady 635?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Does it go up and down?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Do you speed up at the very end?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "Like what's, what's the pacing?"}, {"time": 2463, "text": "If you were to maybe how much variability is there in the pacing for an optimal performance here?"}, {"time": 2469, "text": "So if you're talking about someone, let's say that there was someone, well, let's just take me for example, let's say that we could just like, we had this infinite knowledge and we knew for a fact, a perfect performance for me would produce a 10 59, but I'm not going a second faster and I need to do everything right in order to run a 10 59."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "Uh, I would definitely want to either have a slight negative or slight positive split."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "So when, um, and I think there's, I think there's a, there's a range in there where like being a little bit faster the first half and the second half isn't going to necessarily change your outcome or being a little bit slower the first half and a little bit faster."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "The second half isn't going to drastically change your outcome."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "So that's what you're referring to."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "The split is you're looking at the first 50 miles and the second 50 miles."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "And you can break it down as tiny as you want."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "Like I think, uh, when you take out the outlier laps where I stopped to use the bathroom, which would have been that like three to four minute nonmoving time that I talked about before, my splits were really tight."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "Um, I had a couple that were, um, it was weird cause that, that track that I did that on was actually like 400 and some weird number, like 400 and like 38 meters or something like that."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "So I actually like ran like my numbers based on that."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "So they're there normally I'm dealing with 400 meters and then it's a little more like clean as to like what my lap splits are going to range from one event to the next."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "So we're talking about running a hundred miles on a track."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "And so that you can be really scientific about getting the, the, this, the, um, the pacing, right."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "And, uh, you're, you're running on the inside lane or is there some kind of tricks to this?"}, {"time": 2565, "text": "Like, are you alternating directions?"}, {"time": 2565, "text": "They'll switch directions at most events every four hours."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "So you'll do four hours one way and then they usually put a cone out."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "And once it hits like, like, let's say it hits four hours, you finish the lap you're on and then you do a loop around and then you start the next, your next lap."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "Would you say you take the exact same number of steps?"}, {"time": 2586, "text": "Like when you're really in the groove, when you take in the pacing, are we talking about that level of precision or is it a little bit more feel?"}, {"time": 2592, "text": "You mean like foot strike frequency?"}, {"time": 2598, "text": "Like frequency then over the distance to the lap."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "Would you say it's so precise that you're like, you get in this groove where it's like, gosh, you're making me wish I would have strapped more like a foot pod to my head."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "But like, yeah, so I think like my guess is it's pretty precise."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "Like is there a video of this?"}, {"time": 2614, "text": "I keep interrupting."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "Is there a video of this?"}, {"time": 2614, "text": "Cause I, I've actually, this is now three years ago, build a computer vision algorithm that counts foot strikes."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "For fun."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "I was trying to understand, uh, we'll talk about this later."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "We have the same definition of fun when I got my, find myself on a track for all day and you find yourself counting foot strikes."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "I was trying to understand if, if there's how much variability there's in a extreme, like elite performers within a particular race, but also across races."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "It was just interesting to me from a robotics perspective, if like how much variability there is in the human body and in the way they use legs to move quickly."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "I think my guess would be that at the individual level, it's going to be pretty precise, assuming the pacing is consistent."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "So you get, so my pacing on that day, I ran two minutes faster the second 50 miles than I did the first 50 miles."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "So my splits were very even most of the day."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "I actually ran some of my fastest miles at the end."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "Uh, so there's going to be probably a slight variance from my fastest miles to my slowest mile in like your cadence or your foot strike."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "Uh, but probably not by a huge margin, but you might have a pretty big variance from one person to the next."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "So you get someone whose gate is just a little bit different."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "So like for me, I supinate, which means I kind of come down on the outside of my foot and I'm kind of more of a mid forefoot striker."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "So that's going to kind of impact my cadence to a degree."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "Whereas you might have someone who is kind of more mid to rear their foot or heel striker and they might pronate where their foot kind of rolls in."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "Uh, so that person may have a little bit of a different cadence as well."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "So you get someone, and I think you see this in elite marathoning too, which is going to probably just be a much larger data pool, uh, much, much more probably precise from just like a number of opportunities to study this."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "And I think even their ranges from one person to the next can be, I wouldn't say drastic, but, you know, to the degree of like 10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or something like that from one person to the next."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "But most people, the faster they go, the higher their cadence is going to be."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "The slower they go, the lower their cadence is going to be, but there's going to be probably a range of optimal lowness and I don't know, probably optimal highness too than that."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "If you can just linger on the 11 hours, the person, first of all, would you like to be the person that breaks 11 hours?"}, {"time": 2759, "text": "And second of all, the person that does break 11 hours, like what would, what would it take?"}, {"time": 2765, "text": "And third question is, is it even possible in your intuition?"}, {"time": 2770, "text": "I mean, I would def I would be lying to you if I said I didn't want to be the first person to break 11 hours and a hundred miles."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "I think that'll be, um, would be a cool like barrier to be the one to usher that in."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "But with that said, I think I'm much more motivated in seeing it done from the sense that like, I think when we're talking about records, it's something that is inevitable that it's going to get broken."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "So, I mean, we were talking about happiness before this, right?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "So I've contemplated this in the past, um, where I was thinking to myself, like, uh, if my motivation is to break a world record or any record for that matter, course record and have that be my defining reason or my defining motivator, I probably need to do an assessment of what I'm kind of where my mind is at and where my focus is at."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "Uh, and just reflect on how I'm behaving in life because it's going to get broken, right?"}, {"time": 2821, "text": "I mean, I could run 10 50 tomorrow and in 10 years, chances are that's no longer going to be my world record anymore."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "Someone's going to run faster than that."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "So if you're living to hold on to a record versus living to try to move the sport forward, which anytime you break a world record, you're moving the sport forward, then, then you have to look at that as like, that was my contribution."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "And whether I contribute again or not is kind of besides the point."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "What you want is that your performance, your contribution brings new people into the sport who are excited, motivated, and they can make their contribution."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "And then we can ultimately see, well, how fast can someone run a controlled environment, a hundred miler."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "And that's what I really want to see."}, {"time": 2873, "text": "Uh, cause I think I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport."}, {"time": 2873, "text": "I mean, I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "I've been able to turn it into a career."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "And I think there's, there's other people who can do the same thing and it's not necessarily going to come at the expense of my career."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "Uh, but it's going to bring more attention to the sport."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "It's going to bring more interest in the sport."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "It's going to open the sport up to people who maybe otherwise would have never thought about it, seen it, considered it."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "And to me, I think that's like a much more rewarding goal than saying I want to break this record and I want to hold it for decades or I want to die with this record."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "So I never have to see someone go faster than me."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "Well, that's the progress of human civilization was down on the shoulders of giants and we keep creating cool stuff."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "Well, and it's, it's the other thing is just like, if you're honest with yourself too, it's, uh, I mean, we're seeing this right now in the running world where, you know, new innovations come in, new technologies come in, new nutritional approaches come in."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And then we see like the new crop of folks have advantages that the old crop didn't have."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "And it can be easy to look back on that and say like, Hey, well, um, you know, if I would have had that product or if I would have done that, I would have run this."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "But then you're getting into that negative, you know, thought process again, which I generally try to stay off of."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "It's like the caveman."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "If I had fire, I would have done right."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "But with this, look at these idiots up there with their cars."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "If I would have had a car back then, I would have been ruled the world."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "Um, let me just zoom up briefly and ask you about kind of beauty and love."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "What's the most beautiful thing about running to you?"}, {"time": 2958, "text": "Why do you love it?"}, {"time": 2964, "text": "I think, uh, there's kind of a couple of directions to look at it through our lenses, look at it through."}, {"time": 2969, "text": "There's like the, in the moment, right?"}, {"time": 2969, "text": "There's always going to be that run where, uh, you're clicking along and things just feel great."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "You get some endorphins and you get the, the, you know, the, the quote unquote runner's high and that sort of stuff."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "And that's like just like this great feeling that you can kind of tap into on the like the real, like, like in the moment type of level."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "Uh, you know, you've, my wife and I talk about this because she's a competitive ultra runner as well."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "And, um, you will, you'll, we'll have a day where, you know, we'll take a forced day off or something like that."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "And it's necessary, right?"}, {"time": 2998, "text": "It's going to allow the enjoyment to continue."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "But you get into this like routine of, I wake up in the morning, I do this run and that kind of gets my day started."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "That gets my energies up."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "I get that runner's high afterwards."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "You remove that from the equation for a rest day."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "And you just start like, oh man, I don't feel like I never got started today."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "Like, you know, it's just this weird thing."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "It's almost, I think it's, it's funny because non runners don't always like necessarily recognize it because for them it's the complete opposite."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "They're like, if I can get away from not having to run today, that's going to be a good day versus."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "But it's one of those things that I think gets more addictive the more you do it."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "So, uh, so that's purely from the running perspective."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "There's this joy of, uh, of the runner's high of the post after the run."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "You feel like you can take on the world, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "And I think that's one of the drivers from just the quality of life standpoint."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "Uh, just, uh, you know, and in the moment, immediate gratification, uh, standpoint."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "But then there's like, I think the bigger picture stuff or the longer term stuff."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "And for me, that enjoyment is like just the process like of, uh, okay, I'm starting at this fitness level and I'm going to do these workouts and by doing these workouts, I'm going to see incremental progress from them."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "And then that's another kind of like, kind of short term gratification."}, {"time": 3075, "text": "That's maybe a little longer than the day to day, but, um, still like shorter than like a career or a, or a buildup for a particular race where you're saying you're seeing yourself like, okay, maybe I'm focusing on short intervals right now."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "And on week one, I covered this much distance in three minutes, but by week four, I'm covering this much distance and you can just see that progress is almost like, uh, in elementary school when you get the gold star for reading a book, it's like, did that gold star really mean anything?"}, {"time": 3102, "text": "I don't know, but I felt great when they gave it to me."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "There's something about just finding improvement and people love to see improvement, I think."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "So that's where, uh, I think you can also get some value in it saying like I started here and I got there."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "Um, and then I think there's also just like, uh, I would call this maybe more the cherry on top, which is like where you express your work, which is the race itself, where that's going to be kind of the thing that kind of like, uh, shows up on the end result and where it kind of identifies whether you did things right or wrong."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "So there's a sense which, in which training is a kind of, uh, preparation towards race day and race day being the thing where you get to be the artist."}, {"time": 3145, "text": "You get to create this, this piece of art and they might suck, it might be beautiful."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "Like in grappling, that means for me, that means like not stalling, like taking big risks and trying to dominate another person in the, in the context of grappling and, and do it, like push myself to the limit, both cardio wise and technique wise, and just play, play beautifully."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "I mean, you see this in kind of chess, there's systematic chess players and there's people that allow themselves to have those moments of genius where they take the big risk that eventually pays off or doesn't."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "And that to me is art that, I mean, there's art within running, there's art within chess, there's art within grappling."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "And you got a chance, like all the training is more like science."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "And then it feels like the competition days art."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "I think that that that's a really cool, cool way to look at."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "And I think it's when you really open up the perspective of that too, it's like even, uh, obviously, you know, having a great day, like winning the tournament or, you know, getting further than you were expected to, or beating someone who you've never beaten before or something like that."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "Uh, or in the running perspective, like achieving that goal time, uh, that sort of stuff."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "Obviously those are kind of like the ones you, if, when you're honest with yourself, you really want, and you're going to probably get the most satisfaction out of, but even when they don't go wrong, like maybe like with your grappling tournament, uh, analogy, the, you know, maybe the guy you're grappling against does a move on you and you're like, I was not prepared for that move."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "So now the enjoyment becomes, okay, back to the drawing board."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "Now I need to find out what do I do when that happens to me next time."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "And that's where the, I think the why comes in again, same thing with running."}, {"time": 3273, "text": "Like maybe I make a mistake and, you know, like eat something I didn't really want to eat or, or thought was going to work, but didn't work."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "And it costs me more time than I gained by having it or something like that."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "And then I go back to the drawing board and say, okay, well, I can't do that."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "Or if I'm going to do that, I need to be more prepared to be able to do it."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "And I love that part of the sport."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "Um, just the rearranging of things and adjusting and tinkering."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "There's some sense in which the mistakes and like the flaws give us meaning."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "Cause like if, if everything, um, if you weren't able to find mistakes and something you've done, it feels like the life would be void of meaning."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "It's a lost opportunity too."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "Like if, I mean, like when I look at even my a hundred mile race of 11, 19, I can find spots in there where I was like, Oh, you know what?"}, {"time": 3324, "text": "I could clean that up a little bit."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "Maybe if I do this differently."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "And I mean, that's going to get me, you know, a little bit faster."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "If I sat back and said, Hey, well things went great that day."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "Let's see if we can replicate it."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "Then, you know, I probably run 11, 19 again."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "So can we talk about training a little bit?"}, {"time": 3337, "text": "What does your training look like year round day to day, hour to hour, like optimal?"}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Maybe, uh, maybe you want to pick a race in the context of what you want to discuss that, but, and also people should follow you on Instagram."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "You have a lot of kind of interesting, um, like little glances into your training process and into your training thinking, which is quite fascinating."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "But if you look at an optimal training process, what does that look like?"}, {"time": 3370, "text": "So I think, uh, the, if we were looking at it from like a philosophical level or like an approach level, I think there's some things that carry over from regardless of the distance."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "So I think working on your weaknesses and things that are least specific to what you're going to do on race day, but are still going to be important things in terms of improving your ability to perform on race day or maximizing your potential, uh, with the things that are specific you do first."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "I say that, but there's a caveat with endurance sport."}, {"time": 3406, "text": "I think maybe even more specifically with things like our ultra marathons or a hundred miles where you want a really strong aerobic foundation or like a base before you really start, I think, structuring things towards a specific one."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "So for me, I think like a target for me is oftentimes like, uh, you know, getting really fit at like what my pace would be at like my aerobic threshold or what a lot of people may be called like a maximum aerobic function."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "Um, I mean, the running world is kind of weird where we have like these terminologies where there's sometimes multiple words that essentially mean the same thing, but one is from like, uh, just an actual physiological reaction and one is just like a feeling and stuff like that."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "So you mentioned time on feet versus time in optimal physiological state."}, {"time": 3445, "text": "Like how important is it just to get like running done versus like running in a particular pace that would depend on the event."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "I would say to a degree and there's contradicting ideas about like kind of how to structure it."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "I think a lot of times like, uh, you do want to like time on feet in most cases is just going to be like I'm running easy, whatever feels easy that day."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "And that can be different from one day to the next."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "Like I might feel great and you know, that produces a much faster pace than if I feel really miserable or something like that."}, {"time": 3481, "text": "Um, so that's why I think a lot of times running, well they'll, they'll do the whole perceived, perceived effort or perceived exertion."}, {"time": 3490, "text": "And there you're looking at kind of understanding the response your body has to a certain effort level and you're supposed to target a certain effort level in order to like get a certain response."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "So to maybe simplify that a little bit or make it a little clearer, like I think I focus on essentially like short intervals."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "I focus on longer intervals or tempo runs."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "Uh, I focus on, um, like race pace intensity, which is a lot of times what I'll build my long run around."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "Um, but I'll also like, those are kind of like the small pieces to the puzzle."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "Those are the options you're working with."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "Yeah, but I'm going to always try to work with those options on top of a massive aerobic base, which is going to probably be like 80% of the work."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "So how do you build that massive aerobic base?"}, {"time": 3535, "text": "Just distance?"}, {"time": 3535, "text": "Distance and essentially, so I like to call it microstressing because you're going to always start at a different spot depending on where your fitness level is at and depending on where you're at as an individual."}, {"time": 3543, "text": "I'm going to be targeting my aerobic threshold."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "I'm going to get right up to it, but not necessarily cross over it."}, {"time": 3551, "text": "Um, it's, it, you know, it's, it's been popularized as maximum aerobic function as kind of a training philosophy."}, {"time": 3556, "text": "That philosophy in itself, I think maybe is a little more like holistic where they're saying, do this basically all the time."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "And by doing so, you're going to, like, you're going to raise your aerobic potential by so much that, you know, you can kind of like race yourself into shape at that point."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "And this would be maybe more specific for like shorter distance or endurance runs where you're not going to really race yourself in the shape of a hundred milers."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "But for five Ks, you might, you might do like a huge base building phase where you're going up to that maximum aerobic function or that aerobic threshold and you're watching your pace come down at that."}, {"time": 3593, "text": "So the rule there is basically like if you're seeing improvement, that's the sign you're looking for, or which would just be your pace dropping at that heart rate or at that intensity."}, {"time": 3602, "text": "And, uh, if you're seeing that continually go down, you're heading in the right direction."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "If you start seeing it go the opposite way, you're, you're probably overreaching where you're trying to do too much of it."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "So that's kind of dictates how much the dose, I guess you'd say, when we talk about max aerobic function, we're talking about heart rate as the ultimate, as the really important metric here."}, {"time": 3619, "text": "So maintaining a particular heart rate during the run."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "Uh, is that the measure that, like, how do you know you're in the right place?"}, {"time": 3625, "text": "And then that's where it gets a little tricky because like, unless you go into a lab and get your aerobic threshold tested, it's really hard to have like an exact number on it."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "Um, you know, Dr. Phil Maffetone with the maximum function process, he'll say 180 minus your age is going to give you your."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "That's the MAF 180 formula that I thought was fascinating for, it's like, uh, in the same way E equals E equals MC squared is fascinating that there could be a formula that captures like optimal running."}, {"time": 3652, "text": "So that for people who don't know that's 180 minus your age, if you train at that heart rate, if you run at that heart rate, you're going to progress a lot."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "And here's the advantage of that."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "I think like with any of these things, you want to look at it through where are the advantages here and I need to account for those."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "And then where are the potential disadvantages and then decide for me as an individual, do these advantages outweigh the disadvantages on what's the alternative approach and is that going to produce more advantages or less?"}, {"time": 3680, "text": "So with, with maximum function, uh, here's some advantages."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "Like it is low enough intensity where you can train pretty consistently at a fairly high volume with a very low injury risk with a very low, like things that are going to maybe lower your quality of life, like muscle damage and things like that."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "So they could be like a, what they call like a fat adapted athlete."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "So you can go to your fat stores for energy if you're applying this math."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "What is it called by the way?"}, {"time": 3728, "text": "Math 180."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "Is that a good, what are your thoughts about in general for yourself and for the broader population?"}, {"time": 3734, "text": "I think the math 180 formula is about as good of a formula as you're going to find in terms of capturing as many people as you can get away with capturing with a kind of a universal thing."}, {"time": 3747, "text": "Uh, like any of these things, I mean, it's, it's more likely kind of on a bell curve where like the bulk of that 180 minus their age is probably going to be a pretty good, at least starting point to kind of figure out where that is."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "There's some other things you can like maybe use to kind of check it that I like to do."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "If I'm, let's say I just, I did 180 minus my age and I went out and I started running and it was like, I'm running along and I'm just like, my, my breathing is labored."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "I'm, you know, I'm struggling to get a sentence out without gasping for breath."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "Well, that's my body telling me I'm probably not actually at my true like math number or my true, like underneath my true aerobic threshold, like aerobic threshold and maximum function, you should be able to do that for hours and you should be able to breathe pretty efficiently and talk."}, {"time": 3790, "text": "Carry a conversation."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "I had, uh, actually when I was in, in better shape, I had trouble getting to that math number."}, {"time": 3816, "text": "I found myself like that I would be doing way too much work."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "Like it was too hard to do."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "It was too hard to get to that number."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "I was running a much lower heart rate, like 10 to 20, what do you call that beats lower."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "And that's, I was still for myself, happy with the pace."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "It was a good pace and, and I was, felt good."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "I was smiling and enjoying life and, uh, I did."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "And the moment I take myself to that, uh, level of like the, the math 180 level, that's like, that felt like a real workout."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "And it felt like I can't do that for five, 10, 15 miles."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "Like I, I started feeling it like this is a one or two mile thing."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "No, but I think his answer to that, uh, Phil Meftone's answer is maybe you're supposed to like, uh, what, maybe do some more sprints or something like that, or build up your, maybe like I'm too weak."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "Musculature wise to like, uh, yeah, like that, that's a sign that you need to work on some stuff."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "You can't just keep enjoying life."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "There's, there's two ways to look at that, I think."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "And I think you're, you're, you're right on."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "I think that what the advice from that, from that kind of a process would say is either you, you're doing too much of it."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "So it's getting too hard for where your skeletal muscle system is currently at for that particular activity."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "So like, it can be different too."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "So for you, like, you know, you're prioritizing, like, uh, uh, wrestling and mixed martial arts or not mixed martial arts, but jujitsu type stuff."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "So, uh, you know, running is maybe kind of that, that, uh, that secondary activity versus the primary activity."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "But yeah, so what they would say is probably like, maybe instead of doing that at, let's say you were doing that for like 30 miles a week or something like that, and it was getting too hard to continue there, they'd say, you know, come back to 20, get used to 20, get comfortable with 20, then let's get you up to 25 and 30 and kind of just like inch you along."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "One of the intuitions I had about the ways I was failing at running is the form was probably not great."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "Like the way to get to those 30, 40 miles is to get the form right."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "Maybe I was doing too big of steps, not so like playing with a different gate, playing with a different kind of, um, the form of your form, the economy, the efficiency."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "So that was, that was the intuition."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "Like I was doing something wrong, but I suppose that's the benefit of these kind of formulas."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "It challenges you to think like, how can I improve this kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 3979, "text": "Well, and it also, it simplifies it so much that you're forced to, right?"}, {"time": 3984, "text": "You're forced to optimize within that real strict parameter versus am I doing my short intervals right, but my long runs wrong?"}, {"time": 3989, "text": "Or am I doing my like long intervals right, but my short intervals, and then you just, it kind of complicates things when you start throwing a lot of stuff there."}, {"time": 3999, "text": "And for most people, especially when they're first getting started, you know, you're, you can't overcomplicate it or you're just going to like, you're going to do like a bunch of half right, half wrong things and then not really know where your progress or your deficits are necessarily at."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "So I do think this is an amazing approach, especially for people who are just getting into it and building that, that foundation, um, where, where I think maybe you want to deviate from that a little bit, especially when you start getting to these events that are operating well outside that intensity."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "So you take something like, um, you know, let's say it's a race that takes you in the neighborhood of around like 12 minutes or something like that, then you're going to be running significantly faster than your, your maximum function pace."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "So most of the research is going to say at some point in time, you need to get around to practicing the pace at which you're going to perform at and really fine tuning the mechanics, uh, the efficiencies, uh, how it feels, how to judge it, how to pace it at the pace you're going to try to compete at."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "So there's obviously like a large range of targets there when we're talking about the endurance world in general, where, you know, you have these shorter events, like five kilometers, and then you also have a hundred mile races, which are going to typically be quite a bit below your maximum heroic function in, especially on these trail races."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "I need to admit something."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "So I don't measure the runs at all in terms of, uh, time, uh, because I get competitive with myself."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "So I kind of decided that running for me is going to be this thing where I just go by feel."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "Is it possible to be that kind of runner and, you know, still have running as part of your life and be a good performer in running?"}, {"time": 4093, "text": "I actually think that's, that's where you want to get to."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "The problem is most people have a hard time getting to that because they'll go out and they'll run with a friend and match their pace."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "Or they'll go out and they'll say, well, I want to run this pace."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "So they'll target that pace or target a specific heart rate, which is, you know, not necessarily how they maybe feel good doing it."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "So I think like once you, I mean, obviously I think when you put a race on the calendar, if your goal is performance, it's a little harder to just say like, well, I'm going to run whatever feels good today because eventually you have to get around to doing what's specific."}, {"time": 4127, "text": "But from just a fitness standpoint, health standpoint, enjoyment standpoint, um, I think it's totally fine to go out and say, I'm going to run what feels good today."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "And you know, maybe someday you will feel like at the end of the run, I'm going to do a couple of sprints just to get some, you know, that, because it does, that one's a hard one to kind of jumpstart, but once you do it and you realize how kind of good it feels, maybe to throw in a few accelerations at the end of a run."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "And then you, you say, oh wow, that feels pretty good to do that."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "I feel a little more accomplished."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "That's a forcing function, but I like to finish runs with sprints anyway."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "Because you're already there without, right."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "You don't need to the timing."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "I'm afraid of the time becoming a drug, but the flip side of that, it's a useful tool to get you to learn the right form, the right feel, like what it feels like to have to be in good shape."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "And then you can throw out the time."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "Well, I think too with, with feel running."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "And what I mean by that is that kind of back to that perceived effort thing where like you do enough of it and you start being able to recognize, like I can go out and if you said, okay, run, you know, 60 minutes at your aerobic threshold, I could go, I could know where that is on my heart rate."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "And I could go out there and just say like, okay, I know what that feels like and go out and run that feel."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "And I'm going to hit that spot."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "Like I bet you if we looked at my heart rate data after that, it'd be right in there."}, {"time": 4199, "text": "And I wouldn't have to look at some of that's just experience."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "Someone's just understanding like when like noticing the physiological responses, when you cross over versus step a little bit too below it, uh, you can get yourself daydreaming and forget."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "I'll do this sometimes too, where I'll be tart."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "Cause I'm kind of like you too, where when I'm getting really fit, uh, especially with my foundation, like I gotta, you know, I'm moving pretty quick at my aerobic threshold."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "So like if I start daydreaming too much, I can notice, Oh, I'm drifting back a little bit."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "I looked down at my heart rate matter."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "Oh yeah, I'm 10 beats under, you know, so you do it."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "It does take a little bit of, I think just awareness."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "Um, but it's also not necessarily something where you have to be so exact that you're hitting things, you know, an exact heart rate all the time."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "There's usually a range and there's even like some fluctuations where like if you've been healthy for a year or two without any injuries and you've been fit that you can probably add five beats to your maximum aerobic function."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "If you're using that as kind of your, your target from the 180 minus your age formula."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "So let's try this, lay this out for yourself, but for others, you, you offer readymade plans for people, you know, depending on their, I think the key thing there is the distance."}, {"time": 4266, "text": "Maybe you can elaborate, but what does that plan look like?"}, {"time": 4266, "text": "Usually what are the key options as you've already kind of mentioned?"}, {"time": 4273, "text": "And how does your week look like?"}, {"time": 4273, "text": "How do a lot of people's week look like in terms of splits?"}, {"time": 4279, "text": "Are we talking about, um, you know, in terms of rest days, in terms of how often do you do speed work versus longer distance?"}, {"time": 4285, "text": "You mentioned long runs."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "Like, is there something you could say that's generally applicable about the, the structure of these plans?"}, {"time": 4298, "text": "The readymade plans, I definitely follow like a philosophy, um, and it's going to be like kind of like lockstep in that."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "Um, so for those, like there's always going to be a sacrifice when you do like a readymade plan because there's, you're removing the individual context there."}, {"time": 4312, "text": "So for folks who are like really want to get into the weeds, I usually do like a personalized coaching plan with them where we sit down and we actually look at their strengths, their weaknesses and really kind of go in from that perspective and fine tune it."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "And it also like it avoids it avoids a situation where, Oh, my readymade plan says I'm supposed to do this run today, but I don't feel great today."}, {"time": 4332, "text": "So what do I do?"}, {"time": 4332, "text": "I mean, some people are fine with that because they're, they're, they're aware enough of like the process that they can adjust it themselves."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "Other folks just need a little more support."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "So, um, that's kind of the difference there, but in terms of the structure of it, it kind of goes with an approach where ogre saying you build this foundation, you're going to spend, you know, usually anywhere between eight to 12 weeks just building up your, your aerobic foundation."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "You're going to be doing a lot of stuff that are kind of at, I call them base runs, but they're basically your maximum aerobic function or you're up to your aerobic threshold type stuff."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "And they're really going to get really fit with that."}, {"time": 4366, "text": "And once they kind of have that foundation laid, then it's time to get into the specifics of whatever distance they're doing."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "So if it, where it will differ will be like if they're doing a right now on those plans, I think I've got 5k half marathon marathon, 50k, 80 to a hundred K and then a hundred miles."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "So if they pick a 5k plan, the order of operations is going to be different than if they pick the a hundred mile plan, you're going to see some of the same workouts show up in that plan."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "It just going to be different areas of it."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "So once they're really fit at that, uh, you know, that foundational level, then, you know, if they're doing say a hundred mile plan, they might start doing some short intervals, which I would, on my plans, I usually range between 30 seconds up to four minutes."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "It's kind of that short interval range."}, {"time": 4408, "text": "Can you describe what you mean by short interval?"}, {"time": 4408, "text": "It's like a sprint and then a rest."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "So I'll use basically like, I'll use like a, basically a 12 minute time trial and that's going to kind of like dictate for them what the intensity and the pace is going to be for some of those."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "When they're under a minute, they'll push past that a little bit."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "Um, but usually when we're up to like above a minute and certainly up to four minutes, like whatever pace or intensity that they get for that kind of 12 minute time trial, where they're just seeing how far they can go in 12 minutes is going to be, um, kind of like about where they're going to target for those intervals."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "So then those intervals are going to be structured."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "Let's say we were doing two minute intervals."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "They're going to do two minutes at that intensity that they could do for 12 minutes at a time trial."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "Then they're going to do a two minute real easy jog, or maybe even walk just to kind of bounce back."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "And they're going to repeat it."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "How do you figure out how far you can go in 12 minutes?"}, {"time": 4458, "text": "Is that just a trial and error you build up to it?"}, {"time": 4458, "text": "There's formulas with, yeah, there's some newer formulas that are probably a little less, uh, um, brutal, uh, where you kind of, uh, I haven't really dove into these that that in depth yet."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "I know like, um, that you can kind of replicate it by doing like a short, a very short interval and then a slightly longer one."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "Um, and then like another one where like at the end one, that last one will kind of indicate what it is."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "Uh, and so you're doing less of it to get the same answer to the question."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "But sometimes I think when it's someone who's new, I'd rather them just do a 12 minute time trial because it's easy for them to execute in the sense that it's pretty clear."}, {"time": 4496, "text": "You do a warm up, you do some strides, maybe some dynamic stretches, and you just run as hard as you can for 12 minutes as evenly paced as you can manage."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "And, uh, I mean, if the, if it's going to produce the data I'm looking for, uh, and I mean, it's also no matter what happens, they'll produce the data."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "I mean, you can, you can screw it up."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "I guess you can go way too fast."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "Then you have this scenario where like, Oh, it looks like your, you know, your first two minutes were drastically faster than your last two."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "And then it's like, Oh, we maybe screwed that one up."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "But, um, but I mean really like you don't even need to do the time trial technically."}, {"time": 4565, "text": "And as you do a few of them, you just get to know the pacing of it a little better."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "And then you start seeing more even split."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "So like, you know, their first two minute intervals pretty close within a couple seconds of their second, or, you know, I guess we'd be looking at distance if we're doing time."}, {"time": 4576, "text": "So like you went approximately the same distance on that last one as you did the first one."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "And then we're just looking for improvement over time."}, {"time": 4583, "text": "So, you know, we might spend four, six weeks kind of focusing on improving that we're going to still include kind of foundational running volume where you're going to be running like an easy pace and enjoyable pace kind of in the interim."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "And then there's going to be some rest days and that's going to be where the levels come in."}, {"time": 4597, "text": "My like level one plans are going to be like four day a week training plans."}, {"time": 4601, "text": "Level two are going to be five day level three are going to be six day with one day off."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "Um, and you can obviously operate outside of those, those, those are just the ones that I put up for the readymade when I'm coaching people kind of personalized."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "We just, we look at like what their history is with running their schedule, all sorts of stuff."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "Cause oftentimes people get hung up on like, well, what are the elites doing?"}, {"time": 4621, "text": "What are the professionals doing?"}, {"time": 4621, "text": "What are the Olympians doing?"}, {"time": 4621, "text": "It's like, well, it's like what the Olympians are doing is they're waking up and they're living and breathing everything around this one race that they're going to do in four years."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "Or so it's like, we need to step away from that."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "If you're working, you know, 10 hours a day and you got kids and all this other stuff too."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "So, um, there's a lot of variables that make it more interesting to coach someone who's actually like not an elite athlete or someone who's a professional athlete, I should say, uh, the, but, but yeah, so they're, they're going to do that stuff."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "Those, those shorter intervals, um, for probably about like four to six weeks."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "If they're doing, if they're doing a longer race, like a hundred miles, if they were doing say a 5k, we'd start bringing those workouts in near the end of their plan."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "Cause that's going to be specific to their race pace."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "That's going to be the intensity that maybe they're doing for, you know, like a three K or a five K or something like that."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "So it's going to be more relative to what they're going to use."}, {"time": 4669, "text": "So it follows that philosophy."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "The plans follow that philosophy of weaknesses and least specific stuff early."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "And then we start phasing closer to most specific stuff and strengths as you get kind of near to the end of the plan."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "And then the distance of, or the time that you're going to spend out doing whatever event it is, is going to dictate how those kind of get ordered in there."}, {"time": 4689, "text": "I wonder if I could ask you for some sort of advice, maybe almost, uh, maybe look at me as a case study of a particular runner and runner and then see how we can plan stuff out."}, {"time": 4701, "text": "So which context to give."}, {"time": 4701, "text": "So I have been, first, let me say how much we're currently in Austin."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "I want to say how much I love Austin for many reasons."}, {"time": 4714, "text": "Uh, first and foremost, people are super kind and just like, there's so much love that I've experienced immediately when I came to the city versus many of the other cities I've been in."}, {"time": 4726, "text": "It's, uh, it's not quite as welcoming and full of kindness immediately."}, {"time": 4726, "text": "I mean, I really love, love it here in Austin."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "And because I've been going through a bunch of stressful stuff, I just kind of gave myself a chance to say, okay, I'm going to stick to a diet of carnivore, keto, but I'm going to eat as much as I want because, uh, primarily because just barbecue was part of the love I was getting here."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "And I was like, either I resist or just give in."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "And I decided to give in and actually use this as an opportunity to relax and have fun for the past three, four months, plus whiskey and so on."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "And then the training kind of all, I also let go of the training a little bit, just to relax, to really focus on the work, focus on the love I've been getting all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "But now I just kind of want to set a goal for myself to get back into both competing and grappling, but also doing a, um, hanging out with David Goggins and, uh, doing a conversation with him, but almost this is my own personal kind of race that I'm looking forward to."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "And in terms of distance, that means running with David, uh, something like a marathon plus plus it's like, it's unclear what plus."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "So my goal would be to, uh, continue eating carnivore, which is a whole nother topic that I'd love to talk to you about."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "I feel great psychologically, sort of in terms of mental performance in my work when I eat carnivore and physically, I love it."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "I've never felt any kind of need for carbs to, uh, to improve performance in my running or anything else."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "Combine that with fasting, intermittent fasting, or eating once a day."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "I just, that's when I, uh, feel the best."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "I also feel best."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "And this is something you can push back on."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "I feel best when I just run every day, like no breaks ever, and usually the same way every day."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "So like, I know this is suboptimal."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "It'd be interesting to hear your opinion of just how suboptimal that is."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "Uh, so I think that actually lays out like where my mind is."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "I'm happy eating carnivore once a day."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "I like running every day."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "Uh, the goal is to run a marathon in two months ish, two months plus, and then about three months to do a bunch of competitions and grappling."}, {"time": 4866, "text": "With those parameters, I think like you actually probably would be a great candidate for maximum heroic function training strategy."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "Like you want that consistency where I'm going to do the same thing each day."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "Uh, you don't want to beat yourself up so much any one day that you can't get out and do it the next one."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "So, um, where you could maybe get creative would be if you decided that it's a hard, fast rule that you run an hour every day, seven days a week."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "But we find out that to run your maximum robot function means you probably are better off sticking to 30 minutes."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "Then what you would maybe do is you would run underneath your maximum aerobic function for the first 15 minutes in the last 15 minutes, maybe throw some of those strides in there if you want to do that at the very end."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "Uh, and then that middle 30 minutes is going to be maximum road function target."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "And then maybe after, you know, four weeks, you start noticing, you know what, this 30 minutes isn't wearing me out near as much as it used to."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "Um, I feel like I could easily push past that."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "Well, let's up that to 40 minutes."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "So that 60, you're always staying within that 60 minute parameter that keeps your, your schedule consistent, your routine consistent."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "I'm wearing a heart rate monitor to sort of as I run to monitor it."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "You could do that."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "You could go perceived effort."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "Um, I like to use them in tandem in the sense that like early on, I'll maybe look at my heart rate a little more often, especially for shorter length."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "There is heart rate can get messy the longer you go."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "So I, I end up kind of maybe stepping away from heart rate a little more than some will at a certain point because I'm ultimately I'm going to be usually training or working with someone to run like, you know, a race that's really long and they get cardiac drift, dehydration, heat and things that are going to make the heart rate super messy."}, {"time": 4992, "text": "But you're probably your ability to measure perceived effort is exceptionally good."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "Mine is actually really weak."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "Heart rate then I need to do the, still the work of connecting heart rate to the perceived effort."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "And that's exactly what I would use heart rate for then."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "And you'll get to a point probably by like in the first couple of months where you, you can still lean on heart rate if you want, but it'll be kind of one of those things where you keep looking at, you're like, Oh wow, I can guess it."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "And you play a game with yourself too."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "And you say, well, how close can I guess?"}, {"time": 5019, "text": "You'll get it."}, {"time": 5019, "text": "So like for me, what I'll do is I'll do the run and then I'll look at the heart rate afterwards and be like, Oh cool."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "I was right there."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "Or I remember feeling like I was speeding up a little bit there and their show is right there on the heart rate or."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "I also love sort of something we haven't talked about."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "I love pushups and pull ups of like body weight workouts."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "Again, it's mostly mental."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "I just enjoy the mental challenge of it."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "I also like, it makes me feel like if all I'm doing is running, it makes me feel I'm not like."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "I mean, there's some aspect to running that's not to be like hippie about it, but like, you know, you're, you're with nature, you're running in the, it's like, we're born to do this thing."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "And that same way, I feel like when I'm doing pushups and pull ups, I feel like I was born to do that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5065, "text": "Like it's like this body weight exercise that is, body weight exercises have that way about them."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "It's, it doesn't have that dumbbell feel or doing bench press or squats, squats with weight."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "When you're just doing squats, body weight, we do pushups and pull ups, body weight, even just basic ab stuff, core stuff, body weight."}, {"time": 5087, "text": "I just love the way I feel doing that."}, {"time": 5087, "text": "So it's usually, I forgot to mention that part."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "I combine that with the running afterwards, doing some basic body weight stuff."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "And I think like you're going to get from, if we're not looking at it from like specifically, like training at a pace in order to get both the skeletal muscle adaptations, as well as the cardiovascular benefits, you're probably tapping into some of the higher intensity stuff with that body weight."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "So this, and unless you're doing, I guess no rest."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "So is it, you get pretty high heart rate from that."}, {"time": 5119, "text": "Higher than running."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "So you're checking that box there from just like a lifestyle, enjoyment, fitness, overall fitness standpoint."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "I think you want to keep your running more aerobic then because you're getting that and you're probably getting it from like your grappling workouts too, I would guess."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "So there's just not as big of a need for you from a big picture standpoint to be doubling down on that stuff with your runs as well."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "And it sounds like you prefer not to."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "So I mean, what about the distance of marathon versus a hundred miles?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "Is that a big difference?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "What's a good goal to work towards?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "Is it marathon and the rest of it just takes care of itself?"}, {"time": 5163, "text": "So you want to do a marathon and then ultimately do a hundred mile after that?"}, {"time": 5168, "text": "I have no idea what the guy."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "Oh, so he's going to tell you spot on what you're doing."}, {"time": 5173, "text": "So you have to be ready for anything."}, {"time": 5173, "text": "For anything."}, {"time": 5177, "text": "My own personal goal is to feel somewhat challenged, but comfortable running a marathon."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "The longest I've ever run is 22 miles, but there's been many stretches of my life where I would regularly run."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "Like the long run would be close to 20 miles."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "And then I was comfortably running 10 miles four months ago."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "Feels like forever ago."}, {"time": 5197, "text": "Until I injured myself a little bit by running in the snow and stubbing my toe to where it was like, you don't realize how much you appreciate your toes until you stub them."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "That big toes where all that power comes off."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "And so it was surprising how long it took to heal and how essential it was and how unpleasant running, how much I hated running with it."}, {"time": 5223, "text": "And then I kept like coming, trying to get back out there to run to think, I think it's okay."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "And no, it's not okay."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "You really need to let it fully heal."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "At least that was my experience."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "I couldn't like just suck it up."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "It was making it worse every time."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "And one of those injuries that could really feel, even though it's so small, but it's essential."}, {"time": 5237, "text": "So is there any difference between the goal of marathon or a hundred miles?"}, {"time": 5243, "text": "Would you say, should I be prepping for a hundred miles if that's at all a possibility?"}, {"time": 5248, "text": "The big difference is going to be like you're dropping intensity significantly by going up to a hundred miles versus the marathon."}, {"time": 5253, "text": "So the maximum aerobic function I think is actually going to feed into that maybe a little bit better."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "It's probably gonna be a little closer."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "It all varies a bit because people will focus on specific distances and they'll get very efficient and very adapted to that."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "So it's what makes running kind of messy where you'll get, for example, the average person can hit their lactate threshold for probably about 60 minutes or something like that."}, {"time": 5284, "text": "Whereas you get these elite marathoners who've been basically spending their entire life preparing for a marathon race."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "They can push almost up to their lactate threshold and after lactate threshold for almost like two hours."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "So it gets a little messy when you start looking at it from that lens, but you're, you don't really have to worry about that too much because you're not really focusing on being the best possible hundred mile or the best possible marathon."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "Or you could be, you want enough overall fitness that you can just do either one of them without absolute misery because you did the couch to a hundred miles."}, {"time": 5316, "text": "So I think like for a hundred miles, the biggest difference I think given your context is just like the more physical things you are doing, the better prepared you're going to be for the hundred mile."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "So it's almost given your context."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "I wouldn't say irrelevant."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "You want to be doing running, but you're going to be doing that."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "Once you put it in your program, it sounds like it's going to be pretty locked in."}, {"time": 5336, "text": "If you view it this way, it's probably going to be more mentally beneficial to where, Hey, today I did my run."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "I did my body weight exercises."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "I did some grappling practice."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "You know, I spent three hours working out today."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "If you think of it like that, then you know, you're, you're moving your body, you're doing things that are active for a good chunk of the day, especially relative to most people."}, {"time": 5361, "text": "So that's going to actually be very helpful for you."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "Uh, the, the problem or the, the, the battle to get over is going to just be like the, you know, you're going to break down physically running a hundred miles and you're gonna break down physically running a marathon too."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "So like the, you might just have to push through a little more discomfort, like from a physical standpoint compared to be a few decided I'm gonna do everything I can in these next like 24 weeks to be able to run a, a full hundred, a hundred miler."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "Would you say it's physical or is it mental discomfort?"}, {"time": 5394, "text": "Like, uh, I mean, isn't everything physically uncomfortable?"}, {"time": 5400, "text": "Like what, uh, do you train for if you're training for the chaos of, uh, so it's not necessarily the hundred miles."}, {"time": 5406, "text": "It's the chaos of the unexpected, which might include a hundred miles, but it might also include a thousand pushups in my case."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "So like, you need a bit jack of all trades is what you need to be."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "But also like building up the confidence or maybe not."}, {"time": 5419, "text": "How do you survive a thousand pushups?"}, {"time": 5419, "text": "It's combination of confidence that you have to know that you can do that kind of thing."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "Not necessarily the actual number, but like doing crazy stuff."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "And the, the second is probably the base strength and endurance and also just the practicing that process of not quitting."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "I feel like that's one of the things I really need to do in the running space is like doing slightly unpleasant things where I'm yeah, practicing that, like bringing my mind back and saying, Nope, uh, I'm going to keep doing it."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "And part of the running every day has that benefit because some days you really don't want to feel, don't feel like running and doing that."}, {"time": 5464, "text": "Then you're practicing that muscle of, um, of doing it anyway."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "Um, I don't know if there's something you can say in terms of advice, how to practice the, like doing something unpleasant every day frequently."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "What I would do with that is I would try to make the unpleasant thing be different from one day to the next if you can."}, {"time": 5487, "text": "So the fear I would have with making running unpleasant every time would be, it becomes like a negative feedback loop in your physiologically potentially as well as mentally, where if the entire running process is miserable, you're going to be miserable when you step on that starting line, whether it's a marathon or a hundred miles."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "So you've trained yourself that running equals miserable."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "Well, and here's the thing."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "Like if you look at just like, here's where the literature says on paper are like the dozen workouts you should do in a training plan."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "And this is how you should structure them right down to the minute."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "And you just say, like, I'm going to give everyone this schedule and they're going to do this every time rinse and repeat."}, {"time": 5530, "text": "My biggest concern with that approach is you are potentially putting them in a position where the training is so boring and so monotonous that like if they hit a roadblock mentally, they're going to fall apart very quick because they've already exhausted themselves mentally, just trying to do the same old interval every time doing the same old workout."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "And it doesn't necessarily have to be like one specific plan in its entirety could just be like, like the, the mix of things within it."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "So like, rather than like, if I just said, do, oh, we're going to do three minute intervals, this entire short interval process or two minute intervals or four minute intervals or 62nd intervals, you know, by that sixth week, they might be so sick of that, that they're not actually maximizing their potential within that because there's no flavor there."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "Uh, so like, I think what you want to do is you want to introduce the misery."}, {"time": 5617, "text": "So if you can possibly say like, okay, on Tuesdays, the pushup workout, I'm going to go 10 pushups more than I want to."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "I'm going to get to that point where I'm like, there's no more."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "And then I'm going to do 10 more and you're going to make that one miserable."}, {"time": 5631, "text": "And then maybe on, uh, you know, Thursdays you decide to do like some of those sprints or something at the end where you do a few of them and you're like, okay, this is where I'd be comfortable to stop."}, {"time": 5641, "text": "Like, well, I'm going to do two more of them because I know I don't want to do two more of them, um, but mix that up."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "So you're not, so at least you're getting enjoyment from some of it and not just getting complete disgust from the entire process."}, {"time": 5652, "text": "There's actually quite a lot of ways that I can introduce misery into the running, get creative, including, um, you know, even just like stuff outside of the running, like taking a freezing cold showers, those kinds of things, just introducing random kind of chaos into the, into the system, um, or having conversations with people as an introvert."}, {"time": 5673, "text": "More podcasts."}, {"time": 5673, "text": "So, um, now starting, uh, the training and, uh, Zach, you've been kind enough to also kind of, um, be willing to help me out throughout this process."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "So I look forward to where that goes."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "It's kind of, uh, fascinating."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "Um, on the diet side, you're, uh, one of, one of the many things that, uh, make you fascinating is, uh, you've played with diet as well and you're, um, somewhat famous, I would say, for doing low carb or playing with low carb or meat based diets."}, {"time": 5706, "text": "Can you describe the potential, like how you're thinking about that has evolved and the potential beneficial role of a carnivore diet or keto diet or a meat based diet in training as an ultra marathon runner?"}, {"time": 5717, "text": "And I think like where a lot of times things get confusing for people here is the context of it too, where it's like, they want an answer as to what do I eat for endurance sport?"}, {"time": 5726, "text": "And it's like, well, endurance sport is quite wide ranging as we've talked about many, many times here."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "So there's going to be differences, I think, in just like what you want to maybe necessarily prioritize, uh, both for the event you're doing and the intensity that's required for it, the training that's required for that event."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "And then also the individual component too, where I think this one often gets overlooked, where we tend to say like, well, we've got all these Olympic medalists at the marathon and below distance who are, you know, eating a moderate to high carbohydrate diet."}, {"time": 5761, "text": "So everyone needs to do that if they want to reach their potential in, you know, say the three K to the marathon."}, {"time": 5766, "text": "And, you know, in a perfect world, maybe that would be true, but there's a lot of other variables that often get forgotten then that could positively or negatively impact that decision choice."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "So I think Dr. Jeff Volk has done a great job of kind of highlighting this in the sense that, you know, when he works with people, he works with people in the health sphere as well as the performance sphere."}, {"time": 5786, "text": "And, you know, he's one of the main guys at Virta health who's, uh, they've got like a 60% success rate with working with folks with the type two diabetes to, um, reverse their type two diabetes."},

"They're very, very low."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "And the big difference with his is the coaching aspect of it."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "Like the give support."}, {"time": 5812, "text": "So these people like have someone to turn to when they make a mistake, or if they're thinking about doing something differently, or they don't know what to do rather than just kind of throwing, throwing it all up in the air and quitting."}, {"time": 5820, "text": "They, they, they have a resource there."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "And that's probably a big reason why that's the success rate that they have with that, is they put those support mechanisms in place."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "That picture needs to be carried into the performance world or the running world too, where, you know, we may have just been identifying that, uh, you know, Olympic distance athletes that can tolerate a very large portion of their diet coming from carbohydrate is going to just, it's going to filter those ones towards the Olympics filter those towards interesting."}, {"time": 5851, "text": "And that doesn't mean that like, uh, if we would have taken say the gold medals in the five came, put them on a low carb diet, they'd run faster."}, {"time": 5858, "text": "They probably wouldn't, because we may have already selected that that person's thriving on carbohydrate."}, {"time": 5865, "text": "Uh, what I would be interested in is like, you have, let's say we have someone with equal talent, but got weeded out along the way potentially because for whatever reason, they just weren't able to tolerate like the, both the training and the nutrition requirements that they're being told to do."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "So the coaches can, there's a culture where the coaches would really push a carb heavy diet and that that would in itself would do the filtering process of people that are not, it would filter out the people that are not able to tolerate carbs as part of their training."}, {"time": 5896, "text": "I mean, I might be an example of this actually where, you know, you take someone where, uh, they, for whatever reason, the carbs aren't working for them."}, {"time": 5900, "text": "Like it's unsustainable for them to continue that path."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "Or if they do, they might have a shortened career, so they might be able to eke out a few really good years, but then, you know, they're not going to be the person they're like, wow, that person's 38 and they're still competing at the Olympics type of a person."}, {"time": 5910, "text": "Uh, and, you know, you, you, you put them on a low carb diet, uh, if you can control everything else, like their entire lifestyle is based around training and racing, then, uh, you know, they may still have better potential by introducing carbohydrates at a higher level."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "But if that's not going to, if that's not going to be sustainable for them as a person, then, you know, what's the point kind of at that, unless they want to be like a kind of a spark in the pan, so to speak."}, {"time": 5944, "text": "I just feel good eating meat performance wise."}, {"time": 5944, "text": "Well, I think

for, for some context, like I followed what I would call a low carbohydrate diet for the last 10 years."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "And just like kind of the training, I periodize it to a degree where there are parts of my training where I do bring back a little more carbohydrate."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "And there's periods of my training, especially like the off season where I'm like very low and I might be like kind of in that ballpark of, uh, like, you know, ketogenic, strict ketogenic or no carbohydrates for, for periods of time."}, {"time": 6014, "text": "And what kind of food are we talking about?"}, {"time": 6014, "text": "What's a strict low carb diet?"}, {"time": 6018, "text": "I've ranged everywhere from like mostly plant based, low carb keto to like mostly animal based."},

talking probably more like 95% at the, at the peak."}, {"time": 6035, "text": "Um, in terms of any type of like, like longer lasting, uh, from my personal experience of like being like either in like the animal food camp or her, like the plant based camp kind of a, of a process."}, {"time": 6047, "text": "Um, so I've tried all of them, things that stayed consistent over the 10 years as a kind of

maybe less about the meat and it's more about like, what are you, what is it replacing?"}, {"time": 6095, "text": "So if we go, if we step away from like me specifically and just like the people that,

endurance training."}, {"time": 6189, "text": "So it's possible and it's it's possible."}, {"time": 6194, "text": "And it's very likely that a huge portion of that success was just the culmination of a lot of work over time from the training side of things."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "I just think like anytime you hyper focus on one area or pick a couple of variables and just target those, you find yourself in a position where you are, you're putting other things in the most uncharitable light possible."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "So, so then you have this situation where like, it's actually a combination of a variety of different things."}, {"time": 6220, "text": "So where are the big movers?"}, {"time": 6220, "text": "And you know, for me, nutritional shift was pretty clear that that

me personally, a 10 year placebo effect would be a quite lengthy placebo effect."}, {"time": 6236, "text": "And I do think it's individual, though I emphasize that a lot because I mean, I've worked with tons of people with this and I do see a range from person to person."}, {"time": 6247, "text": "I've worked with people who come to me and they're like strict keto and we raise up their carbohydrates a bit."}, {"time": 6253, "text": "And they're like, okay, I feel way better doing it this way."}, {"time": 6253, "text": "And I've worked with people who they come to me moderate

like, okay, I'm gonna give them this workout."}, {"time": 6268, "text": "And they're gonna wish they brought back a little bit of carbohydrate."}, {"time": 6272, "text": "And then they go and they nail the workout."}, {"time": 6272, "text": "And I'm just like baffled that because because they're different from me."}, {"time": 6276, "text": "And every time, you know, when you have your own

this."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "I've had like several moments in my life where you kind of realize the body is weird and it's weirder than the average advice."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "Like one of them is how well I perform for my own standards when I fast."}, {"time": 6304, "text": "First of all, intellectually, but that's more known and understandable."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "But like physically, the fact that I could train, like not eat 20 hours, 24 hours, and then do a hard like jiu jitsu session for like two hours, like hard."}, {"time": 6326, "text": "It's incredible to me."},

grams of carbs and see how you actually feel."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "Not like in that moment, but over a period of several weeks and then doing everything else right with based on best available science, like with electrolytes and then vitamins, but then also like remove all the humans from your life that affect you positively or negatively."}, {"time": 6401, "text": "Cause you might feel amazing because you're hanging out with cool people and then, you know, like removing basically all the variables."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "And you kind of, all of us land in a place where we find something that worked for us."}, {"time": 6411, "text": "And then we maybe use some of the placebo effect to help us out, to stick in that place."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "And then I suppose that's the way to live life."}, {"time": 6423, "text": "I guess it's impossible to find the optimal for any of us, but carnivore is an interesting new kind of caveat, a new challenge to the nutritional community, because more and more people seem to be doing well under carnivore."}, {"time": 6439, "text": "Well, the nutrition community is probably like, we just got done like dealing with the vegans and now we got this opposite end of the spectrum coming at us."}, {"time": 6444, "text": "But I think, well, I mean, what this all tells, what this all tells me is like, there is a, for one, like in our food environment, like the failure rate of any one approach at a population level is going to be incredibly high."}, {"time": 6461, "text": "I mean, it's why we have, you know, what is it like 88%

ailment or something like that."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "That's a weird one."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "Like where the carnivore seems to treat like, like depression, like mental stuff."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "There's all these stories."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "Again, it's anecdotes, but it's like the mental one, I think may, I'm stepping out a bit on a limb here, but I want to say like some of the research of Dominic DiAgostino and Jeff Volokh was looking at the ketogenic diet, which of carnivore diet is basically going to be a part of a ketogenic."}, {"time": 6517, "text": "I mean, you could always go like way too high on the protein, I guess, but most people that I see doing carnivore, they're cognizant enough that at least if they're doing it for therapeutic reasons, they're not going like, you know, 50% protein, 50%."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "They're more like 70, 30, 80, 20, something like that."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "And, and I think like you, you do see some, some work with like the brain."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "So the mental stuff, I know some of the, I'm not sure if this was part of the DARPA funding that, that Dr. Dominic DiAgostino had where they were looking at things like mental stuff, like post traumatic stress disorder and that sort of stuff with, with like a strict ketogenic diet."}, {"time": 6558, "text": "So I wonder if some of that, like the depression related stuff has to do with that, where now like their body is just fueling their brain differently than maybe they were in the past, but that's just, you know, wild guesses on my part."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "And I'm deviating from the conversation, but like, no, that's brilliant."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "In terms of your own story on food, can you say something?"},

sessions, like maybe the day before, let's go even that far during, and maybe a few hours after."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "It'll be a little different for racing than it will be for like a big

"You're going to replicate the race almost up to it in training."}, {"time": 6611, "text": "Whereas with a hundred miles, you can't, you might replicate a third of it."}, {"time": 6616, "text": "So, so I'll do, I'll walk you through kind of my approach for, for like a hundred mile race."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "And I can tell you maybe what I would do differently on like a training day."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "But yeah, so for where, where the community is an agreement is that you do want to be very good at burning fat for ultra marathons."}, {"time": 6633, "text": "I mean, there's just like the intensity is low."}, {"time": 6633, "text": "If your, if your ratios are skewed very high towards carbohydrate metabolism, then you're going to have to defend your muscle glycogen through tons of carbohydrate consumption."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "And that's just going to be very hard to do over the course of an entire day, even at low intensities."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "So it's a fuel tank thing."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "I mean, it's like your, your leanest endurance athletes have way more fat than they do."}, {"time": 6656, "text": "Glycogen stores."}, {"time": 6661, "text": "When you're doing the low intensity performance, you want to be burning high levels of fat and sparing that muscle glycogen."}, {"time": 6665, "text": "What I tend to do is I want to start the race burning really high levels of fat."}, {"time": 6671, "text": "So I'm going to, I'll maybe have some carbohydrate the night before for dinner, but then I'm going to lean into the overnight fast breakfast the morning of I'm going to stay away from carbohydrates for a hundred mile or anyway."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "And I'm going to have something like something that's pretty like a high energy, low volume."}, {"time": 6685, "text": "So like I'll do like an S fuels, a life bar."}, {"time": 6693, "text": "They've got like, what's in an S fuel life bar?"}, {"time": 6693, "text": "Are we talking about carbs or we're talking about protein fat and protein?"}, {"time": 6698, "text": "Fat protein bar."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "And then they make some awesome."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "So it's, it's not as low carb."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "They make S fuels makes a whole product line."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "That's like kind of positioned for a low carb athlete."}, {"time": 6709, "text": "So they have some products on their lineup that offers some carbohydrate, which is perfect for me because I do introduce some carbohydrate on racing and some of my bigger training sessions and things, but the majority of their products are low carb."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "So like they have like, you know how you get like the powders that you put into like your drinks that are like high carbohydrate, you know, sports products."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "They make a version of that."}, {"time": 6733, "text": "That's like fat based."}, {"time": 6733, "text": "That you can mix in with water."}, {"time": 6733, "text": "So they've got like a creamer version and then a fruity flavored version."}, {"time": 6739, "text": "So you can like replicate the taste and the feel of drinking like a, like, you know, a sports drink."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "Science is awesome."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "I know it is."}, {"time": 6747, "text": "Well, and that's so much of it too, cause people are always like, well, I don't know."}, {"time": 6747, "text": "I just, I just like to have my Gatorade or whatever."}, {"time": 6750, "text": "It's like, well, you can have it now."}, {"time": 6750, "text": "It just, it won't have all that."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "So you can bring that kind of thing with you."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "So I'm leaning on a lot of those like kind of liquid calories, like those low volume, high energy fat protein stuff the morning of so that when I start the race, my body's going to be encouraged to start out burning high levels of fat."}, {"time": 6768, "text": "Once I get going probably about 45 minutes in, I'll start introducing small amounts of carbohydrate."}, {"time": 6775, "text": "So at that point, my body's been revving pretty high fat metabolism and by introducing some carbohydrate in the context of the, you know, let's say my a hundred mile, uh, personal record, you know, I'm, I'm running approximately nine miles every hour."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "So I'm probably going through about a thousand calories in an hour's time."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "Uh, I'm going to start just like defending muscle glycogen by burning super high levels of fat at the heart rate I would do for that."}, {"time": 6803, "text": "I'm probably burning somewhere between 80, 90% fat, you know, 12 hours of that you can chip away at your muscle glycogen, uh, to the point where you don't necessarily want to go zero carb."}, {"time": 6812, "text": "So I'm basically just trying to defend what I know I'm going to be burning from the carbohydrate side of that 80 to 90% fat, 10 to 20% carbohydrate by taking in like, usually, you know, I've gone as low as about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour and as high as 40 grams."}, {"time": 6829, "text": "Um, and the reality is somewhere in between is probably the sweet spot, but 40, I can get away without any digestion issues."}, {"time": 6834, "text": "So I'm not really concerned pushing up to that during a race since I'm only concerned about performance on that day, the carbs, the problem, or is it fiber?"}, {"time": 6845, "text": "Oh, from going above 40 grams or just cause you mentioned digestion issues."}, {"time": 6845, "text": "Like one of the things for me, like one of the cool things about fatty protein protein and fat is like my stomach just feels way better."}, {"time": 6856, "text": "So like carbs introduce like bloating and just not feeling great."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "And I think the funny thing is like, if you look at the position paper for ultra marathon single day events and it's, you know, it's very limited in the sense that then it's not anyone's fault."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "It's just, we don't have a lot of great research on a hundred mile race."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "It's really hard to study what's going on when someone's running a hundred miles, but they'll say moderate carbohydrate diet is recommended, but they'll also say that it's like something like 60% of participants are going to report some sort of like digestion issue during the event."}, {"time": 6885, "text": "So then it kind of becomes an issue of, do you want to flip that coin?"}, {"time": 6889, "text": "Do you want to flip that coin and be the 40%."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "So for me, what I found is like, I can push up to 40 grams without getting any digestion issues."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "Um, do I need 40 grams?"}, {"time": 6900, "text": "Probably not, at least not based on kind of the numbers that would be like, uh, that, that I would see on, like if I went and actually got a, like a metabolic heart test or something like that."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "Um, but it's possible."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "I mean, if I had a really good race that I would get close to burning that per hour, um, most folks that are following a moderate high carbohydrate diet are going to be recommended to do like 50 to 70 grams during a single day ultra marathon events."}, {"time": 6924, "text": "And you'll see some, you know, some recommendations of up to like a hundred grams, uh, not so much for ultra marathons, but just in general, from like a performance standpoint, which I mean, it's one of those things where it's like application versus like what you can do in a lab for one hour is going to be a lot different, especially when you're stretching out distances well past that."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "And you, you, there's, there's, I'm diverting a little here, but I mean, there's like an approach

does not turn like a car."}, {"time": 845, "text": "But at least when I started, and this has changed and it's part of the technology story of trucking, the first thing you had to do was learn how to shift it."}, {"time": 855, "text": "And it doesn't shift like a manual car."}, {"time": 859, "text": "The clutch isn't synchronized."}, {"time": 861, "text": "So you have to do what's called double clutch."}, {"time": 864, "text": "And it's basically the foundational skill that a truck driver used to have to learn."}, {"time": 869, "text": "So you would, you know, accelerate, say you're in first

just gonna get this horrible grinding sound as you coast, you know, to a dead stop in the, you know, underneath the stoplight or whatever it is."}, {"time": 903, "text": "So the first thing you have to do is learn to shift it."}, {"time": 906, "text": "And so at least for me and a lot of drivers who are going to private company CDL schools, what happens is it's kind of like a bootcamp."},

you're in this giant parking lot with one of these old trucks and just like, you know, destroying what's left of the thing, you know, and it's lurching and belching smoke and just making horrible

lugging, I mean, it can throw you right out of the seat, right?"}, {"time": 954, "text": "So it's this, it's like, you know, it's bull, you're trying to ride and it's super intimidating."}, {"time": 960, "text": "And the thing about it is that for everybody there, it's almost everybody there, it's super high stakes."}, {"time": 967, "text": "So trucking has become a job of last resort for a lot of people."}, {"time": 972, "text": "And so they, you know, they lose a job in manufacturing, they get too old to do construction any longer, right?"}, {"time": 980, "text": "The knees can no longer

you know, grown men break down crying about like how they couldn't go home and tell their son that they had been telling they were gonna, you know, go become a long haul truck driver that they'd failed."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "And it's kind of this super high stress system."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "And it's designed that way partly because as one of my trainers later told me, it's basically a two week job interview."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Like they're testing you, they're seeing like, you know, how's this person gonna respond when it's tough, you know, when they have to do the right thing and it's slow and, you know, they need to learn something, are they gonna rush, you know, or are they gonna kind of stay calm, figure it out, you know, nose to the grindstone."},

through to the job."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "Well, so the truck is such an imposing part of a traffic scenario."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "So you said like turning, it stresses me out every time I look at a truck cause they, I mean, the geometry of the problem is so tricky."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "And so if you combine the fact that they have to, like everybody, basically all the cars in the scene are staring at the truck and they're waiting, often in frustration."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "And in that mode, you have to then shift gears perfectly and move perfectly."}, {"time": 1088,

something that was really difficult?"}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Again, just, I saw people freeze up, you know, in that intersection as, you know, horns are blaring and the truck's grinding, you know,

skilled."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "Would it be fair to break trucking into the task of driving a truck into two categories?"}, {"time": 1168, "text": "One is like the local stuff, getting out of the

1181, "text": "You kind of emphasized the first one."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "What about the actual like long haul highway driving?"}, {"time": 1188, "text": "Yeah, so, I mean, and they are very different, right?"}, {"time": 1191, "text": "And the key with the long haul driving is really a set of, the way I came to understand it was a set of habits, right?"}, {"time": 1203, "text": "We have a sense of driving, particularly men, I think, have a sense of driving as like being really skilled, is like the goal and you can kind of maneuver yourself out of in and out of tight spaces with great speed and breaking and acceleration, you know."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "For a really good truck driver, it's about understanding traffic and traffic patterns and making good decisions so you never have to use those skills."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "And the really good drivers, you know, the mantra is always leave yourself an out, right?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So always have that safe place that you can put that truck in case that four wheeler in front of you who's texting loses control."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "You know, what are you gonna do in that situation?"}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And what really good truck drivers do on the highway is they just keep themselves out of those situations entirely."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "They see it, they slow down, you know, they avoid it."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And then the local driving is really something that takes just practice and routine to learn."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "You know, this quarter turn, it feels like the back of the truck sometimes is on delay when you're backing it up."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So it's like, all right, I'm gonna do a quarter turn of the wheel now to get the effect that I want like five seconds from now in where that tail of that trailer is gonna be."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "And there's just no, I mean, some people have a natural talent for that, you know, spatial visualization and kind of calculating those angles and everything, but there's really no escaping the fact that you've gotta just do it over and over again before you're gonna learn how to do it well."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "Do you mind sharing how much you were getting paid, how much you were making as a truck driver in your time as a truck driver?"}, {"time": 1310, "text": "Yeah, I started out at 25 cents a mile and then I got bumped up to 26 cents a mile."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So we had a minimum pay, which was sort of a new pay scheme that the industry had started to introduce to, you know, because there's lots of unpaid work and time."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "And so we had a minimum pay of $500 a week that you would get if you didn't drive enough miles to exceed that."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "You get paid in sort of, so you get paid when you turn the bills in, which is the paperwork that goes with the load."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "So, you know, you have to get that back to your company and then that's how they bill the customer."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "And so you might get a bunch of those bills that kind of bunch up in one week."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "So, you know, I might get a paycheck for, you know, $1,200."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "And I mean, I was a poor graduate student."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "So this was real, real money to me."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "And so I had this sort of natural incentive to, you know, earn a lot or to maximize my pay."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "Some weeks were that minimum, 500, very few."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "And then some I'd get 1200, 1300 bucks."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "Pay has gone up, you know, typical drivers now starting in the 30s, you know, in the kind of job that I was in."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "30 cents per mile, 30 to 35."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "So can we try to reverse engineer that math, how that maps to the actual hours?"}, {"time": 1394,

discussion that we'll then continue when we start talking about autonomous trucking."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "But, you know, you're saying all these cents per mile kind of thing."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "What, how does that map to like average hourly wage?"}, {"time": 1418, "text": "Yeah, so, I mean, and this is kind of the, this is also an interesting technology story in the end."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "And it's the technology story that didn't happen."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "So pay per mile was, you know, invented by companies when you couldn't surveil drivers, you didn't know what they were doing, right?"}, {"time": 1433, "text": "And you wanted them to have some skin in the game."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And so you'd say, you know, here's the load, it's going from, you know, for me, I might start in, you know, the Northeast, maybe in upstate New York with a load of beer, and say, here's this load of beer, bring it to this address in Michigan, we're gonna pay you by the mile, right?"}, {"time": 1451, "text": "If I was being paid by the hour, I might just pull over at the diner and have breakfast."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "So you're paid by the mile, but increasingly over time, the typical driver is spending more and more time doing non driving tasks."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "There's lots of reasons for that."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "One of which is railroads captured a lot of freight that goes long distances now."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "Another one is traffic congestion."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "And the other one is that drivers are pretty cheap."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And they're almost always the low people on the totem pole in some segments."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And so their time is used really inefficiently."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "So I might go to that brewery to pick up that load of Bud Light."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And, you know, their dock staff may be busy loading up five other trucks."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And they'll say, you know, go over there and sit and wait, and we'll call you on the CB when the dock's ready."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "So you wait there a couple hours, they bring you in, you know, you never know what's happening in the truck."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Sometimes they're loading it with a forklift, maybe they're throwing 14 pallets on there full of kegs."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "But sometimes it'll take them hours, you know, and you're sitting in that truck."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "And you're essentially unpaid."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "You know, then you pull out, you've got control over what you're gonna get paid based on how you drive that load."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "And then on the other end, you got a similar situation of kind of waiting, so."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "So if that's the way truck drivers are paid, then there's a low incentive for the optimization of the supply chain to make them more efficient, right?"}, {"time": 1543, "text": "To utilize truck labor more efficiently."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "So that's a technology problem that, one of several technology problems that could be addressed."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "I mean, so what did, if we just linger on it, what are we talking about in terms of dollars per hour?"}, {"time": 1566, "text": "Is it close to minimum wage?"}, {"time": 1568, "text": "Is it, you know, there's something you talk about, there was a conception or a misconception that truckers get paid a lot for their work."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "Do they get paid a lot for their work?"}, {"time": 1581, "text": "Some do."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "And I think that's part of the complexity."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "So, you know, what interested me as an ethnographer about this was, you know, I'm interested in the kind of economic conceptions that people have in their heads and how they lead to certain decisions in labor markets."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "You know, why some people become an entrepreneur and other people become a wage laborer, or, you know, why some people wanna be doctors and other people wanna be truck drivers."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "That conception, right, is getting shaped in these labor markets is the argument of the book."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "And the fact that drivers can hear, or potential drivers can hear about these, you know, workers who make $100,000 plus, which happens regularly in the trucking industry."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "There are many truck drivers who make more than $100,000 a year, you know, is an attraction."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "But the industry is highly segmented."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "And so the entry level segment, and we can probably get into this, but, you know, the industry is dominated by a few dozen really large companies that are self insured and can train new drivers."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "So if you want those good jobs, you've gotta have several years, up until recently, now the labor market's becoming tighter, but you had to have several years of accident free, you know, perfectly clean record driving to get into them."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "The other part of the segment, you know, those drivers often don't make minimum wage."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "But this leads to one of the sort of central issues that has been in the courts, and in the legislature, in some states, is, you know, what should truck drivers get paid for?"}, {"time": 1679, "text": "Right, the industry, you know, for the last 30 years or so has said, essentially, it's the hours that they log for safety reasons for the Department of Transportation, right?"}, {"time": 1691, "text": "Now, since the drivers are paid by the mile, they try to minimize those, because those hours are limited by the federal government."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "So the federal government says, you can't drive more than 60 hours in a week as a long haul truck driver."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "And so you wanna drive as many miles as you can in those 60 hours, and so you under report them, right?"}, {"time": 1711, "text": "And so what happens is the companies say, well, that guy, you know, he only said he logged 45 hours of work that week, or 50 hours of work."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "That's all we have to pay him minimum wage for."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "When in fact, typical truck driver in these jobs will work, according to most people, would sort of define it as like, okay, I'm at the customer location, I'm waiting to load, I'm doing some paperwork, you know, inspecting the truck, I'm fueling it, just waiting to, you know, get put in the dock, 80 to 90 hours would be sort of a typical work week for one of these drivers."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "And just when you look at that, they don't make minimum wage oftentimes."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "Right, just to be clear, what we're dancing around here is that a little bit over, a little bit under minimum wage is nevertheless most truck drivers seem to be making close to minimum wage."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "Like this is the, so like we maybe haven't made that clear."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "There's a few that make quite a bit of money, but like you're as an entry and for years, you're operating essentially minimum wage and potentially far less than minimum wage if you actually count the number of hours that are taken out of your life due to your dedication to trucking."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "Well, if you count like the hours taken out of your life, then you gotta go, you know, maybe a full 24."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "That's right, yeah, from family, from the high quality of life parts of your life."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "Yeah, and there's a whole nother set of rules that the Department of Labor has, which basically say that a truck driver who's dispatched away from home for more than a day should get minimum wage 24 hours a day."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "And that could be a state minimum wage, but typically what it would work out to for most drivers is that, you know, the minimum wage for a truck driver should be 50s of thousands, you know, 55, $60,000 should be the minimum wage of a truck driver."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "And you've probably heard about the truck driver shortage."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "If, you know, which I hope we can talk about, if the minimum wage for truck drivers is as it should be on the books at, you know, around $60,000, we wouldn't have a shortage of truck drivers."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "And to me, 60,000 is not a lot of money for this kind of job."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "Cause you're, this isn't, this is essentially two jobs and two jobs where you don't get to sleep with your wife or see your kids at night."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "That's 60,000 is a very little money for that."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "But you're saying if it was 60,000, you wouldn't even have the shortage."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "If that was the minimum."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "And I think that's what, now we have drivers who start in the 30s."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "Wow, but yeah."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "And I mean, so we're talking two, three jobs really, when you look at the total hours that people are working at, you know, they can work over a hundred."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "If they're a trainer, you know, training other truck drivers, well over a hundred hours a week."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "So a job of last resort."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "Maybe you can jump around from tangent to tangent."}, {"time":

jobs."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "The industry in their, you know, regular promotion of the idea that there's a shortage is always projecting forward and says, you know, we're gonna need 165,000 or so

all an absence of people who, I mean, and again, going back to what we were talking about before, getting that license is not something that you just walk down to the DMV and take the test."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "Like this is somebody who probably quit another job, was unemployed, and took months to go to a training school, paid for that training school oftentimes, left their family for months, invested in what they thought was gonna be a long term career, and then said, you know what, forget it, I can't, I can't do it."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "So yeah, so it's not just skill, it's like they were psychologically invested potentially for months, if not years, into this kinds of position as perhaps a position that if they lose their current job, they could fall too."}, {"time":

problems of the job of truck driver currently?"}, {"time": 2039, "text": "Yeah, the job, the problems with the job and the labor market, right?"}, {"time": 2042, "text": "But let's start with the job, which is, you know, again, just so much time that's not compensated directly for the amount of time."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "And that's just psychologically, and this was a big part of what I studied for the first book was, you know, that conception of like, what's my time worth, right?"}, {"time": 2064, "text": "And like, what truck drivers love is oftentimes, is that tangible outcome based compensation."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "So they say, you know what, you know, honest days work, I work hard, I get paid for what I do, I drive 500 miles today, that's what I'm gonna get paid for."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "And then you get to that dock, and they tell you, sorry, the load's not ready, go sit over there, and you stew."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "And that weight can break you psychologically because your time every second becomes more worthless."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "Or worth less."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "Yeah, and again, the industry is gonna say, for instance, okay, well, you know, they've got skin in the game, right?"}, {"time": 2106, "text": "That argument about sort of compensation based on sort of output, right?"}, {"time": 2110, "text": "But that's a holdover from when you couldn't observe truckers."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "Now they all have, you know, satellite linked computers in the trucks that tell these large companies, this driver was, you know, at this GPS location for four and a half hours, right?"}, {"time": 2122, "text": "So if you wanted to compensate them for that time directly, and the trucker can't control what's happening on that customer location, you know, they're waiting for that, you know, firm, that customer to tell them, hey, pull in there."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "And so what it becomes is just a way to shift the inefficiencies and the cost of that onto that driver."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "Now it's competitive for customers."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "So if you're Walmart, you might have your choice of a dozen different trucking companies that could move your stuff."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "And if one of them tells you, hey, you're not moving our trucks in and out of your docks fast enough, we're gonna charge you for how long our truck is sitting on your lot."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "If you're Walmart, you're gonna say, I'll go see what the other guy says, right?"}, {"time": 2164, "text":

driver."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "Doesn't that like spiral, doesn't that lead to a poor performance on the part of the truck driver and just like make the whole thing more and more inefficient and it results in lower payment to the truck driver and so on."}, {"time": 2232, "text": "It just feels like in capitalism, you should have a competing solution in terms of truck drivers."}, {"time": 2241,

"text": "How is the competition being suppressed here?"}, {"time": 2254, "text": "Yeah, so it is, the competition is based on who's cheaper."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "And this is the cheapest way to move the freight."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "Now, there are externalities, right?"}, {"time": 2264, "text": "I mean, so this is the explanation that I think is obvious for this, right?"}, {"time": 2269, "text": "There are lots of costs that, whether it's that driver's time, whether it's the time without their family, whether it's the fact that they drive through congestion and spew lots of diesel particulates into cities where kids have asthma and make our commutes longer rather than more efficiently use their time by sort of routing them around congestion and rush hour and things like that."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "This is the cheapest way to move freight."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "And so it's the most competitive."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "A big part of this is public subsidy

you're a veteran using your GI benefits, you may very well be offered training, publicly subsidized training to become a truck driver."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "And so all of these are externalities that the companies don't have to pay for."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "And so this makes it the most profitable way to move freight."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So trucks is way cheaper than trains?"},

talked to truckers about a lot."}, {"time": 2647, "text": "Yeah, what's their perception of Jimmy Hoffa, for example, of unions?"}, {"time": 2651, "text": "Yeah, so, and this was probably one of the central hypotheses that I had going in there."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "And it may sound, you know, someone who does hard science, right?"}, {"time": 2661, "text": "You may hear a social scientist,

way."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "And my initial hypothesis was that, you know, and it's very simple, that, you know, the tenure of the driver in the industry would have a strong effect on how they viewed unions."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "That, you know, somebody who had experienced unions would be more favorable and someone who had not would not be, right?"}, {"time": 2691, "text": "And that turned out to be the case without a doubt."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "But in an interesting way, which was that even the drivers who were not part of the union, who in the kind of public debate of deregulation were portrayed as these kind of small business truckers who were getting shut out by the big regulated monopolies and the Teamsters Union, you know, the corrupt Teamsters Union."}, {"time": 2719, "text": "Even those drivers longed for the days of the Teamsters because they recognized the overall market impact that they had."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "That trucking just naturally tended toward excessive competition that meant that there was no profit to be made and oftentimes you'd be operating at a loss."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "And so even these, you know, the asphalt cowboy owner operators from back in the day would tell me when the Teamsters were in power, I made a lot more money."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "And, you know, this is, you know, unions, at least those kinds of unions, like the Teamsters, you know, there's, I think a lot of misconceptions today sort of popularly about what unions did back then."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "They tied wages to productivity."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "Like that was the central thing that the Teamsters Union did."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "And, you know, there were great accounts of sort of Jimmy Hoffa's perspective for all his portrayal as sort of corrupt and criminal, and there's, you know, I'm not disputing that."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "He broke a lot of laws."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "He was remarkably open about who he was and what he did."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "He actually invited a pair, a husband and wife team of Harvard economists to follow him around and like opened up the Teamsters books to them so that they could see how he was, you know, thinking about negotiating with the employers."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "And the Teamsters, and this goes back to the beginning, and this goes back well before Hoffa, back to the, you know, 1800s, they understood that workers did better if their employers did better."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "And the only way the employers would do better was if they controlled the market."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "And so oftentimes the corruption in trucking was initiated by employers who wanted to limit competition and they knew they couldn't limit competition without the support of labor."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "And so you'd get these collusive arrangements between employers and labor to say no new trucking companies."},

there's a shortage of trucks around, it's great, rates go up, but you get too many trucks."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "It's very often that you end up operating at a loss just to keep the doors

up a bunch of trucking services and store it in a warehouse, right?"}, {"time": 2863, "text": "You gotta keep those trucks moving to pay the bills."}, {"time": 2867, "text": "Can we also lay out the

we, how many jobs are we talking about today?"}, {"time": 2877, "text": "And what kind of jobs are there?"}, {"time": 2880, "text": "So there are a number of different segments and the first part would be, you know, are you offering, the first question would be, are you offering services to the public or are you moving your own freight, right?"}, {"time": 2893, "text": "So are you a retailer, say Walmart or, you know, a paper company or something like that that's operating your own fleet of trucks?"}, {"time": 2902, "text": "That's private trucking."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "For hire are the folks who, you know, offer their services out to other customers."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "So you have private and for hire."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "In general, for hire pays less."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "Is that because of the, something you talk about with employee versus contractor situation or are they all tricked or led to become contractors?"}, {"time": 2928, "text": "That can become a part of it as a strategy, but the fundamental reason is competition."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "So those private carriers aren't in competition with other trucking fleets, right?"}, {"time": 2940, "text": "For their own in house services."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "So, you know, they tend to, and this, you know, the question of why private versus for hire because for hire is cheaper, right?"}, {"time": 2949, "text": "And so if you need that, if that trucking service is central to what you do and you cannot afford disruptions or volatility in the price of it, you keep it in house."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "You should be willing to pay more for that because it's more valuable too and you keep it in house and that."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "So that's an interesting distinction."}, {"time": 2965, "text": "What about, and this is kind of moving towards our conversation of what can and can't be automated."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "How else does it divide the different trucking jobs?"}, {"time": 2976, "text": "So the next big chunk is kind of how much stuff are you moving, right?"}, {"time": 2980, "text": "And so we have what's called truckload and truckload means, you know, you can fill up a trailer either by volume or by weight and then less than truckload."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "Less than truckload, the official definition is like less than 10,000 pounds."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "You know, this is gonna be a couple of pallets of this, a couple of pallets of that."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "The process looks really different, right?"}, {"time": 3000, "text": "So that truckload is, you know, point A to point B, I'm buying, you know, a truckload of bounty paper towels, I'm bringing it into, you know, my distribution center,

a lot like if you send a package by UPS, right, they pick all these parcels, right, figure out where they're all going, put them on planes or in trailers going to the same destination, then break them

our supply chains?"}, {"time": 3748, "text": "Whether it's making more resilient or make them less densely connected, you know, building a, it's like a, what is it?"}, {"time": 3758, "text": "You know, the Tesla model for in the automotive sector of like trying to build everything, like trying to get the factory to do as much as possible with as little reliance on widely distributed sources of the supply chain as possible."}, {"time": 3775, "text": "So maybe like rethinking how much we rely on the infrastructure of the supply chain."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "Yeah, I mean, you know, there's some basic, and I assume, right, that there are a lot of folks in corporate boardrooms looking at risk and saying that didn't go well, and maybe it could have even gone worse."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "Maybe we need to think about reshoring, right?"}, {"time": 3800, "text": "At the very least, one of the things that I'm hearing about anecdotally is that they're starting stuff up, you know,

you know, guys, inventory is getting kind of heavy and the cost of that is like, do we, can we really justify that much longer to the shareholders, right?"}, {"time": 3821, "text": "We can back off and start, you know, back, things are back to normal, let's lean out."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "Well, my hope is that there's a technology solution to a lot of aspects of this."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "So one of them on the supply chain side is collecting a lot more data, like having much more integrated and accurate representation of the inventory all over the place, and the available transportation mechanisms, the trucks, the all kinds of freight, and how in the different models of the possible catastrophes that can happen, like how will the system respond?"}, {"time": 3855, "text": "So having a really solid model that you're operating under as opposed to just kind of being in emergency response mode under poor, incomplete information, which is what seems like is more commonly the case, except for things like you said, Walmart and Amazon, they're trying to internally get their stuff together on that front, but that doesn't help the rest of the economy."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "So another exciting technological development as you write about, as you think about is autonomous trucks."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "So these are often brought up in different contexts

well, guy maybe with not a lot of other good options, right?"}, {"time": 3920, "text": "To sort of make that same income easily, and you build a robot to take his job away, right?"}, {"time": 3928,

happened that somebody was working at Uber, Uber had just bought auto, saw the book and was like, hey, can you come out and talk to our engineering teams about what life is like for truck drivers and maybe how our technology could make it better."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "And at that time, there were a lot of different ideas about how they were gonna play out, right?"}, {"time": 3960, "text": "So while the press was saying, all truckers are gonna lose their jobs, there were a lot of people in these engineering teams who thought, okay, if we've got an individual owner operator and they can only drive eight or 10 hours a day, they hop in the back, they get their rest, and the asset that they own works for them, right?"}, {"time": 3983, "text": "Sort of perfect, right?"}, {"time": 3985, "text": "And at that time, there were a bunch of reports that came out and sort of basically what people did was they took the category of truck driver."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "Some people took a

on to another topic."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "I had like been in trucking for 10 years and that's how I started looking at it."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "And it is, it's a lot more complicated."}, {"time": 4053, "text": "And the initial impacts, and here's the challenge I think, and it's not just a research challenge, it's the fundamental public policy challenge is we look at the existing

static picture of the existing industry."}, {"time": 4088, "text": "And here's the key with this is, at least in my conclusion is this is a transformative technology."}, {"time": 4097, "text": "We are not going to swap in self driving trucks for human driven trucks and all else stays the same."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "This is gonna reshape our supply chains."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "It's gonna reshape landscapes."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "It's gonna affect our ability to fight climate change."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "This is a really important technology in this space."}, {"time": 4117, "text": "Do you think it's possible to predict the future of the kind of opportunities it will create, how it will change the world?"}, {"time": 4126, "text": "So like when you have the internet, you can start saying like all the kinds of ways that office work, all jobs will be lost because it's easy to network."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "And then software engineering allows you to automate a lot of the tasks like Microsoft Excel does, you know."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "But it opened up so many opportunities, even with things that are difficult to imagine, like with the internet, I don't know, Wikipedia, which is widely making accessible information."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "And that increased the general education globally by a lot, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4162,

in?"}, {"time": 4192, "text": "It absolutely is."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "Because it's the wrong question."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "The question is, what do we want the future to be and let's shape it, right?"}, {"time": 4201, "text": "And I think this is, and this is the only point that I really wanna make in my work for the foreseeable future, is that we have got to get out of this mindset that we're just gonna let technology kind of go and it's a natural process and whatever pops out will fix the problems on the backside."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "And we've got to recognize that one, that's not what we do, right?"}, {"time": 4230, "text": "You know, and self driving vehicles is just such a perfect example, right?"}, {"time": 4235, "text": "We would not be sitting here

before aerial unmanned vehicles had really sort of proven their worth."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "They would come to be incredibly, like, you know, just blow people's minds in terms of their additional capabilities, the lower costs, you know, keeping soldiers out of harm's way."}, {"time": 4273, "text": "Now, of course they raised other problems and considerations that I think we're still

the good fight."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "And that somehow just that little bit of challenge was the essential spark of progress that now resulted in this beautiful up and down wave of hype and

supply chain."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "I did not know that."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "So they had the same kind of vision for the military as we're not talking about a vision for the civilian,

right?"}, {"time": 4384, "text": "How many great researchers and minds have been harnessed by this outcome of that spark, right?"}, {"time": 4391, "text": "And I think this is sort of theoretically about technology, right, this is what makes it sort of so great is that this is what makes us human, in my opinion, right?"}, {"time": 4398, "text": "Is that you conceive of something in your mind and

4426, "text": "But truck drivers always ask me, like, is this for real?"}, {"time": 4430, "text": "Like, is this really, like, it's harder than they think, like, right, and they can't really do this."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "And, you know, at first I was like, look, you know, this is like the defense department and like basically the top computer science and robotics departments in the

conflict."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "So we often wage war with a dream of making a better world and then realize it costs trillions of dollars and then we step back and like, and go, wait a minute, what do we actually get for this?"}, {"time": 4540, "text": "But in the space of technology, it seems like all these kinds of large efforts have paid off."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "This, you're right."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "It seems like, it seems like even GM and Ford and all these companies now are a little bit like, hey, or Toyota and even Tesla, like, are we sure about this?"}, {"time": 4562, "text": "And it's fascinating to think about when you tell the story of this, this could be one of the big first, perhaps, but by far the biggest failures of the dream in the space of technology."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "I was a skeptic for a long time because of the human factor."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "Because for business to work in the space, you have to work with humans and you have to work with humans at every level."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "So in the truck driving space, you have to work with the truck driver, but you also have to work with the society that has a certain conception of what driving means."}, {"time": 4597, "text": "And also you have to have work with businesses that are not used to this extreme level of technology, you know, in the basic operation of their business."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "So I thought it would be really difficult to move to autonomous vehicles in that way."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "But then I realized that there's certain companies that are just willing to take big risks and really innovate."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "I think the first impressive company to me was Waymo or what was used to be the Google self driving car."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "And I saw, okay, here's a company that's willing to really think longterm and really try to solve this problem, hire great engineers."}, {"time": 4638,

thought, because I'm a computer vision person, I thought there's no way a system could keep me in lane long enough for it to be a pleasant experience for me."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "So from a computer vision perspective, I thought there'd be too many failures."}, {"time": 4659, "text": "It'd be really annoying."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "It'd be a gimmick, a toy."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "It wouldn't actually create a pleasant experience."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "And when I first was gotten Tesla with Mobileye, the initial Mobileye system, it actually held to lane for quite a long time to where I could relax a little bit."}, {"time": 4674, "text": "And it was a really pleasant experience."}, {"time": 4676, "text": "I couldn't exactly explain why it's pleasant because it's not like I still have to really pay attention, but I can relax my shoulders a little bit."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "I can look around a little bit more."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "And for some reason that was really reducing the stress."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "And then over time, Tesla with a lot of the revolutionary stuff they're doing on the machine learning space made me believe that there's opportunities here to innovate, to come up with totally new ideas."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "Another very sad story that I was really excited about is Cadillac SuperCruise system."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "It is a sad story because I think I vaguely read in the news they just said they're discontinuing SuperCruise, but it's a nice innovative way of doing driver attention monitoring and also doing lane keeping."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "And it just innovation could solve this in ways we don't predict."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "And same with in the trucking space, it might not be as simple as like journalists envision a few years ago, where everything's just automated."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "It might be gradually helping out the truck driver in some ways that make their life more efficient, more effective, more pleasant, remove some of the inefficiencies that we've been talking about in totally innovative ways."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "And that I still have that dream that I believe to solve the fully autonomous driving problem we're still many years away, but on the way to solving that problem, it feels like there could be, if there's bold risk takers and innovators in this space, there's an opportunity to come up with like subtle technologies that make all the difference."}, {"time": 4776, "text": "That's actually just what I realized is sometimes little design decisions make all the difference."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "It's the Blackberry versus the iPhone."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "Why is it that you have a glass and you're using your finger for all of the work versus the buttons makes all the difference."}, {"time": 4794, "text": "This idea that now that you have a giant screen so that every part of the experience is now a digital experience."}, {"time": 4801, "text": "So you can have things like apps that change everything."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "You can't, when you first thinking about do I want a keyboard or not on a

the phone."}, {"time": 4823, "text": "And now you're making the smartphone into a computer."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "And that same way, who knows how you can transform trucks, right?"}, {"time": 4830, "text": "By like automating some parts of it, maybe adding some displays, maybe allows you to, maybe giving the truck driver some control in the supply chain to make decisions all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "So, I don't know."}, {"time": 4846, "text": "So where are you on the spectrum of hope for the role of automation in trucking?"}, {"time": 4856, "text": "I think automation is inevitable."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "And again, I think this is really going to be transformative and it's gonna be, I've studied the history of trucking technology as much as I can."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "There's not a lot of great stuff written and you kind of have to, there isn't a lot of data and places to know sort of volumes of stuff and how they're changing, et cetera."}, {"time": 4879, "text": "But the big revolutionary changes in trucking are because of constellations of factors."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "It's not just one thing, right?"}, {"time": 4889, "text": "So Daimler builds a motorized truck and I think it's 1896, right?"}, {"time": 4895, "text": "Intercity trucking."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "So basically what they use that truck for is just to swap out horses, right?"}, {"time": 4901, "text": "They basically do the same thing."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "The service doesn't really change, you know?"}, {"time": 4905, "text": "And then World War I really spurs the development of sort of bigger, larger trucks, like spreads air filled tires."}, {"time": 4914, "text": "And then we start paving roads, right?"}, {"time": 4917, "text": "And paved roads, right?"}, {"time": 4920, "text": "Air filled tires and the internal combustion engine."}, {"time": 4924, "text": "Now you got a winning mix."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "Now it met with demand for people who wanted to get out from under the thumb of the railroads, right?"}, {"time": 4932, "text": "So there was all of this pent up demand to get cheaper freight from the countryside into cities and between cities that typically had to go by rail."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "And so now, you know, 40 years after that internal combustion engine, it becomes this absolutely essential, right?"}, {"time": 4950, "text": "This necessary but not sufficient piece of technology to create the modern trucking industry in the 1930s."}, {"time": 4958, "text": "And I think self driving is gonna be, self driving trucks are gonna be part of that."}, {"time": 4963, "text": "And the idea, I guess we credit Jeff Bezos."}, {"time": 4967, "text": "The idea is, you know, okay, so Sam Walton, if we can do it like a slight tangent on sort of the importance of trucking to business strategy and sort of how it has transformed our world."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "The central insight that Sam Walton had that made him the giant that he was in influencing the way that so many people get stuff was a trucking insight."}, {"time": 4992, "text": "And so if you look at the way that he developed his system, you build a distribution center and then you ring it with stores."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "Those stores are never further out from that distribution center than a human driven truck can drive back and forth in one day."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "And so rather than the way all of his competitors were doing it with sending trucks all over the place and having people sleep overnight and sort of making the trucking service fit where they had stores, he designed the layout of the stores to fit what trucks could do."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "And so transportation and logistics become Walmart's edge and allows them to dominate the space."}, {"time": 5039, "text": "That's the challenge that Amazon has now."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "They've mastered the digital part of it."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "And now they got to figure out how do we dominate the actual physical movement that complements that."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "Others are obviously gonna follow."}, {"time": 5056, "text": "But the capabilities of these trucks is completely different than the capability of a human driven truck."}, {"time": 5062, "text": "So if you're Smith packing and you've got a bunch of meat in a warehouse and it's going to grocery distribution centers, you have that trucker probably come in the night before and you make him wait so that he has a full 10 hour break, which is what the law requires so that he can get to the furthest reaches that he can of one of those stores."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "So he can drive his full 11 hours and bring that meat so it doesn't have to sit overnight in that refrigerated trailer."}, {"time": 5095, "text": "And so their system is based on that."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "Now, what happens when that truck can now travel two times as far, right?"}, {"time": 5104, "text": "Three times as far."}, {"time": 5105, "text": "Now you don't need the warehouses where they were."}, {"time": 5108, "text": "Now you can go super lean with your inventory."}, {"time": 5111, "text": "Instead of having meat here, meat there, meat there, you can put it all right here."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "And if it's cheap enough, substitute those transportation costs for all that warehousing costs, right?"}, {"time": 5122, "text": "So this is gonna remake landscapes in the same way that big box supply chains did, right?"}, {"time": 5129, "text": "And then of course, the further compliment of that is, how do you then get it to two people at their door, right?"}, {"time": 5137, "text": "And the big box supply chain, it moves very few items in really large quantities to very few locations pretty slowly, right?"}, {"time": 5149, "text": "Ecommerce aspires to do something completely different, move huge varieties of things in small quantities, virtually everywhere as fast as possible, right?"}, {"time": 5161, "text": "And so that is like that intercity trucking under the, in the era of railroad monopolies, right?"}, {"time": 5170, "text": "The demand for that is potentially enormous, right?"}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And so there's such a, so right now I think a lot of the business plans for sort of automated trucks, right?"}, {"time": 5182, "text": "And sort of the way that the journalistic accounts portray it is like, okay, if we swap out a human for a computer, what are the labor costs per mile?"}, {"time": 5190, "text": "And like, oh, here's the profitability of self driving trucks, uh uh."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "Like this is transformative technology."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "We're gonna change the way we get stuff."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "So we could actually get a lot more trucks period with like with autonomous trucks because they would enable a very different kind of transportation networks you think."}, {"time": 5207, "text": "Yeah, here's, and this is where it's like, uh oh."}, {"time": 5210, "text": "Like, yeah, so we really thought we were gonna be electrifying trucks."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "If they're going twice as far, if they're moving three times as much, if they're going three times as far, right?"}, {"time": 5223, "text": "What does that mean for how far we are behind on batteries, right?"}, {"time": 5226, "text": "We've got sort of these, you know, ideas about like, man, we, you know, here's how far, how close we could get to meet this demand."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "That demand is gonna radically change, right?"}, {"time": 5235, "text": "These trucks are, you know, so then we've got to think about, all right, if it's not batteries, you know, how are we powering these things?"}, {"time": 5242, "text": "And how many of them are they're gonna be?"}, {"time": 5245, "text": "Like right now we've got 5 million containers that move from LA and Long Beach to Chicago on rail."}, {"time": 5254, "text": "Rail is three or four times at least more efficient than trucks in terms of greenhouse gas emissions."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "And on that lane, it varies a lot depending on demand, but maybe rail has a 20% advantage in cost, maybe 25%, but it's a couple of days slower."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "So now you cut the cost of that truck, transportation per mile by 30%."}, {"time": 5277, "text": "Now it's cheaper than rail and it gets the stuff there five days faster than rail."}, {"time": 5282, "text": "How many millions of containers are gonna leave LA and Long Beach on self driving trucks and go to Chicago?"}, {"time": 5288, "text": "And it might look very much like a train if we go with the platooning solution, where you have these rows of like, imagine like rows of like 10, like dozens of trucks or like hundreds of trucks, like some absurd situation."}, {"time": 5305, "text": "Just going from LA to Chicago, just this train, but taking up a highway."}, {"time": 5311, "text": "I mean, this is probably a good place to talk about various scenarios."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "Well, before we get there, can I just make one interesting observation that I made as a driver?"}, {"time": 5324, "text": "When you're in a truck, you're up higher."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "So you can see further and you can see the traffic patterns and cars move in packs."}, {"time": 5334, "text": "I'm sure there's academic research on this, right?"}, {"time": 5336, "text": "But they move in packs."}, {"time": 5337, "text": "They kind of bunch up behind a slower car and then a bunch of them break free."}, {"time": 5341, "text": "And this is sort of on almost free flowing highways."}, {"time": 5343, "text": "They kind of move in packs and you can kind of see them in the truck."}, {"time": 5347, "text": "So, rather than platoons, we might have like hives of trucks, right?"}, {"time": 5351, "text": "So you have like 20 trucks moving in some coordinated fashion, right?"}, {"time": 5355, "text": "And then maybe the self driving cars are, cause people don't like to be around them or whatever it is, right?"}, {"time": 5361, "text": "You might have a pod of 20 self driving cars sort of moving in a packet behind them."}, {"time": 5366, "text": "This is what, if the aliens came down or we're just observing cars, which is one of the sort of prevalent characteristics of human civilization is there seems to be these cars like moving around that would do this kind of analysis of like, huh, what's the interesting clustering of situations here, especially with autonomous vehicles, I like this."}, {"time": 5388, "text": "Okay, so what technologically speaking do you see are the different scenarios of increasing automation in trucks?"}, {"time": 5398, "text": "What are some ideas that you think about?"}, {"time": 5400, "text": "For the most part, I have no influence on sort of what these ideas were."}, {"time": 5406, "text": "So what the project was that I did was I said, technology is created by people, they solve for X and they have some conception of what they wanna do."}, {"time": 5417, "text": "And that's where we should start in sort of thinking about what the impacts might be."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "So I went and I talked to everybody I could find who was thinking about developing a self driving truck."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "And the question was essentially, what are you trying to build?"}, {"time": 5432, "text": "Like, what do you envision this thing doing?"}, {"time": 5435, "text": "It turned out that that for a lot of them was an afterthought."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "They knew the sort of technological capabilities that a self driving vehicle would have."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "And those were the problems that they were tackling."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "They were engineers and computer scientists and... Oh, robotics people, I love you so much."}, {"time": 5453, "text": "This is, I could talk forever about this, but yes, there's a technology problem, let's focus on that and we'll figure out the actual impact on society, how it's actually going to be applied, how it's actually going to be integrated from a policy and from a human perspective, from a business perspective later."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "First, let's solve the technology problem."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "That's not how life works, friends, but okay, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I'm sure you know the division of labor in these companies, right?"}, {"time": 5478, "text": "There's sort of a business development side, you know, and then there's the engineering side, right?"}, {"time": 5482, "text": "And the engineers are like, oh my God, what are these business development people, you know, why are they involved in this process?"}, {"time": 5490, "text": "So I ended up sort of coming up with a few different ideas that people seem to be batting around and then really tried to zero in on a layman's understanding of the limitations, right?"}, {"time": 5502, "text": "And it turns out that's really obvious and quite simple."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "Highway driving's a lot simpler, right?"}, {"time": 5509, "text": "So, you know, the plan is simplify the problem, right?"}, {"time": 5513, "text": "And focus on highways because city driving is so much more complicated."}, {"time": 5519, "text": "So from that, I came up with basically six scenarios, actually I came up with five that the developers were talking about."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "And then one that I thought was a good idea that I had read about, I think in like 2013 or 2014, which was actually something that the US military was looking at."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "I actually first heard about the idea of this kind of automation, at least in sketched out form in like 2011, I guess it was with Peloton, which was this sort of early technology entrant into the trucking industry, which was working on platooning trucks."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "And all they were doing was, you know, a cooperative adaptive cruise control as they came to call it."}, {"time": 5565, "text": "And we ended up on a panel together."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "And it's kind of interesting because I was on that panel because I was thinking about how we got the best return on investment for fuel efficient technologies."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "And if it's cool, I'll sort of set this up because it does, it comes into sort of the story of some of these scenarios."}, {"time": 5585, "text": "So when I studied the drivers, you had this like complete difference in the driving tasks, like we were talking about before with long haul and city, right?"}, {"time": 5598, "text": "And you're not paid in the city, you've got congestion, the turns are tight."}, {"time": 5605, "text": "There's lots of, you know, pedestrians, you know, all the things that self driving trucks don't like, truckers don't like, right?"}, {"time": 5611, "text": "And they're not paid, there's lots of waiting time."}, {"time": 5615, "text": "And then in the highway, they get to cruise, they're getting paid, they have control, they go at their own pace, they're making money, they're happy."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "Well, it turned out, I guess it was around 2010, this is still when we were thinking about regenerative braking, you know, and hybrid trucks being sort of like the solution."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "The problems with them sort of, and the advantages, you know, also split on what I was thinking of as kind of the rural urban divide at that time, right?"}, {"time": 5641, "text": "So, like you got the regenerative braking, right?"}, {"time": 5645, "text": "You can make the truck lighter, you can keep it local, right?"}, {"time": 5648, "text": "You don't get any benefit from that, you know, hybrid electric on the rural highway, you want aerodynamics, right?"}, {"time": 5657, "text": "There, you want low rolling resistance tires and these super aerodynamic sleek trucks, right?"}, {"time": 5663, "text": "Where we know with off the shelf technology today, we could double the fuel economy, more than double the fuel economy of the typical truck in that highway segment, if we segmented the duty cycle, right?"}, {"time": 5674, "text": "And so in the urban environment, you want a clean burning truck, so you're not giving kids asthma, you want it lighter, so it's not destroying those less strong pavements, right?"}, {"time": 5685, "text": "You're not, you can make tighter turns, you don't need a sleeper cab, because the driver, you know, hopefully is getting home at night, right?"}, {"time": 5691, "text": "In the long haul, you want that super aerodynamic stuff."}, {"time": 5694, "text": "Now that doesn't get you anything in the city, and in fact, it causes all kinds of problems, because you turn too tight, you crunch up all the aerodynamics that connect the tractor and the trailer."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "So the idea that I had was like, okay, what if we deliberately segmented it?"}, {"time": 5708, "text": "Like, what if we created these droplets outside cities, where, you know, a local city driver who's paid by the hour kind of runs these trailers out once they're loaded, you know, doesn't sit there and wait while it's being loaded, they drop off a trailer, they go pick up one that's loaded, they run it out, when it's loaded, they call them, and they just run them out there and stage them."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "It's like an Uber driver, but for truckloads."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "Yeah, and we have like intermodal."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "We have like, basically this would be the equivalent of like rail to truck intermodal, right?"}, {"time": 5737, "text": "So you put it on the rail, and then, you know, a trucker picks it up and delivers it, right?"}, {"time": 5740, "text": "So instead of having the rail, you'd have these super aerodynamic, hopefully platoons, or what at the time was called long combination vehicles, which is basically two trailers connected together, right?"}, {"time": 5751, "text": "Because this is like a huge productivity gain, right?"}, {"time": 5754, "text": "And then instead of that driver like me, I would pick up something in upstate New York, drive to Michigan, drive to Alabama, you know, drive to Wisconsin, drive to Florida, you know, I'd get home every two weeks."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "If I'm just running that, you know, that double trailer, I might be able to go back and forth from Chicago to Detroit, right?"}, {"time": 5771, "text": "Take two trailers there, pick up two trailers going back, right, and be home every night."}, {"time": 5776, "text": "Now, the problem with that at the time, or one of them was, you know, bridge weights."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "So you can't, not all bridges can handle that much weight on them."}, {"time": 5785, "text": "They can't handle these doubles, right?"}, {"time": 5786, "text": "And some places can, some places can't."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "And so this platooning idea was happening at the same time, and we ended up on the same panel, and the founders were like, hey, so what's it like to follow really close behind another truck?"}, {"time": 5799, "text": "Which was kind of the stage that they were at was like, you know, what's that experience gonna be like?"}, {"time": 5803, "text": "And I was like, truckers aren't gonna like it, you know?"}, {"time": 5806, "text": "I mean, that's just like the cardinal rule is following distance."}, {"time": 5809, "text": "Like that's the one you really shouldn't violate, right?"}, {"time": 5812, "text": "And when you're out on the road, like you have that trucker like right on your ass, you know, people remember that."}, {"time": 5818, "text": "They don't remember the 99.9% of truckers that are not on their ass, you know?"}, {"time": 5823, "text": "Like they're very careful about that."}, {"time": 5825, "text": "But when the trucks are really close together, there's benefits in terms of aerodynamics."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "So that's the idea."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "So like if you want to get some benefits of a platoon, you want them to be close together, but you're saying that's very uncomfortable for truckers."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, I think that ended up at the, I mean, Peloton I think is sort of winding down their work on this."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "And I think that ended up being still an open question."}, {"time": 5851, "text": "Like, and I had a chance to interview a couple drivers who at least one, maybe two of which had actually driven in their platoons."}, {"time": 5858, "text": "And I got completely different experiences."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "Some of them were like, it's really cool."}, {"time": 5863, "text": "You know, I'm like in communication with that other driver."}, {"time": 5866, "text": "You know, I can see on a screen what's out, you know, the front of his truck."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "And then some were like, it's too close."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "And it might be one of those things that's just, you know, it takes an adjustment to sort of get there."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "So you get the aerodynamic advantage, which, you know, saves fuel."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "There's some problems though, right?"}, {"time": 5883, "text": "So, you know, you're getting that aerodynamic advantage because there's a low pressure system in front of that following truck."}, {"time": 5890, "text": "But the engine is designed with higher pressure feeding that engine, right?"}, {"time": 5895, "text": "So there are sort of adjustments that you need to make and, you know, still the benefits are there."}, {"time": 5901, "text": "That's one scenario."}, {"time": 5902, "text": "And that's just the automation of that acceleration and braking."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "Starsky, which, you know, probably a lot of your listeners heard about, was working on another scenario, which was, you know, to solve that local problem was gonna do teleoperation, right?"}, {"time": 5920, "text": "Sort of remote piloting."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "I had the chance to, you know, sort of watch them do that."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "You know, they drove a truck in Florida from San Francisco in one of their offices."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "That was really interesting."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "In case it's not clear, teleoperation means you're controlling the truck remotely, like it's a video game."}, {"time": 5941, "text": "So you've gotten the chance to witness it."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "Does it actually work?"}, {"time": 5946, "text": "Yeah, I mean, so it's a... What are the pros and cons?"}, {"time": 5950, "text": "You know, one of the problems with doing research like this with all these Silicon Valley folks is the NDAs."}, {"time": 5957, "text": "So, you know, I don't know what I'm able to say about sort of watching it, but obviously they're public statements about sort of what the challenges are, right?"}, {"time": 5965, "text": "And it's about the latency and the ability to sort of in real time."}, {"time": 5971, "text": "There's challenges there."}, {"time": 5972, "text": "Let me say one thing."}, {"time": 5973, "text": "So I'm talking to the...

actually."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "I'm a huge fan of his because he was, I think the founder of Anki, which is a toy robotics company."}, {"time": 5992, "text": "So I love human robot interaction."}, {"time": 5995, "text": "And he created one of the most effective and beautiful toy robots."}, {"time": 6003, "text": "Anyway, I keep complaining to them on email privately that there's way too much marketing in these conversations and not enough showing off both the challenge and the beauty of the engineering efforts."}, {"time": 6016, "text": "And that seems to be the case for a lot of these Silicon Valley tech companies."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "They put up this, you're talking about NDAs."}, {"time": 6026, "text": "For some reason, rightfully or wrongfully, because

"Can we reduce some of the costs while still having reliability, like catch when the vehicle fails by having teleoperation?"}, {"time": 6193, "text": "So that's for you scenario number two is to use teleoperation as part of the picture."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "Yeah, let me follow up on that question of how hard driving is, because this becomes a big question for researchers who are thinking about labor market impacts, because we start from a perspective of what's hard or easy for humans."}, {"time": 6214, "text": "And so if you were to look at truck driving prior to a lot, I mean, there's been a lot of thinking and debate in academic research circles around sort of how you estimate labor impacts, what these models look like."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "And a lot of it is about how automatable is a job, object recognition, really easy for people, right?"}, {"time": 6234, "text": "Really hard for computers."}, {"time": 6236, "text": "And so there's a whole bunch of things that truck drivers do that we see as super easy and as it would have been characterized 10 years ago, routine, and it's not for a computer, right?"}, {"time": 6250, "text": "It turns out to be something that we do naturally that is sort of cutting edge, right?"}, {"time": 6256, "text": "Computer science."}, {"time": 6257, "text": "So on the teleoperation question, I think this is a more interesting one than people would like to sort of let on, I think, publicly."}, {"time": 6269, "text": "There are gonna be problems, right?"}, {"time": 6272, "text": "And this is one of the complexities of sort of putting these things out in the world."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "And if you see the real world of trucking, you realize, wow, it's rough."}, {"time": 6280, "text": "There are dirt lots, there's gravel, there's salt and ice and cold weather, and there's equipment that just gets left out in the middle of nowhere, and the brakes don't get maintained, and somebody was supposed to service something and they didn't, you know?"}, {"time": 6293, "text": "And so you imagine, okay, we've got this vehicle that can drive itself, which is gonna require a whole lot of sensors to tell it that the doors are still closed and the trailer's still hooked up and each of the tires has adequate pressure, and any number of, probably hundreds of sensors that are gonna be sort of relaying information."}, {"time": 6311, "text": "And one of them, after 500,000 miles or whatever, it goes out."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "Now, do we have some fleet of technicians sort of continually cruising the highways and sort of servicing these things as they do what?"}, {"time": 6325, "text": "Pull themselves off to the side of the road and say, I've got a sensor fault, I'm pulling over, or maybe there's some level of safety critical faults or whatever it might be."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "So that suggests that there might be a role for teleoperation even with self driving."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "And when I push people on it in the conversations, they all are like, yeah, we kind of have that on the bottom of the list, figure out how to rescue truck, you know?"}, {"time": 6354, "text": "I guess on the to do list, right?"}, {"time": 6356, "text": "After solving the self driving question is like, yeah, what do we do with the problems, right?"}, {"time": 6362, "text": "I mean, no, we could imagine like, all right, we have some protocol that the truck is not, realizes the system says not safe for operation, pull to the side."}, {"time": 6373, "text": "Good, you have a crash, but now you got a truck stranded on the side of the road."}, {"time": 6377, "text": "You're gonna send out somebody to like calibrate things and check out what's going on, or that sounds like expensive labor, it sounds like downtime, it sounds like the kind of things that shippers don't like to happen to their freight, you know, in a just in time world."}, {"time": 6390, "text": "And so wouldn't it be great if you could just sort of, you know, loop your way into the controls of that truck and say, all right, we've got a sensor out, says that the tire is bad, but I can see visually from the camera, looks fine, I'm gonna drive it to our next depot, you know, maybe the next rider or Penske location, right?"}, {"time": 6408, "text": "Sort of all these service locations around and have a technician take a look at it."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "So teleoperation often gets this, you know, so dismissive, you know, commentary from other folks working on other scenarios."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "But I think it's potentially more relevant than we hear publicly."}, {"time": 6429, "text": "But it's a hard problem."}, {"time": 6431, "text": "And, you know, for me, I've gotten a chance to interact with people that take on hard problems and solve them and they're rare."}, {"time": 6441, "text": "What Tesla has done with their data engine."}, {"time": 6445, "text": "So I thought autonomous driving cannot be solved without collecting a huge amount of data and organizing it well, not just collecting, but organizing it."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "And exactly what Tesla is doing now is what I thought it would be, like I couldn't see car companies doing that, including Tesla."}, {"time": 6462, "text": "And now that they're doing that, it's like, oh, okay."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "So it's possible to take on this huge effort seriously."}, {"time": 6468, "text": "To me, teleoperation is another huge effort like that."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "It's like taking seriously what happens when it fails."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "What's the, in the case of Waymo for the consumer, like ride sharing, what's the customer experience like?"}, {"time": 6484, "text": "There's a bunch of videos online now where people are like the car fails and it pulls off to the side and you call like customer service and you're basically sitting there for a long time and there's confusion."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "And then there's a rescue that comes and they start to drive."}, {"time": 6497, "text": "I mean, just the whole experience is a mess that has a ripple effect to how you trust in the entirety of the experience."}, {"time": 6505, "text": "But like actually taking on the problem of that failure case and revolutionizing that experience, both for trucking and for ride sharing, that's an amazing opportunity there because that feels like it would change everything."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "If you can reliably know when the failures happen, which they will, you have a clear plan that doesn't significantly affect the efficiency of the whole process, that could be the game changer."}, {"time": 6531, "text": "And if teleoperation is part of that, it could be just like you're saying, it could be teleoperation or it could be like a fleet of rescuers that can come in, which is a similar idea."}, {"time": 6541, "text": "But teleoperation, obviously that allows you to just have a network of monitors of people monitoring this giant fleet of trucks and taking over when needed."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "And it's a beautiful vision of the future where there's millions of robots and only thousands of humans monitoring those millions of robots."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "That seems like a perfect dance of allowing humans to do what they do best and allowing robots to do what they do best."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I think there are, and we just applied for an NSF we didn't get, anybody's watching, but with some folks from Wisconsin who do teleoperation, right?"}, {"time": 6583, "text": "And some of this is used for like rovers and I mean, really high stakes, difficult problems."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "But one of the things we wanted to study were these mines, these Rio Tinto mines in Australia where they remotely pilot the trucks."}, {"time": 6599, "text": "And there's some autonomy, I guess, but it's overseen by a remote operator and it's near Perth and it's quite remote and they retrained the truck drivers to be the remote operators, right?"}, {"time": 6615, "text": "There's autonomy in the port of Rotterdam and places like that where there are jobs there."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "And so I think, and maybe we'll get to this later, but there's a real policy question about sort of who's gonna lose and what we do about it and whether or not there are opportunities there that maybe we need to put our thumb on the scale a little bit to make sure that there's some give back to the community that's taking the hit."}, {"time": 6641, "text": "So for instance, if there were teleoperation centers, maybe they go in these communities that we disproportionately source truck drivers from today."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "Now, I mean, what does that mean?"}, {"time": 6652, "text": "It may not be the cheapest place to do it if they don't have great connectivity and it may not be where the upper level managers wanna be and places like that, issues like that, right?"}, {"time": 6661, "text": "So I do think it's an interesting question, both from sort of a practical scenario situation of how it's gonna work, but also from a policy perspective."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "So there's platoons, there's teleoperation, and this is taking care of some of the highway driving that we're talking about."}, {"time": 6681, "text": "Is there other ideas like, is there other ideas, scenarios that you have for autonomous trucks?"}, {"time": 6688, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, the most obvious one actually is just facility to facility, right?"}, {"time": 6694, "text": "The sort of, it can't go everywhere, but a lot of logistics facilities are very close to interstates and they're on big commercial roads without bikes and parked cars and all that stuff."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "And some of the jobs that I think are really first on the chopping block are these LTL, that less than truckload, what's called line haul, right?"}, {"time": 6717, "text": "So these are the drivers who go from terminal to terminal with those full trailers."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "And those facilities are often located strategically to avoid congestion, right?"}, {"time": 6727, "text": "And to be in big industrial facilities."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "So you could imagine that being the first place you see a Waymo self driving truck rollout might be sort of direct facility to facility for UPS or FedEx or less than truckload care."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "And the idea there is fully driverless, so potentially not even a driver in the truck, it's just going from facility to facility empty, zero occupancy."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "Yeah, and those, because that labor is expensive, they don't keep those drivers out overnight, those drivers do a run back and forth typically, or in a team go back and forth in one day."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "So from the people you've spoken with so far, what's your sense?"}, {"time": 6770, "text": "How far are we away from, which scenario is closest and how far away are we from that scenario of autonomy being a big part of our trucking fleet?"}, {"time": 6782, "text": "Most folks are focused on another scenario, which is the exit to exit, right?"}, {"time": 6787, "text": "Which looks like that urban truck ports thing that I laid out earlier."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "So you have a human driven truck that comes out to a drop lot, it meets up with an autonomous truck, that truck then drives it on the interstate to another lot, and then a human driver picks it up."}, {"time": 6807, "text": "There are a couple variations maybe on that."}, {"time": 6812, "text": "So, or let me just run through the last two scenarios."}, {"time": 6847, "text": "And so you have a self driving truck that's not driverless, right?"}, {"time": 6851, "text": "And just to clarify, because Tesla uses the term autopilot instead of airplanes, and so everybody uses the word autopilot, we're referring to essentially full autonomy, but because it's exit to exit, the truck driver is onboard the truck, but they're sleeping in the back or whatever."}, {"time": 6866, "text": "Yeah, and this gets to the really weedy policy questions, right?"}, {"time": 6871, "text": "So basically for the Department of Transportation, for you to be off duty for safety reasons, you have to be completely relieved of all responsibility."}, {"time": 6879, "text": "So that truck has to not encounter a construction site or inclement weather or whatever it might be, and call to you and say, hey, you know, or I mean, obviously, right, we're imagining connected vehicles as well, right?"}, {"time": 6893, "text": "So you're in a self driving truck, you're in the back and trucks 20 miles ahead experience some problem, right?"}, {"time": 6901, "text": "That may require teleoperation or whatever it is, right?"}, {"time": 6904, "text": "And it signals to your truck, hey, you know, tell the driver 20 miles ahead, he's got to hop in the seat."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "That would mean that they're on duty according to the way that the current rules are written, they have some responsibility."}, {"time": 6915, "text": "And part of that is, you know, we need them to get rest, right?"}, {"time": 6919, "text": "They need to have uninterrupted sleep."}, {"time": 6922, "text": "So that's what I call autopilot."}, {"time": 6925, "text": "The final scenario is one that I thought was actually the one scenario that was good for labor, you know, which I proposed is I was like, well, here's an idea, you know, that would be like, actually good for workers."}, {"time": 6941, "text": "And just another brief aside here."}, {"time": 6946, "text": "The history of trucking over the last, you know, 40 years, there's been a lot of technological change."}, {"time": 6972, "text": "You've probably seen that on YouTube, if not, you know, check it out, you know, truck can opener."}, {"time": 6978, "text": "You know, there's some bridges that are famous for it, right, and there's one I think called the can opener and you can find on YouTube."}, {"time": 6986, "text": "And, you know, you had to log those hours like manually and sort of do the math and plan your work routine."}, {"time": 6994, "text": "And I would do this every day."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "I'd say like, okay, I'm gonna get up at five."}, {"time": 6997, "text": "I've got to think about Buffalo and there's traffic there."}, {"time": 7000, "text": "So I wanna be through Buffalo by 6.30, you know, and then that'll put me, you know, in Cleveland at, you know, 9.30, which means I'll miss that rush hour, right, which is gonna put me in Chicago, you know, and so you do this and now today, you know, 15 years later, truck drivers don't have to do any of that."}, {"time": 7021, "text": "You know, you don't have to shift the truck, you don't have to map, you know, you can figure out the least congested route to go on and your hours of service are recorded or a good portion of them are reported automatically."}, {"time": 7037, "text": "All of that has been a substantial de skilling that has, you know, put downward pressure on wages and allowed companies to kind of speed up, monitor and direct, I mean, the key technology, you know, that I did work under is satellite linked computers."}, {"time": 7052, "text": "So before you could kind of go out and plan your own work and the boss really couldn't see what you were doing and push you and say, you know, you've been on break for 10 hours, why aren't you moving?"}, {"time": 7061, "text": "You know, and you might tell them, you know, cause I'm tired, you know, like I didn't sleep well, I've got to get a couple more hours, you know, they're only gonna accept that so many times or at least some of those dispatchers are."}, {"time": 7071, "text": "So all this technology has made the job sort of, you know, de skilled the job, you know, hurt drivers in the labor market, made the work worse."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "So I think the burden it's really on the technologists who are like, oh, this will make truck driver jobs better and sort of envision ways that it would."}, {"time": 7091, "text": "It's like, the burden's really, a proof is really on you to sort of really clearly lay out what that is gonna look like because it's 30 or 40 years of history suggests that that technology into labor markets where workers are really weak and cheap is what wins that new technology doesn't help workers or raise their wages."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "So it lowers the bar of entry in terms of skill."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "So that's really, that's tough."}, {"time": 7123, "text": "That's tough to know what to do with because yeah, from a technology perspective, you wanna make the life of the people doing the job today easier."}, {"time": 7132, "text": "Is that what you want?"}, {"time": 7134, "text": "No, but that like, when you think about like what exactly, because the reality is you will make their life potentially a little bit easier, but that will allow the companies to then hire people that are less skilled, get those people that were previously working there fired or lower wages."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "And so the result of this easier is a lower quality of life."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "That's dark actually."}, {"time": 7163, "text": "But you were saying that was for you initially the hopeful."}, {"time": 7167, "text": "Oh no, so I'll get to that."}, {"time": 7168, "text": "But one more thing, cause this is not stopping."}, {"time": 7171, "text": "And this is another interesting question about the sort of automation."}, {"time": 7174, "text": "And I think Uber is an interesting example here where it's like, okay, if we had self driving trucks or self driving cars, we could automate what used to be taxi service."}, {"time": 7186, "text": "There's a whole bunch of stuff that's already been automated, like the dispatching."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "So the dispatchers are already out of work in rideshare and the payment is already automated."}, {"time": 7195, "text": "So you have to automate steps like this."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "So you have to have that initial link to dispatch the truck."}, {"time": 7200, "text": "You have to have the automated mapping."}, {"time": 7204, "text": "So we're sort of done all this incremental automation that could make the truck completely driverless."}, {"time": 7211, "text": "There's some important things happening right now with the remaining good jobs."}, {"time": 7215, "text": "So what you're really paying for when you get a good truck driver is, like I said, you get those kind of local skills of like backing and congested traffic."}, {"time": 7226, "text": "Those, it's really impressive to watch and there's some value on it certainly, but it's relatively low value in the actual driving technique, right?"}, {"time": 7235, "text": "So you bump something backing into the dock, it might be a couple of thousand dollars because you ruin a canopy or something over a dock or tear up a trailer."}, {"time": 7245, "text": "What you really want, those highly skilled conscientious drivers, and that's really what it is."}, {"time": 7252, "text": "And that's what computers are really good at is about being conscientious, right?"}, {"time": 7255, "text": "In the sense of like, they pay attention continually, right?"}, {"time": 7259, "text": "And how I was describing those long haul segments where the driver just keeps out of the situations that could become problematic and just, they don't look at their phone."}, {"time": 7270, "text": "I mean, they take the job seriously and they're safe and you can give somebody a skills test, right?"}, {"time": 7276, "text": "As a CDL examiner, you could take them out and say, all right, I need you to go around these cones and drive safely through this school zone."}, {"time": 7284, "text": "But what really proves that you're a safe driver is two years without an accident, right?"}, {"time": 7289, "text": "Because that means that day after day, hour after hour, mile after mile, you did the right thing, right?"}, {"time": 7296, "text": "And not when it was like, oh, some situations emerging, but just consistently over time kept yourself out of accident situations."}, {"time": 7303, "text": "And you can see this with drivers who are a million or 2 million safe miles."}, {"time": 7307, "text": "The value of those drivers for Walmart is they don't run over minivans."}, {"time": 7312, "text": "The company I worked for, they ran over minivans on a regular basis."}, {"time": 7317, "text": "So when I was trained, they said, we kill 20 people a year."}, {"time": 7323, "text": "We send someone to the funeral, there's a big check involved, don't be that."}, {"time": 7328, "text": "We don't wanna go to your funeral and you don't wanna be the person who caused that funeral."}, {"time": 7335, "text": "Okay, so they just write that off."}, {"time": 7338, "text": "Okay, that's just part of the business model."}, {"time": 7340, "text": "Now, forward collision avoidance can basically eliminate the vast majority of those accidents."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "That's what the value of a really expensive conscientious driver is based on."}, {"time": 7355, "text": "They don't run over minivans."}, {"time": 7357, "text": "So as soon as you have that forward collision avoidance, what's gonna happen to the wages of those drivers?"}, {"time": 7363, "text": "By way of a therapy session, help me understand, is a collision avoidance, automated collision avoidance systems, are they good or bad for society?"}, {"time": 7377, "text": "Yeah, I mean, this is, they're good."}, {"time": 7383, "text": "But what do we do about the pain of a workforce in the short term because their wages are gonna go down because the job starts requiring less and less skill?"}, {"time": 7398, "text": "Is there a hopeful message here where other jobs are created?"}, {"time": 7402, "text": "So I'm a sociologist, right?"}, {"time": 7404, "text": "So I'm gonna think about what's the structure behind that that creates that pain, right?"}, {"time": 7410, "text": "And it's ownership, right?"}, {"time": 7412, "text": "We don't call it capitalism for nothing."}, {"time": 7415, "text": "What capitalists do is they figure out cheaper, more efficient ways to do stuff."}, {"time": 7420, "text": "And they use technology to do that oftentimes, right?"}, {"time": 7423, "text": "This is the remarkable history of the last couple centuries and all the productivity gains is, people who were in a competitive market saying, if I have to do it, right?"}, {"time": 7436, "text": "I don't have a choice."}, {"time": 7437, "text": "Cause like my competitor over there is gonna eat my lunch if I'm not on my game."}, {"time": 7444, "text": "I've got to invest in this technology to make it more efficient, to make it cheaper."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "And what do you look for?"}, {"time": 7452, "text": "You look for oftentimes, you look for labor costs, right?"}, {"time": 7456, "text": "You look for high value labor."}, {"time": 7457, "text": "If I can take a hundred and, a lot of these truck drivers make good money, a hundred thousand dollars, good benefits, vacation, retirement."}, {"time": 7465, "text": "If I can replace them with a $35,000 worker when I'm competing with maybe a low wage retail employer rather than some other more expensive employers for skilled blue collar workers, I'm gonna do that."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "And that's just, that's what we do."}, {"time": 7481, "text": "And so I think those are the bigger questions around this technology, right?"}, {"time": 7486, "text": "Is like, are workers gonna get screwed by this?"}, {"time": 7490, "text": "Like, yeah, most likely."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "Like that's what we do."}, {"time": 7494, "text": "So one of the things you say is, I mean, first of all, the numbers of workers that will feel this pain is not perhaps as large as the journalists kind of articulate, but nevertheless, the pain is real."}, {"time": 7505, "text": "And I guess my question here is, do you have an optimistic vision about the transformative effects of autonomous trucks on society?"}, {"time": 7517, "text": "Like if you look 20 years from now and perhaps see maybe 30 years from now, perhaps see these autonomous trucks doing the various parts of the scenarios you listed."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "And there's just hundreds of thousands of them, just like veins, like blood flowing through veins on the interstate system."}, {"time": 7543, "text":

I know that higher skilled jobs are created by technological advancement, right?"}, {"time": 7569, "text": "I mean, there are big questions about how many of them, right, so the idea that we would create more expensive labor positions, right, with a new technology, right?"}, {"time": 7580, "text": "You better check your business plan if your idea is to take a bunch of low wage labor and replace it with the same amount of high wage labor, right, so there's a question about how many of those jobs."}, {"time": 7591, "text": "And there's the really important social and political question of are they the same people, right?"}, {"time": 7598, "text": "And do they live in the same places?"}, {"time": 7599, "text": "And I think that kind of geography is a huge issue here with the impacts,

union folks who are gonna try to slow autonomy and lots of red state representatives in the house maybe who wanna stand up for their trucker constituents."}, {"time": 7621, "text": "So just to defend myself."}, {"time": 7623, "text": "Yeah, and to elaborate, I think economics as a field is not good at measuring the landscape of human pain and suffering."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "So sometimes you can forget in the numbers that it's real lives that are at stake."}, {"time": 7635, "text": "That's what I suppose sociology is better at doing."}, {"time": 7638, "text": "So we try sometimes, sometimes."}, {"time": 7640, "text": "Well, the problem with, I mean, I'm somebody who loves psychology and psychiatry and a little bit, I guess, of sociology."}, {"time": 7648, "text": "I realize how

different case."}, {"time": 7766, "text": "That low wage worker is driving a truck that they might, the wheels might roll seven to eight hours a day."}, {"time": 7772, "text": "That's what the truck

think about these problems is I try to find analogies, right?"}, {"time": 7801, "text": "Sort of labor processes and things that make economic sense that seem in the same area of the economy, but have some different characteristics for workers, right?"}, {"time": 7815, "text": "And sort of try to figure out why does the economics work there, right?"}, {"time": 7819, "text": "And so if you look at those really good jobs, the most likely way that you as a passenger car driver would know that it's one of those drivers is that there are multiple trailers, right?"}, {"time": 7833, "text": "So you see these, like maybe it's three small trailers, maybe it's two sort of medium sized trailers."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "Some places you might even see two really big trailers together."}, {"time": 7842, "text": "You do that because labor is expensive, right?"}, {"time": 7844, "text": "And it's highly skilled."}, {"time": 7845, "text": "And so you use it efficiently and you say, all right,

beyond, this is one of the challenge obviously of being a researcher who doesn't really have any background in the technology, right?"}, {"time": 8164, "text": "So I can dream this up."}, {"time": 8165, "text": "I don't, you know, I have no idea if it's feasible."}, {"time": 8168, "text": "Well, let me speak, you spoke to the PhDs in economics."}, {"time": 8170, "text": "Let me speak to the PhDs in computer science."}, {"time": 8172, "text": "If you think platooning is as hard as the full self driving problem, we need to talk, because I think that's ridiculous."}, {"time": 8180, "text": "I think platooning, and in fact, I think platooning is an interesting idea for ride sharing as well, for the general autonomous driving problem, not just trucking, but obviously trucking is the big, big benefit, because the number of A to B points in trucking is much, much lower than the general ride sharing problem."}, {"time": 8198, "text": "But anyway, I think that's a great idea, but you're saying it was removed."}, {"time": 8202, "text": "Yeah, and so you can go, you know, and listeners could go to these reports."}, {"time": 8207, "text": "They're publicly available."}, {"time": 8208, "text": "And they explain why in the footnote."}, {"time": 8211, "text": "And they note that there was this other scenario suggested by at least me, and I can't remember if they said someone else did too."}, {"time": 8218, "text": "But they said, you know, we didn't include it because no developers were working on it."}, {"time": 8225, "text": "Full disclosure, that was the approach that I took in my research, right?"}, {"time": 8231, "text": "Which was to go to the developers and say, what's your vision, right?"}, {"time": 8234, "text": "What are you trying to develop?"}, {"time": 8237,

"Like, here's one that I have, you know, people aren't talking about that could be cool."}, {"time": 8245, "text": "Now, again, it had been proposed in like 2014 for like fuel convoys."}, {"time": 8251, "text": "So you could just have like one super armored lead fuel truck, right?"}, {"time": 8255, "text": "In a, you know, bringing fuel to forward operating bases in Afghanistan."}, {"time":

list."}, {"time": 8276, "text": "And so, but here's the thing, right?"}, {"time": 8278, "text": "This is the Department of Transportation, right?"}, {"time": 8281, "text": "And the Department of

should."}, {"time": 8304, "text": "And I think that's the fundamental shift that we need to have, right?"}, {"time": 8307, "text": "I've been involved with this a little bit like NHTSA and DOT."},

it for a while, just to see."}, {"time": 8321, "text": "You don't, you think that's, you think DOT should provide ideas themselves."}, {"time": 8326, "text": "Well, so this is the, this is the great trick in policy of private actors, is you get narrow mandates for government agencies, right?"}, {"time": 8338, "text": "So, you know, the safety case will be handled by organizations whose mandate is safety."}, {"time": 8344, "text": "So the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, who is, you know, going to be a key player, I argue in an article that I wrote, you know, they're going to be a key player in actually determining which scenario is most profitable by setting the rules for truck drivers."}, {"time": 8360, "text": "Their mandate is safety, right?"}, {"time": 8362, "text": "Now they have lots of good people there who want, you know, who care about truck drivers and who wish truck drivers jobs were better, but they don't have the authority to say, hey, we're going to write this rule because it's good for truck drivers, right?"}, {"time": 8375, "text": "And so when you, you know, we need to say, you know, as a society, we need to not restrict technology, not stand in the way of things."}, {"time": 8385, "text": "We need to harness it towards the goals that matter, right?"}, {"time": 8388, "text": "Not whatever comes out the end of the pipeline because it's the easiest

to the moon, you know, we did that, and there were tremendous benefits that followed from it, right?"}, {"time": 8409, "text": "And we do this all the time in, you know, trying to cure cancer or whatever it is, right?"}, {"time": 8413, "text": "I mean, we can do this, right?"}, {"time": 8417, "text": "Now the interesting sort of epilogue to that story is, you know, six months or so, I don't know how long it was, after those meetings in which that sixth scenario was not considered, a company called Locomation, you know, ends up using that, essentially that basic scenario with a slight variation."}, {"time": 8439, "text": "So they leave the human driver in both trucks and then that following driver goes off duty."}, {"time": 8470, "text": "Well, some of it is also just the company stepping up and just doing it, screw the authority, and showing that it's possible, and then the authority follows."}, {"time": 8479, "text": "So that's why I really love innovators in the space."},

dollars might I be able to make?"}, {"time": 8530, "text": "There's something lost in that conversation where you're not really taking on like the problem in a real way, so these autonomous vehicle

changing."}, {"time": 8551, "text": "This is where I have to give props to Waymo is they put driverless cars on the road and like forget PowerPoint slide presentations, actual cars on the road."},

trucks on the road as well."}, {"time": 8580, "text": "And that kind of, that component, I think is important part of the policy conversation because you start getting data from these companies that are willing to take the big risks as opposed to making slide decks, they're actually putting cars on the road and like real lives are at stake."}, {"time": 8599, "text": "They could be lost and they

have that luxury, right?"}, {"time": 8636, "text": "Which I don't think I, if I had another life as a researcher, I would love to just study the business strategies of startups and Silicon Valley sort of structure."}, {"time": 8650, "text": "Would you consider Waymo a startup?"}, {"time": 8654, "text": "I mean, it's at least not in the things that seem to matter in this self driving space."},

is, there's a real scarcity of talent and money for this."}, {"time": 8673, "text": "And there certainly was a scarcity of like partnerships with OEMs and the big trucking companies."}, {"time": 8679,

they come off much worse than my personal appraisal of them."}, {"time": 6112, "text": "So it's kind of interesting as a writer when you're watching it, I guess, kind of like an attorney, right?"},

writing for a president, this is no joke, especially for a president who's the great communicator, Reagan."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "So, and you have to be very inspirational, but also not come off as corny, which is very hard to do."}, {"time": 6188, "text": "And she in the book talks about how she wrote speeches for him, how she, I'm paraphrasing her and I haven't read her book in a couple of decades, but basically she would write like a brain dump and it's just garbage."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "And she's like, that's okay, just get it all out there."}, {"time": 6203, "text": "And then there's that expression, all writing is editing."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "So for the White Pills specifically, this is, I don't know if it's the most ambitious book I've ever done, your reader I think is more ambitious because that's all of North Korea's history and it's written in somebody else's voice, not a person's abortion."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "And you, like you mentioned, you had to read a giant number of books."}, {"time": 6222, "text": "Yeah, 60 books as research, yeah."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "Well, maybe can we just pause, can you say what White Pill is about?"},

you think, why are you so hopeful?"}, {"time": 6238, "text": "And I'm not hopeful on an emotional level, I'm hopeful because looking at history, I think there's certain things that not will certainly happen again, but it's not at all implausible to happen again and that the good guys will win."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "And this is one of those cases."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "So, the book took on a life of its own, it's very different from how I originally conceived it."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "I originally conceived it as a kind of retelling of Camus philosophy, Ryan Holiday, who he used to be close friends with, I've talked to him in a while."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "He has a whole kind of cottage industry based on the Stoics of the past."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "I'm like, okay, I asked him once, can I do this with Camus?"}, {"time": 6276, "text": "He said, sure."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "And then I reread Camus recently and it wasn't what I had remembered."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "I was like, Camus wasn't that, I apologize to interrupt."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "So, it's interesting."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "So, he kind of took ideas from Stoics and started to kind of use it as a book that gives you advice about how to live life from the Stoic perspectives."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "And you were thinking, is there something in existentialism, absurdism, or something specifically in Camus thinking, or I think you've mentioned Mithos Sisyphus, specifically like his philosophical work."}, {"time": 6311, "text": "So, you were trying to see like, is there, can I resurrect this?"}, {"time": 6315, "text": "That's actually, I would think, that's an interesting project."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "And it's sad to hear that it didn't materialize in exactly that form, because I thought there would be a lot in that."}, {"time": 6333, "text": "So, I had Douglas Murray on my show and he also made the point, like when you go back and read Camus, there's not that much there."}, {"time": 6338, "text": "The myth of Sisyphus is not at all how I remembered it."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "The vast bulk of that book is like literary criticism."}, {"time": 6346,

title essay is basically like a six chapter essay at the back of the book, which it's good for what it is, but there's not that much there to draw."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "I'm extremely, he's a great hero of mine."}, {"time": 6367, "text": "I think his life is just enormously admirable."}, {"time": 6370, "text": "He fought very hard against the Nazi occupation."}, {"time": 6374, "text": "His

6383, "text": "It's the kind of book where reading the book doesn't add anything to the plot."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "The plot is a plague comes, sleeps over the town, destroys a lot of life and vanishes quickly as it came."}, {"time": 6394, "text": "You don't need to read the book now."}, {"time": 6395, "text": "You get the point."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "I deeply disagree with you."}, {"time": 6398, "text": "Yes, of course I've read The Plague."}, {"time": 6400, "text": "To me, The Plague is about the doctor and it's about love and it's about the different roles that humans take in a time of tragedy like The Plague."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "Also, it's an allegory, so you could start to think about whether it's Nazi Germany, whatever you think that is."}, {"time": 6421, "text": "To me, that was about love and about the highest ideal being the doctor that sacrifices themselves for others and still has love and hope."}, {"time": 6432, "text": "I mean, to me, the way that story is told, I think, has a lot of meaning."}, {"time": 6439, "text": "It's like, to me, you saying that's interesting."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "You say it this way, but to me, it's like saying Animal Farm doesn't need to be read because it's an obvious story."}, {"time": 6451, "text": "I don't think there's much plot to The Plague."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "I think Animal Farm has a very long plot and a complex plot."}, {"time": 6458, "text": "But there's experiences within."}, {"time": 6462, "text": "So the situation is set up in The Plague and there's experiences that start to reveal a philosophy."}, {"time": 6468, "text": "So yeah, it's not very plot driven."}, {"time": 6473, "text": "So I would say you still should read it, but The Plague doesn't... Like you didn't give away anything currently."}, {"time": 6483, "text": "Some books are just..."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "I mean, Ayn Rand is similar to that in the sense like The Plague is not as

necessarily the important thing."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "To me, the behavior of the people is the important thing."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "You could like separate it into a bunch of blog posts

like..."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "I'm trying to scramble here for books I really appreciate that don't have a plot."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "I mean, Notes from Underground."}, {"time": 6544,

short, yeah."}, {"time": 6570, "text": "A Hunger Artist, one of my probably favorite short stories is that kind of a short story."}, {"time": 6575, "text": "It's a pretty long short story of

has to do something."}, {"time": 6611, "text": "It makes me think about like, don't become, the way you live, don't become like a freak show, a circus act."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "Like live for an

this one, I just had a first draft of notes and it's not in chronological order."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "It's like, I read certain books as research and then I had the pull quotes that was

plot driven and also heavily character driven, but the characters are real."}, {"time": 6789, "text": "So it's interesting to kind of mention what kind of, what does the first draft kind of look like

own home, the depression, the sadness, the loneliness that leads to suicide."}, {"time": 831, "text": "And forget suicide, just low key suffering."}, {"time": 835, "text": "Yeah, no, I think that's the suffering, that isolation, we're not meant to live alone, we're not meant to live apart from one another."}, {"time": 842, "text": "I mean, that's, of course, the ideology of lockdown is to make people live apart, alone, isolated, so that we don't spread diseases to each other, right?"}, {"time": 850, "text": "But we're not actually designed as a species to live that way."}, {"time": 854, "text": "And that, what you're describing, I think, if everyone's honest with themselves, have felt, especially in places where lockdowns have been sort of very militantly enforced, has felt deep into their core."}, {"time": 866, "text": "Well, if I could just return to the question of deaths."}, {"time": 870, "text": "You said that the data isn't perfect, because we need these kind of seroprevalence surveys to understand how many cases there were to determine the rate of deaths."}, {"time": 879, "text": "And we need to have a strong footing in the number of deaths."}, {"time": 882, "text": "But if we assume that the number of deaths is approximately correct, like what's your sense, what kind of statements can we say about the deadliness of COVID across different demographics?"}, {"time": 895, "text": "Maybe not in a political way or in the current way, but when history looks back at this moment of time, 50 years from now, 100 years from now, the way we look at the pandemic 100 years ago, what will they say about the deadliness of COVID?"}, {"time": 912, "text": "I mean, I think the deadliness of COVID depends on not just the virus itself, but who it infects."}, {"time": 918, "text": "So probably the most important thing about it, about the deadliness of COVID, is this steep age gradient in the mortality rate."}, {"time": 926, "text": "So according to these seroprevalence studies that have been done, now hundreds of them, mostly from before vaccination, because vaccination also reduces the mortality risk of COVID, the seroprevalence studies suggest that the risk of death, if you're, say, over the age of 70, is very high."}, {"time": 947, "text": "You know, 5% if you get COVID."}, {"time": 950, "text": "If you're under the age of 70, it's lower, 0.05."}, {"time": 954, "text": "But there's not a single sharp cutoff."}, {"time": 956, "text": "It's more like, I have a rule of thumb that I use."}, {"time": 959, "text": "So if you're 50, say, the infection fatality rate from COVID is 0.2%, according to the seroprevalence data."}, {"time": 967, "text": "That means 99.8% survival if you're 50."}, {"time": 971, "text": "And for every seven years of age above that, double it."}, {"time": 974, "text": "Every seven years of age below that, halve it."}, {"time": 977, "text": "So a 57 year old would have a 0.4%."}, {"time": 980, "text":

would be listening to this with PhDs at the end of their name that would disagree with the 99.8, would you say?"}, {"time": 1007, "text": "So I think there's some disagreement over this."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "And the disagreement is about the quality of the seroprevalence studies that were conducted."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "So as I said earlier, I was the senior investigator in three different seroprevalence studies very early in the epidemic."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "I view them as very high quality studies."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "In Santa Clara County, what we did is we used a test kit that we obtained from someone who works in major league baseball, actually."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "He had ordered these test kits very early in March, 2020, that measures, very accurately measures antibody levels, antibodies in the bloodstream."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "These test kits were eventually were approved by the, had an EUA by the emergency use authorization by the FDA, sort of shortly after we did this."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "And it had a very low false positive rate, false positive means if you don't have these COVID antibodies in your bloodstream, the kit shows up positive anyways."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "That turns out to happen about 0.5% of the time."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "And based on studies, a very large number of studies looking at blood from 2018, you try it against this kit, and 0.5% of the time, 2018, there shouldn't be antibodies there to COVID."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "So if it turns positive to false positives, 0.5% of the time."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "And then like a false negative rate, about 10%, 12%, something like that, I don't remember the exact number, but the false positive rate is the important thing there."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "So you have a population in March, 2020 or April, 2020, with very low fraction of patients having been exposed to COVID, you don't know how much, but low, even a small false positive rate could end up biasing your study quite a bit."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "But there's a formula to adjust for that."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "You can adjust for the false positive rate, false negative rate."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "We did that adjustment, and those studies found in a community population, so leaving aside people in nursing homes who have a higher death rate from COVID, the death rate was 0.2% in Santa Clara County and in LA County."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "Across all age groups in a community, community meaning just like regular folks."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "Yeah, so that's actually a real important question too."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "So the Santa Clara study, we did this Facebook sampling scheme, which is, I mean, not the ideal thing, but it was very difficult to get a random sample and during lockdown, where we put out an ad on Facebook soliciting people to volunteer for the study, randomly selected set of people."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "We were hoping to get a random selection of people from Santa Clara County, but it tended to, the people who tend to volunteer were from the richer parts of the county."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Like I had Stanford professors writing, begging to be in the study because they wanted to know their antibody levels."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "So we did some adjustment for that."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "In LA County, we hired a firm that had a preexisting representative sample of LA County."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "But it didn't include nursing homes, it didn't include people in jail, things like that, didn't include the homeless populations."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "So it's representative of a community dwelling population, both of those."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "And there we found that both in LA County and Santa Clara County in April, 2020, something like 40 to 50 times more infections than cases in both places."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So for every case that had been reported to the public health authorities, we found 40 or 50 other infections, people with antibodies in their blood that suggested that they'd had COVID and recovered."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "So people were not reporting, or severe, at least in those days, underreporting."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there was testing problem."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "I mean, there weren't so many tests available."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "People didn't know."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "A lot of them, we asked a set of questions about the symptoms they'd faced, and most of them said they'd faced no symptoms, or at the most, 30, 40% of them said they'd faced no symptoms."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "And I mean, even these days, how many people report that they get COVID when they get COVID?"}, {"time": 1245, "text": "Okay, have those numbers, that 0.2%, has that approximately held up over time?"}, {"time": 1251, "text": "That is, so Professor John Ioannidis, who's a colleague of mine at Stanford, is a world expert in meta now, so probably the most cited scientist on Earth, I think, at least living."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "He did a meta analysis of now 100 or more of these seroprevalence studies."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "And what he found was that that 0.2% is roughly the worldwide number."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "In fact, I think he cites this lower number, 0.15%, as the median infection fatality rate worldwide."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "So we did these studies, and it generated an enormous amount of blowback by people who thought that the infection fatality rate is much higher."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "And there's some controversy over the quality of some of the other studies that are done."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "And so there are some people who look at this same literature and say, well, the lower quality studies tend to have lower IFRs."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "The higher quality studies."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "IFR?"}, {"time": 1301, "text": "Oh, infection fatality rate, I apologize."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "I do this in lectures, too, I apologize."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "And I'm going to rudely interrupt you and ask for the basics sometimes, if it's okay."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "So these higher quality studies, they say, tend to produce higher IFR."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "But the problem is that if you want a global infection fatality rate, you need to get seroprevalence studies from everywhere, even in places that don't necessarily have the infrastructure set up to produce very, very high quality studies."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "And in poor places in the world, places like Africa, the infection fatality rate is incredibly low."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "And in some richer places, like New York City, the infection fatality rate is much higher."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "There's a range of IFRs, not a single number."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "This sometimes surprises people, because they think, well, it's a virus, it should have the same properties no matter where it goes."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "But the virus kills or infects or hurts in interaction with the host."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "And the properties of both the host and the virus combine to produce the outcome."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "But you also mentioned the environment, too?"}, {"time": 1373, "text": "Well, I'm thinking mainly just about the person."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "Like if I'm gonna think about it, the most simplest way to think about it is age."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "Age is the single most important risk factor."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "So older places are going to have a higher IFR than younger places."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "Africa, 3% of Africa is over 65."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "So in some sense, it's not surprising that they have a low infection fatality rate."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "So that's one way you would explain the difference between Africa and New York City in terms of the fatality rate, is the age, the average age?"}, {"time": 1402, "text": "Yeah, and especially in the early days of the epidemic in New York City, the older populations living in nursing homes were differentially infected based on, because of policies that were adopted, to send COVID infected patients back to nursing homes to keep hospitals empty."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "What do you mean by differentially infected?"}, {"time": 1422, "text": "The policy that you adopt determines who is most exposed."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "So that's what I mean by different."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "The policy, it's the person that matters."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "I mean, it's not like the virus just kind of doesn't care."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "I mean, the policy determines the nature of the interaction."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And there's also, I mean, there is some contribution from the environment, different regions have different proximity maybe of people interacting or the dynamics of the way they interact."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "Yeah, like if you have situations where there's lots of intergenerational interactions, then you have a very different risk profile than if you have societies that are where generations are more separate from one another."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "Okay, so let me just finish real fast about this."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "So you have in New York, you have a population that was infected in the early days that was very likely going to die, had a much higher likelihood of dying if infected."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "And so New York City had a higher IFR, especially in the early days than like Africa has had."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "The other thing is treatment, right?"}, {"time": 1490, "text": "So the treatments that we adopted in the early days of the epidemic, I think actually may have exacerbated the risk of death."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "Which treatments?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "Using ventilators, like the over reliance on ventilators is what I'm primarily thinking of, but I can think of other things."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "But that also we've learned over time how better to manage patients with the disease."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "So you have all those things combined."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "So that's where the controversy over this number is."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "I mean, New York City also is a central hub for those who tweet and those who write powerful stories and narratives in article form."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "And I remember those quite dramatic stories about sort of doctors in the hospitals and these kinds of things."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "I mean, there's very serious, very dramatic, very tragic deaths going on always in hospitals."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "Those stories, loved ones losing each other on a deathbed, that's always tragic."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And you can always write a hell of a good story about that."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And you should, about the loss of loved ones."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "But they were doing it pretty well, I would say, over this kind of dramatic deaths."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And so in response to that, it's very unpleasant to hear, even to consider the possibility that the death rate is not as high as you might feel."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "Yeah, I was surprised by the reaction, both by regular people and also the scientific community in response to those studies, those early studies in April of 2020."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "To me, they were studies."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "I mean, they're the kinds of, not exactly the kinds of work I've worked on all my life, but kind of like the kind of, you write a paper and you get responses from your fellow scientists and you change the paper to improve it, you hopefully learn something from it."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "Well, but to push back, it's just a study."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "But there's some studies, and this is kind of interesting, because I've received similar pushback on other topics."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "There's some studies that, if wrong, might have wide ranging detrimental effects on society."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "So that's the way they would perceive the studies."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "If you say the death rate is lower, and you end up, as you often do in science, realizing that, nope, that was a flaw in the way the study was conducted, or we're just not representative of a broader population, and then you realize the death rate is much higher, that might be very damaging in people's view."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "So that's probably where the scientific community sort of just steel man the kind of response, is that's where they felt like, there's some findings where you better be damn sure before you kind of report them."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "Yeah, I mean, we were pretty sure we were right, and it turns out we were right."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "So we released the Santa Clara study via this open science process and this server called MedArchive."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "It's designed for releasing studies that have not yet been peer reviewed in order to garner comment from the scientists before peer review."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "The LA County study, we went through this traditional peer review process and got it published in the Journal of American Medical Association sometime in like July, I think, I forget the date, of 2020."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "The Santa Clara study released in April of 2020 in this sort of working paper archive."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "The reason was that we felt we had an obligation, we had a result that we thought was quite important, and we wanted to tell the scientific community about it and also tell the world about it."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "And we wanted to get feedback."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "I mean, that's part of the purpose of sending it to these kinds of places."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "I think a lot of the problem is that when people think about published science, they think of it as automatically true."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "And if it goes through peer review, it's automatically true."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "If it hasn't gone through peer review, it's not automatically true."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "And especially in medicine, when we're not used to having this access to pre peer reviewed work."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "I mean, in economics, actually, that's quite normal."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "You takes years to get something published."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "So there's a very active debate over or discussion about papers before they're peer reviewed in this sort of working paper way, much less normal or much newer in medicine."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "And so I think part of that, the perception about what process happens in open science when you release a study, that got people confused."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "And you're right, it was a very important result because we had just locked the world down in middle of March with, I think, catastrophic results."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "And if that study was right, if our study was right, that meant we'd made a mistake."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "And not because the death rate was low, that's actually not the key thing there."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "The key thing is that we had adopted these policies, these test and trace policies, these policies, these lockdown policies aimed at suppressing the virus level to close to zero."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "That was essentially the idea."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "If we can just get the virus to go away, we won't have to ever worry about it again."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "The main problem with our result as far as that strategy was concerned wasn't the death rate, it was the 40 to 50 times more infections than cases."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "It was the 2.5% or 3% or 4% prevalence rate that we identified of the antibodies in the population."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "If that number is right, it's too late."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "The virus is not going to go to zero."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "And no matter how much we test and trace and isolate, we're not going to get the viral level down to zero."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "So we're gonna have to let the virus go through the entire population in some way or some other?"}, {"time": 1839, "text": "We can talk about that in a bit."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "That's the Great Barrington Declaration."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "You don't have to let the virus go through the population."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "You can shield preferentially."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "The policy we chose was to shield preferentially the laptop class, the set of people who could work from home without losing their job."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "And we did a very good job at protecting them."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "Well, let me take a small tangent."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "We're gonna jump around in time, which I think will be the best way to tell the story."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "So that was the beginning."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "Yeah, okay, actually, can I go back one more thing for that?"}, {"time": 1873, "text": "Because that's really important and I should have started with this."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "What led me to do those studies was a paper that I had remembered seeing from the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "This is where I've been much less active in writing about that."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "I had written like a paper or two about that in 2009."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "There was actually the same debate over the mortality rate, except it unfolded over the course of three years, two or three years."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "The early studies of the mortality rate in H1N1 counted the number of cases in the denominator, counted the number of deaths in the numerator, cases meaning people identified as having H1N1, showing up the doctor, tested to have it."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "And the earliest estimates of the H1N1 mortality were like 4%, 3%, really, really high."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "Over the course of a couple of more years, a whole bunch of seroprevalence studies, seroprevalence studies of H1N1 flu came out."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "And it turned out that there were 100 or more times people infected per case."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "And so the mortality rate was actually something like 0.02% for H1N1, not the three, like 100 fold difference."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "So this made you think, okay, it took us a couple of two or three years to discover the truth behind the actual infections for H1N1, and then what's the truth here and can we get there faster?"}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Yeah, and it spreads in a similar way as the H1N1 flu did."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "I mean, it spreads via solization, via person to person breathing, kind of contact up."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "It may be some by fomites, but it seems less likely now."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "In any case, it seemed really important to me to speed up the process of having those seroprevalence studies so that we can better understand who was at risk and what the right strategy ought to be."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "This might be a good place to kind of compare influenza, the flu, and COVID in the context of the discussion we just had, which is how deadly is COVID?"}, {"time": 2004, "text": "So you mentioned COVID is a very particular kind of steepness, where the X axis is age."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "So in that context, could you maybe compare influenza and COVID, because a lot of people outside the folks who suggest that the lizards who run the world have completely fabricated and invented COVID, outside of those folks, kind of the natural process by which you dismiss the threat of COVID is, say, well, it's just like the flu."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "The flu is a very serious thing, actually."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "So in that comparison, where does COVID stand?"}, {"time": 2043, "text": "Yeah, the flu is a very serious thing."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "It kills 50, 60,000 people a year, something I found out, depending on the particular strain that goes around, that's in the United States."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "The primary difference to me, there's lots of differences, but one of the most salient differences is the age gradient and mortality risk for the flu."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "So the flu is more deadly to children than COVID is."}, {"time":

comment on, I think in another conversation you mentioned there's a U shape to the flu curve, so meaning there's actually quite a large number of kids that die from flu."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "Yeah, I mean, the 1918 flu, the H1N1 flu, the Spanish flu in the US killed millions of younger people."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "And that is not the case with COVID."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "More than, I'm gonna get the number wrong, but something like 70, 80% of the deaths are people over the age of 60."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "Well, we've talked about the fear the whole time, really."},

to the kids."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "And I think that obviously that makes a lot of sense this kind of the kids come first no matter what, that's number one priority."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "But for this particular virus, that reasoning was not grounded in data, it seems like, or that emotion and feeling was not grounded in data."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "But at the same time, this is way more deadly than the flu just overall, and especially to older people."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "The numbers, when the story is all said and done, COVID would take many more lives."}, {"time": 2184,

have?"}, {"time": 3802, "text": "And sorry to take us on a tangent, but almost from an interview perspective of how to inspire humility and inspire trust in science or maybe give hope that we know

instance, you said Francis Collins had a moment when he learned that there was quite possible to get a vaccine going."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "He must've learned that quite early."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "And I didn't learn that early."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "I mean, I didn't know, in March of 2020, in my experience with vaccine development, it would've take, I thought it would take a decade or more to get a vaccine."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "That was wrong, right?"}, {"time": 3994, "text": "I didn't, and I was so happy when I started to see the preliminary numbers in the Pfizer

safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines at the individual and the societal level?"}, {"time": 4042, "text": "So for the vaccine safety data, it's actually challenging to convey to the public how this is normally done."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "Like normally you would do this in the context of the trial, you'd have a long trial with large numbers, relatively large numbers of people, you'd follow them over a long time and the trial will give you some indication of the safety of the vaccine."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "And it did, I mean, but the trial, the way it was constructed, when it came out that it was protective against COVID, it was no longer ethical to have a placebo arm."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "And so that placebo arm was vaccinated, large part of it."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "And so that meant that from the trial, you were not going to be able to get data on the longterm safety profiles of the vaccine."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "So I wasn't surprised when people were a little bit skeptical when the trial was done about the safety profile, just the way the nature of the thing was gonna make it so that it was gonna be hard to get a complete picture from the trials itself."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "And the trial showed they were pretty safe and quite effective at preventing both you from getting COVID, like I said, I think the main endpoint of the trial itself was a symptomatic COVID, right?"}, {"time": 4137, "text": "So that was like, that was, I mean, it was really to me, like it was about as amazing achievement as anything, organizing a trial of that scale and running it so quickly."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "And the final results being so surprisingly high."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "So good, right?"}, {"time": 4156, "text": "And so, but the problem then was, normally it would take a long time, the FDA would tell Pfizer to go back and try it in this subgroup, they'd work more on dosing, they do all these kinds of things that kind of didn't, we really didn't have time for in the middle of the pandemic, right?"}, {"time": 4174, "text": "So you have a basis for approval that it's less full than normally you would have for a population scale vaccine."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "But the results were good, the results looked really good."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "And actually, I should say for the most part, that's been born out when we've given the vaccine at scale in terms of protection against severe disease, right?"}, {"time": 4196, "text": "So people who have got the vaccine for a very long time after they've had for the full vaccination have had great protection against being hospitalized and dying if they get COVID."}, {"time": 4208, "text": "Let's separate, because this seems to be, there's critics of both categories, but different."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "Kids and kids, not older people, like let's say five years old and above or something, or 13 years old and above."}, {"time": 4226, "text": "So for those, it seems like the reduction of the rate of fatalities and serious illness seems to be something like 10X."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "I mean, for older people, it is a godsend, this vaccine."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "It transforms the problem of focus protection from something that's quite challenging, possible, I believe, but quite challenging to something that's much, much more manageable."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "Because the vaccine in and of itself when deployed in older populations is a form of focus protection."}, {"time": 4260, "text": "Yes, by the way, we'll talk about the focus protection in one segment, because it's such a brilliant idea for this pandemic or for future pandemics."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "I thought the sociological, psychological discussion about the letter from Francis Collins is, because it was so recent, it has been so troubling to me, so I'm glad we talked about that first."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "But so there seems to be, the vaccines work to reduce deaths, and that has especially the most transformative effects for the older folks."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "I've told you one thing that I got wrong in the pandemic."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "Let me tell you the second thing I got wrong, for sure, in the pandemic."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "In January of this year, 2021, I thought that the vaccines would stop infection."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "Right, it would make it so that you were much less likely to be infected at all, because the antibodies that were produced by the vaccines looked like they were neutralizing antibodies that would essentially block you from being infected at all."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "That turned out to be wrong, right?"}, {"time": 4326, "text": "So I think, and it became clear as data came out from Israel, which vaccinated very early, that they were seeing surges of infection, even in a very highly vaccinated population, that the vaccine does not stop infection."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "So you're a used car salesman, and you were selling the vaccine, and the features you thought a vaccine would have, I mean, I have a similar kind of sense when the vaccine came out."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "Vaccine would reduce, if you somehow were able to get it, it would reduce rate of death and all those kinds of things, but it would also reduce the chance of you getting it, and if you do get it, the chance of you transmitting it to somebody else."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "And it turns out that those latter two things are not as definitive, or in fact, I mean, I don't know to which degree they're not there at all."}, {"time": 4377, "text": "I think it's a little complicated, because I think the first two or three months after you're fully vaccinated, after the second dose, you have 60, 70% efficacy peak against infection."}, {"time": 4390, "text": "So that, which is pretty good, I mean, right?"}, {"time": 4392, "text": "But by six, seven, eight months, that drops to 20%."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "Some places, some studies, like there's a study out of Sweden that suggests it might even drop to zero."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "But, and then you're also infectious for some period of time, if you do get it, even though you're vaccinated."}, {"time": 4407, "text": "It seems to be lucidated that the period of time your infectious is shorter."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "Is shorter, but the infectivity per day is about as high."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "So you still, the point is that the vaccine might reduce some risk of infecting others, but it's not a categorical difference."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "So, it's not safe to be in the presence of just vaccinated people."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "You can still get infected."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "Right, so, I mean, there's a million things I wanna ask here, but is there in some sense because the vaccine really helps on the worst part of this pandemic, which is killing people."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "Doesn't that mean, where does the vaccine hesitancy come from in terms of, it seems like, obviously a vaccine is a powerful solution to let us open this thing up."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "Yeah, so I wrote a Wall Street Journal op ed with Sunetra Gupta in December of last year."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "A very night with a very naive title, which says we can end the lockdowns in a month."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "And the idea is very simple."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "Vaccinate all vulnerable people and then open up."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "Open up."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "Right, and the idea was that the lockdown harms, this is directly related to the Great Barrington Declaration."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "Great Barrington Declaration said the lockdown harms are devastating to the population at large."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "There's this considerable segment of people that are vulnerable, protect them."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "Well, with the vaccine, we have a perfect tool to protect the vulnerable, which is, I still believe, I mean, it's true, right?"}, {"time": 4504, "text": "You vaccinate the vulnerable, the older population, and as you said, there's a tenfold decrease in the mortality risk from getting infected, which is, I mean, amazing."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "So that was the strategy we outlined."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "What happened is that the vaccine debate got transformed."}, {"time": 4520, "text": "So first there's, so you're asking about vaccine hesitancy."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "I think first there's the inherent limitations of how to measure vaccine safety, right?"}, {"time": 4529, "text": "So we talked about a little bit about the trial, but also after the trial, there's a mechanism, and this is the work I've been involved with before COVID, on tracking and identifying and checking whether the vaccines actually are safe."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "And the central challenge is one of causality."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "So you no longer have the randomized trial, but you wanna know is the vaccine, when it's deployed at scale, causing adverse events."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "Well, you can't just look at people who are vaccinated and see what adverse events happen, because you don't know what would have happened if the person had not been vaccinated."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "So you have to have some control group."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "Now, what happened is there's several systems to check this that the CDC uses."}, {"time": 4574, "text": "One very commonly known one now is called VAERS, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "There, anyone who has an adverse event, either a regular person or a doctor can just go report, look, I had the vaccine and two days later I had a headache or whatever it is, the person died a day after I had the vaccine, right?"}, {"time": 4594, "text": "Now, the vaccine was rolled out to older people first, and older people die sometimes with or without the vaccine."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "So sometimes you'll see someone's vaccinated and a few days later they die."}, {"time": 4606, "text": "Did the vaccine cause it or something else cause it?"}, {"time": 4608, "text": "Really difficult to tell."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "In order to tell, you need a control group."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "For that, there are other systems the FDA and CDC have, like there's one called VSD, Vaccine Safety Datalink."}, {"time": 4622, "text": "There's another system called BEST, I forget what the acronym is, to essentially to track cohorts of people, vaccinated versus unvaccinated, with as careful of matching as you can do."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "It's not randomized, and then see if you have safety signals that pop up in the vaccinated relative to the control group unvaccinated."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "And so that's, for instance, how the myocarditis risk was picked up in especially young men."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "It's also how the higher risk of blood clots in middle age and older women with the J&J vaccine was picked up."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "There, what you have are situations where the baseline risk of these outcomes are so low that if you see them in the vaccinated arm at all, that it's not hard to understand that the vaccine did this."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "Young men should not be having myocarditis."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "Middle age women should not be having huge blood clots in the brain."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "So when you see that, you can say it's linked."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "Now, the rates are low."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "So young men, maybe one in 5,000, one in 10,000 of the vaccine, vaccine related myocarditis, pericarditis."}, {"time": 4694, "text": "Young women, middle age women, I don't know."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "I'm not sure what the right number might be, but like I'd say, it's like one in hundreds of thousands, something like that."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "So these are rare outcomes, but they are vaccine linked outcomes."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "How do you deal with that as a messaging thing?"}, {"time": 4713, "text": "I think you just tell people."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "You tell people here are the risks."}, {"time": 4716, "text": "You transparently tell them."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And just, you're not, so they're not getting into something that they don't know."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "And don't treat people like they're children and need to be told lies because they won't understand the full complexity of the truth."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "People, I think, are pretty good at, or actually, people with time are good at understanding data, but better than anything."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "They're better at, they're extremely good at detecting arrogance and bullshit."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "And you give them either one of those."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "I mean, I'll give you one that's where I think it's greatly undermined vaccine, greatly undermined the demand for the vaccine, is this weird denial that if you recover from COVID, you have extremely good immunity, both against infection and access to disease."}, {"time": 4767, "text": "And that denial leads to people distrusting the message given by like the CDC director, for instance, in favor of the vaccine, right?"}, {"time": 4775, "text": "Why would you deny a thing that's such an obvious fact?"}, {"time": 4779, "text": "Like you can look at the data and it just, I mean, it just pops out at you that people that are COVID recovered are not getting infected again at very high rates, much lower rates."}, {"time": 4790, "text": "After these kinds of conversations, I'm sure after this very conversation, I often get a number of messages from Joe, Joe Rogan, and from Sam Harris, who to me are people I admire, I think are really intelligent, thoughtful human beings."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "They also have a platform."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "And I believe, at least in my mind, about this COVID set of topics, they represent a group of people."}, {"time": 4819, "text": "Each group has smart, thoughtful, well intentioned human beings."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "And I don't know who is right, but I do know that they're kind of tribal a little bit, those groups."}, {"time": 4837, "text": "And so the question I wanna ask is like, what do you think about these two groups and this kind of tension over the vaccine that sometimes it just keeps finding different topics on which to focus on, like whether kids should get vaccinated or not, whether there should be vaccine mandates or not, which seem to be often very kind of specific policy kinds of questions that miss the bigger picture."}, {"time": 4866, "text": "I think it's a symptom of the distrust that people have in public health."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "I think this kind of schism over the vaccine does not happen in places where the public health authorities have been much more trustworthy, right?"}, {"time": 4878, "text": "So you don't see this vaccine hasn't seen Sweden, for instance."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "What's happened in the United States is that the vaccine has become first because of politics, but then also because of the scientific arrogance, this sort of touchstone issue, and people line up on both sides of it, and the different language you're hearing is structured around that."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "So before the election, for instance, I did a testimony in the House on measurement of vaccine safety."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "And I was invited by the Republicans."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "There were, I think, four other experts invited by the Democrats, or three other experts invited by Democrats, each of whom had a lot of experience in measuring vaccine safety."}, {"time": 4920, "text": "I was really surprised to hear them each doubt whether the FDA would do a reasonable job in assessing vaccine safety, including by people who have long records of working with the FDA."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "I mean, these are professionals, great scientists, whose main sort of goal in life is to make sure that unsafe vaccines don't get released into the world."}, {"time": 4944, "text": "And if they are, they get pulled."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "And they're casting down on the vaccine the ability to track vaccine safety before the election."}, {"time": 4952, "text": "And then after the election, the rhetoric switched on a dime, right?"}, {"time": 4958, "text": "All of a sudden, it's Republicans that are cast as if they're vaccine hesitant."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "That kind of political shift, the public notices."}, {"time": 4966, "text": "If all it takes is an election to change how people talk about the safety of the vaccine, well, we're not talking science anymore, many people think, right?"}, {"time": 4974, "text": "I think that created its hesitancy."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "The other thing I think, I think the hesitancy, some politicians viewed it as a political, as sort of like a political opportunity to sort of demonize people who are hesitant."}, {"time": 4994, "text": "And that itself fueled hesitancy, right?"}, {"time": 4996, "text": "Like if you're telling me I'm a rube that just doesn't want the vaccine because I want everyone to die, well, I'm gonna react really negatively."}, {"time": 5005, "text": "And if you're talking down to me about my legitimate sort of concerns about whether this vaccine is safe to take, I mean, I've heard from women who were thinking about getting pregnant, should I take the vaccine?"}, {"time": 5019, "text": "I mean, there are all kinds of questions, legitimate questions that I think should have good data to answer that we don't necessarily have good data to answer."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "So what do you do in the face of that?"}, {"time": 5030, "text": "Well, one reaction is to pretend like we know for a fact that it's safe when we don't have the data to know for a fact in that particular group with that particular set of clinical circumstances you know."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "And that I think breeds hesitancy."}, {"time": 5043, "text": "People can detect that bullshit."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "Whereas if you just tell people, you know, I don't know."}, {"time": 5049, "text": "Yeah, leave with humility."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "Yeah, you will end up with a better result."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "Let me ask you about, I've recently had a conversation with the Pfizer CEO."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "This is part therapy session, part advice, because again, I really want us to get through this together and it feels like the division is a thing that prevents us from getting through this together."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "And once again, just like with Francis Collins, a lot of people wrote to me words of support and a lot of people wrote to me words of criticism."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "I'm trying to understand the nature of the criticism."}, {"time": 5093, "text": "So some of the criticism had to do with against the vaccine and those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "That I have a better understanding of."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "But some kind of deep distrust of Pfizer."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "So actually looking at Big Pharma broadly, I'm trying to understand am I so naive that I just don't see it?"}, {"time": 5121, "text": "Because yes, there's corrupt people and they're greedy, they're flawed in all walks of life."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "But companies do quite an incredible job of taking a good idea at the scale and making some money with that

time?"}, {"time": 1039, "text": "Because Einstein's theory and quantum theory can't tell us what's beyond them."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "All they can do is tell us that when you put us together,

no operational definition."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "So, but it doesn't tell you what's beyond."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "And so they're just looking for deep structures like guessing is really fun."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So these really brilliant guys, generic brilliant men and women who are doing this work, physicists, are making guesses about these structures, informed guesses,

locality."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "So they make these brilliant guesses."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "And of course, most of the time you're gonna be wrong, but once you get one or two that start to pay off and then you get some lucky breaks."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "So they got a lucky break back in 1986."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor took the

like apparently for people who are into this, that's sort of something that happens so often you need to be able to find it and get rid of those cause you already know about that and you need to."},

billions or millions of times per second they needed to do it."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "So the experimentals begged the theorists, please, you got it."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "And so Park and Taylor took the billions of terms, hundreds of pages and miraculously turned it into nine."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "And then a little bit later, they guessed one term expression that turned out to be equivalent."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "So billions of terms reduced to one term, that so called famous Park Taylor formula, 1986."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "And that was like, okay, where did that come from?"}, {"time": 1154, "text": "This is a pointer into a deep realm, beyond space and time, but no one, I mean, what can you do with it?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "And they thought maybe it was a one off, but then other formulas started coming up."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And then eventually Neymar, Connie, Hamid and his team found this thing called the amplituhedron, which really sort of captures the whole, a big part of the whole ball of wax."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "I'm sure they would say, no, there's plenty more to do."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "So I won't say they did it all by any means."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "They're looking at the cosmological polytope as well."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "So what's remarkable to me is that two pillars of modern science, quantum field theory with gravity on the one hand and evolution by natural selection on the other, just in the last 20 years have very clearly said space time has had a good run."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "Reductionism has been a fantastic methodology."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "So we had a great ontology of space time, a great methodology of reductionism."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "Now it's time for a new trick."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "But now you need to go deeper and show, but by the way, this doesn't mean we throw away everything we've done, not by a long shot."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "Every new idea that we come up with beyond space time must project precisely into space time."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "And it better give us back everything that we know and love in space time or generalizations, or it's not gonna be taken seriously and it shouldn't be."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "So we have a strong constraint on whatever we're going to do beyond space time, it needs to project into space time."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And whatever this deeper theory is, it may not itself have evolution by natural selection."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "This may not be part of this deeper realm."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "But when we take whatever that thing is beyond space time and project it into space time, it has to look like evolution by natural selection or it's wrong."},

time."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "So that was another question you asked a little bit earlier."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "It's telling us more about our perceptual space and time, which we have used as the basis for creating first Newtonian space versus time as a mathematical extension of our perceptions."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "And then Einstein then took that and extended it even further."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So the relationship between what evolution is telling us and what the physicists are telling us is that in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space time are formulated as sort of rigorous extensions of our perceptual space, making it mathematically rigorous and laying out the symmetries that they find there."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "So that's sort of the relationship between them."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So it's the perceptual space time that evolution is telling us is just a user interface effectively."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And then the physicists are finding that even the mathematical extension of that into the Einsteinian formulation has to be as well, not the final story, there's something deeper."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces as we march forward from Newtonian physics to quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "These are all, in your view, interfaces."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "Are we getting closer to objective reality?"}, {"time": 1379, "text": "How do we know if these interfaces in the process of science, the reason we like those interfaces is because they're predictive of some

and closer?"}, {"time": 1402, "text": "Well, of course, one critical constraint on all of our theories is that they are empirically tested and pass the experiments that we have for them."}, {"time":

sorry to pause briefly, did you have a sense, did people know that there's a Stasi type of organization, that there is a large number of people doing this kind of work in East Germany in order for you to make that guess?"}, {"time": 2847, "text": "Yeah, we knew that the Stasi existed."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "We even had our James Bond, we had a series called the Invisible Visor where a Stasi employee in East German would go into West Germany and hunt down Nazis."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "So yes, the Stasi was known to be there."}, {"time": 2867, "text": "And admired in part or feared or both?"}, {"time": 2871, "text": "I thought they were necessary and I admired them."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "Yes, the reason I did so because I had no information to the contrary."}, {"time": 2881,

that they did a lot of damage and that they were doing a lot of surveillance of the East German population the same way the KGB did for the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "So for me to be talking to somebody from the Stasi, it raised my interest."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "I was curious what comes next because I sort of knew something interesting would be coming at me and I had no other thoughts about that at that point."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So when he was finally, when he went for the kill by reversing himself, he said, you know, I got to tell you that I really, I really am not from Karl Stasi, you know, I'm from the government."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "Thank you for pointing that out."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "And then he asked this question, he says, can you imagine to one day work for the government?"}, {"time": 2951, "text": "And so I gave a pretty clever answer."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "I said, yes, but not as a chemist."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "So I answered the question that he didn't ask."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "I helped him out."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "So we made an arrangement to meet for lunch, which in Germany is the main meal at the number one restaurant in Vienna, you know, I still remember what I ate."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "Rump steak with butter on top and French fries, it was my favorite."}, {"time": 2983, "text": "Anyway, so when I get to the restaurant, I saw this fellow sitting in the back there at the table and there was another person at the table."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "So I was a little bit hesitant because in those days it was not unusual for perfect strangers to share a table because there wasn't enough tables and chairs and so forth."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "So I didn't know if I could approach him, but he got up and came to me and he took me to the table and he said, I want to introduce Herman."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "We work with our Soviet comrades."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "Aha, KGB."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "And then he disappeared."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "He says, I got something else to do."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "I never knew his name."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "He just handed me over to the KGB."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "What was the relationship between the KGB and Astazies as collaborators, close collaborators or just distant associates?"}, {"time": 3037, "text": "They were pretty close collaborators as I told you that they bought forged documents that the Germans made because the Germans were better at forgery."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "They also exchanged information, but they didn't trust each other 100% and I tell you why I know that."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "So they recruited me to send me to West Germany."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "As I already said, East Germany had a thousand agents over there."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "Why would they want to have their own?"}, {"time": 3069, "text": "This is a fascinating internal and external dynamic of distrust."}, {"time": 3075, "text": "So there you are welcomed by the KGB."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "When did the offer, the invite come?"}, {"time": 3081, "text": "Well, that took a while."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "So Herman and I had an unofficial relationship for about a year and a half."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "I would meet him once a week, once every two weeks, initially in his car, but then he took me to a conspirational flat that was an apartment that was occupied by a party member, a lady, single lady."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "When we came in, she would leave, she left us tea and cookies and then we could freely talk."}, {"time": 3116, "text": "He also at that time gave me some West German literature magazines to read, which was of course forbidden."}, {"time": 3124, "text": "So I'm starting to feel somewhat special and as we were talking about what they had in mind for me in general, I knew that I was going to be even more special because I would be above the law."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "I would operate outside the law of the countries I would go to as well as East Germany because the magazines and eventually when I joined up, they told me I had better watch West German television, which was also not explicitly prohibited, but it was something that could get you in trouble."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "So on many levels, you're super special, you're the James Bond."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "What was that recruitment testing process like?"}, {"time": 3175, "text": "Testing whether you have what it takes to be a KGB agent?"}, {"time": 3181, "text": "First of all, we had very in depth talks, Herman and I, about life and I still am very honest in sharing my feelings."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "Philosophical or personal?"}, {"time": 3201, "text": "Personal."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "I even told him that I was shy around the girls."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "He was giving you relationship advice or what?"},

brother."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Yeah, he was maybe in his early to mid 30s and I was maybe 10 years younger."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "And what languages did he speak?"}, {"time": 3223, "text": "He spoke German pretty well."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "But he's originally from Russia?"}, {"time": 3228, "text": "Yeah, with a Russian accent."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "So I got in trouble one time with him when I asked him, is your real name German?"}, {"time": 3237, "text": "He didn't like that."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "Was he good with girls?"}, {"time": 3241, "text": "I remember what he told me, he says, you've got to understand one thing, they're looking for guys too."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "Oh, girls are looking for guys too?"}, {"time": 3255, "text": "It's a competitive game."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "So that little flame of love that we talked about and all the shapes that it takes in our life, did he talk to you about that, that that could be taken advantage of, that that could be used or was it implied?"}, {"time": 3272, "text": "Yeah, but not in, it was not very focused, not in great detail."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "So let's, so we talked about personal stuff and you know, like, dislikes, he gave me tasks."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "For instance, when my friend and I hitchhiked from East Germany all the way down to Bulgaria, he told me to write a report about it, what I saw."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "So fundamentally he wanted to see how well I can write and how well I can report, how well I observe."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "He also asked me to write some profiles about fellow students."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "I don't believe that was for them to give him to the Stasi, it was just like, how well do I characterize people?"}, {"time": 3314, "text": "That's important when you're talking about, when I was in the US, active in the US I operated as a spotter."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "So I did exactly that."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "I wrote profiles about people."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "He also gave me some tasks to do that were rather unpleasant."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "He would give me an address and a name of the people who lived at the address and he told me to go there, ring the doorbell and find out something about a relative who lived in West Germany."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "That is undercover exploration, right?"}, {"time": 3355, "text": "So you go, you make up a story and somehow win the confidence of your target to tell you something that you want to know."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "Was that, did that come naturally to you?"}, {"time": 3366, "text": "No, no, I hated it."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "The charisma involved, which part did you hate?"}, {"time": 3369, "text": "Charisma, I think, I

shine."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "So, but anyway, I hated doing that, but I did it well."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "So I, in those days, I had a beard and I rang the bell and..."}, {"time": 3406, "text": "Tall, handsome fella."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "And I looked the part, I said, I'm a sociology student and I'm doing a survey and I asked a whole bunch of questions, would you like to answer

that I wanted to know."}, {"time": 3434, "text": "I did well."}, {"time": 3435, "text": "And the other one that I didn't like, but I also did well with, when Herman drove me around the city and showed

easily sort of, you can kind of lose that connection with life if you forget you're gonna die."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "So I get why people don't wanna think about it."}, {"time": 3588, "text": "But the idea is if I try to pretend I'm not gonna die or just don't think about death or don't at least address it, then I won't feel scared."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "But it can have the opposite

notion of like, oh, is it that we're imprinting into the medium of time, space, everything we do, and that that is a permanent imprint, a frame that upon death can be accessed in the same way we can

interesting experience."}, {"time": 11047, "text": "Combined with everything else, obviously, the ideas, the voices and so on, but just visually it's like a super psychedelic version of Rick and Morty

amount of time that goes into making digital art look like that is, it's insane."}, {"time": 11158, "text": "The amount of work in comping that stuff is just crazy."}, {"time": 11164, "text":

cutting like a few seconds of animation, that was someone's like month, maybe, you know?"}, {"time": 11233, "text": "And like, they understand, but still it's like, whoa, it's brutal."}, {"time":

dumb enough to think that that $12,000 is gonna help you live in LA for a year."}, {"time": 11326, "text": "So then what you do is you move to LA with $12,000 and you find a shitty place that you live at."}, {"time": 11333, "text": "And then you use that money to buy acid and synthesizers."}, {"time": 11338, "text": "And then you run out of the money and then you, then you have to get a job."},

for me."}, {"time": 11351, "text": "And none of, there wasn't, I never had the confidence to be like, I'm gonna be a standup comedian."}, {"time": 11359, "text": "I just thought it'd be cool to work in that building."}, {"time": 11362, "text": "I thought the building looked cool."}, {"time": 11363, "text": "And so, but then like, cause like you work at the comedy store, you get stage time."},

know he was in the room or I would've bombed, you know, and then like, cause he thought I was funny and he liked talking to me."}, {"time": 11396, "text": "He started taking me on the road with him."}, {"time": 11397, "text": "And then, you know, so I don't know, man."}, {"time": 11401, "text": "Was there an element to, there's a beautiful weirdness to you as a human being."}, {"time":
