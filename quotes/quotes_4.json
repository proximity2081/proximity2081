[{"title": "Kevin Scott: Microsoft CTO | Lex Fridman Podcast #30", "id": "QDN6xvhAw94", "quotes": [{"time": 482, "text": "Maybe you can speak to, this connects to AI, so we have a candidate, Andrew Yang, who kind of talks about artificial intelligence and the concern that people have about, you know, automation's impact on society and arguably, Microsoft is at the cutting edge of innovation in all these kinds of ways and so it's pushing AI forward."}, {"time": 507, "text": "How do you think about combining all our conversations together here with radical markets and socialism and innovation in AI that Microsoft is doing and then Andrew Yang's worry that that will result in job loss for the lower and so on."}, {"time": 527, "text": "I think it's sort of one of the most important questions in technology like maybe even in society right now about how is AI going to develop over the course of the next several decades and what's it going to be used for and what benefits will it produce and what negative impacts will it produce and who gets to steer this whole thing."}, {"time": 591, "text": "As a platform."}, {"time": 592, "text": "Yeah, it has to be a platform that other people can use to build businesses, to fulfill their creative objectives, to be entrepreneurs, to solve problems that they have in their work and in their lives."}, {"time": 607, "text": "It can't be a thing where there are a handful of companies sitting in a very small handful of cities geographically who are making all the decisions about what goes into the AI and then on top of all this infrastructure, then build all of the commercially valuable uses for it."}, {"time": 630, "text": "So I think that's bad from a sort of economics and sort of equitable distribution of value perspective, sort of back to this whole notion of did the markets work?"}, {"time": 644, "text": "But I think it's also bad from an innovation perspective because I have infinite amounts of faith in human beings that if you give folks powerful tools, they will go do interesting things and it's more than just a few tens of thousands of people with the interesting tools, it should be millions of people with the tools."}, {"time": 698, "text": "But access to that technology democratized over time."}, {"time": 702, "text": "Like now, like an engine, it's not like a differentiated thing, like there isn't one engine company that builds all the engines and all of the things that use engines are made by this company and like they get all the economics from all of that."}, {"time": 717, "text": "Like fully demarcated, like they're probably, we're sitting here in this room and like even though they're probably things like the MEMS gyroscope that are in both of our phones, like there's like little engines sort of everywhere."}, {"time": 733, "text": "They're just a component in how we build the modern world."}, {"time": 736, "text": "Like AI needs to get there."}, {"time": 737, "text": "Yeah, so that's a really powerful way to think."}, {"time": 740, "text": "If we think of AI as a platform versus a tool that Microsoft owns, as a platform that enables creation on top of it, that's the way to democratize it."}, {"time": 751, "text": "That's really interesting actually."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And Microsoft throughout its history has been positioned well to do that."}, {"time": 758, "text": "And the tie back to this radical markets thing, like so my team has been working with Glenn on this, and Jaren Lanier actually."}, {"time": 770, "text": "So Jaren is the sort of father of virtual reality."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Like he's one of the most interesting human beings on the planet, like a sweet, sweet guy."}, {"time": 782, "text": "And so Jaren and Glenn and folks in my team have been working on this notion of data as labor or like they call it data dignity as well."}, {"time": 793, "text": "And so the idea is that if you, again going back to this sort of industrial analogy, if you think about data as the raw material that is consumed by the machine of AI in order to do useful things, then like we're not doing a really great job right now in having transparent marketplaces for valuing those data contributions."}, {"time": 819, "text": "So and we all make them explicitly like you go to LinkedIn, you sort of set up your profile on LinkedIn, like that's an explicit contribution."}, {"time": 827, "text": "Like you know exactly the information that you're putting into the system."}, {"time": 830, "text": "And like you put it there because you have some nominal notion of what value you're going to get in return."}, {"time": 836, "text": "But it's like only nominal, like you don't know exactly what value you're getting in return."}, {"time": 840, "text": "Like service is free, like it's low amount of perceived debt."}, {"time": 844, "text": "And then you've got all this indirect contribution that you're making just by virtue of interacting with all of the technology that's in your daily life."}, {"time": 853, "text": "And so like what Glenn and Jaren and this data dignity team are trying to do is like, can we figure out a set of mechanisms that let us value those data contributions so that you could create an economy and like a set of controls and incentives that would allow people to like maybe even in the limit, like earn part of their living through the data that they're creating."}, {"time": 881, "text": "And like you can sort of see it in explicit ways."}, {"time": 882, "text": "There are these companies like Scale AI, and like there are a whole bunch of them in China right now that are basically data labeling companies."}, {"time": 892, "text": "So like you're doing supervised machine learning, you need lots and lots of label training data."}, {"time": 897, "text": "And like those people who work for those companies are getting compensated for their data contributions into the system."}, {"time": 907, "text": "That's easier to put a number on their contribution because they're explicitly labeling data."}, {"time": 912, "text": "But you're saying that we're all contributing data in different kinds of ways."}, {"time": 915, "text": "And it's fascinating to start to explicitly try to put a number on it."}, {"time": 922, "text": "It really is."}, {"time": 924, "text": "Because we don't have as much transparency as I think we need in like how the data is getting used."}, {"time": 937, "text": "And it's super complicated."}, {"time": 938, "text": "Like we, I think as technologists sort of appreciate like some of the subtlety there."}, {"time": 944, "text": "It's like the data gets created and then it gets, it's not valuable."}, {"time": 950, "text": "Like the data exhaust that you give off, or the explicit data that I am putting into the system isn't super valuable atomically."}, {"time": 965, "text": "Like it's only valuable when you sort of aggregate it together into sort of large numbers."}, {"time": 970, "text": "This is true even for these like folks who are getting compensated for like labeling things."}, {"time": 974, "text": "Like for supervised machine learning now, like you need lots of labels to train a model that performs well."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And so I think that's one of the challenges."}, {"time": 984, "text": "It's like how do you sort of figure out like because this data is getting combined in so many ways like through these combinations like how the value is flowing."}, {"time": 995, "text": "Yeah, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 997, "text": "And it's fascinating that you're thinking about this."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "And I wasn't even going into this conversation expecting the breadth of research really that Microsoft broadly is thinking about, you're thinking about at Microsoft."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "So if we go back to 89 when Microsoft released Office, or 1990 when they released Windows 3.0."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "In your view, I know you weren't there through its history, but how has the company changed in the 30 years since as you look at it now?"}, {"time": 1032, "text": "The good thing is it's started off as a platform company."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Like it's still a platform company, like the parts of the business that are thriving and most successful are those that are building platforms."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "Like the mission of the company now is, the mission's changed."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "It's like changed in a very interesting way."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "So back in 89, 90 like they were still on the original mission, which was like put a PC on every desk and in every home."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "And it was basically about democratizing access to this new personal computing technology, which when Bill started the company, integrated circuit microprocessors were a brand new thing."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "And people were building homebrew computers from kits, like the way people build ham radios right now."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "I think this is the interesting thing for folks who build platforms in general."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "Bill saw the opportunity there and what personal computers could do."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "And it was like, it was sort of a reach."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "Like you just sort of imagine like where things were when they started the company versus where things are now."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "Like in success, when you've democratized a platform, it just sort of vanishes into the platform."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "You don't pay attention to it anymore."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "Like operating systems aren't a thing anymore."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Like they're super important, like completely critical."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And like when you see one fail, like you just sort of understand."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "But like it's not a thing where you're not like waiting for the next operating system thing in the same way that you were in 1995, right?"}, {"time": 1132, "text": "Like in 1995, like we had Rolling Stones on the stage with the Windows 95 rollout."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "Like it was like the biggest thing in the world."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "Everybody lined up for it the way that people used to line up for iPhone."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "But like, you know, eventually, and like this isn't necessarily a bad thing."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Like it just sort of, you know, the success is that it's sort of, it becomes ubiquitous."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "It's like everywhere, like human beings, when their technology becomes ubiquitous, they just sort of start taking it for granted."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "So the mission now that Satya rearticulated five plus years ago now, when he took over as CEO of the company."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Our mission is to empower every individual and every organization in the world to be more successful."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "And so, you know, again, like that's a platform mission."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And like the way that we do it now is, is different."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "It's like we have a hyperscale cloud that people are building their applications on top of."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Like we have a bunch of AI infrastructure that people are building their AI applications on top of."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "We have, you know, we have a productivity suite of software, like Microsoft Dynamics, which, you know, some people might not think is the sexiest thing in the world, but it's like helping people figure out how to automate all of their business processes and workflows and to help those businesses using it to grow and be more."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "So it's a much broader vision in a way now than it was back then."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Like it was sort of very particular thing."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "And like now, like we live in this world where technology is so powerful and it's like such a basic fact of life that it both exists and is going to get better and better over time or at least more and more powerful over time."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "So like, you know, what you have to do as a platform player is just much bigger."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "There's so many directions in which you can transform."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "You didn't mention mixed reality, too."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "You know, that's probably early days or it depends how you think of it."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "But if we think on a scale of centuries, it's the early days of mixed reality."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "Oh, for sure."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And so with HoloLens, Microsoft is doing some really interesting work there."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "Do you touch that part of the effort?"}, {"time": 1273, "text": "What's the thinking?"}, {"time": 1274, "text": "Do you think of mixed reality as a platform, too?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "When we look at what the platforms of the future could be, it's like fairly obvious that like AI is one."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "Like you don't have to, I mean, like that's, you know, you sort of say it to like someone and you know, like they get it."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "But like we also think of the like mixed reality and quantum as like these two interesting, you know, potentially."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "Quantum computing?"}, {"time": 1302, "text": "So let's get crazy then."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "So you're talking about some futuristic things here."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "Well, the mixed reality, Microsoft is really, it's not even futuristic, it's here."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "It's incredible stuff."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "And look, and it's having an impact right now."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "Like one of the more interesting things that's happened with mixed reality over the past couple of years that I didn't clearly see is that it's become the computing device for folks who, for doing their work, who haven't used any computing device at all to do their work before."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "So technicians and service folks and people who are doing like machine maintenance on factory floors."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "So like they, you know, because they're mobile and like they're out in the world and they're working with their hands and, you know, sort of servicing these like very complicated things, they're, they don't use their mobile phone and like they don't carry a laptop with them and, you know, they're not tethered to a desk."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "And so mixed reality, like where it's getting traction right now, where HoloLens is selling a lot of units is for these sorts of applications for these workers."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "And it's become like, I mean, like the people love it."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "They're like, oh my God, like this is like for them, like the same sort of productivity boosts that, you know, like an office worker had when they got their first personal computer."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "Yeah, but you did mention it's certainly obvious AI as a platform, but can we dig into it a little bit?"}, {"time": 1395, "text": "How does AI begin to infuse some of the products in Microsoft?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "So currently providing training of, for example, neural networks in the cloud or providing pre trained models or just even providing computing resources and whatever different inference that you wanna do using neural networks."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "How do you think of AI infusing as a platform that Microsoft can provide?"}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think it's super interesting."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "It's like everywhere."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And like we run these review meetings now where it's me and Satya and like members of Satya's leadership team and like a cross functional group of folks across the entire company who are working on like either AI infrastructure or like have some substantial part of their product work using AI in some significant way."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Now, the important thing to understand is like when you think about like how the AI is gonna manifest in like an experience for something that's gonna make it better, like I think you don't want the AIness to be the first order thing."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "It's like whatever the product is and like the thing that is trying to help you do, like the AI just sort of makes it better."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And this is a gross exaggeration, but like people get super excited about like where the AI is showing up in products and I'm like, do you get that excited about like where you're using a hash table like in your code?"}, {"time": 1499, "text": "Like it's just another."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "It's just a tool."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "It's a very interesting programming tool, but it's sort of like it's an engineering tool."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "And so like it shows up everywhere."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So like we've got dozens and dozens of features now in Office that are powered by like fairly sophisticated machine learning, our search engine wouldn't work at all if you took the machine learning out of it."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "The like increasingly things like content moderation on our Xbox and xCloud platform."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "When you mean moderation, you mean like the recommender is like showing what you wanna look at next."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "No, no, no, it's like anti bullying stuff."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "So the usual social network stuff that you have to deal with."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "But it's like really it's targeted, it's targeted towards a gaming audience."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "So it's like a very particular type of thing where the line between playful banter and like legitimate bullying is like a subtle one."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "And like you have to like, it's sort of tough."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Like I have."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "I'd love to if we could dig into it because you're also, you led the engineering efforts of LinkedIn."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "And if we look at LinkedIn as a social network, and if we look at the Xbox gaming as the social components, the very different kinds of I imagine communication going on on the two platforms, right?"}, {"time": 1586, "text": "And the line in terms of bullying and so on is different on the platforms."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "So how do you, I mean, it's such a fascinating philosophical discussion of where that line is."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "I don't think anyone knows the right answer."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "Twitter folks are under fire now, Jack at Twitter for trying to find that line."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "Nobody knows what that line is."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "But how do you try to find the line for trying to prevent abusive behavior and at the same time, let people be playful and joke around and that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1622, "text": "I think in a certain way, like if you have what I would call vertical social networks, it gets to be a little bit easier."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "So like if you have a clear notion of like what your social network should be used for, or like what you are designing a community around, then you don't have as many dimensions to your sort of content safety problem as you do in a general purpose platform."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "I mean, so like on LinkedIn, like the whole social network is about connecting people with opportunity, whether it's helping them find a job or to sort of find mentors or to sort of help them like find their next sales lead or to just sort of allow them to broadcast their sort of professional identity to their network of peers and collaborators and sort of professional community."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "Like that is, I mean, like in some ways, like that's very, very broad, but in other ways it's sort of, it's narrow."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "And so like you can build AI's like machine learning systems that are capable with those boundaries of making better automated decisions about like what is sort of inappropriate and offensive comment or dangerous comment or illegal content when you have some constraints."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "You know, same thing with like the gaming social network."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "So for instance, like it's about playing games, not having fun."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "And like the thing that you don't want to have happen on the platform is why bullying is such an important thing."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Like bullying is not fun."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "So you want to do everything in your power to encourage that not to happen."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "And yeah, but I think it's sort of a tough problem in general and it's one where I think, you know, eventually we're going to have to have some sort of clarification from our policymakers about what it is that we should be doing, like where the lines are, because it's tough."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "Like you don't, like in democracy, right?"}, {"time": 1763, "text": "Like you don't want, you want some sort of democratic involvement."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "Like people should have a say in like where the lines are drawn."}, {"time": 1774, "text": "Like you don't want a bunch of people making like unilateral decisions."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And like we are in a state right now for some of these platforms where you actually do have to make unilateral decisions where the policymaking isn't going to happen fast enough in order to like prevent very bad things from happening."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "But like we need the policymaking side of that to catch up, I think, as quickly as possible because you want that whole process to be a democratic thing, not a, you know, not some sort of weird thing where you've got a non representative group of people making decisions that have, you know, like national and global impact."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "And it's fascinating because the digital space is different than the physical space in which nations and governments were established."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "And so what policy looks like globally, what bullying looks like globally, what's healthy communication looks like globally is an open question and we're all figuring it out together, which is fascinating."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "Yeah, I mean with, you know, sort of fake news, for instance."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Deep fakes and fake news generated by humans?"}, {"time": 1842, "text": "Yeah, so we can talk about deep fakes, like I think that is another like, you know, sort of very interesting level of complexity."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "But like if you think about just the written word, right?"}, {"time": 1851, "text": "Like we have, you know, we invented papyrus, what, 3,000 years ago where we, you know, you could sort of put word on paper."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And then 500 years ago, like we get the printing press, like where the word gets a little bit more ubiquitous."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "And then like you really, really didn't get ubiquitous printed word until the end of the 19th century when the offset press was invented."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "And then, you know, just sort of explodes and like, you know, the cross product of that and the Industrial Revolution's need for educated citizens resulted in like this rapid expansion of literacy and the rapid expansion of the word."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "But like we had 3,000 years up to that point to figure out like how to, you know, like what's journalism, what's editorial integrity, like what's, you know, what's scientific peer review."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "And so like you built all of this mechanism to like try to filter through all of the noise that the technology made possible to like, you know, sort of getting to something that society could cope with."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "And like, if you think about just the piece, the PC didn't exist 50 years ago."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "And so in like this span of, you know, like half a century, like we've gone from no digital, you know, no ubiquitous digital technology to like having a device that sits in your pocket where you can sort of say whatever is on your mind to like what did Mary have in her, Mary Meeker just released her new like slide deck last week."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "You know, we've got 50% penetration of the internet to the global population."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "Like there are like three and a half billion people who are connected now."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "So it's like, it's crazy, crazy, like inconceivable, like how fast all of this happened."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "So, you know, it's not surprising that we haven't figured out what to do yet, but like we gotta really like lean into this set of problems because like we basically have three millennia worth of work to do about how to deal with all of this and like probably what, you know, amounts to the next decade worth of time."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So since we're on the topic of tough, you know, tough challenging problems, let's look at more on the tooling side in AI that Microsoft is looking at is face recognition software."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "So there's a lot of powerful positive use cases for face recognition, but there's some negative ones and we're seeing those in different governments in the world."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "So how do you, how does Microsoft think about the use of face recognition software as a platform in governments and companies?"}, {"time": 2019, "text": "How do we strike an ethical balance here?"}, {"time": 2022, "text": "Yeah, I think we've articulated a clear point of view."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "So Brad Smith wrote a blog post last fall, I believe that sort of like outlined like very specifically what, you know, what our point of view is there."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "And, you know, I think we believe that there are certain uses to which face recognition should not be put."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And we believe again, that there's a need for regulation there."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "Like the government should like really come in and say that, you know, this is where the lines are."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "And like, we very much wanted to like figuring out where the lines are, should be a democratic process."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "But in the short term, like we've drawn some lines where, you know, we push back against uses of face recognition technology, you know, like the city of San Francisco, for instance, I think has completely outlawed any government agency from using face recognition tech."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "And like that may prove to be a little bit overly broad."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "But for like certain law enforcement things, like you really, I would personally rather be overly sort of cautious in terms of restricting use of it until like we have, you know, sort of defined a reasonable, you know, democratically determined regulatory framework for like where we could and should use it."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "And, you know, the other thing there is like, we've got a bunch of research that we're doing and a bunch of progress that we've made on bias there."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "And like, there are all sorts of like weird biases that these models can have, like all the way from like the most noteworthy one where, you know, you may have underrepresented minorities who are like underrepresented in the training data and then you start learning like strange things."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "But like there are even, you know, other weird things."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "Like we've, I think we've seen in the public research, like models can learn strange things, like all doctors are men, for instance, just, yeah."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "I mean, and so like, it really is a thing where it's very important for everybody who is working on these things before they push publish, they launch the experiment, they, you know, push the code to, you know, online, or they even publish the paper that they are at least starting to think about what some of the potential negative consequences are, some of this stuff."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "I mean, this is where, you know, like the deep fake stuff I find very worrisome just because there are going to be some very good beneficial uses of like GAN generated imagery."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "And funny enough, like one of the places where it's actually useful is we're using the technology right now to generate synthetic visual data for training

this?"}, {"time": 2351, "text": "Like you can click something and like have a verified chain of custody that shows like, oh, this is coming from this source."}, {"time": 2359, "text": "And it's like

interesting things."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "Like the auto response stuff's getting better and better."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "And it's like getting to the point where it can auto respond with

it."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "But if it overloads the system, it'll feel unpleasant."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "So in that same way, ethics, there's a feeling of how socially acceptable it is."},

positives, i.e."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "people that are not creditworthy or are not gonna repay your loan, that get a loan, you might think of them as lucky."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And so that's not a harm, although it's not clear that if you don't have the means to repay a loan, that being given a loan is not also a harm."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "So, you know, the literature is sort of so far quite limited in that you sort of need to say, who do you want to protect and what would constitute harm to that group?"}, {"time": 1117, "text": "And when you ask questions like, will algorithms feel ethical?"}, {"time": 1122, "text": "One way in which they won't, under the definitions that I'm describing, is if, you know, if you are an individual who is falsely denied a loan, incorrectly denied a loan, all of these definitions basically say like, well, you know, your compensation is the knowledge that we are also falsely denying loans to other people, you know, in other groups at the same rate that we're doing it to you."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "And, you know, and so there is actually this interesting even technical tension in the field right now between these sort of group notions of fairness and notions of fairness that might actually feel like real fairness to individuals, right?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "They might really feel like their particular interests are being protected or thought about by the algorithm rather than just, you know, the groups that they happen to be members of."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Is there parallels to the big O

that one individual?"}, {"time": 1188, "text": "So like worst case analysis, is that something you think about or?"}, {"time": 1192, "text": "I mean, I think we're not even at the point where we can sensibly think about that."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So first of all, you know, we're talking here both about fairness applied at the group level, which is a relatively weak thing, but it's better than nothing."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "And also the more ambitious thing of trying to give some individual promises, but even that doesn't incorporate, I think something that you're hinting at here is what I might call subjective fairness, right?"}, {"time": 1220, "text": "So a lot of the definitions, I mean, all of the definitions in the algorithmic fairness literature are what I would kind of call received wisdom definitions."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "It's sort of, you know, somebody like me sits around and things like, okay, you know, I think here's a technical definition of fairness that I think people should want or that they should, you know, think of as some notion of fairness, maybe not the only one, maybe not the best one, maybe not the last one."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "But we really actually don't know from a subjective standpoint, like what people really think is fair."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "And to my knowledge, there's not a large literature in which ordinary people are asked about, you know, they have sort of notions of their subjective fairness elicited from them."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "It's mainly, you know, kind of scholars who think about fairness kind of making up their own definitions."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "And I think this needs to change actually for many social norms, not just for fairness, right?"}, {"time": 1310, "text": "So there's a lot of discussion these days in the AI community about interpretable AI or understandable AI."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And as far as I can tell, everybody agrees that deep learning or at least the outputs of deep learning are not very understandable, and people might agree that sparse linear models with integer coefficients are more understandable."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "But nobody's really asked people."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "You know, there's very little literature on, you know, sort of showing people models and asking them, do they understand what the model is doing?"}, {"time": 1345, "text": "And I think that in all these topics, as these fields mature, we need to start doing more behavioral work."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Yeah, which is one of my deep passions is psychology."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "And I always thought computer scientists will be the best future psychologists in a sense that data is, especially in this modern world, the data is a really powerful way to understand and study human behavior."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "And you've explored that with your game theory side of work as well."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "Yeah, I'd like to think that what you say is true about computer scientists and psychology from my own limited wandering into human subject experiments."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "We have a great deal to learn, not just computer science, but AI and machine learning more specifically, I kind of think of as imperialist research communities in that, you know, kind of like physicists in an earlier generation, computer scientists kind of don't think of any scientific topic that's off limits to them."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "They will like freely wander into areas that others have been thinking about for decades or longer."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And, you know, we usually tend to embarrass ourselves in those efforts for some amount of time."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "Like, you know, I think reinforcement learning is a good example, right?"}, {"time": 1421, "text": "So a lot of the early work in reinforcement learning, I have complete sympathy for the control theorists that looked at this and said like, okay, you are reinventing stuff that we've known since like the forties, right?"}, {"time": 1435, "text": "But, you know, in my view, eventually this sort of, you know, computer scientists have made significant contributions to that field, even though we kind of embarrassed ourselves for the first decade."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "So I think if computer scientists are gonna start engaging in kind of psychology, human subjects type of research, we should expect to be embarrassing ourselves for a good 10 years or so, and then hope that it turns out as well as, you know, some other areas that we've waded into."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "So you kind of mentioned this, just to linger on the idea of an ethical algorithm, of idea of groups, sort of group thinking and individual thinking."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "And we're struggling that."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "One of the amazing things about algorithms and your book and just this field of study is it gets us to ask, like forcing machines, converting these ideas into algorithms is forcing us to ask questions of ourselves as a human civilization."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "So there's a lot of people now in public discourse doing sort of group thinking, thinking like there's particular sets of groups that we don't wanna discriminate against and so on."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And then there is individuals, sort of in the individual life stories, the struggles they went through and so on."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Now, like in philosophy, it's easier to do group thinking because you don't, it's very hard to think about individuals."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "There's so much variability, but with data, you can start to actually say, you know what group thinking is too crude."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "You're actually doing more discrimination by thinking in terms of groups and individuals."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Can you linger on that kind of idea of group versus individual and ethics?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And is it good to continue thinking in terms of groups in algorithms?"}, {"time": 1541, "text": "So let me start by answering a very good high level question with a slightly narrow technical response, which is these group definitions of fairness, like here's a few groups, like different racial groups, maybe gender groups, maybe age, what have you."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "And let's make sure that for none of these groups, do we have a false negative rate, which is much higher than any other one of these groups."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "Okay, so these are kind of classic group aggregate notions of fairness."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "And you know, but at the end of the day, an individual you can think of as a combination of all of their attributes, right?"}, {"time": 1579, "text": "They're a member of a racial group, they have a gender, they have an age, and many other demographic properties that are not biological, but that are still very strong determinants of outcome and personality and the like."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "So one, I think, useful spectrum is to sort of think about that array between the group and the specific individual, and to realize that in some ways, asking for fairness at the individual level is to sort of ask for group fairness simultaneously for all possible combinations of groups."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "So the optimization, actually, that's a fascinating way to put it."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "So you're just optimizing, the one way to achieve the optimizing fairness for individuals is just to add more and more definitions of groups that each individual belongs to."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "So, you know, at the end of the day, we could think of all of ourselves as groups of size one because eventually there's some attribute that separates you from me and everybody else in the world, okay?"}, {"time": 1677, "text": "And so it is possible to put, you know, these incredibly coarse ways of thinking about fairness and these very, very individualistic specific ways on a common scale."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "And you know, one of the things we've worked on from a research perspective is, you know, so we sort of know how to, you know, in relative terms, we know how to provide fairness guarantees at the core system of the scale."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "We don't know how to provide kind of sensible, tractable, realistic fairness guarantees at the individual level, but maybe we could start creeping towards that by dealing with more refined subgroups."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "I mean, we gave a name to this phenomenon where, you know, you protect, you enforce some definition of fairness for a bunch of marginal attributes or features, but then you find yourself discriminating against a combination of them."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "We call that fairness gerrymandering because like political gerrymandering, you know, you're giving some guarantee at the aggregate level, but when you kind of look in a more granular way at what's going on, you realize that you're achieving that aggregate guarantee by sort of favoring some groups and discriminating against other ones."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And so there are, you know, it's early days, but there are algorithmic approaches that let you start creeping towards that, you know, individual end of the spectrum."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "Does there need to be human input in the form of weighing the value of the importance of each kind of group?"}, {"time": 1773, "text": "So for example, is it like, so gender, say crudely speaking, male and female, and then different races, are we as humans supposed to put value on saying gender is 0.6 and race is 0.4 in terms of in the big optimization of achieving fairness?"}, {"time": 1799, "text": "Is that kind of what humans are supposed to do here?"}, {"time": 1801, "text": "I mean, of course, you know, I don't need to tell you that, of course, technically one could incorporate such weights if you wanted to into a definition of fairness."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "You know, fairness is an interesting topic in that having worked in the book being about both fairness, privacy, and many other social norms, fairness, of course, is a much, much more loaded topic."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So privacy, I mean, people want privacy, people don't like violations of privacy, violations of privacy cause damage, angst, and bad publicity for the companies that are victims of them."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "But sort of everybody agrees more data privacy would be better than less data privacy."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "And you don't have these, somehow the discussions of fairness don't become politicized along other dimensions like race and about gender and, you know, whether we, and, you know, you quickly find yourselves kind of revisiting topics that have been kind of unresolved forever, like affirmative action, right?"}, {"time": 1872, "text": "Sort of, you know, like, why are you protecting, and some people will say, why are you protecting this particular racial group?"}, {"time": 1880, "text": "And others will say, well, we need to do that as a matter of retribution."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Other people will say, it's a matter of economic opportunity."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "And I don't know which of, you know, whether any of these are the right answers, but you sort of, fairness is sort of special in that as soon as you start talking about it, you inevitably have to participate in debates about fair to whom, at what expense to who else."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "I mean, even in criminal justice, right, you know, where people talk about fairness in criminal sentencing or, you know, predicting failures to appear or making parole decisions or the like, they will, you know, they'll point out that, well, these definitions of fairness are all about fairness for the criminals."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "And what about fairness for the victims, right?"}, {"time": 1936, "text": "So when I basically say something like, well, the false incarceration rate for black people and white people needs to be roughly the same, you know, there's no mention of potential victims of criminals in such a fairness definition."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "And that's the realm of public discourse."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "I should actually recommend, I just listened to people listening, Intelligence Squares debates, US edition just had a debate."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "They have this structure where you have old Oxford style or whatever they're called, debates, you know, it's two versus two and they talked about affirmative action and it was incredibly interesting that there's really good points on every side of this issue, which is fascinating to listen to."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "Yeah, yeah, I agree."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And so it's interesting to be a researcher trying to do, for the most part, technical algorithmic work, but Aaron and I both quickly learned you cannot do that and then go out and talk about it and expect people to take it seriously if you're unwilling to engage in these broader debates that are entirely extra algorithmic, right?"}, {"time": 2008, "text": "They're not about, you know, algorithms and making algorithms better."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "They're sort of, you know, as you said, sort of like, what should society be protecting in the first place?"}, {"time": 2016, "text": "When you discuss the fairness, an algorithm that achieves fairness, whether in the constraints and the objective function, there's an immediate kind of analysis you can perform, which is saying, if you care about fairness in gender, this is the amount that you have to pay for it in terms of the performance of the system."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "Like do you, is there a role for statements like that in a table, in a paper, or do you want to really not touch that?"}, {"time": 2046, "text": "No, no, we want to touch that and we do touch it."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "So I mean, just again, to make sure I'm not promising your viewers more than we know how to provide, but if you pick a definition of fairness, like I'm worried about gender discrimination and you pick a notion of harm, like false rejection for a loan, for example, and you give me a model, I can definitely, first of all, go audit that model."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "It's easy for me to go, you know, from data to kind of say like, okay, your false rejection rate on women is this much higher than it is on men, okay?"}, {"time": 2081, "text": "But once you also put the fairness into your objective function, I mean, I think the table that you're talking about is what we would call the Pareto curve, right?"}, {"time": 2091, "text": "You can literally trace out, and we give examples of such plots on real data sets in the book, you have two axes."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "On the X axis is your error, on the Y axis is unfairness by whatever, you know, if it's like the disparity between false rejection rates between two groups."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "And you know, your algorithm now has a knob that basically says, how strongly do I want to enforce fairness?"}, {"time": 2119, "text": "And the less unfair, you know, if the two axes are error and unfairness, we'd like to be at zero, zero."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "We'd like zero error and zero unfairness simultaneously."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "Anybody who works in machine learning knows that you're generally not going to get to zero error period without any fairness constraint whatsoever."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "So that's not going to happen."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "But in general, you know, you'll get this, you'll get some kind of convex curve that specifies the numerical trade off you face."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "You know, if I want to go from 17% error down to 16% error, what will be the increase in unfairness that I experienced as a result of that?"}, {"time": 2162, "text": "And so this curve kind of specifies the, you know, kind of undominated models."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "Models that are off that curve are, you know, can be strictly improved in one or both dimensions."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "You can, you know, either make the error better or the unfairness better or both."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "And I think our view is that not only are these objects, these Pareto curves, you know, with efficient frontiers as you might call them, not only are they valuable scientific objects, I actually think that they in the near term might need to be the interface between researchers working in the field and stakeholders in given problems."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "So you know, you could really imagine telling a criminal jurisdiction, look, if you're concerned about racial fairness, but you're also concerned about accuracy."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "You want to, you know, you want to release on parole people that are not going to recommit a violent crime and you don't want to release the ones who are."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "So you know, that's accuracy."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "But if you also care about those, you know, the mistakes you make not being disproportionately on one racial group or another, you can show this curve."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "I'm hoping that in the near future, it'll be possible to explain these curves to non technical people that are the ones that have to make the decision, where do we want to be on this curve?"}, {"time": 2250, "text": "Like, what are the relative merits or value of having lower error versus lower unfairness?"}, {"time": 2258, "text": "You know, that's not something computer scientists should be deciding for society, right?"}, {"time": 2263, "text": "That, you know, the people in the field, so to speak, the policymakers, the regulators, that's who should be making these decisions."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "But I think and hope that they can be made to understand that these trade offs generally exist and that you need to pick a point and like, and ignoring the trade off, you know, you're implicitly picking a point anyway, right?"}, {"time": 2286, "text": "You just don't know it and you're not admitting it."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "Just to linger on the point of trade offs, I think that's a really important thing to sort of think about."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "So you think when we start to optimize for fairness, there's almost always in most system going to be trade offs."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "Can you like, what's the trade off between just to clarify, there have been some sort of technical terms thrown around, but sort of a perfectly fair world."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "Why will somebody be upset about that?"}, {"time": 2323, "text": "The specific trade off I talked about just in order to make things very concrete was between numerical error and some numerical measure of unfairness."}, {"time": 2333, "text": "What is numerical error in the case of... Just like say predictive error, like, you know, the probability or frequency with which you release somebody on parole who then goes on to recommit a violent crime or keep incarcerated somebody who would not have recommitted a violent crime."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "So in the case of awarding somebody parole or giving somebody parole or letting them out on parole, you don't want them to recommit a crime."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "So it's your system failed in prediction if they happen to do a crime."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "Okay, so that's one axis."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "And what's the fairness axis?"}, {"time": 2371, "text": "So then the fairness axis might be the difference between racial groups in the kind of false positive predictions, namely people that I kept incarcerated predicting that they would recommit a violent crime when in fact they wouldn't have."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "And the unfairness of that, just to linger it and allow me to in eloquently to try to sort of describe why that's unfair, why unfairness is there."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "The unfairness you want to get rid of is that in the judge's mind, the bias of having being brought up to society, the slight racial bias, the racism that exists in the society, you want to remove that from the system."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Another way that's been debated is sort of equality of opportunity versus equality of outcome."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "And there's a weird dance there that's really difficult to get right."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "And we don't, affirmative action is exploring that space."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "And then this also quickly bleeds into questions like, well, maybe if one group really does recommit crimes at a higher rate, the reason for that is that at some earlier point in the pipeline or earlier in their lives, they didn't receive the same resources that the other group did."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "And so there's always in kind of fairness discussions, the possibility that the real injustice came earlier, right?"}, {"time": 2471, "text": "Earlier in this individual's life, earlier in this group's history, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "And so a lot of the fairness discussion is almost, the goal is for it to be a corrective mechanism to account for the injustice earlier in life."}, {"time": 2485, "text": "By some definitions of fairness or some theories of fairness, yeah."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "Others would say like, look, it's not to correct that injustice, it's just to kind of level the playing field right now and not falsely incarcerate more people of one group than another group."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "But I mean, I think just it might be helpful just to demystify a little bit about the many ways in which bias or unfairness can come into algorithms, especially in the machine learning era, right?"}, {"time": 2515, "text": "I think many of your viewers have probably heard these examples before, but let's say I'm building a face recognition system, right?"}, {"time": 2524, "text": "And so I'm kind of gathering lots of images of faces and trying to train the system to recognize new faces of those individuals from training on a training set of those faces of individuals."}, {"time": 2573, "text": "Now, there's a bunch of ways you could think about addressing this."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "One is to deliberately put into the objective of the algorithm not to optimize the error at the expense of this discrimination, and then you're kind of back in the land of these kind of two dimensional numerical trade offs."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "A valid counter argument is to say like, well, no, you don't have to, there's no, you know, the notion of the tension between error and accuracy here is a false one."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "You could instead just go out and get much more data on these other groups that are in the minority and, you know, equalize your data set, or you could train a separate model on those subgroups and, you know, have multiple models."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "The point I think we would, you know, we tried to make in the book is that those things have cost too, right?"}, {"time": 2625, "text": "Going out and gathering more data on groups that are relatively rare compared to your plurality or more majority group that, you know, it may not cost you in the accuracy of the model, but it's going to cost, you know, it's going to cost the company developing this model more money to develop that, and it also costs more money to build separate predictive models and to implement and deploy them."}, {"time": 2647, "text": "So even if you can find a way to avoid the tension between error and accuracy in training a model, you might push the cost somewhere else, like money, like development time, research time and the like."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "There are fundamentally difficult philosophical questions, in fairness, and we live in a very divisive political climate, outraged culture."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "There is alt right folks on 4chan, trolls."}, {"time": 2678, "text": "There is social justice warriors on Twitter."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "There's very divisive, outraged folks on all sides of every kind of system."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "How do you, how do we as engineers build ethical algorithms in such divisive culture?"}, {"time": 2697, "text": "Do you think they could be disjoint?"}, {"time": 2699, "text": "The human has to inject your values, and then you can optimize over those values."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "But in our times, when you start actually applying these systems, things get a little bit challenging for the public discourse."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "How do you think we can proceed?"}, {"time": 2714, "text": "Yeah, I mean, for the most part in the book, a point that we try to take some pains to make is that we don't view ourselves or people like us as being in the position of deciding for society what the right social norms are, what the right definitions of fairness are."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "Our main point is to just show that if society or the relevant stakeholders in a particular domain can come to agreement on those sorts of things, there's a way of encoding that into algorithms in many cases, not in all cases."}, {"time": 2750, "text": "One other misconception that hopefully we definitely dispel is sometimes people read the title of the book and I think not unnaturally fear that what we're suggesting is that the algorithms themselves should decide what those social norms are and develop their own notions of fairness and privacy or ethics, and we're definitely not suggesting that."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "The title of the book is Ethical Algorithm, by the way, and I didn't think of that interpretation of the title."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "I mean, especially these days where people are concerned about the robots becoming our overlords, the idea that the robots would also sort of develop their own social norms is just one step away from that."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "But they had to make, so if we look at people at the heads of companies and so on, they had to make those decisions, right?"}, {"time": 2822, "text": "There has to be decisions, so there's two options, either you kind of put your head in the sand and don't think about these things and just let the algorithm do what it does, or you make decisions about what you value, you know, of injecting moral values into the algorithm."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "Look, I never mean to be an apologist for the tech industry, but I think it's a little bit too far to sort of say that explicit decisions were made about these things."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "So let's, for instance, take social media platforms, right?"}, {"time": 2854, "text": "So like many inventions in technology and computer science, a lot of these platforms that we now use regularly kind of started as curiosities, right?"}, {"time": 2865, "text": "I remember when things like Facebook came out and its predecessors like Friendster, which nobody even remembers now, people really wonder, like, why would anybody want to spend time doing that?"}, {"time": 2876, "text": "I mean, even the web when it first came out, when it wasn't populated with much content and it was largely kind of hobbyists building their own kind of ramshackle websites, a lot of people looked at this and said, well, what is the purpose of this thing?"}, {"time": 2889, "text": "Why is this interesting?"}, {"time": 2891, "text": "Who would want to do this?"}, {"time": 2892, "text": "And so even things like Facebook and Twitter, yes, technical decisions were made by engineers, by scientists, by executives in the design of those platforms, but, you know, I don't think 10 years ago anyone anticipated that those platforms, for instance, might kind of acquire undue, you know, influence on political discourse or on the outcomes of elections."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And I think the scrutiny that these companies are getting now is entirely appropriate, but I think it's a little too harsh to kind of look at history and sort of say like, oh, you should have been able to anticipate that this would happen with your platform."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "And in this sort of gaming chapter of the book, one of the points we're making is that, you know, these platforms, right, they don't operate in isolation."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "So unlike the other topics we're discussing, like fairness and privacy, like those are really cases where algorithms can operate on your data and make decisions about you and you're not even aware of it, okay?"}, {"time": 2956, "text": "Things like Facebook and Twitter, these are, you know, these are systems, right?"}, {"time": 2960, "text": "These are social systems and their evolution, even their technical evolution because machine learning is involved, is driven in no small part by the behavior of the users themselves and how the users decide to adopt them and how to use them."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "And so, you know, I'm kind of like who really knew that, you know, until we saw it happen, who knew that these things might be able to influence the outcome of elections?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "Who knew that, you know, they might polarize political discourse because of the ability to, you know, decide who you interact with on the platform and also with the platform naturally using machine learning to optimize for your own interest that they would further isolate us from each other and, you know, like feed us all basically just the stuff that we already agreed with."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "So I

some stuff that we think that they don't like, or that's a little bit further away."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "And you could even imagine users being able to control this, you know, just like

Netflix prize, when you can start combining stuff together."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "So this is exactly the problem with these notions, right?"}, {"time": 4145, "text": "Is that notions of a anonymization, removing personally identifiable information, the kind of fundamental conceptual flaw is that, you know, these definitions kind of pretend as if the data set in question is the only data set that exists in the world or that ever will exist in the future."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "And of course, things like the Netflix prize and many, many other examples since the Netflix prize,

other allegedly anonymized data sets and maybe publicly available information about you."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "You know, for people who don't know the Netflix prize was, was being publicly released this data."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "So the names from those rows were removed, but what was released is the preference or the ratings of what movies you like and you don't like."}, {"time":

users publicly rate their movie, you know, their movie preferences."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "And so the anonymized data and Netflix, when it's just this phenomenon, I think that we've all come to realize in the last decade or so is that just knowing a few apparently irrelevant innocuous things about you can often act as a fingerprint."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "Like if I know, you know, what, what rating you gave to these 10 movies and the date on which you entered these movies, this is almost like a fingerprint for you in the sea of all Netflix users."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "There were just another paper on this in science or nature of about a month ago that, you know, kind of 18 attributes."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "So we live in this era where, you know, even the apparently

differential privacy basically is a kind of alternate, much stronger notion of privacy than these anonymization ideas."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "And, you know, it's a technical definition, but like the spirit of it is we compare two alternate worlds, okay?"}, {"time": 4340, "text": "So let's suppose I'm a researcher and I want to do, you know, there's a database of medical records and one of them is yours, and I want to use that database of medical records to build a predictive model for some disease."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "So based on people's symptoms and test results and the like, I want to, you know, build a probably model predicting the probability that people have disease."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "So, you know, this is the type of scientific research that we would like to be allowed to continue."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "And in differential privacy, you ask a very particular counterfactual question."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "We basically compare two alternatives."}, {"time": 4377, "text": "One is when I do this, I build this model on the database of medical records, including your medical record."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "And the other one is where I do the same exercise with the same database with just your medical record removed."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "So basically, you know, it's two databases, one with N records in it and one with N minus one records in it."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "The N minus one records are the same, and the only one that's missing in the second case is your medical record."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "So differential privacy basically says that any harms that might come to you from the analysis in which your data was included are essentially nearly identical to the harms that would have come to you if the same analysis had been done without your medical record included."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "So in other words, this doesn't say that bad things cannot happen to you as a result of data analysis."}, {"time": 4439, "text": "It just says that these bad things were going to happen to you already, even if your data wasn't included."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "And to give a very concrete example, right, you know, like we discussed at some length, the study that, you know, in the 50s that was done that established the link between smoking and lung cancer."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "And we make the point that, like, well, if your data was used in that analysis and, you know, the world kind of knew that you were a smoker because, you know, there was no stigma associated with smoking before those findings, real harm might have come to you as a result of that study that your data was included in."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "In particular, your insurer now might have a higher posterior belief that you might have lung cancer and raise your premium."}, {"time": 4484, "text": "So you've suffered economic damage."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "But the point is, is that if the same analysis has been done with all the other N minus one medical records and just yours missing, the outcome would have been the same."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "Or your data wasn't idiosyncratically crucial to establishing the link between smoking and lung cancer because the link between smoking and lung cancer is like a fact about the world that can be discovered with any sufficiently large database of medical records."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "But that's a very low value of harm."}, {"time": 4518, "text": "So that's showing that very little harm is done."}, {"time": 4521, "text": "But how what is the mechanism of differential privacy?"}, {"time": 4524, "text": "So that's the kind of beautiful statement of it."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "It's the mechanism by which privacy is preserved."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "So it's basically by adding noise to computations, right?"}, {"time": 4534, "text": "So the basic idea is that every differentially private algorithm, first of all, or every good differentially private algorithm, every useful one, is a probabilistic algorithm."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "So it doesn't, on a given input, if you gave the algorithm the same input multiple times, it would give different outputs each time from some distribution."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "And the way you achieve differential privacy algorithmically is by kind of carefully and tastefully adding noise to a computation in the right places."}, {"time": 4565, "text": "And to give a very concrete example, if I wanna compute the average of a set of numbers, the non private way of doing that is to take those numbers and average them and release like a numerically precise value for the average."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "In differential privacy, you wouldn't do that."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "You would first compute that average to numerical precisions, and then you'd add some noise to it, right?"}, {"time": 4590, "text": "You'd add some kind of zero mean, Gaussian or exponential noise to it so that the actual value you output is not the exact mean, but it'll be close to the mean, but it'll be close..."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "The noise that you add will sort of prove that nobody can kind of reverse engineer any particular value that went into the average."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "So noise is a savior."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "How many algorithms can be aided by adding noise?"}, {"time": 4621, "text": "Yeah, so I'm a relatively recent member of the differential privacy community."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "My co author, Aaron Roth is really one of the founders of the field and has done a great deal of work and I've learned a tremendous amount working with him on it."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "It's a pretty grown up field already."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "Yeah, but now it's pretty mature."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "But I must admit, the first time I saw the definition of differential privacy, my reaction was like, wow, that is a clever definition and it's really making very strong promises."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "And I first saw the definition in much earlier days and my first reaction was like, well, my worry about this definition would be that it's a great definition of privacy, but that it'll be so restrictive that we won't really be able to use it."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "We won't be able to compute many things in a differentially private way."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "So that's one of the great successes of the field, I think, is in showing that the opposite is true and that most things that we know how to compute, absent any privacy considerations, can be computed in a differentially private way."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "So for example, pretty much all of statistics and machine learning can be done differentially

abstracted away."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "So in case of computation, you can ask yourself, what are the mathematical objects or so that could bring such a properties?"}, {"time": 1301, "text": "So for instance, if we think about the models, uh, AI models, the, what they truly try to do, uh, or like a models like GPT is, uh, uh, you know, they try to predict, uh, next word or so."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And this turns out to be equivalent to, uh, compressing, uh, text."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "Um, and, uh, because in some sense, compression means that, uh, you learn the model of reality and you have just to, uh, remember where are your mistakes."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "The better you are in predicting the, and, and, and in some sense, when we look at our experience, also, when you look, for instance, at the car driving, you know, in which direction it will go, you are good like in prediction."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And, um, you know, it might be the case that the consciousness is intertwined with, uh, compression, it might be also the case that self consciousness, uh, has to do with compress or trying to compress itself."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "So, um, okay."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "I was just wondering, what are the objects in, you know, mathematics or computer science, which are mysterious that could, uh, that, that, that could have to do with consciousness."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "And then I thought, um, you know, you, you see in mathematics, there is something called Gadel theorem, uh, which means, okay, you have, if you have sufficiently complicated mathematical system, it is possible to point the mathematical system back on itself."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "In computer science, there is, uh, something called helping problem."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "It's, it's somewhat similar construction."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "So I thought that, you know, if we believe that, uh, that, uh, that under assumption that consciousness has to do with, uh, with compression, uh, then you could imagine that the, that the, as you keep on compressing things, then at some point, it actually makes sense for the compressor to compress itself."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Metacompression consciousness is metacompression."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "That's a, that's an I, an, an, an idea."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "And in some sense, you know, the crazy, thank you."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "So, uh, but do you think if we think of a Turing machine, a universal Turing machine, can that achieve consciousness?"}, {"time": 1435, "text": "So is there some thing beyond our traditional definition of computation that's required?"}, {"time": 1442, "text": "So it's a specific computation."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "And I said, this computation has to do with compression and, uh, the compression itself, maybe other way of putting it is like, uh, you are internally creating the model of reality in order, like, uh, it's like a, you try inside to simplify reality in order to predict what's going to happen."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And, um, that also feels somewhat similar to how I think actually about my own conscious experience, though clearly I don't have access to reality."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "The only access to reality is through, you know, cable going to my brain and my brain is creating a simulation of reality and I have access to the simulation of reality."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "Are you by any chance, uh, aware of, uh, the Hutter prize, Marcus Hutter?"}, {"time": 1484, "text": "He, uh, he made this prize for compression."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Uh, Wikipedia pages, and, uh, there's a few qualities to it."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "One, I think has to be perfect compression, which makes, I think that little cork makes it much less, um, applicable to the general task of intelligence, because it feels like intelligence is always going to be messy."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Uh, like perfect compression is feels like it's not the right goal, but it's nevertheless a very interesting goal."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So for him, intelligence equals compression."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "And so the smaller you make the file, given a large Wikipedia page, the more intelligent the system has to be."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "Yeah, that makes sense."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "So you can make perfect compression if you store errors."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And I think that actually what he meant is you have algorithm plus errors."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "Uh, by the way, Hutter, Hutter is, uh, he was a PhD advisor of Sean Leck, who is a DeepMind, uh, uh, DeepMind cofounder."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "So there's an interesting, uh, and now he's a DeepMind, there's an interesting, uh, network of people."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And he's one of the people that I think seriously took on the task of what would an AGI system look like?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "Uh, I think for a longest time, the question of AGI was not taken seriously or rather rigorously."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "So he developed the framework even to describe what's optimal with respect to reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "Like there is a theoretical framework, which is, as you said, under assumption, there is infinite amount of memory and compute."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "Um, there was actually one person before his name is Solomonov, who there extended, uh, Solomonov work to reinforcement learning, but there exists the, uh, theoretical algorithm, which is optimal algorithm to build intelligence and I can actually explain you the algorithm."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "So the task itself, can I just pause how absurd it is for brain in a skull, trying to explain the algorithm for intelligence, just go ahead."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "It is pretty crazy."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "It is pretty crazy that, you know, the brain itself is actually so small and it can ponder, uh, how to design algorithms that optimally solve the problem of intelligence."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "So what's the algorithm?"}, {"time": 1666, "text": "So first of all, the task itself is, uh, described as, uh, you have infinite sequence of zeros and ones."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "You read, uh, N bits and they are about to predict N plus one bit."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "So that's the task."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "And you could imagine that every task could be casted as such a task."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "So if for instance, you have images and labels, you can just turn every image into a sequence of zeros and ones, then label, you concatenate labels and you, and that that's actually the, the, and you could, you could start by having training data first, and then afterwards you have test data."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "So theoretically any problem could be casted as a problem of predicting zeros and ones on this, uh, infinite tape."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "So, um, so let's say you read already N bits and you want to predict N plus one bit, and I will ask you to write every possible program that generates these N bits."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "So, um, and you can have, you, you choose programming language."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "It can be Python or C plus plus."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "And the difference between programming languages, uh, might be, there is a difference by constant asymptotically, your predictions will be equivalent."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "So you read N bits, you enumerate all the programs that produce these N bits in their output."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "And then in order to predict N plus one bit, you actually weight the programs according to their length."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And there is like a, some specific formula, how you weight them."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And then the N plus, uh, one bit prediction is the prediction, uh, from each of these program, according to that weight."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "Like statistically, you pick, so the smaller the program, the more likely you, you are to pick the, its output."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "So, uh, that's, that algorithm is grounded in the hope or the intuition that the simple answer is the right one."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "It's a formalization of it."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "Um, it also means like, if you would ask the question after how many years would, you know, sun explode, uh, you can say, hmm, it's more likely the answer is due to some power because they're shorter program."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "Um, then other, well, I don't have a good intuition about, uh, how different the space of short programs are from the space of large programs."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "Like, what is the universe where short programs, uh, like run things?"}, {"time": 1818, "text": "Uh, so, so I said, the things have to agree with N bits."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "So even if you have, you, you need to start, okay."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "If, if you have very short program and they're like a steel, some has, if, if it's not perfectly prediction of N bits, you have to start errors."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "What are the errors?"}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And that gives you the full program that agrees on N bits."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Oh, so you don't agree with the N bits."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And you store, that's like a longer, a longer program, slightly longer program because it can take these extra bits of errors."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "What's what's your intuition about the, the programs that are able to do cool stuff like intelligence and consciousness, are they, uh, perfectly like, is, is it, uh, is there if then statements in them?"}, {"time": 1865, "text": "So like, is there a lot of a good, uh, if then statements in them?"}, {"time": 1868, "text": "So like, is there a lot of exceptions that they're storing?"}, {"time": 1871, "text": "So, um, you could imagine if there would be tremendous amount of if statements, then they wouldn't be that short."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "In case of neural networks, you could imagine that, um, what happens is, uh, they, uh, when you start with an initialized neural network, uh, it stores internally many possibilities, how the, uh, how the problem can be solved."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "And SGD is kind of magnifying some, some, uh, some, uh, paths, which are slightly similar to the correct answer."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "So it's kind of magnifying correct programs."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "And in some sense, SGD is a search algorithm in the program space and the program space is represented by, uh, you know, kind of the wiring inside of the neural network and there's like an insane number of ways how the features can be computed."}, {"time": 1921, "text": "Let me ask you the high level, basic question that's not so basic."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "Is there a way you'd like to think of it that is different than like a generic textbook definition?"}, {"time": 1934, "text": "The thing that I hinted just a second ago is maybe that, uh, closest to how I'm thinking these days about deep learning."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "So, uh, now the statement is, uh, neural networks can represent some programs."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "Uh, it seems that various modules that we are actually adding up to, or like, uh, you know, we, we want networks to be deep because we, we want multiple steps of the computation and, uh, uh, and deep learning provides the way to represent space of programs, which is searchable and it's searchable with, uh, stochastic gradient descent."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "So we have an algorithm to search over humongous number of programs and gradient descent kind of bubbles up the things that are, uh, tend to give correct answers."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "So a neural network with a, with fixed weights that's optimized, do you think of that as a single program?"}, {"time": 1991, "text": "Um, so there is a, uh, work by Christopher Olaj where he, uh, so he works on interpretability of neural networks and he was able to, uh, to identify the neural network, for instance, a detector of a wheel for a car, or the detector of a mask for a car, and then he was able to separate them out and assemble them, uh, together using a simple program, uh, for the detector, for a car detector."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "That's like, uh, if you think of traditionally defined programs, that's like a function within a program that this particular neural network was able to find and you can tear that out, just like you can copy and paste it into a stack overflow that, so, uh, any program is a composition of smaller programs."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "I mean, the nice thing about the neural networks is that it allows the things to be more fuzzy than in case of programs."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Uh, in case of programs, you have this, like a branching this way or that way."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "And the neural networks, they, they have an easier way to, to be somewhere in between or to share things."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "Neurons and the learning happens, uh, by adjusting the weights on the edges that connect these neurons."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "Thank you for giving definition that I supposed to do it, but I guess you have enough empathy to listeners to actually know that the, that that might be useful."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "No, that's like, so I'm asking Plato of like, what is the meaning of life?"}, {"time": 2107, "text": "He's not going to answer."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "You're being philosophical and deep and quite profound talking about the space of programs, which is, which is very interesting, but also for people who just not familiar with the hell we're talking about when we talk about deep learning anyway, sorry, what is the most beautiful or surprising idea to you in, in, um, in all the time you've worked at deep learning and you worked on a lot of."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "Fascinating projects, applications of neural networks."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "It doesn't have to be big and profound."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "It can be a cool trick."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "I mean, I'm thinking about the trick, but like, uh, it's still, uh, I'm using to me that it works at all that let's say that the extremely simple algorithm stochastic gradient descent, which is something that I would be able to derive on the piece of paper to high school student, uh, when put at the, at the scale of, you know, thousands of machines actually, uh, can create the."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "Behaviors we, which we called kind of human like behaviors."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "So in general, any application is stochastic gradient descent to neural networks is, is amazing to you."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "So that, or is there a particular application in natural language reinforcement learning, uh, and also what do you attribute that success to?"}, {"time": 2189, "text": "Is it just scale?"}, {"time": 2191, "text": "What profound insight can we take from the fact that the thing works for gigantic, uh, sets of variables?"}, {"time": 2199, "text": "I mean, the interesting thing is this algorithms, they were invented decades ago and, uh, people actually, uh, gave up on the idea and, um, you know, back then they thought that we need profoundly different algorithms and they spent a lot of cycles on very different algorithms."}, {"time": 2249, "text": "In the past people are, it's almost like a, out of the, maybe an ego, people are saying that it cannot be the case that such a simple algorithm is there, you know, uh, could solve complicated problems."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "So they were in search for the other algorithms."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "And as I'm saying, like, I believe that actually we are in the game where there is, there are actually frankly three levers."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "There is compute, there are algorithms and there is data."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "And, uh, if we want to build intelligent systems, we have to pull, uh, all three levers and they are actually multiplicative."}, {"time": 2285, "text": "Um, it's also interesting."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "So you ask, is it only compute?"}, {"time": 2288, "text": "Uh, people internally, they did the studies to determine how much gains they were coming from different levers."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "And so far we have seen that more gains came from compute than algorithms, but also we are in the world that in case of compute, there is a kind of, you know, exponential increase in funding and at some point it's impossible to, uh, invest more, it's impossible to, you know, invest $10 trillion as we are speaking about the, let's say all taxes in us."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "Uh, but you're talking about money that could be innovation in the compute."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "That's that's true as well."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "Uh, so I mean, they're like a few pieces."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "Um, so it might be the case that our networks are still somewhat small."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "Uh, it also might be the case that they are more efficient than brain or less efficient by some, by some huge factor."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "Um, I also believe that there will be like a, you know, at the moment we are at the stage that the, these neural networks, they require thousand X or, or like a huge factor of more data than humans do."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "And it will be a matter of, uh, um, there will be algorithms that vastly decrease sample complexity, I believe so, but that place where we are heading today is there are domains which contains million X more data."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "And even though computers might be 1000 times slower than humans in learning, that's not a problem."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "Like, uh, for instance, uh, I believe that, uh, it should be possible to create super human therapist, uh, by, uh, and, and the, the, like, uh, even simple steps of, of, of doing what, of, of doing it."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "And, you know, the, the core reason is there is just machine will be able to read way more transcripts of therapies, and then it should be able to speak simultaneously with many more people and it should be possible to optimize it, uh, all in parallel."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "And, uh, well, there's now you're touching on something I deeply care about and think is way harder than we imagine."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "Um, what's the goal of a therapist?"}, {"time": 2443, "text": "What's the goal of therapies?"}, {"time": 2445, "text": "So, okay, so one goal now this is terrifying to me, but there's a lot of people that, uh, contemplate suicide, suffer from depression, uh, and they could significantly be helped with therapy and the idea that an AI algorithm might be in charge of that, it's like a life and death task."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "It's, uh, the stakes are high."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "So one goal for a therapist, whether human or AI is to prevent suicide ideation to prevent suicide."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "How do you achieve that?"}, {"time": 2485, "text": "So to be clear, I don't think that the current models are good enough for such a task because it requires insane amount of understanding, empathy, and the models are far from this place, but it's."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "But do you think that understanding empathy, that signal is in the data?"}, {"time": 2503, "text": "Um, I think there is some signal in the data."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "I mean, there are plenty of transcripts of conversations and it is possible to, it is possible from it to understand personalities."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "So there's another underlying question, which is self supervised versus supervised."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "So can you get that from the data by just reading a huge number of transcripts?"}, {"time": 2596, "text": "I actually, so I think that reading huge number of transcripts is a step one."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "It's like at the same way as you cannot learn to dance if just from YouTube by watching it, you have to actually try it out yourself."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And so I think that here that's a similar situation."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "I also wouldn't deploy the system in the high stakes situations right away, but kind of see gradually where it goes."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "And, uh, obviously initially, uh, it would have to go hand in hand with humans."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "But, uh, at the moment we are in the situation that actually there is many more people who actually would like to have a therapy or, or speak with, with someone than there are therapies out there."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "I can, you know, I was so, so fundamentally I was thinking, what are the things that, uh, can vastly increase people's well being therapy is one of them being meditation is other one, I guess maybe human connection is a third one, and I guess pharmacologically it's also possible, maybe direct brain stimulation or something like that."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "But these are pretty much options out there."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "Then let's say the way I'm thinking about the AGI endeavor is by default, that's an endeavor to, uh, increase amount of wealth."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "And I believe that we can invest the increase amount of wealth for everyone and simultaneously."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "So, I mean, there are like a two endeavors that make sense to me."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "One is like essentially increase amount of wealth."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "And second one is, uh, increase overall human wellbeing."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "And those are coupled together and they, they can, like, uh, I would say these are different topics."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "One can help another and, uh, you know, therapist is a, is a funny word because I see friendship and love as therapy."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "I mean, so therapist broadly defined as just friendship as a friend."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "So like therapist is, has a very kind of clinical sense to it, but what is human connection you're like, uh, not to get all Camus and Dostoevsky on you, but you know, life is suffering and we draw, we seek connection with the humans as we, uh, desperately try to make sense of this world in a deep overwhelming loneliness that we feel inside."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So I think connection has to do with understanding."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "And I think that almost like a lack of understanding causes suffering."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "If you speak with someone and do you, do you feel ignored that actually causes pain?"}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Yeah, very much agree."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "So I thought in the past about, um, somewhat similar question to yours, which is what is love, uh, rather what is connection."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "And, um, and obviously I think about these things from AI perspective."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "What would it mean?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "Um, so I said that, um, you know, intelligence has to do with some compression, which is more or less like I can say, almost understanding of what is going around."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "It seems to me that, uh, other aspect is there seem to be reward functions and you can have, uh, uh, you know, reward for, uh, food, for maybe human connection, for, uh, let's say warmth, uh, sex and so on."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "And, um, and it turns out that the various people might be optimizing slightly different, uh, reward functions."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "They essentially might care about different things."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "And, uh, uh, in case of, uh, love at least the love between two people, you can say that the, um, you know, boundary between people dissolves to such extent that, uh, they end up optimizing each other reward functions and yeah, oh, that's interesting."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "Um, celebrate the success of each other."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "In some sense, I would say love means, uh, helping others to optimize their, uh, reward functions, not your reward functions, not the things that you think are important, but the things that the person cares about, you try to help them to, uh, optimize it."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "So love is, uh, if you think of two reward functions, you just, it's a condition."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "You combine them together, pretty much maybe like with a weight and it depends like the dynamic of the relationship."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "So for instance, if you look at, at the donut on the one level, you might think, oh, this is like, it looks tasty."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "I would like to eat it on other level."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "You might tell yourself, I shouldn't be doing it because I want to gain muscles."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "So, and you know, you might do it regardless kind of against yourself."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "And like, I try to imagine, try to imagine if there would be like a small baby Lex, like a five years old, angry, and then they are like, you shouldn't be angry."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "Like stop being angry."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "But like an instant, actually you want the Lex to come over, give him a hug and just like, I say, it's fine."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "It's going to be angry as long as you want."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "And then he would stop or, or maybe not, or maybe not, but you cannot expect it even."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "But still, that doesn't explain the why of love."}, {"time": 2989, "text": "Like why is love part of the human condition?"}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Why is it useful to combine the reward functions?"}, {"time": 2996, "text": "It seems like that doesn't, I mean, I don't think reinforcement learning frameworks can give us answers to why even, even the Hutter framework has an objective function that's static."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "So we came to existence as a consequence of evolutionary process."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "And in some sense, the purpose of evolution is survival."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And then the, this complicated optimization objective baked into us, let's say compression, which might help us operate in the real world and it baked into us various reward functions."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "Then to be clear at the moment we are operating in the regime, which is somewhat out of distribution, where they even evolution optimized us."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "It's almost like love is a consequence of a cooperation that we've discovered is useful."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "In some way it's even the case."}, {"time": 3045, "text": "If you, I just love the idea that love is like the out of distribution."}, {"time":

humanity."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "But then you start to ask, well, where do you draw the line?"}, {"time": 3145, "text": "Because why not expand it to other conscious beings?"}, {"time": 3148, "text": "And then finally, for our discussion, something I think about is why not expand it to AI systems?"}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Like we, we start respecting each other when the, the person, the entity on the other side has the capacity to suffer."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "Cause then we develop a capacity to sort of empathize."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "And so I could see AI systems that are interacting with humans more and more having conscious, like displays."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "So like they display consciousness through language and through other means."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "And so then the question is like, well, is that consciousness?"}, {"time": 3186, "text": "Because they're acting conscious."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "And so, you know, the reason we don't like torturing animals is because they look like they're suffering when they're tortured and if AI looks like it's suffering when it's tortured, how is that not requiring of the same kind of empathy from us and respect and rights that animals do and other humans do?"}, {"time": 3215, "text": "I think it requires empathy as well."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "I mean, I would like, I guess us or humanity or so make a progress in understanding what consciousness is, because I don't want just to be speaking about that, the philosophy, but rather actually make a scientific, uh, to have a, like, you know, there was a time that people thought that there is a force of life and, uh, the things that have this force, they are alive."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "And, um, I think that there is actually a path to understand exactly what consciousness is and how it works."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "Understand exactly what consciousness is."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "And, uh, um, in some sense, it might require essentially putting probes inside of a human brain, uh, what Neuralink, uh, does."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "So the goal there, I mean, there's several things with consciousness that make it a real discipline, which is one is rigorous measurement of consciousness."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "And then the other is the engineering of consciousness, which may or may not be related."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "I mean, you could also run into trouble."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "Like, for example, in the United States for the department, DOT, department of transportation, and a lot of different

literally just plugging into the brain."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "Um, I mean, that, that seems like it's kind of easy, but the plugging into the brain and asking person if they feel that their

consciousness, uh, life AI, but, uh, in terms of the, it's interesting to me, cause you're a brilliant, uh, Thinker in the space of machine learning, like intuition, like digging deep in what works, what doesn't, why it works, why it doesn't, and so is Ilya."}, {"time": 4145, "text": "I'm wondering if there's interesting deep discussions you've had with him in the past or disagreements that were

might come, you know, from either meditation, psychedelics, or let's say I read just hundreds of books on this topic."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "So, and I also went through a journey of, you know, I developed a lot of, uh, algorithms, so I think that maybe I can, that's my super human skill."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "Uh, Ilya is, uh, one of the best AI scientists, but then I'm pretty good in

watch."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "It makes you realize like, um, yeah, the, the, the limits of the, that the human intellect may be limitless, or it's just impressive to see a descendant of ape come up with clever ideas."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "I mean, so even in the space of deep learning, when you look at various people, there are people now who invented some breakthroughs once, but there

one of these few people who, uh, uh, who have, uh, a lot of these inventions in his arsenal."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "It also feels that, um, you know, for instance, if you think about folks like Gauss or Euler, uh, you know, at first they read a lot of books and then they did thinking and then they figure out math and that's how it feels with Ilya, you know, at first he read stuff and then like he spent his thinking cycles."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "And that's a really good way to put it."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "When I talk to him, I, I see thinking."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "He's

he's what is it?"}, {"time": 4418, "text": "He said, what does it, his brain is like a vertical takeoff in terms of airplane analogy."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "So it's interesting, but it, I mean, Cal Newport talks about this as ideas of deep work."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "It's, you know, most of us don't work much at all in terms of like, like deeply think about particular problems, whether

4448, "text": "So I think that the big piece has to do with actually even engineering your environment that says that it's conducive to that."}, {"time": 4456, "text": "So, um, see both Ilya and I, uh, on the frequent basis, we kind of disconnect ourselves from the world in order to be able to do extensive amount of thinking."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "So Ilya usually, he just, uh, leaves iPad

way."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "You can format text in the way that you have sentence in English."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "You make it even look like some content of a website, uh, elsewhere, which

arbitrary personality to the model."}, {"time": 4649, "text": "You can say, here is a conversation that we've a friendly AI bot."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "And the model, uh, will complete the text as a friendly AI bot."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "So, I mean, how do I express how amazing this is?"}, {"time": 4663, "text": "So just to clarify, uh, a conversation, generating a conversation between me and Elon Musk, it wouldn't just generate good examples of what Elon would say."}, {"time": 4676, "text": "It would get the same results as the conversation between Elon Musk and me."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "Say it would get the syntax all correct."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "So like interview style, it would say like Elon call and Lex call, like it, it's not just like, uh, inklings of, um, semantic correctness."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "It's like the whole thing, grammatical, syntactic, semantic, it's just really, really impressive, uh, generalization."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "I mean, I also want to, you know, provide some caveats so it can generate few paragraphs of coherent text, but as you go to, uh, longer pieces, it, uh, it actually goes off the rails."}, {"time": 4721,

it goes off the rails?"}, {"time": 4730, "text": "Like what falls apart first?"}, {"time": 4734, "text": "So the model is trained on the, all the existing data, uh, that is out there, which means that it is not trained on its own mistakes."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "So for instance, if it would make a mistake, then, uh, I kept, so to give you, give you an example."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "So let's say I have a conversation with a model pretending that is Elon Musk."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "And then I start putting some, uh, I'm start actually making up things which are not factual."},

will just keep on carrying it on."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "And as if it's true."}, {"time": 4778, "text": "And in some sense, if you would have a normal conversation with Elon, he would be what the fuck."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "There'll be some feedback between, so the model is trained on things that humans have written, but through the generation process, there's no human in the loop

of all, humans have the same problem."}, {"time": 4806, "text": "It's just that we, uh, we'll make fewer errors and magnify the errors slower."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "I think that actually what happens with humans is if you have a wrong belief about the world as a kid, then very quickly we'll learn that it's not correct because they are grounded in reality and they are learning from your new experience."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "But do you think the model can correct itself too?"}, {"time": 4830, "text": "Won't it through the power of the representation."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "And so the absence of Elon Musk being your wife information on the internet, won't it correct itself?"}, {"time": 4843, "text": "There won't be examples like that."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "So the errors will be subtle at first."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "Subtle at first."}, {"time": 4849, "text": "And in some sense, you can also say that the data that is not out there is the data, which would

you think?"}, {"time": 4866, "text": "Like when you think about the nature of intelligence, it seems exceptionally impressive."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "But then if you think about the big AGI

like the spaceship to the moon is actually effective."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "So people who criticize GPT, they say, you guys just building a taller, a ladder, and it will never reach the moon."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "And at the moment, I would say the way I'm thinking is, is like a scientific question."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "And I'm also in heart, I'm a builder creator and like, I'm thinking, let's try out, let's see how far it goes."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "And so far we see constantly that there is a progress."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "So do you think GPT four, GPT five, GPT N plus one will, um, there'll be a phase shift, like a transition to a, to a place where we'll be truly surprised."}, {"time": 4976, "text": "Then again, like GPT three is already very like truly surprising."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "The people that criticize GPT three as a stair, as a, what is it?"}, {"time": 4984, "text": "Ladder to heaven."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "I think too quickly get accustomed to how impressive it is that they're impressive, it is that the prediction of the next word can achieve such depth of semantics, accuracy of syntax, grammar, and semantics."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "Um, do you, do you think GPT four and five and six will continue to surprise us?"}, {"time": 5008, "text": "I mean, definitely there will be more impressive models that there is a question of course, if there will be a phase shift and, uh, the, also even the way I'm thinking about the, about these models is that when we build these models, you know, we see some level of the capabilities, but we don't even fully understand everything that the model can do."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "And actually one of the best things to do is to allow other people to probe the model to even see what is possible."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "Hence the, the using GPT as an API and opening it up to the world."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "I mean, so when I'm thinking from perspective of like, uh, obviously various people are, that have concerns about AGI, including myself."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "Um, and then when I'm thinking from perspective, what's the strategy even to deploy these things to the world, then the one strategy that I have seen many times working is that iterative deployment that you deploy, um, slightly better versions and you allow other people to criticize you."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "So you actually, or try it out, you see where are their fundamental issues."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "And it's almost, you don't want to be in that situation that you are holding into powerful system and there's like a huge overhang, then you deploy it and it might have a random chaotic impact on the world."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "So you actually want to be in

nuclear weapons, having the same kind of bug."}, {"time": 5407, "text": "And so like the lowest level engineer and the CEO of a company all need to have the seriousness, uh, in approaching this problem and thinking about the worst case consequences."}, {"time": 5417, "text": "So I think that is true."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "I mean, the, what I also recognize in myself and others even asking this question is that it evokes a lot of fear and fear itself ends up being actually quite debilitating."}, {"time": 5431, "text": "The place where I arrived at the moment might sound cheesy or

system, uh, you know, that system train on all the language out there started having some rudimentary coding capabilities."}, {"time": 5525, "text": "So we're able to ask it, you know, to implement addition function between two numbers and indeed it can write item or JavaScript code for that."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "And then we thought, uh, we might as well just go full steam ahead and try to create a system that is actually good at what we are doing every day ourselves, which is programming."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "We optimize models for proficiency in coding."}, {"time": 5551, "text": "We actually even created models that both have a comprehension of language and code."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "And Codex is API for these models."}, {"time": 5562, "text": "So it's first pre trained on language and then codex."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "Then I don't know if you can say fine tuned because there's a lot of code, but it's language and code."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "It's language and code."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "It's also optimized for various things."}, {"time": 5580, "text": "I can, let's say low latency and so on."}, {"time": 5582, "text": "Codex is the API, the similar to GPT tree."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "We expect that there will be proliferation of the potential products that can use coding capabilities and I can, I can speak about it in a second."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "Copilot is a first product and developed by GitHub."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "So as we're building, uh, models, we wanted to make sure that these models are useful and we work together with GitHub on building the first product."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "Copilot is actually, as you code, it suggests you code completions."}, {"time": 5612, "text": "And we have seen in the past, there are like a various tools that can suggest how to like a few characters of the code or a line of code."}, {"time": 5621, "text": "Then the thing about Copilot is it can generate 10 lines of code."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "You, it's often the way how it works is you often write in the comment what you want to happen because people in comments, they describe what happens next."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "So, um, these days when I code, instead of going to Google to search, uh, for the appropriate code to solve my problem, I say, Oh, for this area, could you smooth it and then, you know, it imports some appropriate libraries and say it uses NumPy convolution or so I, that I was not even aware that exists and it does the appropriate thing."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "Um, so you, uh, you write a comment, maybe the header of a function and it completes the function."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "Of course, you don't know what is the space of all the possible small programs that can generate."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "What are the failure cases?"}, {"time": 5670, "text": "How many edge cases, how many subtle errors there are, how many big errors there are, it's hard to know, but the fact that it works at all in a large number of cases is incredible."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "It's like, uh, it's a kind of search engine into code that's been written on the internet."}, {"time": 5688, "text": "So for instance, when you search things online, then usually you get to the, some particular case, like if you go to stack overflow and people describe that one particular situation, uh, and then they seek for a solution."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "But in case of a copilot, it's aware of your entire context and in context is, Oh, these are the libraries that they are using."}, {"time": 5710, "text": "That's the set of the variables that is initialized."}, {"time": 5714, "text": "And on the spot, it can actually tell you what to do."}, {"time": 5717, "text": "So the interesting thing is, and we think that the copilot is one possible product using codecs, but there is a place for many more."}, {"time": 5725, "text": "So internally we tried out, you know, to create other fun products."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "So it turns out that a lot of tools out there, let's say Google calendar or Microsoft word or so, they all have a internal API to build plugins around them."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "So there is a way in the sophisticated way to control calendar or Microsoft word."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "Today, if you want, if you want more complicated behaviors from these programs, you have to add the new button for every behavior."}, {"time": 5755, "text": "But it is possible to use codecs and tell for instance, to calendar, uh, could you schedule an appointment with Lex next week after 2 PM and it writes corresponding piece of code."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "And that's the thing that actually you want."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "So you figure out is there's a lot of programs with which you can interact through code."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "And so there you can generate that code from natural language."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "And that's somewhat like also closest to what was the promise of Siri or Alexa."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "So previously all these behaviors, they were hard coded and it seems that codecs on the fly can pick up the API of let's say, given software."}, {"time": 5799, "text": "And then it can turn language into use of this API."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "So without hard coding, you can find, it can translate to machine language."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "To, uh, so for example, this would be really exciting for me, like for, um, Adobe products, like Photoshop, uh, which I think action scripted, I think there's a scripting language that communicates with them, same with Premier."}, {"time": 5820, "text": "And do you could imagine that that allows even to do coding by voice on your phone?"}, {"time": 5826, "text": "So for instance, in the past, okay."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "As of today, I'm not editing Word documents on my phone because it's just the keyboard is too small."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "But if I would be able to tell, uh, to my phone, you know, uh, make the header large, then move the paragraphs around and that's actually what I want."}, {"time": 5845, "text": "So I can tell you one more cool thing, or even how I'm thinking about codecs."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "So if you look actually at the evolution of, uh, of computers, we started with a very primitive interfaces, which is a punch card and punch card."}, {"time": 5860, "text": "So Charlie, you make a holes in the, in the plastic card to indicate zeros and ones."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "And, uh, during that time, there was a small number of specialists who were able to use computers."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And by the way, people even suspected that there is no need for many more people to use computers."}, {"time": 5876, "text": "Um, but then we moved from punch cards to at first assembly and see, and at these programming languages, they were slightly higher level."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "They allowed many more people to code and they also, uh, led to more of a proliferation of technology."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "And, uh, you know, further on, there was a jump to say from C++ to Java and Python."}, {"time": 5899, "text": "And every time it has happened, more people are able to code and we build more technology."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "And it's even, you know, hard to imagine now, if someone will tell you that you should write code in assembly instead of let's say, Python or Java or JavaScript."}, {"time": 5917, "text": "And codecs is yet another step toward kind of bringing computers closer to humans such that you communicate with a computer with your own language rather than with a specialized language, and, uh, I think that it will lead to an increase of number of people who can code."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "And then, and the kind of technologies that those people will create is it's innumerable, it could, you know, it could be a huge number of technologies."}, {"time": 5943, "text": "We're not predicting at all because that's less and less requirement of having a technical mind, a programming mind, you're not opening it to the world of, um, other kinds of minds, creative minds, artistic minds, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "I would like, for instance, biologists who work on DNA to be able to program and not to need to spend a lot of time learning it."}, {"time": 5966, "text": "And I, I believe that's a good thing to the world."}, {"time": 5969, "text": "And I would actually add, I would add, so at the moment I'm a managing codecs team and also language team, and I believe that there is like a plenty of brilliant people out there and they should have a lot of experience."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "There and they should apply."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "So what's the language and the codecs is, so those are kind of, they're overlapping teams."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "It's like GPT, the raw language, and then the codecs is like applied to programming."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "And they are quite intertwined."}, {"time": 6000, "text": "There are many more things involved making this, uh, models, uh, extremely efficient and deployable."}, {"time": 6006, "text": "For instance, there are people who are working to, you know, make our data centers, uh, amazing, or there are people who work on putting these models into production or, uh, or even pushing it at the very limit of the scale."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "So all aspects from, from the infrastructure to the actual machine."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "So I'm just saying there are multiple teams while the, and the team working on codecs and language, uh, I guess I'm, I'm directly managing them."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "I would like, I would love to hire more interested in machine learning."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "This is probably one of the most exciting problems and like systems to be working on is it's actually, it's, it's, it's pretty cool."}, {"time": 6045, "text": "Like what, what, uh, the program synthesis, like generating a programs is very interesting, very interesting problem that has echoes of reasoning and intelligence in it."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "It's and I think there's a lot of fundamental questions that you might be able to sneak, uh, sneak up to by generating programs."}, {"time": 6065, "text": "Yeah, that one more exciting thing about the programs is that, so I said that the, um, you know, the, in case of language, that one of the travels is even evaluating language."}, {"time": 6075, "text": "So when the things are made up, you, you need somehow either a human to, to say that this doesn't make sense or so in case of program, there is one extra lever that we can actually execute programs and see what they evaluate to."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "So that process might be somewhat, uh, more automated in, in order to improve the, uh, qualities of generations."}, {"time": 6099, "text": "So like the, wow, that's really interesting."}, {"time": 6102, "text": "So, so for the language, the, you know, the simulation to actually execute it as a human mind."}, {"time": 6108, "text": "For programs, there is a, there is a computer on which you can evaluate it."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "That's a brilliant little insight."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "Insight that the thing compiles and runs that's first and second, you can evaluate on a, like do automated unit testing and in some sense, it seems to me that we'll be able to make a tremendous progress."}, {"time": 6132,

controlling a nuclear power plant has to be very reliable."}, {"time": 6159, "text": "So I wouldn't start with controlling nuclear power plant maybe one day, but that's not actually, that's not on the current roadmap."}, {"time": 6166, "text": "That's not the step one."}, {"time": 6168, "text": "And you know, it's the Russian thing."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "You just want to go to the most powerful, destructive, most powerful the most powerful, destructive thing right away run by JavaScript."}, {"time": 6177, "text": "But I got you."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "So this is a lower impact, but nevertheless, when you make me realize it is possible to achieve some levels of reliability by doing testing."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "And you could, you could imagine that, you know, maybe there are ways for model to write event code for testing itself and so on, and there exists a ways to create the feedback loops that the model could keep on improving."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "By writing programs that generate tests for the instance, for instance."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "And that's how we get consciousness, because it's metacompression."}, {"time": 6210, "text": "That's what you're going to write."}, {"time": 6211, "text": "That's the comment."}, {"time": 6212, "text": "That's the prompt that generates consciousness."}, {"time": 6214, "text": "Compressor of compressors."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "You just write that."}, {"time": 6218, "text": "Do you think the code that generates consciousness will be simple?"}, {"time": 6224, "text": "I mean, ultimately, the core idea behind will be simple, but there will be also decent amount of engineering involved."}, {"time": 6233, "text": "Like in some sense, it seems that, you know, spreading these models on many machines, it's not that trivial."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "And we find all sorts of innovations that make our models more efficient."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "I believe that first models that I guess are conscious or like a truly intelligent, they will have all sorts of tricks, but then again, there's a Richard Sutton argument that maybe the tricks are temporary things that they might be temporary things and in some sense, it's also even important to, to know that even the cost of a trick."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "So sometimes people are eager to put the trick while forgetting that there is a cost of maintenance or like a long term cost, long term cost or maintenance, or maybe even flexibility of code to actually implement new ideas."}, {"time": 6288, "text": "So even if you have something that gives you 2x, but it requires, you know, 1000 lines of code, I'm not sure if it's actually worth it."}, {"time": 6296, "text": "So in some sense, you know, if it's five lines of code and 2x, I would take it."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "And we see many of this, but also, you know, that requires some level of, I guess, lack of attachment to code that we are willing to remove it."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "So you led the OpenAI robotics team."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "Can you give an overview of the cool things you were able to accomplish, what are you most proud of?"}, {"time": 6322, "text": "So when we started robotics, we knew that actually reinforcement learning works and it is possible to solve fairly complicated problems."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "Like for instance, AlphaGo is an evidence that it is possible to build superhuman Go players, DOTA2 is an evidence that it's possible to build superhuman agents playing DOTA, so I asked myself a question, you know, what about robots out there?"}, {"time": 6348, "text": "Could we train machines to solve arbitrary tasks in the physical world?"}, {"time": 6353, "text": "Our approach was, I guess, let's pick a complicated problem that if we would solve it, that means that we made some significant progress in the domain."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "And if can progress the domain, and then we went after the problem."}, {"time": 6368, "text": "So we noticed that actually the robots out there, they are kind of at the moment optimized per task, so you can have a robot that it's like, if you have a robot opening a bottle, it's very likely that the end factor is that bottle opener."}, {"time": 6384, "text": "And the, and in some sense, that's a hack to be able to solve a task, which makes any task easier and ask myself, so what would be a robot that can actually solve many tasks?"}, {"time": 6395, "text": "And we conclude that human hands have such a quality that indeed they are, you know, you have five kind of tiny arms attached individually."}, {"time": 6408, "text": "They can manipulate pretty broad spectrum of objects."}, {"time": 6411, "text": "So we went after a single hand, like trying to solve Rubik's cube single handed."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "We picked this task because we thought that there is no way to hard code it."}, {"time": 6421, "text": "And it's also, we picked the robot on which it would be hard to hard code it."}, {"time": 6425, "text": "And we went after the solution such that it could generalize to other problems."}, {"time": 6431, "text": "And just to clarify, it's one robotic hand solving the Rubik's cube."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "The hard part isn't the solution to the Rubik's cube is the manipulation of the, of like having it not fall out of the hand, having it use the, uh, five baby arms to, uh, what is it like rotate different parts of the Rubik's cube to achieve the solution."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "So what, uh, what was the hardest part about that?"}, {"time": 6458, "text": "What was the approach taken there?"}, {"time": 6460, "text": "What are you most proud of?"}, {"time": 6461, "text": "Obviously we have like a strong belief in reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "And, uh, you know, one path it is to do reinforcement learning, the real world other path is to, uh, uh, that simulation in some sense, the tricky part about the real world is at the moment, our models, they require a lot of data and there is essentially no data."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "And, uh, I did, we decided to go through the path of the simulation."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "And in simulation, you can have infinite amount of data."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "The tricky part is the fidelity of the simulation."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "And also can you in simulation represent everything that you represent otherwise in the real world."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "How do you generate the different simulations?"}, {"time": 6531, "text": "So, uh, you know, there's plenty of parameters out there."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "We just pick them randomly."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "And, uh, and in simulation model just goes for thousands of years and keeps on solving Rubik's cube in each of them."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "And the thing is that neural network that we used, it has a memory."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "And as it presses, for instance, the side of the, of the cube, it can sense, oh, that's actually, this side was, uh, difficult to press."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "There's probably somebody listening to this actually doing bench press."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "Um, so maybe, uh, put the bar down and pick up the water bottle and you'll know exactly what, uh, what Jack is talking about."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "So what, uh, what was the hardest part of getting the whole thing to work?"}, {"time": 6624, "text": "So the hardest part is at the moment when it comes to, uh, physical work, when it comes to robots, uh, they require maintenance, it's hard to replicate a million times it's, uh, it's also, it's hard to replay things exactly."}, {"time": 6641, "text": "I remember this situation that one guy at our company, he had like a model that performs way better than other models in solving Rubik's cube."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "And, uh, you know, we kind of didn't know what's going on, why it's that."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "And, uh, it turned out, uh, that, you know, he was running it from his laptop that had better CPU or better, maybe local GPU as well."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "And, uh, because of that, there was less of a latency and the model was the same."}, {"time": 6674, "text": "And that actually made solving Rubik's cube more reliable."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "So in some sense, there might be some subtle bugs like that when it comes to running things in the real world."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "Even hinting on that, you could imagine that the initial models you would like to have models, which are insanely huge neural networks, and you would like to give them even more time for thinking."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "And when you have these real time systems, uh, then you might be constrained actually by the amount of latency."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "And, uh, ultimately I would like to build a system that it is worth for you to wait five minutes because it gives you the answer that you're willing to wait for five minutes."}, {"time": 6716, "text": "So latency is a very unpleasant constraint under which to operate."}, {"time": 6720, "text": "And also there is actually one more thing, which is tricky about robots."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "Uh, there is actually, uh, no, uh, not much data."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "So the data that I'm speaking about would be a data of, uh, first person experience from the robot and like a gigabytes of data like that, if we would have gigabytes of data like that, of robots solving various problems, it would be very easy to make a progress on robotics."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "And you can see that in case of text or code, there is a lot of data, like a first person perspective, they don't writing code."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "So you would invest, that's just one way to do it, invest in human supervision, like direct human control of the robots as it's learning and over time, add more and more automation."}, {"time": 6796, "text": "So let's say that's how I would build a robotics company today."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "If I would be building a robotics company, which is, you know, spend 10 million dollars or so recording human trajectories, controlling a robot."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "After you find a thing that the robot should be doing, that there's a market fit for, like you can make a lot of money with that product."}, {"time": 6818, "text": "Uh, so I would record data and then I would essentially train supervised learning model on it."}, {"time": 6825, "text": "That might be the path today."}, {"time": 6827, "text": "I think that actually what is needed is to have a robot that can train powerful models over video."}, {"time": 6835, "text": "So, um, you have seen maybe a models that can generate images like Dali and people are looking into models, generating videos, they're like, uh, bodies, algorithmic questions, even how to do it."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "And it's unclear if there is enough compute for this purpose, but, uh, I, I suspect that the models that which would have a level of understanding of video, same as GPT has a level of understanding of text, could be used, uh, to train robots to solve tasks."}, {"time": 6866, "text": "They would have a lot of common sense."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "If one day, I'm pretty sure one day there will be a robotics company by robotics company, I mean, the primary source of income is, is from robots that is worth over $1 trillion."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "What do you think that company will do?"}, {"time": 6889, "text": "I think self driving cars."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "No, it's interesting."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "Cause my mind went to personal robotics, robots in the home."}, {"time": 6897, "text": "It seems like there's much more market opportunity there."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "I think it's very difficult to achieve."}, {"time": 6904, "text": "I mean, this, this, this might speak to something important, which is I understand self driving much better than understand robotics in the home."}, {"time": 6912, "text": "So I understand how difficult it is to actually solve self driving to a, to a level, not just the actual computer vision and the control problem and just the basic problem of self driving, but creating a product that would undeniably be, um, that will cost less money."}, {"time": 6931, "text": "Like it will save you a lot of money, like orders of magnitude, less money that could replace Uber drivers, for example."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "So car sharing that's autonomous, that creates a similar or better experience in terms of how quickly you get from A to B or just whatever, the pleasantness of the experience, the efficiency of the experience, the value of the experience, and at the same time, the car itself costs cheaper."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "I think that's very difficult to achieve."}, {"time": 6957, "text": "I think there's a lot more, um, low hanging fruit in the home."}, {"time": 6963, "text": "That, that, that could be, I also want to give you a perspective on like how challenging it would be at home or like it maybe kind of depends on that exact problem that you'd be solving."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "Like if we're speaking about these robotic arms and hands, these things, they cost tens of thousands of dollars or maybe a hundred K and, um, you know, maybe, obviously, maybe there would be economy of scale."}, {"time": 6990, "text": "These things would be cheaper, but actually for any household to buy it, the price would have to go down to maybe a thousand bucks."}, {"time": 6998, "text": "I personally think that, uh, so self driving car, it provides a clear service."}, {"time": 7004, "text": "I don't think robots in the home, there'll be a trillion dollar company will just be all about service, meaning it will not necessarily be about like a robotic arm that's helps you."}, {"time": 7016,

7025, "text": "You mentioned, I think that's, um, of course there's a line between what is a robot and what is not like, does it really need a body?"}, {"time": 7034, "text": "But you know, some, um, uh, AI system with some embodiment, I think."}, {"time": 7040, "text": "So the tricky part when you think actually what's the difficult part is, um, when the robot has like, when there is a diversity of the environment with which the robot has to interact, that becomes hard."}, {"time": 7051, "text": "So, you know, on the one spectrum, you have, uh, industrial robots as they are doing over and over the same thing, it is possible to some extent to prescribe the movements and we've very small amount of intelligence, the, the movement can be repeated millions of times."}, {"time": 7068, "text": "Um, the, it, there are also, you know, various pieces of industrial robots where it becomes harder and harder."}, {"time": 7074, "text": "I can, for instance, in case of Tesla, it might be a matter of putting a, a rack inside of a car and, you know, because the rack kind of moves around, it's, uh, it's not that easy."}, {"time": 7085, "text": "It's not exactly the same every time."},

{"time": 7096, "text": "Um, then in case of self driving itself, uh, that difficulty has to do with the diversity of the environment, but still the car itself, um, the problem that they are solving is you try to avoid even interacting with things."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "You are not touching anything around because touching itself is hard."}, {"time": 7116, "text": "And then if you would have in the home, uh, robot that, you know, has to touch things and like if these things, they change the shape, if there is a huge variety of things to be touched, then that's difficult."}, {"time": 7126, "text": "If you are speaking about the robot, which there is, you know, head that is smiling in some way with cameras that either doesn't, you know, touch things."}, {"time": 7134, "text": "That's relatively simple."}, {"time": 7135, "text": "So to both agree and to push back."}, {"time": 7140, "text": "So you're referring to touch, like soft robotics, like the actual touch, but."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "I would argue that you could formulate just basic interaction between, um, like non contact interaction is also a kind of touch and that might be very difficult to solve that's the basic, this not disagreement, but that's the basic open question to me with self driving cars and this agreement with Elon, which is how much interaction is required to solve self driving cars."},

that's compelling to use, you're going to have to, uh, interact with pedestrians, not just avoid pedestrians, but interact with them when we drive around."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "In major cities, we're constantly threatening everybody's life with our movements, um, and that's how they respect us."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "There's a game to ready going out with pedestrians and I'm afraid you can't just formulate autonomous driving as a collision avoidance problem."}, {"time": 7208, "text": "So I think it goes beyond like a collision avoidance is the first order approximation."}, {"time": 7214, "text": "Uh, but then at least in case of Tesla, you can't just at least in case of Tesla, they are gathering data from people driving their cars and I believe that's an example of supervised data that they can train their models, uh, on, and they are doing it, uh, which, you know, can give a model dislike, uh, another level of, uh, of, uh, behavior that is needed to actually interact with the real world."}, {"time": 7241, "text": "It's interesting how much data is required to achieve that."}, {"time": 7245, "text": "Um, w what do you think of the whole Tesla autopilot approach, the computer vision based approach with multiple cameras and there's a data engine."}, {"time": 7253, "text": "It's a multitask, multiheaded neural network, and it's this fascinating process of, uh, similar to what you're talking about with the robotics approach, uh, which is, you know, you deploy in your own network and then there's humans that use it and then it runs into trouble in a bunch of places and that stuff is sent back."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "So like the deployment discovers a bunch of edge cases and those edge cases are sent back for supervised annotation, thereby improving the neural network and that's deployed again."}, {"time": 7284, "text": "It goes over and over until the network becomes really good at the task of driving becomes safer and safer."}, {"time": 7291, "text": "What do you think of that kind of approach to robotics?"}, {"time": 7294, "text": "I believe that's the way to go."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "So in some sense, even when I was speaking about, you know, collecting trajectories from humans, that's like a first step and then you deploy the system and then you have humans revising the, all the issues."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "And in some sense, like at this approach converges to system that doesn't make mistakes because for the cases where there are mistakes, you got their data, how to fix them and the system will keep on improving."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "So there's a very, to me, difficult question of how hard that, you know, how long that converging takes, how hard it is."}, {"time": 7324, "text": "The other aspect of autonomous vehicles, this probably applies to certain robotics applications is society, right?"}, {"time": 7332, "text": "They put as, as the quality of the system converges."}, {"time": 7338, "text": "So one, there's a human factors perspective of psychology of humans being able to supervise those even with teleoperation, those robots."}, {"time": 7345, "text": "And the other is society willing to accept robots."}, {"time": 7349, "text": "Currently society is much harsher on self driving cars than it is on human driven cars in terms of the expectation of safety."}, {"time": 7355, "text": "So the bar is set much higher than for humans."}, {"time": 7359, "text": "And so if there's a death in an autonomous vehicle, that's seen as a much more, much more dramatic than a death in the human driven vehicle."}, {"time": 7370, "text": "Part of the success of deployment of robots is figuring out how to make robots part of society, both on the, just the human side, on the media side, on the media journalist side, and also on the policy government side."}, {"time": 7384, "text": "And that seems to be, maybe you can put that into the objective function to optimize, but that is, that is definitely a tricky one."}, {"time": 7394, "text": "And I wonder if that is actually the trickiest part for self driving cars or any system that's safety critical."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "It's not the algorithm, it's the society accepting it."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "Yeah, I would say, I believe that the part of the process of deployment is actually showing people that the given things can be trusted and, you know, trust is also like a glass that is actually really easy to crack it and damage it."}, {"time": 7423, "text": "And I think that's actually very common with, with innovation, that there's some resistance toward it and it's just the natural progression."}, {"time": 7436, "text": "So in some sense, people will have to keep on proving that indeed these systems are worth being used."}, {"time": 7442, "text": "And I would say, I also found out that often the best way to convince people is by letting them experience it."}, {"time": 7452, "text":

fall in love."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "It's actually even similar when I'm thinking about the car."}, {"time": 7486, "text": "It's actually even similar when I'm thinking about Copilot, the GitHub Copilot."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "There was a spectrum of responses that people had."}, {"time": 7494, "text": "And ultimately the important piece was to let people try it out."}, {"time": 7500,

fear."}, {"time": 7508, "text": "But then you try it out and you think, actually, that's cool."}, {"time": 7511, "text": "And, you know, you can try to resist the same way as, you know, you could resist moving from punch cards to, let's say, C++ or so."}, {"time": 7520, "text": "And it's a little bit futile."}, {"time": 7523, "text": "So we talked about generation of program, generation of

what happens."}, {"time": 7602, "text": "And I mean, in some sense, that's actually what happens over the years in AI that like, we get used to things very quickly."}, {"time": 7610, "text": "You know something, I talked to Rodney Brooks."}, {"time": 7614, "text": "He called AlphaZero homework problem."}, {"time": 7617, "text": "Cause he was saying like, there's nothing special about it."},

one is a tree."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "It's got to be connected."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "That's what I mean by a component."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "So if I have 10 things connected, I have to have nine edges."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "Can you clarify why when complexity can go above zero, I'm a little confused why."}, {"time": 6268, "text": "So the complexity plus one is the number of loops."}, {"time": 6268, "text": "So if complexity is zero, I have one loop."}, {"time": 6274, "text": "If complexity is one, that means I have one more edge than I have vertices."}, {"time": 6274,

it."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "Well, but why can't it be trees just going off of the loop?"}, {"time": 6302, "text": "I would need more edges then."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "So every time I get another loop, I get another excess of edges over vertices."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "So in other words, we start out and after I have one loop, I have one component that has a cycle in it."},

from cycle to bicycle."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "But in fact, there's a certain probability it goes from cycle to two different cycles."}, {"time": 6348, "text": "And I worked out the probability was

almost."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "But then it splits again after you have either two or one, one."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "The next step is you either have three or you have two, one or you have one, one, one."}, {"time": 6371, "text": "And so I worked out the probability for those transitions."}, {"time": 6377, "text": "And I worked it out up to the first five transitions."}, {"time": 6377,

out."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "But I had a formula that I could calculate the probability."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "And I could find the limiting probability as n goes to infinity."}, {"time":

23023 is 7 times 11 times 13 times 23."}, {"time": 6437, "text": "That's not a random number."}, {"time": 6437, "text": "There has to be a reason why those small primes appear in the denominator."},

the logarithm of this formula."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "And sure enough, it's going to simplify."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "And it happened."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "So I and I wouldn't have

was like, I can't do that."}, {"time": 892, "text": "And he was like, what do you mean you can't do that?"}, {"time": 894, "text": "And I go, I physically, I can't do that."}, {"time": 898, "text": "And he was like, are you serious?"}, {"time": 900, "text": "And I go, yeah."}, {"time": 901, "text": "So he's, he didn't believe me."}, {"time": 902, "text": "We put 225 on the bar and I bottomed out."}, {"time": 905, "text": "And then he was like, okay, let's go down to 185."}, {"time": 908, "text": "I just, that's not happening."}, {"time": 910, "text": "You probably could, strength wise, you just refuse."}, {"time": 912, "text": "I just mentally, I cannot wrap my head around like, this ain't happening."}, {"time": 916, "text": "I'm not doing it."}, {"time": 917, "text": "So I ended up with like 95 pounds on the bar."}, {"time": 921, "text": "I got you at a front squat, no problem."}, {"time": 923, "text": "By the way, body weight squats are rough too, psychologically."}, {"time": 927, "text": "So yeah, I just, when it comes to my legs, like I want no part of like leg pressing, single leg squats, split squat, any of that, I want no part of it."}, {"time": 936, "text": "So you think like the more traditional variants of Sanagi require you to have that leg strength, that mass."}, {"time": 943, "text": "Like when you watch Japanese Judo players, like their thighs and their hips, they're thick."}, {"time": 948, "text": "They got a lot of power there."}, {"time": 950, "text": "So you're almost like always dropping a little bit into a squat position."}, {"time": 954, "text": "For mine, never."}, {"time": 955, "text": "No, no, no, not you, sorry."}, {"time": 956, "text": "For the traditional ones."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And so the split hip, the split hip actually allows me to keep my legs straight."}, {"time": 963, "text": "And the farther I split my legs, the lower my center of gravity goes."}, {"time": 967, "text": "Now I don't need my legs."}, {"time": 972, "text": "So that's the way you were thinking about it."}, {"time": 974, "text": "But it's, you know, the interesting thing about it is because, you know, as I mentioned to you, I've gotten to Judo after first watching you in the Olympics and then watching Koga as well."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And so you start imitating the people you foresee and then you take it to Judo coaches and they're like, no, no, no, no, that's the wrong way to do it."}, {"time": 994, "text": "And happens all the time."}, {"time": 996, "text": "It drives me nuts, drives me nuts."}, {"time": 998, "text": "I was in Poland one time teaching a camp and I had two coaches anti coaching, telling their kids not to do Seio the way I do it because it never works."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "How do you have the fortitude and the guts to just go on with a throw that's not traditional, a variant that's not traditional?"}, {"time": 1021, "text": "If you think about it, you know, from a very basic like root of it, there's a philosophy and a mentality of Judo of how the throws work, right?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "There's a mechanical structure there of like, this makes sense."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "If I follow that principle, I can do anything I want."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "As long as we follow those core principles."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "So in the early days, even then, you were able to think on your own."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "Yeah, and I was able to develop a pattern for my foot placement based on my opponent's height."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Because the number one thing any Judo coach would tell you is you need your center of gravity below yours."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Well, now I know exactly where to put my feet because the shorter you are, the bigger the split because the lower I need to get."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "The taller you are, the less of a split I need."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Is there something you could say about fundamental principles of Judo?"}, {"time": 1077, "text": "Is there, over all that time, not over 20 years that you've been doing Judo, it's not approaching 30, is it?"}, {"time": 1086, "text": "Yeah, it's getting there."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "Okay, it's getting there."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "We're a couple years away, but it's getting there."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "Is there some like principles that have emerged?"}, {"time": 1097, "text": "Like you said, you have to have your center of gravity below theirs."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Is there other kind of, both on the gripping side, the footwork side, leverage, anything you can speak to?"}, {"time": 1108, "text": "There's some that have withstood like time, like you have to be able to get below their center of gravity because you have to be able to rotate them around their center of gravity."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And then the other one is, that was always a principle when I was growing up and I didn't change until later on in my career was, you have to be able to pull."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "You need to be able to pull to get them off balance."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "But when you think about that statement as a whole, it ended with, they have to be off balance."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "I don't need to pull to get you off balance."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "I just need you off balance."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "And when you think about it that way, it allows you to open up the doors to, what do I need to do to get you off balance?"}, {"time": 1151, "text": "I could push, pull, I could flinch, I could fake, and you could put yourself in your own off balance state."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "When you think about people who wrestle, if I fake shoot, it causes you to over lean forward, which means you're off balance."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "There's no pull, there's no push, there's no nothing."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "I just get a reaction that leaves the opportunity in the door open for an attack."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And that off balance could be very subtle?"}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Could be very subtle."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "And the better you get and the more skills you get, the less subtle it is."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "So we should also mention that there is something called forward throws, where you throw the person, they're gonna fly facing forward, they're gonna fly forward."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "And then a backward throw, they're gonna fly back."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "Yep, and then there's lateral, they actually go sideways over, like a cartwheel almost."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "Okay, so the forward throws, there's the one we've been talking about, which is Seinagi, and there's a bunch of different variants, Ippon, Marote, Seinagi."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "There's drop and there's standing versions of them."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And that all, I don't know if there's a way to summarize it, but that's like as clean as getting your center of gravity under theirs as it gets."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "And then the rest is just gripping variations."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "I guess it's all gripping variations on all of these throws, but."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "And then there is, in terms of forward throws, there's the other big one in competition is Uchimata, which is, I don't know, we can try to explain that one."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "But it ends up being where one, you're standing on just one of your feet, and the other one is up in the air."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "And I don't know if you would put in that same category, Harai Goshi, like those kinds of throws where you're kind of a little bit single footed."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "Yeah, so there's two footed techniques and then there's single footed, yeah."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "Oh, Goshi, where it's like you're doing a mix between the Uchimata and the Seinagi."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "It's a hug."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "You hug a person and then you turn your hips around such that you're now hugging facing the same direction."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "When it comes to forward throw, there's, regardless of the name of the throw or the gripping variation that you're using, the whole principle is how do I get this person to do a forward roll in midair and land on their back?"}, {"time": 1300, "text": "The more of a forward roll I can get, the bigger the score."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "If I get like a quarter of a turn where like you land on your side and you don't go over your back, it's a half score."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "But they all require me to get you to do that forward rolling action."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "So just if we think of one person, if they do this nice leap forward and they do a roll and their back nicely rolls over the ground, you're trying to do the exact same thing with you connected to them."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Well, and if it's nice and it's smooth, it's probably not a full score."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "It needs to have like somewhat of a violent impact."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "So if you think of a drop, say Nagi, if I'm moving too slow and you still roll over your shoulders and there's no direct impact, it's only a half score."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "They want the force."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "The force, the violence."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "So then in terms of backward throws, the traditional ones, there's stuff where you trip them from outside their body, like Osoto gari."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "It's a trip where you hook your leg onto their leg and you trip them, but your hook goes outside of their legs."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "And then there's the trips from inside their body."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "There's a one foot is called kuchi gari and then the other is ochi gari, it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "The most important thing is outside and inside."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "Inside and then there's like, I don't even know how you throw them sideways except foot sweeps."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And then there's the foot sweeps where you can sweep one of their legs from out of them or both their legs at the same time."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "And like we're talking about this kind of is when timed perfectly, it's effortless for everybody involved and the ending, like you said, is big, dramatic and violent."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "Is there other kind of, oh yeah."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "There's a sacrifice techniques."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "There's a bunch of them."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "And that ultimately the variations have to do with gripping, but you're basically you, the attacker fall onto your back, sticking your legs somewhere onto their body, which is like this fulcrum over which they fly and do that same kind of roll that you mentioned."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "You basically sacrifice your back to the mat in order to throw them into that circular pattern."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "So they hit their back."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "Sometimes we use a foot, sometimes we don't."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And so we should probably say, it's okay for you to go onto your back as long as you're clearly demonstrating control over the other person's body."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "You can't go to your back in the same direction that your opponent is trying to put you to your back."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "You have to go the other way or you have to initiate you going to your own back."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "Like clearly."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "And then there's all the counters which almost kind of have a whole group of their own, even though they have echoes of the same types of techniques, it seems like they're their own whole thing."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "Yeah, but they follow the same principles."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "It's just most counters."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "Like if you wanted to counter Ennuchi Mata, for example, you're trying to throw me in a somersault over my right shoulder."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "Therefore, I would counter you by throwing you over your left shoulder."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "It goes in the opposite shoulder direction, but in the same somersault idea."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "And there used to be, I already at this point, forget the years, but it might be before the 2012 Olympics where they banned, you used to be allowed to grab legs in the same way you do in wrestling."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So you have basically all the techniques you would have in wrestling available to you if you would like."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "It's just that some of the techniques in wrestling are not that effective for getting your opponent to their back."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "Wrestlers wanna take the other person down in any way possible and have control."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "Judo wants to take you down, like we said, in a big fashion where your back slams on the ground."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Yeah, it has to be to the back."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "A lot of wrestling takedowns happen because they get behind them and then they parterre out."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "Yeah, so, but Judo banned all touching of the legs, which is a very dramatic change at the sport."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "But after 2012."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "After, it was after 2012?"}, {"time": 1560, "text": "In 2012, so 2008, I fought the games and everything was free."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "In 2012, we could only touch the legs as a defensive action or in response to an attack."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "So I could try to throw you with a normal throw and then when you try to counter, I could grab your leg."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "So there had to be a secondary technique."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "And didn't, like, didn't they disqualify on a first offense?"}, {"time": 1589, "text": "First offense was a direct disqualification, which happened at the 2012 games to the 57 Brazilian who won in 16."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "She was DQed and I think the quarters."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And it was like, I wouldn't say it was blatant as much as I don't think the act changed the outcome of the match had they not disqualified her."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "So that's not that dramatic."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "And by the way, you say 57, that refers to weight divisions and that's in kilograms and kilograms is the measure of weight that the rest of the world uses and the United States does not."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "So, and there's, we should say the divisions for guys, I don't know what the 70, I don't know if the lower level, 60."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "60, 66, 73, 81, 90, 100 and heavyweight, which has no ceiling."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "No ceiling, as we'll talk about."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "It's an important distinction."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "Yeah, it is an important distinction."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "And you competed most of your career at 81 kilograms."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "All, you never did 73."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "I never did 73."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "Well, you had to cut big for 81 anyway, especially towards the end of my career, yeah."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "I overly grew into the division."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "What's, I'm trying to remember, is it about 180 pounds?"}, {"time": 1667, "text": "178.6, I think."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "And you have to weigh in with the gear."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "You're not allowed to wear anything except for your underwear, weigh in."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "Confusing digits, that's right, that's right, that's right."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "That's which is very nice."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "Okay, so we, would you say we covered most of the throws or no?"}, {"time": 1687, "text": "So there's the forward and the backward, there's the sacrifice throws and the counters."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And then there's the leg grabs."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "And we should say for the leg grabs that were effective, it's like the big pickups where you just kind of pick them up and try to figure out once they're in the air what the heck to do with their body to get them to the ground."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "You just kind of figure it out as you go."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "I think the really nice one that was to me heartbreaking as a fantasy go is I guess what's called a fireman's carry, which is, it does lead to judo like beautiful throws."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "And the fact that that was gone is, that one I missed a little bit, but then a bunch of people I guess came up with the variance where you don't need to grab the leg."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "It's definitely not as effective as being able to grab it, but I'm also on the side of the fence having competed in all three."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "It was definitely better for the sport to remove it as a whole."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "It's probably good to cover sort of the whole spectrum of rules of judo is there's groundwork."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "So you do all this stuff on the feet where you're trying to murder each other with a giant throw."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "But then if the throw doesn't succeed, you go to the ground and you stay in the ground for some amount of time, like short amount of time."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "You have to move quickly, you have to be attacking."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "And two of the ways you can win is similar to people who do jiu jitsu is you can submit them, chokes, arm breaks, all that kind of stuff, no footlocks."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "And you can also pin them, which is get around their legs."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "And this is very, no, this is not like wrestling."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "You have to actually get around their legs and pin them in what in jiu jitsu is called side control mount, all kinds of ways that doesn't involve their legs."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "And then you pin them for like whatever, 20 seconds, 25 seconds."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "Yeah, 20 seconds now."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "I think the distinction is their back has to be facing the mat."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "You have to be past their legs and your chest has to be on the same plane as theirs."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "So it doesn't have to necessarily be on top, but it has to be on the same plane."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "And all of this is, I think different sports have different versions of this, but it's like an approximation of what dominance looks like."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "So pin and wrestling is dominating your opponent."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "Presumably if you were in a street fight, that position allows you to then do a lot of damage."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "Obviously submissions is dominance cause you're breaking their arm or choking them to unconscious."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And then obviously the throw, which is not often talked about, but like if you talk about a street fight situation, a throw is like the best way to murder somebody."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "Like this could end anyone's life."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "It's terrifying actually."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "So, okay, so these are all elements of dominance."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "So going back to set of principles, you were mentioning getting your center of mass under theirs, which I think applies for type of like the forward say Nagi throws, is there other stuff?"}, {"time": 1874, "text": "Oh, so you mentioned off balance."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "Yeah, there's the off balance one where you can either pull to get an off balance or you can give way to the force, which can also lead to an off balance."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "You can amplify somebody's force to, so for example, if you push me, you expect a certain reaction that you're ready for."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "But if you push me and I pull you, now you didn't expect that much force coming out of you."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "Therefore you're off balance."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "The thing that's distinctly recognizable about Judo is like when done at the highest level, like it seems effortless when the big throw happens."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "Like that's just, it doesn't, there is no other sport like it in the combat sports where it's like when the timing is right, everything just is perfect."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "I think you get that out of my mate and boxing sometimes when this is a perfect strike, just like, but it's not just like a hard hit."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "It's like, it's almost like with Conor McGregor and Aldo, for example, when you just catch him just right."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "Just right."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "You didn't look like you hit him that hard, but you hit him just right."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "And then you get to see this all the time in Judo."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "And so the beginning part of that is because there's a jacket, there's also this whole thing that you're a master of, which is like, which is gripping."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "So is there something you could say about, are there some fundamental principles of gripping that you can speak to?"}, {"time": 1970, "text": "Like what the hell is gripping?"}, {"time": 1972, "text": "Gripping is having the ability to hold your opponent in such a way where you have the ability to be offensive and also the ability to be defensive at the same given time."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And it's a distinction because I can hold you in such a way where I might be able to feel offensive, but if you can take a purely defensive grip and then I can't be offensive, we are no longer gripping."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "We are holding each other."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "And so like that would be the act of being able to grip is to be in a situation where you have me and I have you, and I can play both offense and defense at the same time where you can only play defense."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So Donaher talks about like Jiu Jitsu that way, and not that way, but maybe you can see if there's a distinction."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "So you have a set of weapons."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "The other person has a set of weapons."}, {"time": 2027, "text": "You wanna sort of maximize the use of your weapons and shut down the set of weapons that they have."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "Do you see gripping the same way on the feet?"}, {"time": 2037, "text": "I do if we wanna include body positioning with our gripping."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "Because I can give you any grip you want and you still can't throw me."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "Because I can put myself in a position that nullifies your ability to use those grips in a successful way."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And those, would you say the hips are critical to that or is it everything?"}, {"time": 2057, "text": "Hips, shoulders, chin position, head position, the angle of your foot."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "Yeah, where you lean."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "And so, and there's a bunch of places you can grip."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "Obviously, if people like kind of think of a jacket, like there's a bunch of places you can grip that are interesting."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So you can grip on the collar, you can grip on the sleeves, you can grip like the elbow joint."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "And then you could do those bad ass, like Eastern European, Georgian, over the back."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "Over the back, over the opposite sides of the heads."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "The Koreans that grab on one side around the head with their hands together."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "There's something really nice about just those, I mean, especially George just keeps throwing that hand."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "Just over the person and just, you're not actually gripping a belt or anything."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "You're gripping just the entirety of like, as opposed to being all nice and I'm gonna grab this part of the jacket, this part of the jacket."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "You're just like taking the whole fucking jacket and just launching somebody."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "For those people that can't picture judo, think about it in like, if you understood like what a boxing match looks like, and you thought about that as like traditional gripping, when you throw like a Russian grip over the back, that's more like a hockey fight."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "Like I'm just grabbing you and we're just gonna, we're gonna be throwing punches left and right."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "Cause when we have that grip, somebody has to get thrown."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "There's no, we don't

being very clever and strategic and all that, maybe using conditioning."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "And then there's people who just like step in the pocket and they almost don't care if they're getting thrown cause they have the confidence that they're gonna throw first."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And those, like there's a clear distinction between the people that do one or the other."},

it up."}, {"time": 5826, "text": "And then he, I mean, doesn't he know what's coming here?"}, {"time": 5830, "text": "Oh no, he might not."}, {"time": 5832, "text": "Oh no, he knew, he was a former teammate."}, {"time": 5834, "text": "He knew exactly what I was trying to do."}, {"time": 5836, "text": "And that was a really big step with your right foot."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "It covers about four feet in distance."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "And your left catches up in like perfect position."}, {"time": 5852, "text": "Yeah, you back it up a little bit."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "Keep going, keep going."}, {"time": 5859, "text": "Right there, this is like an important distinction between mine and everybody else's is because I split his hip, I actually, once I'm able to split, I no longer need his center of gravity below mine."}, {"time": 5875, "text": "Right, and when you say split, you mean you put your foot in between."}, {"time": 5879, "text": "I do that split, that four foot split."}, {"time": 5882, "text": "And then when I get my feet back together, it doesn't matter that I'm under his center of gravity or not."}, {"time": 5889, "text": "That's why my chest is right around his sternum height for me."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "Yeah, so there, I mean, how does he get, for people just listening to this, Travis Steps does a big, huge step, gets."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "Like my hip is probably right around his nipple because he's sprawled back so much."}, {"time": 5910, "text": "So like, so you're, how does the physics of this work?"}, {"time": 5913, "text": "You're violating the principle of your center of mass being under, oh, I guess somehow it is."}, {"time": 5918, "text": "I don't know, but he has nowhere to go."}, {"time": 5920, "text": "He's screwed."}, {"time": 5921, "text": "Yes, that's the kicker is the way mine works is in order for him to play an effective defense, he needs to have his feet firmly planted on the ground with friction."}, {"time": 5936, "text": "Otherwise he can't press into me to stop it."}, {"time": 5939, "text": "So when I get him to sprawl back, when I split his legs, he effectively loses that contact with the floor."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "Even though his feet are on the floor, they're not in a position where he can drive from them."}, {"time": 5951, "text": "So therefore when I flip, he flips."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "So there's a natural like flailing here."}, {"time": 5957, "text": "So he's not falling forward."}, {"time": 5960, "text": "You're falling forward."}, {"time": 5962, "text": "He's just attached to you."}, {"time": 5963, "text": "So like you can keep him up there and then like legs would be just flailing."}, {"time": 5967, "text": "Yep, one of my golden rules when I'm training and I get really tired, one of the like mantras I would always tell myself is I'm gonna put my back on your chest and then I'm gonna put my back on the floor."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "It's gonna be underneath me."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "That's a good principle to."}, {"time": 5982, "text": "It's very simple."}, {"time": 5983, "text": "And it, regardless of like all the chaos and how quickly things are happening, it's something I can just dumb everything down to and focus on."}, {"time": 5991, "text": "Regardless of the gripping situation, the footwork, all of that, get my back to your chest and then put my back on the floor."}, {"time": 5998, "text": "So this step of getting your back to their chest, like for people who are sort of more, like for example, for people like me, who are just like amateur Judo people, like there's all kinds of ways to prevent this turn from happening, the gripping and just everything."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "How difficult is it at the highest level to get into this position?"}, {"time": 6021, "text": "I mean, you make it look effortless often, but like to get to the position where you're from facing them to your back is to them."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "Is that like strategy?"}, {"time": 6030, "text": "Is that timing?"}, {"time": 6034, "text": "It's timing."}, {"time": 6035, "text": "It's like anything, like if I wanted to punch you in the face, like how hard is it to really do that if you know you can just play defense and block it?"}, {"time": 6044, "text": "The trick is to get them to play defense to something that never happened."}, {"time": 6050, "text": "And then you go through like another way."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "And then you just go through what would technically be your first plan if you planned on them playing defense."}, {"time": 6058, "text": "So I set the stage from the very beginning for this to work."}, {"time": 6063, "text": "So then this, you're celebrating here, it's a huge sort of, once a big accomplishments, big relief to qualify for the Olympics."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "And then you go into the Olympics and this is where I first saw Judo."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "And I kind of thought of them as the same as Judo and Jiu Jitsu."}, {"time": 6084, "text": "And I was really impressed by your performance in that Olympics."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "The footage nowhere to be found these days, but at that time I think you could still, you could watch it live on NBC Olympics or somewhere like that."}, {"time": 6098, "text": "And I remember watching several of your matches."}, {"time": 6101, "text": "One of them was the match against Ole Bischoff, the German."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "And I remember being, it'd be nice if you can talk to that match because I don't remember it."}, {"time": 6109, "text": "All I remember is being frustrated."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "By him not letting you play Judo."}, {"time": 6119, "text": "So obviously you faced him again four years later and there's a lot of frustration there as well."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "But I remember being extra frustrated in 2008."}, {"time": 6129, "text": "What was that match like?"}, {"time": 6130, "text": "So he might've been number one in the world at the time or up there?"}, {"time": 6133, "text": "He was up there for sure, especially going into 2008."}, {"time": 6138, "text": "He was really high up there."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "And did he win gold at that Olympics?"}, {"time": 6146, "text": "Because he silvered in London."}, {"time": 6147, "text": "It was the same Olympic final both in 2008 and London."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "Okay, so you're facing him there."}, {"time": 6155, "text": "Were you intimidated?"}, {"time": 6156, "text": "What was the strategy?"}, {"time": 6157, "text": "Can you talk to that match?"}, {"time": 6159, "text": "Because it kind of sets the stage for the rematch in 2012."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "Yeah, he was somebody that I had trained with in the past."}, {"time": 6168, "text": "And for some reason, when it comes to him and I, when we train together, it's more of a physical altercation than a Judo training session."}, {"time": 6179, "text": "It's just the coaches have had to break us up a few times."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "Or you guys get almost angry too?"}, {"time": 6187, "text": "It always goes farther than it should."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "We say hello to each other."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "But for some reason, when we train together, there's something about him and me that just oil and water."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "Could it be also the gripping?"}, {"time": 6201, "text": "Because he's a great gripping strategist."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "Does he frustrate you with certain kinds of grips and then you get pissed off and then you frustrate him?"}, {"time": 6208, "text": "And then he gets pissed off and then before you know it, somebody's kicked somebody or punched somebody in the mouth or done something."}, {"time": 6214, "text": "Yeah, so one of the only evidences we have online of you fighting him is your foot in his groin area is the only thing we have from that Olympics."}, {"time": 6226, "text": "From 2008."}, {"time": 6227, "text": "From 2008, yeah."}, {"time": 6228, "text": "And to answer everybody's question, yes, it was deliberate."}, {"time": 6232, "text": "Now you can say this."}, {"time": 6234, "text": "But yeah, I remember there being a lot of frustration."}, {"time": 6237, "text": "You're actually going for a lot of stuff like sacrifice throws."}, {"time": 6240, "text": "I mean, maybe you're not going for the highest scoring epons, but you're just trying to shake things up, if I remember correctly."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "Yeah, because when he, I was so young then that, and he was in his prime really at that time, right?"}, {"time": 6253, "text": "He must've been 24, 25, 26, world medalist, European champion at the time."}, {"time": 6262, "text": "And when he would grab me, I had that sense of feeling stuck."}, {"time": 6267, "text": "Like I was strong enough if I used all my strength to not let him do anything, but then you can't be offensive when you're using all your strength to hold onto the situation."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "So I was getting really aggravated because I couldn't generate any offense with every time I felt like I gained an advantage in the gripping scenario, he would take some obscure grip somewhere that was like, well, now I've got to go address this thing, give up what I gained and I have to go back."}, {"time": 6294, "text": "And if I were to think about watching the match now, it probably looked like a lot of flailing because we're just trying to generate enough to not get a penalty, but also not enough to where he could counter it."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "Did you think you could beat him like when you were walking into the match?"}, {"time": 6314, "text": "Until I

a whole nother question."}, {"time": 6330, "text": "But I remember when he grabbed me for that first time, I went, this is different."}, {"time": 6340, "text": "And there was a sense of panic at the time cause I was like, holy crap, where did this come from?"}, {"time": 6345, "text": "This is not the guy that I've trained with that I expected."}, {"time": 6351, "text": "Cause it was a definite like level change in like his ability, strength, speed, and stamina."}, {"time": 6357, "text": "Like looking back at that, can you explain that?"}, {"time": 6360, "text": "Is it just you being more, less confident because it was the Olympics?"}, {"time": 6365, "text": "It was, is there some kind of routine that he followed to like really level up in intensity for this particular event?"}, {"time": 6372, "text": "I've been told that he only gets to like his prime for like really big events."}, {"time": 6380, "text": "Like he doesn't train like year round like I would train, but when it comes to like the games, he doesn't do social media, he doesn't work, he lives, breathes, eats his training for the games, which could institute that level."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "Is there a, like

the social part of the social media."}, {"time": 6437, "text": "I have to bring this up because, and then you went on to face Tiago Camilo."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "You lost that match, but he went on to win bronze."}, {"time": 6444, "text": "That's also an interesting one, but we can skip ahead."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "I just remember being really impressed both by your groundwork."},

got that solidified his win, yes, it was a point back in those days."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "So I can't say anything, but like my shoulder nicked the ground."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "So it's like, I don't know."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "A lot of the stories of your Olympic career is like from a fan perspective, it seems like you should have won or you very close to could have won."},

much goes into it, and then when I broke down on the match, like the amount of suffering that happens when you lose a match like that."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "And then, you know, really coming back

aren't about to do what I think you're about to do."}, {"time": 7658, "text": "And he's like, hey, shake hands again."}, {"time": 7659, "text": "Cause the first time we did it, that wasn't good

too experienced."}, {"time": 7781, "text": "He has to mentally make that choice to give that inch."}, {"time": 7784, "text": "And then you just have to be ready to take it."}, {"time": 7787, "text":

like the sacrifice throws to him?"}, {"time": 7801, "text": "Cause the whole point of that technique and the sacrifice throws wasn't because I thought I was gonna throw him, but it disrupts the pattern enough to like get him to make a potential mistake."}, {"time": 7814, "text": "Like see, he should have gotten Ashido there."}, {"time": 7816, "text": "Hands in the face."}, {"time": 7818,

no?"}, {"time": 7827, "text": "Like, was he acting frustrated or anything like that?"}, {"time": 7830, "text": "It was all like, he's like acting for the ref."}, {"time": 7834, "text": "Like, oh, that, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7835, "text": "You're just going in hard, nonstop, like angry, aggressive, feeling cardio here at all."}, {"time": 7844, "text": "I don't, I didn't get tired during this."}, {"time": 7846, "text": "And then just always pressing for."}, {"time": 7848, "text": "Time runs out."}, {"time": 7850, "text": "Now we're into golden score."}, {"time": 7851, "text":

take longer to get back to the line than the entire exchange."}, {"time": 7863, "text": "So the more aggression, the more exchanges you have, the longer the time stretches."}, {"time": 7869, "text":

to the flags, I won."}, {"time": 7896, "text": "No doubt in my mind."}, {"time": 7899, "text": "Because I felt like the whole time, like I was going to him, right?"}, {"time": 7905, "text": "He was never coming at me."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "Yeah, that's the way it felt."}, {"time": 7909, "text": "And like, that's the way it felt body language wise, just the intensity, how fast you're moving towards him."}, {"time": 7915, "text": "You're constantly going for throws."}, {"time": 7920, "text": "Now, if you want to rewind that, we can talk about the whole, because it's a part of this clip."}, {"time": 7925, "text": "So wait a minute, they all went blue."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "They all did."}, {"time": 7929, "text": "So in judo, there's three referees, two on the side, one in the center, and they all vote on who won."}, {"time": 7934, "text": "And now let's pause it right there."}, {"time": 7936, "text": "Now, the way this is supposed to work, they raise their flags, they do like a one, two count, and then on three, they all raise it together."}, {"time": 7944, "text": "Now, as a little pretext to this entire match, up until this point, not one match at the Olympic Games has ever been a split decision."}, {"time": 7954, "text": "Meaning out of three people, not one of them voted against the other group members."}, {"time": 7961, "text": "So they were all unified blue or all unified white."}, {"time": 7966, "text": "Which is statistically difficult to imagine."}, {"time": 7970, "text": "It's almost like they had a referee meeting and said, it's better for the Olympics."}, {"time": 7975, "text": "To never have a split."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "So the question becomes, if you would click that frame by frame, right?"}, {"time": 7988, "text": "So right now we have all the refs with their flags out and then click that."}, {"time": 7992, "text": "So the middle guy starts."}, {"time": 7995, "text": "He is all the way up."}, {"time": 7997, "text": "All the way up."}, {"time": 7997, "text": "The other side judges haven't moved."}, {"time": 8000, "text": "We now have one side ref all the way up."}, {"time": 8003, "text": "Then we have a third side ref all the way up."}, {"time": 8009, "text": "So there's a time point when the middle guy has the flag all the way up."}, {"time": 8013, "text": "If not 80, 90% of the way there."}, {"time": 8016, "text": "Then the other one does."}, {"time": 8017, "text": "And then the third one goes."}, {"time": 8020, "text": "So now the question becomes who really, like did the outside refs really have an opinion?"}, {"time": 8027, "text": "Or were they told to wait for the center one to start and then lift whatever flag the center ref picked?"}, {"time": 8041, "text": "It's very, honestly, it's very possible that they had this meeting."}, {"time": 8045, "text": "This is the problem with the Olympics."}, {"time": 8049, "text": "They sometimes, it's also the problem in the Soviet Union with communism."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "They think the committee knows what's good for the people and so on."}, {"time": 8058, "text": "So they decide universally as opposed to letting the magic of the Olympics be what it is."}, {"time": 8065, "text": "But nevertheless, in this case, the center ref decided blue."}, {"time": 8071, "text": "Like what do you think?"}, {"time": 8073, "text": "Do you think it's just a shitty call?"}, {"time": 8076, "text": "He has the right to pick."}, {"time": 8078, "text": "But the problem is the other two I don't think did."}, {"time": 8083, "text": "And so when you do this frame by frame again, I can see from my own perspective two of the refs."}, {"time": 8094, "text": "And I see them both blue."}, {"time": 8095, "text": "So when you fast forward that a little bit to get to all the flags, I see the two go blue."}, {"time": 8103, "text": "And I go, I look over and I look at the other guy and I'm like, really?"}, {"time": 8108, "text": "All three?"}, {"time": 8110, "text": "I fought for eight minutes and I can't even get a vote."}, {"time": 8113, "text": "I didn't even get a penalty."}, {"time": 8115, "text": "I can't even get a vote."}, {"time":

Jimmy saying here to you?"}, {"time": 8159, "text": "I mean, I guess there's nothing to say."}, {"time": 8164, "text": "He was kind of apologizing for the way the scores went."}, {"time": 8171,

when I'm sitting in the hotel and I'm sending this email, I remember being at the training camp, I was like, I don't even fucking care what the rules are, I'm just gonna fucking throw people, I don't

to do Judo, right?"}, {"time": 8663, "text": "Because when you get to the highest level, your game tends to morph around what can you can or cannot get away with."}, {"time": 8673, "text": "I was more

don't even know what to do."}, {"time": 8781, "text": "And I couldn't even think clearly."}, {"time": 8784, "text": "And that's when I was like, I may not come back."}, {"time": 8788, "text": "You

one thing you need."}, {"time": 8804, "text": "Like you gotta have it."}, {"time": 8805, "text": "So I can work through anything else."}, {"time": 8807, "text": "I needed that though."}, {"time": 8809, "text": "And so how did you come back from that time?"}, {"time": 8811, "text": "That's when I wrote another email and I was like, I'm fucking off team USA."}, {"time": 8815, "text": "I'm not fucking, I'm all done with USA judo."}, {"time": 8817, "text": "I'm done with the tour."}, {"time": 8818, "text": "I was like, I quit."}, {"time": 8820, "text": "Well, I'm gonna go do my own thing."},

figure out a way of like doing this."}, {"time": 8843, "text": "And I was like, because when we trained before, we did it as a unit, right?"}, {"time": 8849, "text": "We all went to the same tournaments."}, {"time": 8850, "text": "We all went to the same training camps."}, {"time": 8851, "text": "And I'm like, you guys are treating me like I'm the same player I used to be."}, {"time":

wanna do?"}, {"time": 8863, "text": "And I go, I'll tell you what Jimmy, you know I'm being serious because my answer is something you'd never would have expected."}, {"time": 8869, "text": "I go, why

this point."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "But I was like, I have to get to a point where I can get so tired and get through it that like my Judo will come back and my body will learn again."}, {"time": 8890, "text": "And when you say Japan, you mean the Kodokan, like what's Tokai, is that the highest level of Judo?"}, {"time": 8896, "text": "It's one of the top colleges in the world, yeah."},

to score."}, {"time": 8933, "text": "Well, if you're training with the best people in the world all the time, you're not always gonna be able to score."}, {"time": 8938, "text": "So you still need

status."}, {"time": 9057, "text": "No, but you're status raising."}, {"time": 9060, "text": "So I was actually like in a situation where nobody was watching me and I was free to just battle at my own will."}, {"time": 9070, "text": "Which is what it was about for me."}, {"time": 9072, "text": "And you just push yourself."}, {"time": 9074, "text": "Because I knew how to do that."}, {"time": 9075,

would rather, I would rather find out who I am and what I'm made of and find those, those end points."}, {"time": 9126, "text": "And if I can't find them, then that means everybody else has given up

there's an interesting pull with the, oh no, it's not a tricep."}, {"time": 12268, "text": "He almost like, it starts with the tricep and he like collects the gear or something like that."}, {"time": 12272, "text": "But it's still above the elbow because you can see the bend, right?"}, {"time": 12276, "text": "And right here, see how he never put, back it up a little bit."}, {"time": 12281, "text": "This is kind of like one of those things, yeah, pause it right there."}, {"time": 12285, "text": "So when he puts his right foot down, he's pulling so hard with his back that when Ono goes to put his left foot down, it never touches the mat."}, {"time": 12295, "text": "But by putting his left foot back, it actually pulls Ungarvi's foot forward."}, {"time": 12299, "text": "And so he's able to speed up his throw by just continuing that motion back, which what was supposed to have been a step turned out to just, in the middle of the action, he makes a split second decision before putting the foot down to just continue."}, {"time": 12315, "text": "Cause he recognizes that feel in his hands."}, {"time": 12318, "text": "And so it's like, it never, it's a swing."}, {"time": 12320, "text": "Like he never touches the ground with his left foot."}, {"time": 12322, "text": "It never started as like a big swing to a back step."}, {"time": 12326, "text": "He changed his mind partway through."}, {"time": 12328, "text": "So it's right there, he wants to take a step."}, {"time": 12330, "text": "And then he goes, nope, he's bringing that foot forward."}, {"time": 12332, "text": "I'm just going to go for it."}, {"time": 12334, "text": "Wait, is he full?"}, {"time": 12336, "text": "Full air."}, {"time": 12338, "text": "Boom, boom."}, {"time": 12339, "text": "And look at, if you go a few more steps forward right there, his hip is the same height as Ungarvi shoulder."}, {"time": 12348, "text": "Because he's leaning so far into the throw with his body weight."}, {"time": 12353,

about the sheer physics to like get your body into this position."}, {"time": 12367, "text": "Jimmy and I were so like, when we saw this for the first time, we tried to just stand like that and we couldn't do it."}, {"time": 12373, "text": "His left foot is pointing straight ahead."}, {"time": 12377, "text": "His chest is perpendicular to that foot or parallel with it, right?"}, {"time": 12381,

"text": "I think he's done this particular throw, not this style of it, but Uchi Mata so much that his body has adapted to be able to do this."}, {"time": 12397, "text": "So when people are trying to learn and like break down videos, they don't understand like the power he has and what we call end range motion."}, {"time": 12408, "text": "Yeah, look at that."}, {"time": 12409, "text": "So like look at the full range of motion he takes, right?"}, {"time": 12413, "text": "His left foot swings all the way around and the torso starts like at three oclock and it goes all the way around like almost back to the three oclock."}, {"time": 12425, "text": "Like, like what?"}, {"time": 12428, "text": "And he never lifts his leg above his hip."}, {"time": 12432, "text": "And the crazy part is he never fell over during any of it."}, {"time": 12437, "text": "Stayed on his feet."}, {"time": 12439, "text": "What's he doing?"}, {"time": 12439, "text": "Is that a matter of pride or just?"},

we talked about the very beginning, like he's got to get his center of gravity under his."}, {"time": 12465, "text": "Well, here's one of the top players in the world throwing another top player in the world with his hip at that guy's shoulder height and it's still working, it's."}, {"time": 12475, "text": "Okay, so he, this generation, he could be the great."}, {"time": 12479, "text": "And like he switched a lot of those details of the throw in the middle."}, {"time": 12483, "text": "In the middle."}, {"time": 12484, "text": "And that only is, that means he's probably what, like a hundred

neck but will not bite."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Okay, so now it turns out that if you study wolves in the wild, then neighboring packs often go hunting for each other, they are in fierce competition, and as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "So it's a really serious business."}, {"time": 1610,

male on another arm."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "Now you have an immobilized victim with four individuals capable of just doing the damage."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "And so they can then move in and

about the motivation is rather like the motivation in sex."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "So when males are interested in having sex with a female, whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans, they don't

suppose that's what democracy is."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "Okay, so at some point alpha males get taken out."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "Well, what alpha males are are males who respond with high

doing is reducing reactive aggression."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "You are selecting those individuals to breed who are most willing to be approached by a human or by another member of their own

changes that are characteristic of domesticated animals in general compared to wild animals are all found in Homo sapiens compared to our early ancestors."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "So it's a very strong signal that when we first see Homo sapiens, what we're seeing is that there's a lot of change in the shape of the animal."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "What we're seeing is evidence of a reduction in reactive aggression."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "And that suggests that what's happening with Homo sapiens is that that is the point at which there is selection against the alpha males."}, {"time":

think that Homo sapiens is a species characterized by the suppression of reactive aggression as a kind of incidental consequence of the suppression of the alpha male."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "And

on the society a new set of values."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "Because when those beta males discovered that they could take out the previous alpha male and continue to do so, because in every generation there'll always be some male who says, maybe I'll become the alpha male."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "So they just keep chopping them down."}, {"time": 2858, "text": "In discovering that,

values."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "There's one kind of value is things that are good for the group."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "Like, thou shalt not murder."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "And the other

loving."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "I mean, if you just follow through from typical ethnographies nowadays of when dominant groups meet subordinate groups, they didn't know each other, then you can

the food such as the amount of sugar there, the amount of free amino acids because the amino acids can be tasted."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "And the physical qualities of the food be particularly

fire has been ultimately responsible for essentially how grandiose do I want to be here, the entire human story, going back to homo."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "It is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "And perhaps the biggest way in which it is likely to have changed us is it reduced the difficulty of making a large brain."}, {"time": 6638, "text":

food."}, {"time": 6776, "text": "You know, there are 25 bodily processes or more that are involved in digesting your food, making the acid that takes the proteins apart, maintaining the brush border

less if you cook your food."}, {"time": 6799, "text": "So you get a net gain in the amount of energy and you are reducing the amount of time from in our case, our ancestors, probably around 50% of the day chewing to nowadays one hour a day chewing."}, {"time": 6816, "text": "So all of a sudden you've got hours a day in which to do other things and to use those brains that you've now enabled to grow."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "So with Homo erectus, you start the process of getting a bigger brain and famously, throughout the whole period of the evolution of the genus Homo, you have a steadily increasing size of brain until right at the end when it actually gets smaller, but that's a different story."}, {"time": 6842, "text": "Which end is this?"}, {"time": 6843, "text": "Which, are we talking about Homo sapiens?"}, {"time": 6846, "text": "Yeah, with Homo sapiens, you've got a smaller brain from, people haven't got it exactly down, but at least 30,000 years ago, it starts declining."}, {"time": 6857, "text": "And so the fascinating thing about that is that all domesticated animals have smaller brains than their wild ancestors."}, {"time": 6865, "text": "And I."},

plank length, but you could argue that that's kind of an imaginary thing."}, {"time": 407, "text": "But that's 10 to the negative 35."}, {"time": 409, "text": "Now we're about, conveniently, about 10 to the one."}, {"time": 412, "text": "Not quite, 10 to the zero."}, {"time": 413, "text": "We're about 10 to the zero meters long."}, {"time": 416, "text": "So it's easy because you can just look and say, okay, well, for example, atoms are like 10 to the negative 15th or 10 to the negative 16th meters across, right?"}, {"time": 428, "text": "If you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 16th, which is right, that's now."}, {"time": 432, "text": "So an atom to us is us to this."}, {"time": 433, "text": "You get to like nebulas, smaller than a galaxy and bigger than the biggest star."}, {"time": 438,

you go up to the observable universe, you're getting down on the small side to things that we, I think, are mostly theoretically imagining are there and hypothesizing are there."}, {"time": 459,

we're very quickly, we're bigger than we are small."}, {"time": 472, "text": "If you think about strings."}, {"time": 474, "text": "Yeah, strings, exactly, string theory and so on."}, {"time": 478, "text": "But I think like you answered, no matter what, we're kind of middleish."}, {"time": 482, "text": "Yeah, I mean, here's something cool."}, {"time": 484, "text": "If a human is a neutrino, and again, neutrino, the size doesn't really make sense."}, {"time": 488, "text": "It's not really a size."}, {"time": 489, "text": "But when we talk about some of these neutrinos, I mean, if a neutrino is a human, a proton is the sun."}, {"time": 495, "text": "So that's like, I mean, a proton is real small, like really small."}, {"time": 500, "text": "And so, yeah, the small gets like crazy small very quickly."}, {"time": 505, "text": "Let's talk about aliens."}, {"time": 510, "text": "We already mentioned it."}, {"time": 512, "text": "Let's start just by with the basic, what's your intuition as of today?"}, {"time": 516, "text": "This is a thing that could change day by day."}, {"time": 518, "text": "But how many alien civilizations out there?"}, {"time": 520, "text": "Is it zero?"},

through randomized rake equation multiplication, you're ended up with 27 million as the mean of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy, in the Milky Way alone."}, {"time": 569, "text": "And so then if you go outside the Milky Way, that would turn into trillions."}, {"time": 572, "text": "That's the mean."}, {"time": 574, "text": "Now, what's interesting is that there's a long tail because they believe some of these multipliers in the Drake equation."}, {"time": 580, "text": "So for example, the probability that life starts in the first place, they think that the kind of range that we use is for that variable or is way too small."}, {"time": 594, "text": "And that's constraining our possibilities."}, {"time": 597, "text": "And if you actually extend it to some crazy number of orders of magnitude, like 200, they think that that variable should be, you get this long tail where, I forget the exact number, but it's like a third or a quarter of the total outcomes have us alone."}, {"time": 614, "text": "I think it's a sizable percentage has us as the only intelligent life in the galaxy, but you can keep going."}, {"time": 623, "text": "And I think there's like a non zero, like legitimate amount of outcomes there that have us as the only life in the observable universe at all is on earth."}, {"time": 632, "text": "I mean, it seems incredibly counterintuitive."}, {"time": 635, "text": "It seems like, you mentioned that people think you must be an idiot because if you picked up one grain of sand on a beach and examined it and you found all these little things on it, it's like saying, well, maybe this is the only one that has that."}, {"time": 647, "text": "And it's like, probably not."}, {"time": 648, "text": "They're probably most of the sand probably or a lot of the sand, right?"}, {"time": 652, "text": "So, and then the other hand, we don't see anything."}, {"time": 654, "text": "We don't see any evidence, which of course, people would say that the people who stuff scoff at the concept that we're potentially alone, they say, well, of course, there's lots of reasons we wouldn't have seen anything."}, {"time": 666, "text": "And they can go list them and they're very compelling, but we don't know."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And the truth is if there were, if this were a freak thing, I mean, we don't, if this were a completely freak thing that happened here, whether it's life at all or just getting to this level of intelligence, that species, whoever it was, would think there must be lots of us out there and they'd be wrong."}, {"time": 688, "text": "So just being, again, using the same intuition that most people would use, I'd say there's probably lots of other things out there."}, {"time": 694, "text": "Yeah, and you wrote a great blog post about it."}, {"time": 696, "text": "But to me, the two interesting reasons that we haven't been in contact, I too have an intuition that the universe is teeming with life."}, {"time": 707, "text": "So one interesting is around the great filter."}, {"time": 710, "text": "So we either, the great filter's either behind us or in front of us."}, {"time": 715, "text": "So the reason that's interesting is you get to think about what kind of things ensure or ensure the survival of an intelligent civilization or lead to the destruction of intelligent civilization."}, {"time": 728, "text": "That's a very pragmatic, very important question to always be asking."}, {"time": 731, "text": "And we'll talk about some of those."}, {"time": 733, "text": "And then the other one is I'm saddened by the possibility that there could be aliens communicating with us all the time."}, {"time": 741, "text": "In fact, they may have visited."}, {"time": 745, "text": "And we're just too dumb to hear it, to see it."}, {"time": 749, "text": "Like the idea that the kind of life that can evolve is just the range of life that can evolve is so large that our narrow view of what is life and what is intelligent life is preventing us from having communication with them."}, {"time": 765, "text": "But then they don't seem very smart because if they were trying to communicate with us, they would surely, if they were super intelligent, they would be very, I'm sure if there's lots of life, we're not that rare, we're not some crazy weird species that hears and has different kinds of ways of perceiving signals."}, {"time": 784, "text": "So they would probably be able to, if you really wanted to communicate with an earth like species, with a human like species, you would send out all kinds of things."}, {"time": 794, "text": "You'd send out radio waves and you send out gravity waves and lots of things."}, {"time": 800, "text": "So if they're communicating in a way, they're trying to communicate with us and it's just we're too dumb to perceive the signals, it's like, well, they're not doing a great job of considering the primitive species we might be."}, {"time": 812, "text": "So I don't know, I think if a super intelligent species wanted to get in touch with us and had the capability of, I think probably they would."}, {"time": 823, "text": "Well, they may be getting in touch with us, they're just getting in touch with the thing that we humans are not understanding that they're getting in touch with us with."}, {"time": 833, "text": "I guess that's what I was trying to say is there could be something about earth that's much more special than us humans."}, {"time": 840, "text": "Like the nature of the intelligence that's on earth or the thing that's of value and that's curious and that's complicated and fascinating and beautiful might be something that's not just like tweets, okay?"}, {"time": 855, "text": "Like English language that's interpretable or any kind of language or any kind of signal, whether it's gravity or radio signal that humans seem to appreciate."}, {"time": 864, "text": "Why not the actual, it could be the process of evolution itself."}, {"time": 869, "text": "There could be something about the way that earth is breathing essentially through the creation of life and this complex growth of life."}, {"time": 877, "text": "There's like, it's a whole different way to view organisms and view life that could be getting communicated with."}, {"time": 884, "text": "And we humans are just a tiny fingertip on top of that intelligence."},

{"time": 900, "text": "I mean, it sounds crazy, but our understanding of what is intelligent, of what is life, what is consciousness is very limited."}, {"time": 908, "text": "And it seems to be, and just being very suspicious, it seems to be awfully human centric."}, {"time": 914, "text": "Like this story, it seems like the progress of science is constantly putting humans down on the importance, humans down on the cosmic importance, the ranking of how big we are, how important we are."}, {"time": 932, "text": "That seems to be the more we discover that's what's happening."}, {"time": 934, "text": "And I think science is very young."}, {"time": 937, "text": "And so I think eventually we might figure out that there's something much, much bigger going on, that humans are just a curious little side effect of the much bigger thing."}, {"time": 946, "text": "That's what, I mean, that, as I'm saying, it just sounds insane, but."}, {"time": 950, "text": "Well, it just, it sounds a little like religious."}, {"time": 954, "text": "It sounds like a spiritual, it gets to that realm where there's something that more than meets the eye."}, {"time": 962, "text": "Well, yeah, but not, so

really good."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "And this is the AI component."}, {"time": 5986, "text": "And so I get excited about specific things like that."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "Like think about if

you have to tell it."}, {"time": 6167, "text": "Well, plus the pleasure thing, like it knows what kind of components of a meal you've enjoyed in the past so you can assemble the perfect meal."},

night and go to bed way too late and then wake up later and get on a bad schedule and I just fall into these bad schedules."}, {"time": 7728, "text": "Or I'll wake up and there's just, you know, I'll say I was gonna do a few emails and I'll open it up and I'm suddenly on text and I'm texting."}, {"time": 7734, "text": "Or I'll just go and, you know, I'll make a phone call and I'll be on phone

early and get to work, I'll feel like a bad person."}, {"time": 7885, "text": "And that is worse than doing those things."}, {"time": 7888, "text": "And then it becomes a habit eventually and it becomes just easy automatic."}, {"time": 7891, "text": "It becomes I do it because that's what I do."}, {"time": 7893, "text": "But I think that if you don't have a lot of shame necessarily, the pain

interesting questions you asked there."}, {"time": 837, "text": "I think the one I mentioned is this idea of memory and experience versus just kind of observe the world and learn its knowledge, which I think for that, I would argue lots of recent advancements that make me very excited about the field."}, {"time": 853, "text": "And then the second maybe issue that I see is all these models, we train them from scratch."}, {"time": 861, "text": "That's something I would have complained three years ago or six years ago or 10 years ago."}, {"time": 866, "text": "And it feels if we take inspiration from how we got here, how the universe evolved us and we keep evolving, it feels that is a missing piece, that we should not be training models from scratch every few months, that there should be some sort of way in which we can grow models much like as a species and many other elements in the universe is building from the previous sort of iterations."}, {"time": 895, "text": "And that from a just purely neural network perspective, even though we would like to make it work, it's proven very hard to not throw away the previous weights, right?"}, {"time": 907, "text": "This landscape we learn from the data and refresh it with a brand new set of weights, given maybe a recent snapshot of these data sets we train on, et cetera, or even a new game we're learning."}, {"time": 920, "text": "So that feels like something is missing fundamentally."}, {"time": 924, "text": "We might find it, but it's not very clear how it will look like."}, {"time": 928, "text": "There's many ideas and it's super exciting as well."}, {"time": 930, "text": "Yes, just for people who don't know, when you're approaching a new problem in machine learning, you're going to come up with an architecture that has a bunch of weights and then you initialize them somehow, which in most cases is some version of random."}, {"time": 947, "text": "So that's what you mean by starting from scratch."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And it seems like it's a waste every time you solve the game of Go and chess, StarCraft, protein folding, like surely there's some way to reuse the weights as we grow this giant database of neural networks that have solved some of the toughest problems in the world."}, {"time": 970, "text": "And so some of that is, what is that?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "Methods, how to reuse weights, how to learn, extract what's generalizable or at least has a chance to be and throw away the other stuff."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And maybe the neural network itself should be able to tell you that."}, {"time": 991, "text": "Like what, yeah, how do you, what ideas do you have for better initialization of weights?"}, {"time": 997, "text": "Maybe stepping back, if we look at the field of machine learning, but especially deep learning, right?"}, {"time": 1004, "text": "At the core of deep learning, there's this beautiful idea that is a single algorithm can solve any task, right?"}, {"time": 1039, "text": "I mean, image classification is very clear example, images to maybe one of a thousand categories, that's what ImageNet is like, but many, many, if not all problems can be mapped this way."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "And then there's a generic recipe, right?"}, {"time": 1053, "text": "That you can use."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "And this recipe with very little change, and I think that's the core of deep learning research, right?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "That what is the recipe that is universal?"}, {"time": 1064, "text": "That for any new given task, I'll be able to use without thinking, without having to work very hard on the problem at stake."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "We have not found this recipe, but I think the field is excited to find less tweaks or tricks that people find when they work on important problems specific to those and more of a general algorithm, right?"}, {"time": 1087, "text": "So at an algorithmic level, I would say we have something general already, which is this formula of training a very powerful model, a neural network on a lot of data."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And in many cases, you need some specificity to the actual problem you're solving, protein folding being such an important problem has some basic recipe that is learned from before, right?"}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Like transformer models, graph neural networks, ideas coming from NLP, like something called BERT, that is a kind of loss that you can emplace to help the knowledge distillation is another technique, right?"}, {"time": 1126, "text": "So this is the formula."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "We still had to find some particular things that were specific to alpha fold, right?"}, {"time": 1133, "text": "That's very important because protein folding is such a high value problem that as humans, we should solve it no matter if we need to be a bit specific."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And it's possible that some of these learnings will apply then to the next iteration of this recipe that deep learners are about."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "But it is true that so far, the recipe is what's common, but the weights you generally throw away, which feels very sad."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "Although, maybe in the last, especially in the last two, three years, and when we last spoke, I mentioned this area of meta learning, which is the idea of learning to learn."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "That idea and some progress has been had starting, I would say, mostly from GPT3 on the language domain only, in which you could conceive a model that is trained once."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "And then this model is not narrow in that it only knows how to translate a pair of languages or even a set of or it only knows how to assign sentiment to a sentence."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "These actually, you could teach it by a prompting, it's called, and this prompting is essentially just showing it a few more examples, almost like you do show examples, input, output examples, algorithmically speaking to the process of creating this model."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "But now you're doing it through language, which is very natural way for us to learn from one another."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "I tell you, hey, you should do this new task."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "I'll tell you a bit more."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "Maybe you ask me some questions and now you know the task, right?"}, {"time": 1217, "text": "You didn't need to retrain it from scratch."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "And we've seen these magical moments almost in this way to do few shot promptings through language on language only domain."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "And then in the last two years, we've seen these expanded to beyond language, adding vision, adding actions and games, lots of progress to be had."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "But this is maybe, if you ask me like about how are we gonna crack this problem?"}, {"time": 1243, "text": "This is perhaps one way in which you have a single model."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "The problem of this model is it's hard to grow in weights or capacity, but the model is certainly so powerful that you can teach it some tasks, right?"}, {"time": 1258, "text": "In this way that I teach you, I could teach you a new task now, if we were all at a text based task or a classification of vision style task."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "But it still feels like more breakthroughs should be had, but it's a great beginning, right?"}, {"time": 1274, "text": "We have a good baseline."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "We have an idea that this maybe is the way we want to benchmark progress towards AGI."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "And I think in my view, that's critical to always have a way to benchmark the community sort of converging to these overall, which is good to see."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "And then this is actually what excites me in terms of also next steps for deep learning is how to make these models more powerful, how do you train them, how to grow them if they must grow, should they change their weights as you teach it task or not?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "There's some interesting questions, many to be answered."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "Yeah, you've opened the door about to a bunch of questions I want to ask, but let's first return to your tweet and read it like a Shakespeare."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "You wrote, God is not the end, it's the beginning."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "And then you wrote meow and then an emoji of a cat."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "So first two questions."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "First, can you explain the meow and the cat emoji?"}, {"time": 1330, "text": "And second, can you explain what Godot is and how it works?"}, {"time": 1333, "text": "Right, indeed."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "I mean, thanks for reminding me that we're all exposing on Twitter and."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "Permanently there."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "Yes, permanently there."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "One of the greatest AI researchers of all time, meow and cat emoji."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "Can you imagine like touring, tweeting, meow and cat, probably he would, probably would."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "So yeah, the tweet is important actually."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "You know, I put thought on the tweets, I hope people."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "Which part do you think?"}, {"time": 1361, "text": "Okay, so there's three sentences."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "Godot is not the end, Godot is the beginning, meow, cat emoji."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "Okay, which is the important part?"}, {"time": 1371, "text": "The meow, no, no."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "Definitely that it is the beginning."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "I mean, I probably was just explaining a bit where the field is going, but let me tell you about Godot."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "So first the name Godot comes from maybe a sequence of releases that DeepMind had that named, like used animal names to name some of their models that are based on this idea of large sequence models."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "Initially they're only language, but we are expanding to other modalities."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "So we had, you know, we had Gopher, Chinchilla, these were language only."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "And then more recently we released Flamingo, which adds vision to the equation."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "And then Godot, which adds vision and then also actions in the mix, right?"}, {"time": 1421, "text": "As we discuss actually actions, especially discrete actions like up, down, left, right."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "I just told you the actions, but they're words."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "So you can kind of see how actions naturally map to sequence modeling of words, which these models are very powerful."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "So Godot was named after, I believe, I can only from memory, right?"}, {"time": 1443, "text": "These, you know, these things always happen with an amazing team of researchers behind."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "So before the release, we had a discussion about which animal would we pick, right?"}, {"time": 1454, "text": "And I think because of the word general agent, right?"}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And this is a property quite unique to Godot."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "We kind of were playing with the GA words and then, you know, Godot."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "Rhymes with cat."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "And Godot is obviously a Spanish version of cat."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "I had nothing to do with it, although I'm from Spain."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "Oh, how do you, wait, sorry."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "How do you say cat in Spanish?"}, {"time": 1474, "text": "Gato."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Oh, gato, okay."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "Now it all makes sense."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Okay, okay, I see, I see, I see."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "How do you say meow in Spanish?"}, {"time": 1480, "text": "No, that's probably the same."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "I think you say it the same way, but you write it as M, I, A, U."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Okay, it's universal."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "All right, so then how does the thing work?"}, {"time": 1491, "text": "So you said general is, so you said language, vision."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "And action."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "How does this, can you explain what kind of neural networks are involved?"}, {"time": 1504, "text": "What does the training look like?"}, {"time": 1506, "text": "And maybe what do you, are some beautiful ideas within the system?"}, {"time": 1511, "text": "Yeah, so maybe the basics of Gato are not that dissimilar from many, many work that come."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So here is where the sort of the recipe, I mean, hasn't changed too much."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "There is a transformer model that's the kind of recurrent neural network that essentially takes a sequence of modalities, observations that could be words, could be vision or could be actions."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And then its own objective that you train it to do when you train it is to predict what the next anything is."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "And anything means what's the next action."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "If this sequence that I'm showing you to train is a sequence of actions and observations, then you're predicting what's the next action and the next observation, right?"}, {"time": 1557, "text": "So you think of these really as a sequence of bites, right?"}, {"time": 1560, "text": "So take any sequence of words, a sequence of interleaved words and images, a sequence of maybe observations that are images and moves in Atari up, down, left, right."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "And these you just think of them as bites and you're modeling what's the next bite gonna be like."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "And you might interpret that as an action and then play it in a game, or you could interpret it as a word and then write it down if you're chatting with the system and so on."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "So Gato basically can be thought as inputs, images, text, video, actions."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "It also actually inputs some sort of proprioception sensors from robotics because robotics is one of the tasks that it's been trained to do."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "And then at the output, similarly, it outputs words, actions."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "It does not output images, that's just by design, we decided not to go that way for now."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "That's also in part why it's the beginning because there's more to do clearly."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "But that's kind of what the Gato is, is this brain that essentially you give it any sequence of these observations and modalities and it outputs the next step."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "And then off you go, you feed the next step into and predict the next one and so on."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "Now, it is more than a language model because even though you can chat with Gato, like you can chat with Chinchilla or Flamingo, it also is an agent, right?"}, {"time": 1653, "text": "So that's why we call it A of Gato, like the letter A and also it's general."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "It's not an agent that's been trained to be good at only StarCraft or only Atari or only Go."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "It's been trained on a vast variety of datasets."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "What makes it an agent, if I may interrupt, the fact that it can generate actions?"}, {"time": 1676, "text": "Yes, so when we call it, I mean, it's a good question, right?"}, {"time": 1680, "text": "When do we call a model?"}, {"time": 1682, "text": "I mean, everything is a model, but what is an agent in my view is indeed the capacity to take actions in an environment that you then send to it and then the environment might return with a new observation and then you generate the next action."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "This actually, this reminds me of the question from the side of biology, what is life?"}, {"time": 1703, "text": "Which is actually a very difficult question as well."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "What is living, what is living when you think about life here on this planet Earth?"}, {"time": 1711, "text": "And a question interesting to me about aliens, what is life when we visit another planet?"}, {"time": 1715, "text": "Would we be able to recognize it?"}, {"time": 1717, "text": "And this feels like, it sounds perhaps silly, but I don't think it is."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "At which point is the neural network a being versus a tool?"}, {"time": 1728, "text": "And it feels like action, ability to modify its environment is that fundamental leap."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "Yeah, I think it certainly feels like action is a necessary condition to be more alive, but probably not sufficient either."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "So sadly I..."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "It's a soul consciousness thing, whatever."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "Yeah, yeah, we can get back to that later."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "But anyways, going back to the meow and the gato, right?"}, {"time": 1752, "text": "So one of the leaps forward and what took the team a lot of effort and time was, as you were asking, how has gato been trained?"}, {"time": 1763, "text": "So I told you gato is this transformer neural network, models actions, sequences of actions, words, et cetera."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And then the way we train it is by essentially pulling data sets of observations, right?"}, {"time": 1779, "text": "So it's a massive imitation learning algorithm that it imitates obviously to what is the next word that comes next from the usual data sets we use before, right?"}, {"time": 1790, "text": "So these are these web scale style data sets of people writing on webs or chatting or whatnot, right?"}, {"time": 1798, "text": "So that's an obvious source that we use on all language work."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "But then we also took a lot of agents that we have at DeepMind."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "I mean, as you know, DeepMind, we're quite interested in learning reinforcement learning and learning agents that play in different environments."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "So we kind of created a data set of these trajectories, as we call them, or agent experiences."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "So in a way, there are other agents we train for a single mind purpose to, let's say, control a 3D game environment and navigate a maze."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "So we had all the experience that was created through one agent interacting with that environment."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "And we added this to the data set, right?"}, {"time": 1841, "text": "And as I said, we just see all the data, all these sequences of words or sequences of this agent interacting with that environment or agents playing Atari and so on."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "We see it as the same kind of data."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "And so we mix these data sets together."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "And we train Gato."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "That's the G part, right?"}, {"time": 1861, "text": "It's general because it really has mixed."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "It doesn't have different brains for each modality or each narrow task."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "It has a single brain."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "It's not that big of a brain compared to most of the neural networks we see these days."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "It has 1 billion parameters."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "Some models we're seeing get in the trillions these days."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "And certainly, 100 billion feels like a size that is very common from when you train these jobs."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "So the actual agent is relatively small."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "But it's been trained on a very challenging, diverse data set, not only containing all of the internet but containing all these agent experience playing very different, distinct environments."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "So this brings us to the part of the tweet of this is not the end, it's the beginning."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "It feels very cool to see Gato, in principle, is able to control any sort of environments, especially the ones that it's been trained to do, these 3D games, Atari games, all sorts of robotics tasks, and so on."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "But obviously, it's not as proficient as the teachers it learned from on these environments."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "Not obvious."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "It's not obvious that it wouldn't be more proficient."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "It's just the current beginning part is that the performance is such that it's not as good as if it's specialized to that task."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So it's not as good, although I would argue size matters here."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "So the fact that I would argue always size always matters."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "That's a different conversation."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "But for neural networks, certainly size does matter."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "So it's the beginning because it's relatively small."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "So obviously, scaling this idea up might make the connections that exist between text on the internet and playing Atari and so on more synergistic with one another."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "And you might gain."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "And that moment, we didn't quite see."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "But obviously, that's why it's the beginning."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "That synergy might emerge with scale."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "Right, might emerge with scale."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "And also, I believe there's some new research or ways in which you prepare the data that you might need to make it more clear to the model that you're not only playing Atari, and you start from a screen."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "And here is up and a screen and down."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "Maybe you can think of playing Atari as there's some sort of context that is needed for the agent before it starts seeing, oh, this is an Atari screen."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "I'm going to start playing."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "You might require, for instance, to be told in words, hey, in this sequence that I'm showing, you're going to be playing an Atari game."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "So text might actually be a good driver to enhance the data."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "So then these connections might be made more easily."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "So that's an idea that we start seeing in language."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "But obviously, beyond, this is going to be effective."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "It's not like I don't show you a screen, and you, from scratch, you're supposed to learn a game."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "There is a lot of context we might set."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "So there might be some work needed as well to set that context."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "But anyways, there's a lot of work."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "So that context puts all the different modalities on the same level ground to provide the context best."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "So maybe on that point, so there's this task, which may not seem trivial, of tokenizing the data, of converting the data into pieces, into basic atomic elements that then could cross modalities somehow."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So what's tokenization?"}, {"time": 2077, "text": "How do you tokenize text?"}, {"time": 2079, "text": "How do you tokenize images?"}, {"time": 2082, "text": "How do you tokenize games and actions and robotics tasks?"}, {"time": 2088, "text": "So tokenization is the entry point to actually make all the data look like a sequence, because tokens then are just these little puzzle pieces."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "We break down anything into these puzzle pieces, and then we just model, what's this puzzle look like when you make it lay down in a line, so to speak, in a sequence?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "So in Gato, the text, there's a lot of work."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "You tokenize text usually by looking at commonly used substrings, right?"}, {"time": 2120, "text": "So there's ING in English is a very common substring, so that becomes a token."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "There's quite a well studied problem on tokenizing text."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "And Gato just used the standard techniques that have been developed from many years, even starting from ngram models in the 1950s and so on."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "Just for context, how many tokens, what order, magnitude, number of tokens is required for a word, usually?"}, {"time": 2146, "text": "Yeah, for a word in English, I mean, every language is very different."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "The current level or granularity of tokenization generally means it's maybe two to five."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "I mean, I don't know the statistics exactly, but to give you an idea, we don't tokenize at the level of letters."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "Then it would probably be, I don't know what the average length of a word is in English, but that would be the minimum set of tokens you could use."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "It was bigger than letters, smaller than words."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "And you could think of very, very common words like the."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "I mean, that would be a single token, but very quickly you're talking two, three, four tokens or so."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "Have you ever tried to tokenize emojis?"}, {"time": 2184, "text": "Emojis are actually just sequences of letters, so."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "Maybe to you, but to me they mean so much more."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "Yeah, you can render the emoji, but you might if you actually just."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "Yeah, this is a philosophical question."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "Is emojis an image or a text?"}, {"time": 2203, "text": "The way we do these things is they're actually mapped to small sequences of characters."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "So you can actually play with these models and input emojis, it will output emojis back, which is actually quite a fun exercise."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "You probably can find other tweets about these out there."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "But yeah, so anyways, text."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "It's very clear how this is done."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "And then in Gato, what we did for images is we map images to essentially we compressed images, so to speak, into something that looks more like less like every pixel with every intensity."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "That would mean we have a very long sequence, right?"}, {"time": 2243, "text": "Like if we were talking about 100 by 100 pixel images, that would make the sequences far too long."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "So what was done there is you just use a technique that essentially compresses an image into maybe 16 by 16 patches of pixels, and then that is mapped, again, tokenized."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "You just essentially quantize this space into a special word that actually maps to these little sequence of pixels."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "And then you put the pixels together in some raster order, and then that's how you get out or in the image that you're processing."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "But there's no semantic aspect to that, so you're doing some kind of, you don't need to understand anything about the image in order to tokenize it currently."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "No, you're only using this notion of compression."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "So you're trying to find common, it's like JPG or all these algorithms."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "It's actually very similar at the tokenization level."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "All we're doing is finding common patterns and then making sure in a lossy way we compress these images given the statistics of the images that are contained in all the data we deal with."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "Although you could probably argue that JPEG does have some understanding of images."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "Because visual information, maybe color, compressing crudely based on color does capture something important about an image that's about its meaning, not just about some statistics."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "Yeah, I mean, JP, as I said, the algorithms look actually very similar to they use the cosine transform in JPG."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "The approach we usually do in machine learning when we deal with images and we do this quantization step is a bit more data driven."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "So rather than have some sort of Fourier basis for how frequencies appear in the natural world, we actually just use the statistics of the images and then quantize them based on the statistics, much like you do in words, right?"}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So common substrings are allocated a token and images is very similar."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "But there's no connection."}, {"time": 2376, "text": "The token space, if you think of, oh, like the tokens are an integer and in the end of the day."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "So now like we work on, maybe we have about, let's say, I don't know the exact numbers, but let's say 10,000 tokens for text, right?"}, {"time": 2391, "text": "Certainly more than characters because we have groups of characters and so on."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "So from one to 10,000, those are representing all the language and the words we'll see."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "And then images occupy the next set of integers."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "So they're completely independent, right?"}, {"time": 2405, "text": "So from 10,001 to 20,000, those are the tokens that represent these other modality images."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "And that is an interesting aspect that makes it orthogonal."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "So what connects these concepts is the data, right?"}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Once you have a data set, for instance, that captions images that tells you, oh, this is someone playing a frisbee on a green field."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "Now the model will need to predict the tokens from the text green field to then the pixels."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "And that will start making the connections between the tokens."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "So these connections happen as the algorithm learns."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "And then the last, if we think of these integers, the first few are words, the next few are images."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "In Gato, we also allocated the highest order of integers to actions, right?"}, {"time": 2456, "text": "Which we discretize and actions are very diverse, right?"}, {"time": 2459, "text": "In Atari, there's, I don't know if 17 discrete actions."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "In robotics, actions might be torques and forces that we apply."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "So we just use kind of similar ideas to compress these actions into tokens."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "And then we just, that's how we map now all the space to these sequence of integers."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "But they occupy different space and what connects them is then the learning algorithm."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "That's where the magic happens."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "So the modalities are orthogonal to each other in token space."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "So in the input, everything you add, you add extra tokens."}, {"time": 2495, "text": "And then you're shoving all of that into one place."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "Yes, the transformer."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "And that transformer, that transformer tries to look at this gigantic token space and tries to form some kind of representation, some kind of unique wisdom about all of these different modalities."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "If you were to sort of like put your psychoanalysis hat on and try to psychoanalyze this neural network, is it schizophrenic?"}, {"time": 2531, "text": "Does it try to, given this very few weights, represent multiple disjoint things and somehow have them not interfere with each other?"}, {"time": 2542, "text": "Or is it somehow building on the joint strength, on whatever is common to all the different modalities?"}, {"time": 2551, "text": "Like what, if you were to ask a question, is it schizophrenic or is it of one mind?"}, {"time": 2558, "text": "I mean, it is one mind and it's actually the simplest algorithm, which that's kind of in a way how it feels like the field hasn't changed since back propagation and gradient descent was purpose for learning neural networks."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "So there is obviously details on the architecture."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "This has evolved."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "The current iteration is still the transformer, which is a powerful sequence modeling architecture."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "But then the goal of this, you know, setting these weights to predict the data is essentially the same as basically I could describe."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "I mean, we described a few years ago, Alpha star language modeling and so on, right?"}, {"time": 2601, "text": "We take, let's say an Atari game, we map it to a string of numbers that will all be probably image space and action space interleaved."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "And all we're gonna do is say, okay, given the numbers, you know, 10,001, 10,004, 10,005, the next number that comes is 20,006, which is in the action space."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "And you're just optimizing these weights via very simple gradients."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "Like, you know, mathematical is almost the most boring algorithm you could imagine."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "We settle the weights so that given this particular instance, these weights are set to maximize the probability of having seen this particular sequence of integers for this particular game."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "And then the algorithm does this for many, many, many iterations, looking at different modalities, different games, right?"}, {"time": 2657, "text": "That's the mixture of the dataset we discussed."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "So in a way, it's a very simple algorithm and the weights, right, they're all shared, right?"}, {"time": 2667, "text": "So in terms of, is it focusing on one modality or not?"}, {"time": 2670, "text": "The intermediate weights that are converting from these input of integers to the target integer you're predicting next, those weights certainly are common."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "And then the way that tokenization happens, there is a special place in the neural network, which is we map this integer, like number 10,001, to a vector of real numbers."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "Like real numbers, we can optimize them with gradient descent, right?"}, {"time": 2696, "text": "The functions we learn are actually surprisingly differentiable."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "That's why we compute gradients."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "So this step is the only one that this orthogonality you mentioned applies."}, {"time": 2706, "text": "So mapping a certain token for text or image or actions, each of these tokens gets its own little vector of real numbers that represents this."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "If you look at the field back many years ago, people were talking about word vectors or word embeddings."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "These are the same."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "We have word vectors or embeddings."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "We have image vector or embeddings and action vector of embeddings."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "And the beauty here is that as you train this model, if you visualize these little vectors, it might be that they start aligning even though they're independent parameters."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "There could be anything, but then it might be that you take the word gato or cat, which maybe is common enough that it actually has its own token."}, {"time": 2750, "text": "And then you take pixels that have a cat and you might start seeing that these vectors look like they align, right?"}, {"time": 2757, "text": "So by learning from this vast amount of data, the model is realizing the potential connections between these modalities."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "Now, I will say there will be another way, at least in part, to not have these different vectors for each different modality."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "For instance, when I tell you about actions in certain space, I'm defining actions by words, right?"}, {"time": 2782, "text": "So you could imagine a world in which I'm not learning that the action app in Atari is its own number."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "The action app in Atari maybe is literally the word or the sentence app in Atari, right?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "And that would mean we now leverage much more from the language."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "This is not what we did here, but certainly it might make these connections much easier to learn and also to teach the model to correct its own actions and so on, right?"}, {"time": 2811, "text": "So all these to say that gato is indeed the beginning, that it is a radical idea to do this this way, but there's probably a lot more to be done and the results to be more impressive, not only through scale, but also through some new research that will come hopefully in the years to come."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "So just to elaborate quickly, you mean one possible next step or one of the paths that you might take next is doing the tokenization fundamentally as a kind of linguistic communication."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "So like you convert even images into language."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "So doing something like a crude semantic segmentation, trying to just assign a bunch of words to an image that like have almost like a dumb entity explaining as much as it can about the image."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "And so you convert that into words and then you convert games into words and then you provide the context in words and all of it."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "And eventually getting to a point where everybody agrees with Noam Chomsky that language is actually at the core of everything."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "That's it's the base layer of intelligence and consciousness and all that kind of stuff, okay."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "You mentioned early on like size, it's hard to grow."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "What did you mean by that?"}, {"time": 2892, "text": "Because we're talking about scale might change."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "There might be, and we'll talk about this too, like there's a emergent, there's certain things about these neural networks that are emergent."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "So certain like performance we can see only with scale and there's some kind of threshold of scale."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "So why is it hard to grow something like this Meow network?"}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So the Meow network, it's not hard to grow if you retrain it."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "What's hard is, well, we have now 1 billion parameters."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "We train them for a while."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "We spend some amount of work towards building these weights that are an amazing initial brain for doing these kinds of tasks we care about."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "Could we reuse the weights and expand to a larger brain?"}, {"time": 2943, "text": "And that is extraordinarily hard, but also exciting from a research perspective and a practical perspective point of view, right?"}, {"time": 2952, "text": "So there's this notion of modularity in software engineering and we starting to see some examples and work that leverages modularity."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "In fact, if we go back one step from Gato to a work that I would say train much larger, much more capable network called Flamingo."}, {"time": 2972, "text": "Flamingo did not deal with actions, but it definitely dealt with images in an interesting way, kind of akin to what Gato did, but slightly different technique for tokenizing, but we don't need to go into that detail."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "But what Flamingo also did, which Gato didn't do, and that just happens because these projects, they're different, it's a bit of like the exploratory nature of research, which is great."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "The research behind these projects is also modular."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "And it has to be, right?"}, {"time": 3002, "text": "We need to have creativity and sometimes you need to protect pockets of people, researchers and so on."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "By we, you mean humans."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "And also in particular researchers and maybe even further DeepMind or other such labs."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "And then the neural networks themselves."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "So it's modularity all the way down."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "All the way down."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "So the way that we did modularity very beautifully in Flamingo is we took Chinchilla, which is a language only model, not an agent, if we think of actions being necessary for agency."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "So we took Chinchilla, we took the weights of Chinchilla and then we froze them."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "We said, these don't change."}, {"time": 3044, "text": "We train them to be very good at predicting the next word."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "It's a very good language model, state of the art at the time you release it, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "We're going to add a capability to see, right?"}, {"time": 3055, "text": "We are going to add the ability to see to this language model."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "So we're going to attach small pieces of neural networks at the right places in the model."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "It's almost like I'm injecting the network with some weights and some substructures in a good way, right?"}, {"time": 3072, "text": "So you need the research to say, what is effective?"}, {"time": 3075, "text": "How do you add this capability without destroying others, et cetera."}, {"time": 3078, "text": "So we created a small sub network initialized, not from random, but actually from self supervised learning that a model that understands vision in general."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "And then we took data sets that connect the two modalities, vision and language."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "And then we froze the main part, the largest portion of the network, which was Chinchilla, that is 70 billion parameters."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "And then we added a few more parameters on top, trained from scratch, and then some others that were pre trained with the capacity to see, like it was not tokenization in the way I described for Gato, but it's a similar idea."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "And then we trained the whole system."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "Parts of it were frozen, parts of it were new."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "And all of a sudden, we developed Flamingo, which is an amazing model that is essentially, I mean, describing it is a chatbot where you can also upload images and start conversing about images."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "But it's also kind of a dialogue style chatbot."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "So the input is images and text and the output is text."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "How many parameters, you said 70 billion for Chinchilla?"}, {"time": 3151, "text": "Yeah, Chinchilla is 70 billion."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "And then the ones we add on top, which kind of almost is almost like a way to overwrite its little activations so that when it sees vision, it does kind of a correct computation of what it's seeing, mapping it back towards, so to speak."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "That adds an extra 10 billion parameters, right?"}, {"time": 3170, "text": "So it's total 80 billion, the largest one we released."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And then you train it on a few datasets that contain vision and language."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "And once you interact with the model, you start seeing that you can upload an image and start sort of having a dialogue about the image, which is actually not something, it's very similar and akin to what we saw in language only."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "These prompting abilities that it has, you can teach it a new vision task, right?"}, {"time": 3222, "text": "We can upload, I think one of the tweets talking about Twitter was this image from Obama that is placing a weight and someone is kind of weighting themselves and it's kind of a joke style image."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "And it's notable because I think Andrew Carpati a few years ago said, no computer vision system can understand the subtlety of this joke in this image, all the things that go on."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "And so what we try to do, and it's very anecdotally, I mean, this is not a proof that we solved this issue, but it just shows that you can upload now this image and start conversing with the model, trying to make out if it gets that there's a joke because the person weighting themselves doesn't see that someone behind is making the weight higher and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "So it's a fascinating capability and it comes from this key idea of modularity where we took a frozen brain and we just added a new capability."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "So the question is, should we, so in a way you can see even from DeepMind, we have Flamingo that this moderate approach and thus could leverage the scale a bit more reasonably because we didn't need to retrain a system from scratch."}, {"time": 3292, "text": "And on the other hand, we had Gato, which used the same data sets, but then he trained it from scratch, right?"}, {"time": 3297, "text": "And so I guess big question for the community is should we train from scratch or should we embrace modularity?"}, {"time": 3304, "text": "And this lies, like this goes back to modularity as a way to grow, but reuse seems like natural and it was very effective, certainly."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "Yeah, so that vision is beautiful."}, {"time": 3359, "text": "I think there's still the question about within single modalities, like Chinchilla was reused, but now if we train a next iteration of language models, are we gonna use Chinchilla or not?"}, {"time": 3371, "text": "Yeah, how do you swap out Chinchilla?"}, {"time": 3373, "text": "Right, so there's still big questions, but that idea is actually really akin to software engineering, which we're not reimplementing libraries from scratch, we're reusing and then building ever more amazing things, including neural networks with software that we're reusing."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "So I think this idea of modularity, I like it, I think it's here to stay and that's also why I mentioned it's just the beginning, not the end."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "You've mentioned meta learning, so given this promise of Gato, can we try to redefine this term that's almost akin to consciousness because it means different things to different people throughout the history of artificial intelligence, but what do you think meta learning is and looks like now in the five years, 10 years, will it look like the system like Gato, but scaled?"}, {"time": 3423, "text": "What's your sense of, what does meta learning look like?"}, {"time": 3427, "text": "Do you think with all the wisdom we've learned so far?"}, {"time": 3431, "text": "Maybe it's good to give another data point looking backwards rather than forward."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "So when we talk in 2019, meta learning meant something that has changed mostly through the revolution of GPT3 and beyond."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "So what meta learning meant at the time was driven by what benchmarks people care about in meta learning."}, {"time": 3458, "text": "And the benchmarks were about a capability to learn about object identities."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "So it was very much overfitted to vision and object classification."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "And the part that was meta about that was that, oh, we're not just learning a thousand categories that ImageNet tells us to learn."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "We're going to learn object categories that can be defined when we interact with the model."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "So it's interesting to see the evolution, right?"}, {"time": 3486, "text": "The way this started was we have a special language that was a data set, a small data set that we prompted the model with saying, hey, here is a new classification task."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "I'll give you one image and the name, which was an integer at the time of the image and a different image and so on."}, {"time": 3505, "text": "So you have a small prompt in the form of a data set, a machine learning data set."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "And then you got then a system that could then predict or classify these objects that you just defined kind of on the fly."}, {"time": 3520, "text": "So fast forward, it was revealed that language models are few shot learners."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "That's the title of the paper."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "So very good title."}, {"time": 3530, "text": "Sometimes titles are really good."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "So this one is really, really good."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "Because that's the point of GPT3 that showed that, look, sure, we can focus on object classification and what meta learning means within the space of learning object categories."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "This goes beyond, or before rather, to also Omniglot, before ImageNet and so on."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "So there's a few benchmarks."}, {"time": 3551, "text": "To now, all of a sudden, we're a bit unlocked from benchmarks."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "And through language, we can define tasks."}, {"time": 3557, "text": "So we're literally telling the model some logical task or a little thing that we wanted to do."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "We prompt it much like we did before, but now we prompt it through natural language."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "And then not perfectly, I mean, these models have failure modes and that's fine, but these models then are now doing a new task."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "And so they meta learn this new capability."}, {"time": 3580, "text": "Now, that's where we are now."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "Flamingo expanded this to visual and language, but it basically has the same abilities."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "You can teach it, for instance, an emergent property was that you can take pictures of numbers and then do arithmetic with the numbers just by teaching it, oh, when I show you 3 plus 6, I want you to output 9."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "And you show it a few examples, and now it does that."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "So it went way beyond the image net categorization of images that we were a bit stuck maybe before this revelation moment that happened in 2000."}, {"time": 3619, "text": "I believe it was 19, but it was after we checked."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "In that way, it has solved meta learning as was previously defined."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "Yes, it expanded what it meant."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "So that's what you say, what does it mean?"}, {"time": 3629, "text": "So it's an evolving term."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "But here is maybe now looking forward, looking at what's happening, obviously, in the community with more modalities, what we can expect."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "And I would certainly hope to see the following."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "And this is a pretty drastic hope."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "But in five years, maybe we chat again."}, {"time": 3651, "text": "And we have a system, a set of weights that we can teach it to play StarCraft."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "Maybe not at the level of AlphaStar, but play StarCraft, a complex game, we teach it through interactions to prompting."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "You can certainly prompt a system."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "That's what Gata shows to play some simple Atari games."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "So imagine if you start talking to a system, teaching it a new game, showing it examples of in this particular game, this user did something good."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "Maybe the system can even play and ask you questions."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "Say, hey, I played this game."}, {"time": 3687, "text": "I just played this game."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "Did I do well?"}, {"time": 3689, "text": "Can you teach me more?"}, {"time": 3690, "text": "So five, maybe to 10 years, these capabilities, or what meta learning means, will be much more interactive, much more rich, and through domains that we were specializing."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "So you see the difference."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "We built AlphaStar Specialized to play StarCraft."}, {"time": 3707, "text": "The algorithms were general, but the weights were specialized."},

Wikipedia page of StarCraft."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "This is in the horizon."}, {"time": 3726, "text": "And obviously, there are details that need to be filled and research needs to be done."},

"The system might tell us to give it feedback after it maybe makes mistakes or it loses a game."}, {"time": 3744, "text": "But it's nonetheless very exciting because if you think about this this way, the benchmarks are already there."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "We just repurposed the benchmarks."}, {"time": 3753, "text": "So in a way, I like to map the space of what maybe AGI means to say, OK, we went 101% performance in Go, in Chess, in StarCraft."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "The next iteration might be 20% performance across, quote unquote, all tasks."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "And even if it's not as good, it's fine."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "We have ways to also measure progress because we have those specialized agents and so on."}, {"time": 3784, "text": "So this is, to me, very exciting."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "And these next iteration models are definitely hinting at that direction of progress, which hopefully we can have."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "There are obviously some things that could go wrong in terms of we might not have the tools."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "Maybe transformers are not enough."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "There are some breakthroughs to come, which makes the field more exciting to people like me as well, of course."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "But that's, if you ask me, five to 10 years, you might see these models that start to look more like weights that are already trained."}, {"time": 3816, "text": "And then it's more about teaching or make their meta learn what you're trying to induce in terms of tasks and so on, well beyond the simple now tasks we're starting to see emerge like small arithmetic tasks and so on."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "So a few questions around that."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "So that kind of teaching, interactive, so it's beyond prompting."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "So it's interacting with the neural network."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "That's different than the training process."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "So it's different than the optimization over differentiable functions."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "This is already trained."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "And now you're teaching, I mean, it's almost akin to the brain, the neurons already set with their connections."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "On top of that, you're now using that infrastructure to build up further knowledge."}, {"time": 3873, "text": "So that's a really interesting distinction that's actually not obvious from a software engineering perspective, that there's a line to be drawn."}, {"time": 3882, "text": "Because you always think for a neural network to learn, it has to be retrained, trained and retrained."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "And prompting is a way of teaching."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "And you'll now work a little bit of context about whatever the heck you're trying it to do."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "So you can maybe expand this prompting capability by making it interact."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "By the way, this is not, if you look at way back at different ways to tackle even classification tasks."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "So this comes from longstanding literature in machine learning."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "What I'm suggesting could sound to some like a bit like nearest neighbor."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "So nearest neighbor is almost the simplest algorithm that does not require learning."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "So it has this interesting, you don't need to compute gradients."}, {"time": 3934, "text": "And what nearest neighbor does is you, quote unquote, have a data set or upload a data set."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "And then all you need to do is a way to measure distance between points."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "And then to classify a new point, you're just simply computing, what's the closest point in this massive amount of data?"}, {"time": 3951, "text": "And that's my answer."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "So you can think of prompting in a way as you're uploading not just simple points."}, {"time": 3958, "text": "And the metric is not the distance between the images or something simple."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "It's something that you compute that's much more advanced."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "But in a way, it's very similar."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "You simply are uploading some knowledge to this pre trained system in nearest neighbor."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "Maybe the metric is learned or not, but you don't need to further train it."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "And then now you immediately get a classifier out of this."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "Now it's just an evolution of that concept, very classical concept in machine learning, which is just learning through what's the closest point, closest by some distance, and that's it."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "It's an evolution of that."}, {"time": 3996, "text": "And I will say how I saw meta learning when we worked on a few ideas in 2016 was precisely through the lens of nearest neighbor, which is very common in computer vision community."}, {"time": 4010, "text": "There's a very active area of research about how do you compute the distance between two images."}, {"time": 4015, "text": "But if you have a good distance metric, you also have a good classifier."}, {"time": 4019, "text": "All I'm saying is now these distances and the points are not just images."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "They're like words or sequences of words and images and actions that teach you something new."}, {"time": 4030, "text": "But it might be that technique wise those come back."}, {"time": 4034, "text": "And I will say that it's not necessarily true that you might not ever train the weights a bit further."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "Some aspect of meta learning, some techniques in meta learning do actually do a bit of fine tuning as it's called."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "They train the weights a little bit when they get a new task."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "So as I call the how or how we're going to achieve this, as a deep learner, I'm very skeptic."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "We're going to try a few things, whether it's a bit of training, adding a few parameters, thinking of these as nearest neighbor, or just simply thinking of there's a sequence of words, it's a prefix."}, {"time": 4070, "text": "And that's the new classifier."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "There's the beauty of research."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "But what's important is that is a good goal in itself that I see as very worthwhile pursuing for the next stages of not only meta learning."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "I think this is basically what's exciting about machine learning period to me."}, {"time": 4091, "text": "Well, and the interactive aspect of that is also very interesting, the interactive version of nearest neighbor to help you pull out the classifier from this giant thing."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "OK, is this the way we can go in 5, 10 plus years from any task, sorry, from many tasks to any task?"}, {"time": 4119, "text": "What does it need to be actually trained on?"}, {"time": 4122, "text": "Which point is the network had enough?"}, {"time": 4125, "text": "So what does a network need to learn about this world in order to be able to perform any task?"}, {"time": 4132, "text": "Is it just as simple as language, image, and action?"}, {"time": 4137, "text": "Or do you need some set of representative images?"}, {"time": 4142, "text": "Like if you only see land images, will you know anything about underwater?"}, {"time": 4146, "text": "Is that some fundamentally different?"}, {"time": 4149, "text": "I mean, those are open questions, I would say."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "I mean, the way you put, let me maybe further your example."}, {"time": 4155, "text": "If all you see is land images but you're reading all about land and water worlds but in books, imagine, would that be enough?"}, {"time": 4167, "text": "But I guess maybe you can join us if you want in our quest to find this."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "That's precisely."}, {"time": 4173, "text": "Water world, yeah."}, {"time": 4174, "text": "Yes, that's precisely, I mean, the beauty of research."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "And that's the research business we're in, I guess, is to figure this out and ask the right questions and then iterate with the whole community, publishing findings and so on."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "But yeah, this is a question."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "It's not the only question, but it's certainly, as you ask, on my mind constantly."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "And so we'll need to wait for maybe the, let's say, five years, let's hope it's not 10, to see what are the answers."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "Some people will largely believe in unsupervised or self supervised learning of single modalities and then crossing them."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "Some people might think end to end learning is the answer."}, {"time": 4221, "text": "Modularity is maybe the answer."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "So we don't know, but we're just definitely excited to find out."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "But it feels like this is the right time and we're at the beginning of this journey."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "We're finally ready to do these kind of general big models and agents."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "What do you sort of specific technical thing about Gato, Flamingo, Chinchilla, Gopher, any of these that is especially beautiful, that was surprising, maybe?"}, {"time": 4251, "text": "Is there something that just jumps out at you?"}, {"time": 4255, "text": "Of course, there's the general thing of like, you didn't think it was possible and then you realize it's possible in terms of the generalizability across modalities and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4265, "text": "Or maybe how small of a network, relatively speaking, Gato is, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "But is there some weird little things that were surprising?"}, {"time": 4275, "text": "Look, I'll give you an answer that's very important because maybe people don't quite realize this, but the teams behind these efforts, the actual humans, that's maybe the surprising in an obviously positive way."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "So anytime you see these breakthroughs, I mean, it's easy to map it to a few people."}, {"time": 4297, "text": "There's people that are great at explaining things and so on."}, {"time": 4299, "text": "And that's very nice."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "But maybe the learnings or the method learnings that I get as a human about this is, sure, we can move forward."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "But the surprising bit is how important are all the pieces of these projects, how do they come together?"}, {"time": 4320, "text": "So I'll give you maybe some of the ingredients of success that are common across these, but not the obvious ones on machine learning."}, {"time": 4328, "text": "I can always also give you those."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "But basically, there is engineering is critical."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "So very good engineering because ultimately we're collecting data sets, right?"}, {"time": 4343, "text": "So the engineering of data and then of deploying the models at scale into some compute cluster that cannot go understated, that is a huge factor of success."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "And it's hard to believe that details matter so much."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "We would like to believe that it's true that there is more and more of a standard formula, as I was saying, like this recipe that works for everything."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "But then when you zoom into each of these projects, then you realize the devil is indeed in the details."}, {"time": 4377, "text": "And then the teams have to work together towards these goals."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "So engineering of data and obviously clusters and large scale is very important."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "And then one that is often not, maybe nowadays it is more clear is benchmark progress, right?"}, {"time": 4397, "text": "So we're talking here about multiple months of tens of researchers and people that are trying to organize the research and so on working together."}, {"time": 4408, "text": "And you don't know that you can get there."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "I mean, this is the beauty."}, {"time": 4414, "text": "If you're not risking to trying to do something that feels impossible, you're not going to get there."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "But you need a way to measure progress."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "So the benchmarks that you build are critical."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "I've seen this beautifully play out in many projects."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "I mean, maybe the one I've seen it more consistently, which means we establish the metric, actually the community did."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "And then we leverage that massively is alpha fold."}, {"time": 4441, "text": "This is a project where the data, the metrics were all there."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "And all it took was, and it's easier said than done, an amazing team working not to try to find some incremental improvement and publish, which is one way to do research that is valid, but aim very high and work literally for years to iterate over that process."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "And working for years with the team, I mean, it is tricky that also happened to happen partly during a pandemic and so on."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "So I think my meta learning from all this is the teams are critical to the success."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "And then if now going to the machine learning, the part that's surprising is so we like architectures like neural networks."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "And I would say this was a very rapidly evolving field until the transformer came."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "So attention might indeed be all you need, which is the title, also a good title, although in hindsight is good."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "I don't think at the time I thought this is a great title for a paper."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "But that architecture is proving that the dream of modeling sequences of any bytes, there is something there that will stick."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "And I think these advance in architectures in how neural networks are architecture to do what they do."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "It's been hard to find one that has been so stable and relatively has changed very little since it was invented five or so years ago."}, {"time": 4533, "text": "So that is a surprising, is a surprise that keeps recurring into other projects."}, {"time": 4538, "text": "Try to, on a philosophical or technical level, introspect, what is the magic of attention?"}, {"time": 4545, "text": "What is attention?"}, {"time": 4547, "text": "That's attention in people that study cognition, so human attention."}, {"time": 4552, "text": "I think there's giant wars over what attention means, how it works in the human mind."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "So there's very simple looks at what attention is in a neural network from the days of attention is all you need."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "But do you think there's a general principle that's really powerful here?"}, {"time": 4568, "text": "Yeah, so a distinction between transformers and LSTMs, which were what came before."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "And there was a transitional period where you could use both."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "In fact, when we talked about AlphaStar, we used transformers and LSTMs."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "So it was still the beginning of transformers."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "But LSTMs were also very powerful sequence models."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "So the power of the transformer is that it has built in what we call an inductive bias of attention that makes the model."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "When you think of a sequence of integers, like we discussed this before, this is a sequence of words."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "When you have to do very hard tasks over these words, this could be we're going to translate a whole paragraph or we're going to predict the next paragraph given 10 paragraphs before."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "There's some loose intuition from how we do it as a human that is very nicely mimicked and replicated structurally speaking in the transformer, which is this idea of you're looking for something."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "So you're sort of when you just read a piece of text, now you're thinking what comes next."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "You might want to relook at the text or look it from scratch."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "I mean, literally is because there's no recurrence."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "You're just thinking what comes next."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "And it's almost hypothesis driven."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "So if I'm thinking the next word that I write is cat or dog, the way the transformer works almost philosophically is it has these two hypotheses."}, {"time": 4672, "text": "Is it going to be cat or is it going to be dog?"}, {"time": 4675, "text": "And then it says, OK, if it's cat, I'm going to look for certain words."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "Not necessarily cat, although cat is an obvious word you would look in the past to see whether it makes more sense to output cat or dog."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "And then it does some very deep computation over the words and beyond."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "So it combines the words, but it has the query as we call it that is cat."}, {"time": 4698, "text": "And then similarly for dog."}, {"time": 4700, "text": "And so it's a very computational way to think about, look, if I'm thinking deeply about text, I need to go back to look at all of the text, attend over it."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "But it's not just attention."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "What is guiding the attention?"}, {"time": 4714, "text": "And that was the key insight from an earlier paper is not how far away is it?"}, {"time": 4719, "text": "I mean, how far away is it is important?"}, {"time": 4720, "text": "What did I just write about?"}, {"time": 4722, "text": "That's critical."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "But what you wrote about 10 pages ago might also be critical."}, {"time": 4728, "text": "So you're looking not positionally, but content wise."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "And transformers have this beautiful way to query for certain content and pull it out in a compressed way."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "So then you can make a more informed decision."}, {"time": 4742, "text": "I mean, that's one way to explain transformers."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "But I think it's a very powerful inductive bias."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "There might be some details that might change over time, but I think that is what makes transformers so much more powerful than the recurrent networks that were more recency bias based, which obviously works in some tasks, but it has major flaws."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "Transformer itself has flaws."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "And I think the main one, the main challenge is these prompts that we just were talking about, they can be 1,000 words long."}, {"time": 4778, "text": "But if I'm teaching you StarGraph, I'll have to show you videos."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "I'll have to point you to whole Wikipedia articles about the game."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "We'll have to interact probably as you play."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "You'll ask me questions."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "The context required for us to achieve me being a good teacher to you on the game as you would want to do it with a model, I think goes well beyond the current capabilities."}, {"time": 4801, "text": "So the question is, how do we benchmark this?"}, {"time": 4803, "text": "And then how do we change the structure of the architectures?"}, {"time": 4807, "text": "I think there's ideas on both sides, but we'll have to see empirically, obviously, what ends up working."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "And as you talked about, some of the ideas could be keeping the constraint of that length in place, but then forming hierarchical representations to where you can start being much clever in how you use those 1,000 tokens."}, {"time": 4832, "text": "But it also is possible that this attentional mechanism where you basically, you don't have a recency bias, but you look more generally, you make it learnable."}, {"time": 4842, "text": "The mechanism in which way you look back into the past, you make that learnable."}, {"time": 4846, "text": "It's also possible we're at the very beginning of that because that, you might become smarter and smarter in the way you query the past."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "So recent past and distant past and maybe very, very distant past."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "So almost like the attention mechanism will have to improve and evolve as good as the tokenization mechanism so you can represent long term memory somehow."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "And I mean, hierarchies are very, I mean, it's a very nice word that sounds appealing."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "There's lots of work adding hierarchy to the memories."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "In practice, it does seem like we keep coming back to the main formula or main architecture."}, {"time": 4893, "text": "That sometimes tells us something."}, {"time": 4895, "text": "There is such a sentence that a friend of mine told me, like, whether it wants to work or not."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "So Transformer was clearly an idea that wanted to work."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "And then I think there's some principles we believe will be needed."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "But finding the exact details, details matter so much."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "That's going to be tricky."}, {"time": 4914, "text": "I love the idea that there's like you as a human being, you want some ideas to work."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "And then there's the model that wants some ideas to work and you get to have a conversation to see which more likely the model will win in the end."}, {"time": 4930, "text": "Because it's the one, you don't have to do any work."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "The model is the one that has to do the work."}, {"time": 4934, "text": "So you should listen to the model."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "And I really love this idea that you talked about the humans in this picture."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "If I could just briefly ask, one is you're saying the benchmarks about the modular humans working on this, the benchmarks providing a sturdy ground of a wish to do these things that seem impossible."}, {"time": 4954, "text": "They give you, in the darkest of times, give you hope because little signs of improvement."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "Like somehow you're not lost if you have metrics to measure your improvement."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "And then there's other aspect."}, {"time": 4970, "text": "You said elsewhere and here today, like titles matter."}, {"time": 4976, "text": "I wonder how much humans matter in the evolution of all of this, meaning individual humans."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "Something about their interactions, something about their ideas, how much they change the direction of all of this."}, {"time": 4992, "text": "Like if you change the humans in this picture, is it that the model is sitting there and it wants some idea to work?"}, {"time": 5002, "text": "Or is it the humans, or maybe the model is providing you 20 ideas that could work."}, {"time": 5007, "text": "And depending on the humans you pick, they're going to be able to hear some of those ideas."}, {"time": 5013, "text": "Because you're now directing all of deep learning and deep mind, you get to interact with a lot of projects, a lot of brilliant researchers."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "How much variability is created by the humans in all of this?"}, {"time": 5024, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I do believe humans matter a lot, at the very least at the time scale of years on when things are happening and what's the sequencing of it."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "So you get to interact with people that, I mean, you mentioned this."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "Some people really want some idea to work and they'll persist."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "And then some other people might be more practical, like I don't care what idea works."}, {"time": 5052, "text": "I care about cracking protein folding."}, {"time": 5056, "text": "And at least these two kind of seem opposite sides."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "We need both."}, {"time": 5062, "text": "And we've clearly had both historically, and that made certain things happen earlier or later."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "So definitely humans involved in all of this endeavor have had, I would say, years of change or of ordering how things have happened, which breakthroughs came before, which other breakthroughs, and so on."}, {"time": 5083, "text": "So certainly that does happen."}, {"time": 5085, "text": "And so one other, maybe one other axis of distinction is what I called, and this is most commonly used in reinforcement learning, is the exploration exploitation trade off as well."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "It's not exactly what I meant, although quite related."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "So when you start trying to help others, like you become a bit more of a mentor to a large group of people, be it a project or the deep learning team or something, or even in the community when you interact with people in conferences and so on, you're identifying quickly some things that are explorative or exploitative."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "And it's tempting to try to guide people, obviously."}, {"time": 5130, "text": "I mean, that's what makes our experience."}, {"time": 5133, "text": "We bring it, and we try to shape things sometimes wrongly."}, {"time": 5136, "text": "And there's many times that I've been wrong in the past."}, {"time": 5140, "text": "But it would be wrong to dismiss any sort of the research styles that I'm observing."}, {"time": 5149, "text": "And I often get asked, well, you're in industry, right?"}, {"time": 5152, "text": "So we do have access to large compute scale and so on."}, {"time": 5155, "text": "So there are certain kinds of research I almost feel like we need to do responsibly and so on."}, {"time": 5161, "text": "But it is, Carlos, we have the particle accelerator here, so to speak, in physics."}, {"time": 5166,

same time, I look at many advances, including attention, which was discovered in Montreal initially because of lack of compute, right?"}, {"time": 5182, "text": "So we were working on sequence to sequence with my friends over at Google Brain at the time."}, {"time": 5187, "text": "And we were using, I think, eight GPUs, which was somehow a lot at the time."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "And then I think Montreal was a bit more limited in the scale."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "But then they discovered this content based attention concept that then has obviously triggered things like Transformer."}, {"time": 5203, "text": "Not everything obviously starts Transformer."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "There's always a history that is important to recognize because then you can make sure that then those who might feel now, well, we don't have so much compute, you need to then help them optimize that kind of research that might actually produce amazing change."}, {"time": 5224, "text": "Perhaps it's not as short term as some of these advancements or perhaps it's a different time scale."}, {"time": 5229, "text": "But the people and the diversity of the field is quite critical that we maintain it."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "And at times, especially mixed a bit with hype or other things, it's a bit tricky to be observing maybe too much of the same thinking across the board."}, {"time": 5247, "text": "But the humans definitely are critical."}, {"time": 5250, "text": "And I can think of quite a few personal examples where also someone told me something that had a huge effect onto some idea."}, {"time": 5260, "text": "And then that's why I'm saying at least in terms of years, probably some things do happen."}, {"time": 5266, "text": "And it's also fascinating how constraints somehow are essential for innovation."}, {"time": 5271, "text": "And the other thing you mentioned about engineering, I have a sneaking suspicion."}, {"time": 5274, "text": "Maybe I over, my love is with engineering."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "So I have a sneaky suspicion that all the genius, a large percentage of the genius is in the tiny details of engineering."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "So I think we like to think our genius, the genius is in the big ideas."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "I have a sneaking suspicion that because I've seen the genius of details, of engineering details, make the night and day difference."}, {"time": 5308, "text": "And I wonder if those kind of have a ripple effect over time."}, {"time": 5312, "text": "So that too, so that's sort of taking the engineering perspective that sometimes that quiet innovation at the level of an individual engineer or maybe at the small scale of a few engineers can make all the difference."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "Because we're working on computers that are scaled across large groups, that one engineering decision can lead to ripple effects."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "Yeah, I mean, engineering, there's also kind of a historical, it might be a bit random."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "Because if you think of the history of how especially deep learning and neural networks took off, feels like a bit random because GPUs happened to be there at the right time for a different purpose, which was to play video games."}, {"time": 5360, "text": "So even the engineering that goes into the hardware and it might have a time, the time frame might be very different."}, {"time": 5368, "text": "I mean, the GPUs were evolved throughout many years where we didn't even were looking at that."}, {"time": 5373, "text": "So even at that level, that revolution, so to speak, the ripples are like, we'll see when they stop."}, {"time": 5382, "text": "But in terms of thinking of why is this happening, I think that when I try to categorize it in sort of things that might not be so obvious, I mean, clearly there's a hardware revolution."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "We are surfing thanks to that."}, {"time": 5398, "text": "Data centers as well."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "I mean, data centers are like, I mean, at Google, for instance, obviously they're serving Google."}, {"time": 5404, "text": "But there's also now thanks to that and to have built such amazing data centers, we can train these models."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "Software is an important one."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "I think if I look at the state of how I had to implement things to implement my ideas, how I discarded ideas because they were too hard to implement."}, {"time": 5423, "text": "Yeah, clearly the times have changed."}, {"time": 5425, "text": "And thankfully, we are in a much better software position as well."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "And then, I mean, obviously there's research that happens at scale and more people enter the field."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "That's great to see."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "But it's almost enabled by these other things."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "And last but not least is also data, right?"}, {"time": 5440, "text": "Curating data sets, labeling data sets, these benchmarks we think about."}, {"time": 5444, "text": "Maybe we'll want to have all the benchmarks in one system."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "But it's still very valuable that someone put the thought and the time and the vision to build certain benchmarks."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "We've seen progress thanks to."}, {"time": 5456, "text": "But we're going to repurpose the benchmarks."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "That's the beauty of Atari is like we solved it in a way."}, {"time": 5464, "text": "But we use it in Gato."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "It was critical."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "And I'm sure there's still a lot more to do thanks to that amazing benchmark that someone took the time to put, even though at the time maybe, oh, you have to think what's the next iteration of architectures."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "That's what maybe the field recognizes."}, {"time": 5481, "text": "But that's another thing we need to balance in terms of humans behind."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "We need to recognize all these aspects because they're all critical."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "And we tend to think of the genius, the scientist, and so on."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "But I'm glad I know you have a strong engineering background."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "But also, I'm a lover of data."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "And the pushback on the engineering comment ultimately could be the creators of benchmarks who have the most impact."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "Andrej Karpathy, who you mentioned, has recently been talking a lot of trash about ImageNet, which he has the right to do because of how critical he is about ImageNet, how essential he is to the development and the success of deep learning around ImageNet."}, {"time": 5521, "text": "And he's saying that that's actually that benchmark is holding back the field."}, {"time": 5525, "text": "Because I mean, especially in his context on Tesla Autopilot, that's looking at real world behavior of a system."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "There's something fundamentally missing about ImageNet that doesn't capture the real worldness of things."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "That we need to have data sets, benchmarks that have the unpredictability, the edge cases, whatever the heck it is that makes the real world so difficult to operate in."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "We need to have benchmarks of that."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "But just to think about the impact of ImageNet as a benchmark, and that really puts a lot of emphasis on the importance of a benchmark, both sort of internally a deep mind and as a community."}, {"time": 5566, "text": "So one is coming in from within, like, how do I create a benchmark for me to mark and make progress?"}, {"time": 5575, "text": "And how do I make benchmark for the community to mark and push progress?"}, {"time": 5582, "text": "You have this amazing paper you coauthored, a survey paper called Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "It has, again, the philosophy here that I'd love to ask you about."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "What's the intuition about the phenomena of emergence in neural networks transformed as language models?"}, {"time": 5600, "text": "Is there a magic threshold beyond which we start to see certain performance?"}, {"time": 5607, "text": "And is that different from task to task?"}, {"time": 5609, "text": "Is that us humans just being poetic and romantic?"}, {"time": 5612, "text": "Or is there literally some level at which we start to see breakthrough performance?"}, {"time": 5618, "text": "Yeah, I mean, this is a property that we start seeing in systems that actually tend to be so in machine learning, traditionally, again, going to benchmarks."}, {"time": 5631, "text": "I mean, if you have some input, output, right, like that is just a single input and a single output, you generally, when you train these systems, you see reasonably smooth curves when you analyze how much the data set size affects the performance, or how the model size affects the performance, or how long you train the system for affects the performance, right?"}, {"time": 5659, "text": "So if we think of ImageNet, the training curves look fairly smooth and predictable in a way."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "And I would say that's probably because it's kind of a one hop reasoning task, right?"}, {"time": 5676, "text": "It's like, here is an input, and you think for a few milliseconds or 100 milliseconds, 300 as a human, and then you tell me, yeah, there's an alpaca in this image."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "So in language, we are seeing benchmarks that require more pondering and more thought in a way, right?"}, {"time": 5698, "text": "This is just kind of you need to look for some subtleties."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "It involves inputs that you might think of, even if the input is a sentence describing a mathematical problem, there is a bit more processing required as a human and more introspection."}, {"time": 5715, "text": "So I think how these benchmarks work means that there is actually a threshold."}, {"time": 5724, "text": "Just going back to how transformers work in this way of querying for the right questions to get the right answers, that might mean that performance becomes random until the right question is asked by the querying system of a transformer or of a language model like a transformer."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "And then only then you might start seeing performance going from random to nonrandom."}, {"time": 5750, "text": "And this is more empirical."}, {"time": 5753, "text": "There's no formalism or theory behind this yet, although it might be quite important."}, {"time": 5757, "text": "But we are seeing these phase transitions of random performance until some, let's say, scale of a model."}, {"time": 5764, "text": "And then it goes beyond that."}, {"time": 5766, "text": "And it might be that you need to fit a few low order bits of thought before you can make progress on the whole task."}, {"time": 5777, "text": "And if you could measure, actually, those breakdown of the task, maybe you would see more smooth, like, yeah, once you get these and these and these and these and these, then you start making progress in the task."}, {"time": 5790, "text": "But it's somehow a bit annoying because then it means that certain questions we might ask about architectures possibly can only be done at a certain scale."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "And one thing that, conversely, I've seen great progress on in the last couple of years is this notion of science of deep learning and science of scale in particular."}, {"time": 5815, "text": "So on the negative is that there are some benchmarks for which progress might need to be measured at minimum at a certain scale until you see then what details of the model matter to make that performance better."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "So that's a bit of a con."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "But what we've also seen is that you can empirically analyze behavior of models at scales that are smaller."}, {"time": 5842, "text": "So let's say, to put an example, we had this Chinchilla paper that revised the so called scaling laws of models."}, {"time": 5851, "text": "And that whole study is done at a reasonably small scale, that may be hundreds of millions up to 1 billion parameters."}, {"time": 5858, "text": "And then the cool thing is that you create some loss, some loss that some trends, you extract trends from data that you see, OK, it looks like the amount of data required to train now a 10x larger model would be this."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And these laws so far, these extrapolations have helped us save compute and just get to a better place in terms of the science of how should we run these models at scale, how much data, how much depth, and all sorts of questions we start asking extrapolating from a small scale."}, {"time": 5890, "text": "But then these emergence is sadly that not everything can be extrapolated from scale depending on the benchmark."}, {"time": 5896, "text": "And maybe the harder benchmarks are not so good for extracting these laws."}, {"time": 5901, "text": "But we have a variety of benchmarks at least."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "So I wonder to which degree the threshold, the phase shift scale is a function of the benchmark."}, {"time": 5912, "text": "So some of the science of scale might be engineering benchmarks where that threshold is low, sort of taking a main benchmark and reducing it somehow where the essential difficulty is left but the scale of which the emergence happens is lower just for the science aspect of it versus the actual real world aspect."}, {"time": 5936, "text": "Yeah, so luckily we have quite a few benchmarks, some of which are simpler or maybe they're more like I think people might call these systems one versus systems two style."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "So I think what we're not seeing luckily is that extrapolations from maybe slightly more smooth or simpler benchmarks are translating to the harder ones."}, {"time": 5958, "text": "But that is not to say that this extrapolation will hit its limits."}, {"time": 5962, "text": "And when it does, then how much we scale or how we scale will sadly be a bit suboptimal until we find better laws."}, {"time": 5971, "text": "And these laws, again, are very empirical laws."}, {"time": 5973, "text": "They're not like physical laws of models, although I wish there would be better theory about these things as well."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "But so far, I would say empirical theory, as I call it, is way ahead than actual theory of machine learning."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "Let me ask you almost for fun."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "So this is not, Oriol, as a deep mind person or anything to do with deep mind or Google, just as a human being, looking at these news of a Google engineer who claimed that, I guess, the lambda language model was sentient."}, {"time": 6011, "text": "And you still need to look into the details of this."}, {"time": 6014, "text": "But making an official report and the claim that he believes there's evidence that this system has achieved sentience."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "And I think this is a really interesting case on a human level, on a psychological level, on a technical machine learning level of how language models transform our world, and also just philosophical level of the role of AI systems in a human world."}, {"time": 6044, "text": "So what do you find interesting?"}, {"time": 6048, "text": "What's your take on all of this as a machine learning engineer and a researcher and also as a human being?"}, {"time": 6054, "text": "Yeah, I mean, a few reactions."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "Quite a few, actually."}, {"time": 6058, "text": "Have you ever briefly thought, is this thing sentient?"}, {"time": 6062, "text": "Right, so never, absolutely never."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "Like even with Alpha Star?"}, {"time": 6068, "text": "Sadly, though, I think, yeah, sadly, I have not."}, {"time": 6071, "text": "Yeah, I think the current, any of the current models, although very useful and very good, yeah, I think we're quite far from that."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "And there's kind of a converse side story."}, {"time": 6085, "text": "So one of my passions is about science in general."}, {"time": 6090, "text": "And I think I feel I'm a bit of a failed scientist."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "That's why I came to machine learning, because you always feel, and you start seeing this, that machine learning is maybe the science that can help other sciences, as we've seen."}, {"time": 6106, "text": "It's such a powerful tool."}, {"time": 6108, "text": "So thanks to that angle, that, OK, I love science."}, {"time": 6112, "text": "I love, I mean, I love astronomy."}, {"time": 6113, "text": "I love biology."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "But I'm not an expert."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "And I decided, well, the thing I can do better at is computers."}, {"time": 6119, "text": "But having, especially with when I was a bit more involved in AlphaFold, learning a bit about proteins and about biology and about life, the complexity, it feels like it really is."}, {"time": 6134, "text": "I mean, if you start looking at the things that are going on at the atomic level, and also, I mean, there's obviously the, we are maybe inclined to try to think of neural networks as like the brain."}, {"time": 6150, "text": "But the complexities and the amount of magic that it feels when, I mean, I'm not an expert, so it naturally feels more magic."}, {"time": 6158, "text": "But looking at biological systems, as opposed to these computational brains, just makes me like, wow, there's such a level of complexity difference still, like orders of magnitude complexity that, sure, these weights, I mean, we train them and they do nice things."}, {"time": 6178, "text": "But they're not at the level of biological entities, brains, cells."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "It just feels like it's just not possible to achieve the same level of complexity behavior."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "And my belief, when I talk to other beings, is certainly shaped by this amazement of biology that, maybe because I know too much, I don't have about machine learning, but I certainly feel it's very far fetched and far in the future to be calling or to be thinking, well, this mathematical function that is differentiable is, in fact, sentient and so on."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "There's something on that point that is very interesting."}, {"time": 6222, "text": "So you know enough about machines and enough about biology to know that there's many orders of magnitude of difference and complexity."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "But you know how machine learning works."}, {"time": 6236, "text": "So the interesting question for human beings that are interacting with a system that don't know about the underlying complexity."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "And I've seen people, probably including myself, that have fallen in love with things that are quite simple."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "And so maybe the complexity is one part of the picture, but maybe that's not a necessary condition for sentience, for perception or emulation of sentience."}, {"time": 6265, "text": "So I mean, I guess the other side of this is that's how I feel personally."}, {"time": 6269, "text": "I mean, you asked me about the person, right?"}, {"time": 6272, "text": "Now, it's very interesting to see how other humans feel about things, right?"}, {"time": 6277, "text": "We are, again, I'm not as amazed about things that I feel this is not as magical as this other thing because of maybe how I got to learn about it and how I see the curve a bit more smooth because I've just seen the progress of language models since Shannon in the 50s."}, {"time": 6296, "text": "And actually looking at that time scale, we're not that fast progress, right?"}, {"time": 6300, "text": "I mean, what we were thinking at the time almost 100 years ago is not that dissimilar to what we're doing now."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "But at the same time, yeah, obviously others, my experience, the personal experience, I think no one should tell others how they should feel."}, {"time": 6320, "text": "I mean, the feelings are very personal, right?"}, {"time": 6322, "text": "So how others might feel about the models and so on."}, {"time": 6326, "text": "That's one part of the story that is important to understand for me personally as a researcher."}, {"time": 6366, "text": "Versus then the complexity of the creation of humans from their inception, right?"}, {"time": 6373, "text": "And also the complexity of evolution of the whole universe to where we are that feels orders of magnitude more complex and fascinating to me."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "So I think, yeah, maybe part of the only thing I'm thinking about trying to tell you is, yeah, I think explaining a bit of the magic."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "There is a bit of magic."}, {"time": 6393, "text": "It's good to be in love, obviously, with what you do at work."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "And I'm certainly fascinated and surprised quite often as well."}, {"time": 6401, "text": "But I think, hopefully, as experts in biology, hopefully will tell me this is not as magic."}, {"time": 6407, "text": "And I'm happy to learn that through interactions with the larger community, we can also have a certain level of education that in practice also will matter because, I mean, one question is how you feel about this."}, {"time": 6420, "text": "But then the other very important is you starting to interact with these in products and so on."}, {"time": 6426, "text": "It's good to understand a bit what's going on, what's not going on, what's safe, what's not safe, and so on, right?"}, {"time": 6433, "text": "Otherwise, the technology will not be used properly for good, which is obviously the goal of all of us, I hope."}, {"time": 6440, "text": "So let me then ask the next question."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "Do you think in order to solve intelligence or to replace the leg spot that does interviews as we started this conversation with, do you think the system needs to be sentient?"}, {"time": 6454, "text": "Do you think it needs to achieve something like consciousness?"}, {"time": 6458, "text": "And do you think about what consciousness is in the human mind that could be instructive for creating AI systems?"}, {"time": 6467, "text": "Honestly, I think probably not to the degree of intelligence that there's this brain that can learn, can be extremely useful, can challenge you, can teach you."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "Conversely, you can teach it to do things."}, {"time": 6485, "text": "I'm not sure it's necessary, personally speaking."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "But if consciousness or any other biological or evolutionary lesson can be repurposed to then influence our next set of algorithms, that is a great way to actually make progress, right?"}, {"time": 6505, "text": "And the same way I try to explain transformers a bit how it feels we operate when we look at text specifically, these insights are very important, right?"}, {"time": 6516, "text": "So there's a distinction between details of how the brain might be doing computation."}, {"time": 6523, "text": "I think my understanding is, sure, there's neurons and there's some resemblance to neural networks, but we don't quite understand enough of the brain in detail, right, to be able to replicate it."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "But then if you zoom out a bit, our thought process, how memory works, maybe even how evolution got us here, what's exploration, exploitation, like how these things happen, I think these clearly can inform algorithmic level research."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "And I've seen some examples of this being quite useful to then guide the research, even it might be for the wrong reasons, right?"}, {"time": 6561, "text": "So I think biology and what we know about ourselves can help a whole lot to build, essentially, what we call AGI, this general, the real ghetto, right?"}, {"time": 6574, "text": "The last step of the chain, hopefully."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "But consciousness in particular, I don't myself at least think too hard about how to add that to the system."}, {"time": 6584, "text": "But maybe my understanding is also very personal about what it means, right?"}, {"time": 6588, "text": "I think even that in itself is a long debate that I know people have often."}, {"time": 6595, "text": "And maybe I should learn more about this."}, {"time": 6597, "text": "Yeah, and I personally, I notice the magic often on a personal level, especially with physical systems like robots."}, {"time": 6606, "text": "I have a lot of legged robots now in Austin that I play with."}, {"time": 6611, "text": "And even when you program them, when they do things you didn't expect, there's an immediate anthropomorphization."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "And you notice the magic, and you start to think about things like sentience that has to do more with effective communication and less with any of these kind of dramatic things."}, {"time": 6630, "text": "It seems like a useful part of communication."}, {"time": 6632, "text": "Having the perception of consciousness seems like useful for us humans."}, {"time": 6638, "text": "We treat each other more seriously."}, {"time": 6640, "text": "We are able to do a nearest neighbor shoving of that entity into your memory correctly, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "It seems useful, at least to fake it, even if you never make it."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "So maybe, like, yeah, mirroring the question."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "And since you talked to a few people, then you do think that we'll need to figure something out in order to achieve intelligence in a grander sense of the word."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "Yeah, I personally believe yes, but I don't even think it'll be like a separate island we'll have to travel to."}, {"time": 6674, "text": "I think it will emerge quite naturally."}, {"time": 6676, "text": "OK, that's easier for us then."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "But the reason I think it's important to think about is you will start, I believe, like with this Google engineer, you will start seeing this a lot more, especially when you have AI systems that are actually interacting with human beings that don't have an engineering background."}, {"time": 6695, "text": "And we have to prepare for that."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "Because I do believe there will be a civil rights movement for robots, as silly as it is to say."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "There's going to be a large number of people that realize there's these intelligent entities with whom I have a deep relationship, and I don't want to lose them."}, {"time": 6713, "text":

{"time": 6719, "text": "And we start to ask questions about ourselves."}, {"time": 6721, "text": "Well, this thing sure seems like it's capable of suffering, because it tells all these stories of suffering."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "It doesn't want to die and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "And we have to start to ask ourselves questions."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "What is the difference between a human being and this thing?"}, {"time": 6736, "text": "And so when you engineer, I believe from an engineering perspective, from a deep mind or anybody that builds systems, there might be laws in the future where you're not allowed to engineer systems with displays of sentience, unless they're explicitly designed to be that, unless it's a pet."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "So if you have a system that's just doing customer support, you're legally not allowed to display sentience."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "We'll start to ask ourselves that question."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "And then so that's going to be part of the software engineering process."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "Which features do we have?"}, {"time": 6773, "text": "And one of them is communications of the sentience."}, {"time": 6776, "text": "But it's important to start thinking about that stuff, especially how much it captivates public attention."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "It's definitely a topic that is important."}, {"time": 6786, "text": "We think about."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "And I think in a way, I always see not every movie is equally on point with certain things."}, {"time": 6796, "text": "But certainly science fiction in this sense at least has prepared society to start thinking about certain topics that even if it's too early to talk about, as long as we are reasonable, it's certainly going to prepare us for both the research to come and how to."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "I mean, there's many important challenges and topics that come with building an intelligent system, many of which you just mentioned."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "So I think we're never going to be fully ready unless we talk about these."}, {"time": 6831, "text": "And we start also, as I said, just expanding the people we talk to not include only our own researchers and so on."}, {"time": 6843, "text": "And in fact, places like DeepMind but elsewhere, there's more interdisciplinary groups forming up to start asking and really working with us on these questions."}, {"time": 6854, "text": "Because obviously, this is not initially what your passion is when you do your PhD, but certainly it is coming."}, {"time": 6863, "text": "It's the thing that brings me to one of my passions that is learning."}, {"time": 6868, "text": "So in this sense, this is a new area that, as a learning system myself, I want to keep exploring."}, {"time": 6876, "text": "And I think it's great to see parts of the debate."}, {"time": 6881, "text": "And even I've seen a level of maturity in the conferences that deal with AI."}, {"time": 6886, "text": "If you look five years ago to now, just the amount of workshops and so on has changed so much."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "It's impressive to see how much topics of safety, ethics, and so on come to the surface, which is great."}, {"time": 6901, "text": "And if it were too early, clearly it's fine."}, {"time": 6903, "text": "I mean, it's a big field, and there's lots of people with lots of interests that will do progress or make progress."}, {"time": 6911, "text": "And obviously, I don't believe we're too late."}, {"time": 6914, "text": "So in that sense, I think it's great that we're doing this already."}, {"time": 6918, "text": "It better be too early than too late when it comes to super intelligent AI systems."}, {"time": 6922, "text": "Let me ask, speaking of sentient AIs, you gave props to your friend Ilyas Etzgever for being elected the fellow of the Royal Society."}, {"time": 6931, "text": "So just as a shout out to a fellow researcher and a friend, what's the secret to the genius of Ilyas Etzgever?"}, {"time": 6939, "text": "And also, do you believe that his tweets, as you've hypothesized and Andrej Karpathy did as well, are generated by a language model?"}, {"time": 6949, "text": "So I strongly believe Ilya is going to visit in a few weeks, actually."}, {"time": 6954, "text": "So I'll ask him in person."}, {"time": 6958, "text": "Will he tell you the truth?"}, {"time": 6959, "text": "Yes, of course, hopefully."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "I mean, ultimately, we all have shared paths, and there's friendships that go beyond, obviously, institutions and so on."}, {"time": 6969, "text": "So I hope he tells me the truth."}, {"time": 6971, "text": "Well, maybe the AI system is holding him hostage somehow."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "Maybe he has some videos that he doesn't want to release."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "So maybe it has taken control over him."}, {"time": 6979, "text": "So he can't tell the truth."}, {"time": 6980, "text": "Well, if I see him in person, then I think he will know."}, {"time": 6983, "text": "But I think Ilya's personality, just knowing him for a while, everyone in Twitter, I guess, gets a different persona."}, {"time": 6996, "text": "And I think Ilya's one does not surprise me."}, {"time": 7000, "text": "So I think knowing Ilya from before social media and before AI was so prevalent, I recognize a lot of his character."}, {"time": 7007, "text": "So that's something for me that I feel good about a friend that hasn't changed or is still true to himself."}, {"time": 7015, "text": "Obviously, there is, though, a fact that your field becomes more popular, and he is obviously one of the main figures in the field, having done a lot of advancement."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "So I think that the tricky bit here is how to balance your true self with the responsibility that your words carry."}, {"time": 7033, "text": "So in this sense, I appreciate the style, and I understand it."}, {"time": 7039, "text": "But it created debates on some of his tweets that maybe it's good we have them early anyways."}, {"time": 7047, "text": "But yeah, then the reactions are usually polarizing."}, {"time": 7051, "text": "I think we're just seeing the reality of social media be there as well, reflected on that particular topic or set of topics he's tweeting about."}, {"time": 7060, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it's funny that he used to speak to this tension."}, {"time": 7062, "text": "He was one of the early seminal figures in the field of deep learning, so there's a responsibility with that."}, {"time": 7068, "text": "But he's also, from having interacted with him quite a bit, he's just a brilliant thinker about ideas, which, as are you."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "And there's a tension between becoming the manager versus the actual thinking through very novel ideas, the scientist versus the manager."}, {"time": 7093, "text": "And he's one of the great scientists of our time."}, {"time": 7097, "text": "So this was quite interesting."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "And also, people tell me quite silly, which I haven't quite detected yet."}, {"time": 7103, "text": "But in private, we'll have to see about that."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "I mean, just on the point of, I mean, Ilya has been an inspiration."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "I mean, quite a few colleagues, I can think, shaped the person you are."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "Like, Ilya certainly gets probably the top spot, if not close to the top."}, {"time": 7123, "text": "And if we go back to the question about people in the field, like how their role would have changed the field or not, I think Ilya's case is interesting because he really has a deep belief in the scaling up of neural networks."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "There was a talk that is still famous to this day from the Sequence to Sequence paper, where he was just claiming, just give me supervised data and a large neural network, and then you'll solve basically all the problems."}, {"time": 7156, "text": "That vision was already there many years ago."}, {"time": 7159, "text": "So it's good to see someone who is, in this case, very deeply into this style of research and clearly has had a tremendous track record of successes and so on."}, {"time": 7174, "text": "The funny bit about that talk is that we rehearsed the talk in a hotel room before, and the original version of that talk would have been even more controversial."}, {"time": 7184, "text": "So maybe I'm the only person that has seen the unfiltered version of the talk."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "And maybe when the time comes, maybe we should revisit some of the skip slides from the talk from Ilya."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "But I really think the deep belief into some certain style of research pays out, is good to be practical sometimes."}, {"time": 7206, "text": "And I actually think Ilya and myself are practical, but it's also good."}, {"time": 7210, "text": "There's some sort of long term belief and trajectory."}, {"time": 7214, "text": "Obviously, there's a bit of lack involved, but it might be that that's the right path."}, {"time": 7218, "text": "Then you clearly are ahead and hugely influential to the field as he has been."}, {"time": 7223, "text": "Do you agree with that intuition that maybe was written about by Rich Sutton in The Bitter Lesson, that the biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective?"}, {"time": 7242, "text": "Do you think that intuition is ultimately correct?"}, {"time": 7248, "text": "General methods that leverage computation, allowing the scaling of computation to do a lot of the work."}, {"time": 7256, "text": "And so the basic task of us humans is to design methods that are more and more general versus more and more specific to the tasks at hand."}, {"time": 7267, "text": "I certainly think this essentially mimics a bit of the deep learning research, almost like philosophy, that on the one hand, we want to be data agnostic."}, {"time": 7280, "text": "We don't want to preprocess data sets."}, {"time": 7282, "text": "We want to see the bytes, the true data as it is, and then learn everything on top."}, {"time": 7287, "text": "So very much agree with that."}, {"time": 7290, "text": "And I think scaling up feels, at the very least, again, necessary for building incredible complex systems."}, {"time": 7298, "text": "It's possibly not sufficient, barring that we need a couple of breakthroughs."}, {"time": 7305, "text": "I think Reed Sutton mentioned search being part of the equation of scale and search."}, {"time": 7312, "text": "I think search, I've seen it, that's been more mixed in my experience."}, {"time": 7317, "text": "So from that lesson in particular, search is a bit more tricky because it is very appealing to search in domains like Go, where you have a clear reward function that you can then discard some search traces."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "So I've seen examples of it being literally mapped to search and scale."}, {"time": 7366, "text": "I'm not so convinced about the search bit, but certainly I'm convinced scale will be needed."}, {"time": 7371, "text": "So we need general methods."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "We need to test them, and maybe we need to make sure that we can scale them given the hardware that we have in practice."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "But then maybe we should also shape how the hardware looks like based on which methods might be needed to scale."}, {"time": 7385, "text": "And that's an interesting contrast of these GPU comments that is we got it for free almost because games were using these."}, {"time": 7395, "text": "But maybe now if sparsity is required, we don't have the hardware."}, {"time": 7400, "text": "Although in theory, many people are building different kinds of hardware these days."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "But there's a bit of this notion of hardware lottery for scale that might actually have an impact at least on the scale of years on how fast we will make progress to maybe a version of neural nets or whatever comes next that might enable truly intelligent agents."}, {"time": 7424, "text": "Do you think in your lifetime we will build an AGI system that would undeniably be a thing that achieves human level intelligence and goes far beyond?"}, {"time": 7438, "text": "I definitely think it's possible that it will go far beyond."}, {"time": 7443, "text": "But I'm definitely convinced that it will be human level intelligence."}, {"time": 7448, "text": "And I'm hypothesizing about the beyond because the beyond bit is a bit tricky to define, especially when we look at the current formula of starting from this imitation learning standpoint."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "So we can certainly imitate humans at language and beyond."}, {"time": 7470, "text": "So getting at human level through imitation feels very possible."}]}]
