doesn't."}, {"time": 166, "text": "I mean, when you talk about like the evolution of the sport, he's responsible for so much of it."}, {"time": 174, "text": "Like when you talk about, like a lot of times when you go back like 20 years, 30 years, a lot of us looked at arm wrestling, I think it's, I mean, as something you could kind of do."}, {"time": 186, "text": "And he's the first guy who's like, if you want to get better at arm wrestling, you got to arm wrestle."}, {"time": 190, "text": "And it seems so simple, but you know, he answered so many questions that all of us had about techniques in the sport, back in a pre video internet."}, {"time": 205, "text": "He's been everybody's target for like 40 years."}, {"time": 208, "text": "So in terms of strength, there's a power in terms of skill."}, {"time": 211, "text": "What did he teach the sport of arm wrestling?"}, {"time": 213, "text": "So if you look, how did the sport change from 80s, 90s to the aughts?"}, {"time": 218, "text": "You were at the top of the world for many years."}, {"time": 223, "text": "Many argue you're still at the very top of the world."}, {"time": 225, "text": "But like you were very dominant, both left and right hand in, I don't know, 2008 to 2013, something like that."}, {"time": 235, "text": "So how did that sport evolve to today?"}, {"time": 237, "text": "So it's hard for me to comment, you know, prior to, you know, when I came to the sport was kind of mid nineties."}, {"time": 246, "text": "Like I've been arm wrestling my whole life, but I wasn't really involved in the sport to a major degree until probably, you know, mid nineties."}, {"time": 256, "text": "But I'll say that before the mid nineties, it was really hard to get good at arm wrestling."}, {"time": 265, "text": "Everybody was doing it wrong, really."}, {"time": 268, "text": "Like it was really rare to find people who were technically good arm wrestlers."}, {"time": 273, "text": "It was very underground."}, {"time": 275, "text": "You know, when I got into sport, it was a flyer that came in the mail."}, {"time": 279, "text": "You had to know somebody who knew you."}, {"time": 281, "text": "You had to know somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody, and then you go to a club and you can't do anything with these people."}, {"time": 289, "text": "And they knew how to arm wrestle."}, {"time": 292, "text": "They did, but real masters were rare."}, {"time": 296, "text": "And you know, then internet helped everybody."}, {"time": 300, "text": "Communication, the transfer of knowledge became so much faster."}, {"time": 306, "text": "People became technically, you know, invested."}, {"time": 311, "text": "People started to train, sharing ideas."}, {"time": 314, "text": "By, I'd say, 2000 and, well, probably around the turn of the millennia, I'd say that professional leagues started to slowly pick up."}, {"time": 327, "text": "More organized, bigger productions."}, {"time": 331, "text": "Started to attract more athletes."}, {"time": 333, "text": "More people took it seriously."}, {"time": 335, "text": "By 2010, I'd say there was another jump."}, {"time": 339, "text": "More serious leagues, a little bit more money."}, {"time": 343, "text": "By 2015, more major media."}, {"time": 347, "text": "Like, people were investing a lot of money."}, {"time": 349, "text": "Like, you know, millionaires, billionaires type of people were organizing events, setting up leagues."}, {"time": 356, "text": "And yeah, I mean, the past five years, it's just blown up."}, {"time": 361, "text": "The techniques, I mean, if I was to go back to when I started, you know, what took me 10 or 15 years to learn?"}, {"time": 370, "text": "I mean, new guys are showing up and they've got it down in like a year."}, {"time": 375, "text": "Well, the thing about it, the development of the sport, is it's, like I was telling you off mic, it's a battle of one versus one."}, {"time": 387, "text": "And then that can turn into battle of nations, which, you know, there is."}, {"time": 392, "text": "There's Canada, there's the United States, there's all the Eastern Europe, Russia, Georgia, all of that."}, {"time": 400, "text": "That's what makes some of the greatest sports in Olympics great, like weightlifting."}, {"time": 406, "text": "It's a battle of nations, not just a battle of individuals."}, {"time": 408, "text": "And it's almost like these two humans represent the two nations."}, {"time": 412, "text": "And I see that very much, we'll talk about your matches coming up, but there is that battle between North America and that other part of the world."}, {"time": 421, "text": "Yeah, yeah, North America is very prized."}, {"time": 425, "text": "You know, the North American champion is always highly sought after because they're typically the most famous."}, {"time": 432, "text": "Even still when, you know, quite arguably, there's always somebody in Eastern Europe who's just monstrous."}, {"time": 440, "text": "It's typically the North American athlete who's more recognized."}, {"time": 444, "text": "By the way."}, {"time": 446, "text": "We'll have a cup here with some maple syrup."}, {"time": 448, "text": "Cheers, Lex."}, {"time": 449, "text": "We should probably show, you just downed that whole thing."}, {"time": 454, "text": "No, no, no, I'm gonna sip it."}, {"time": 456, "text": "I'm gonna sip it, you know?"}, {"time": 457, "text": "But by all means."}, {"time": 461, "text": "It's really good, right?"}, {"time": 461, "text": "That is delicious."}, {"time": 463, "text": "Canadian maple syrup."}, {"time": 466, "text": "That's a perfect July day from Canada in a bottle, yeah."}, {"time": 472, "text": "So you're on a total tangent."}, {"time": 476, "text": "You are known for appreciating food in all kinds of ways, but one of the things you're known for is pancakes."}, {"time": 482, "text": "That is, yeah, that's gone to a crazy place in the sport, but yeah, like."}, {"time": 488, "text": "Where did that originate?"}, {"time": 489, "text": "So, where that originated."}, {"time": 492, "text": "When it went from like your actual love for pancakes to the meme."}, {"time": 496, "text": "Yeah, so I think what happened was."}, {"time": 502, "text": "So I had a match with Michael Todd, big match."}, {"time": 506, "text": "Michael, great champion."}, {"time": 510, "text": "He's another guy who's, you know, he's never gonna get off the horse."}, {"time": 514, "text": "You know, he's, Jesus."}, {"time": 516, "text": "His elbow is a complete disaster."}, {"time": 520, "text": "Probably one of the most loved and hated guys in the sport right now."}, {"time": 525, "text": "Is it because of the King's move?"}, {"time": 527, "text": "Yeah, the King's move brings him a lot of hate."}, {"time": 530, "text": "Not from me, not from a lot of people, but a lot of observers have a big problem with the King's move."}, {"time": 537, "text": "What's wrong with being a little bit controversial?"}, {"time": 541, "text": "You know, I get so passionate about it."}, {"time": 543, "text": "I get so angry, you know?"}, {"time": 545, "text": "Because there's this saying like, oh, can you beat him in a hook?"}, {"time": 548, "text": "Can you beat, man?"}, {"time": 549, "text": "Win, win."}, {"time": 552, "text": "Just win and don't talk to me about anything else."}, {"time": 555, "text": "If you can win with style, win with style, but don't talk to me about anything but winning."}, {"time": 561, "text": "That's the priority."}, {"time": 563, "text": "So you had this match with Michael Todd."}, {"time": 565, "text": "So I was in a terrible place."}, {"time": 569, "text": "I guess it was, I get so screwed up with the years."}, {"time": 571, "text": "It's 2022 now, right?"}, {"time": 573, "text": "No, it's 2030."}, {"time": 576, "text": "I think it is actually 2030."}, {"time": 578, "text": "We're way ahead of schedule."}, {"time": 582, "text": "So when was this?"}, {"time": 583, "text": "This was like a decade ago or no?"}, {"time": 583, "text": "No, this is like a year and a bit ago."}, {"time": 587, "text": "Oh, this is very recent."}, {"time": 588, "text": "Very recent, yeah."}, {"time": 589, "text": "So I got really sick."}, {"time": 592, "text": "Is that the match?"}, {"time": 592, "text": "Yeah, this is the match, right?"}, {"time": 594, "text": "Awesome match."}, {"time": 597, "text": "So this match is for the Legacy Hammer."}, {"time": 599, "text": "So we invented this thing called the Legacy Hammer and Michael took it from me in, I think, 2018."}, {"time": 605, "text": "And then COVID shut everything down and Michael went overseas to try and set up, because at that time, Michael was a North American champion."}, {"time": 615, "text": "He beat me and he went to Dubai and he organized this great big match with LeVon."}, {"time": 621, "text": "And the whole thing fell apart."}, {"time": 623, "text": "Organizers, leagues, wouldn't let it happen, but there was still an ability to have a match of significance happen."}, {"time": 630, "text": "So Michael's like, who do you want?"}, {"time": 631, "text": "And I'm like, let's give Devin a rematch."}, {"time": 633, "text": "And I'm like, yeah, yes."}, {"time": 636, "text": "And I was really sick at the time."}, {"time": 638, "text": "I had DVT, I had pulmonary embolism."}, {"time": 641, "text": "I was mentally in a terrible place and I got offered the match and I just totally turned my life around."}, {"time": 650, "text": "And I committed really hard."}, {"time": 657, "text": "What happened in this match, by the way?"}, {"time": 659, "text": "Oh, I just totally destroyed him."}, {"time": 663, "text": "I just beat the piss out of him."}, {"time": 668, "text": "Michael's a good friend of mine, but."}, {"time": 671, "text": "Yeah, there's a lot of camaraderie when you guys talked afterwards, it's great."}, {"time": 674, "text": "But we fight like brothers, so we let each other really fight hard against each other."}, {"time": 680, "text": "But so I was, I knew, I mean, strength and mass, they go hand in hand."}, {"time": 686, "text": "And I committed to just getting as big and as strong as I could."}, {"time": 690, "text": "And literally, I was eating pancakes every day."}, {"time": 694, "text": "Bacon, pancakes, every sloppy bit of garbage food I could eat."}, {"time": 698, "text": "I was trying to eat healthy also, but if there was garbage food, I'd eat it."}, {"time": 702, "text": "What do you mean, bacon and pancakes isn't healthy?"}, {"time": 706, "text": "But people should go watch, there's a video where you make the Canadian meal of bacon with some bacon cooking tips, water, that was interesting."}, {"time": 717, "text": "And then obviously pancakes and maple syrup all over the whole thing."}, {"time": 722, "text": "Yeah, you're making me very hungry."}, {"time": 725, "text": "I've caused more diabetes than, probably gonna get in trouble karmically for making the world obese."}, {"time": 732, "text": "You should probably write a book, The Pancake Diet."}, {"time": 735, "text": "Yeah, I think I will do that one day."}, {"time": 738, "text": "So you said mass and strength go hand in hand, just at a big level about arm wrestling, what's more important?"}, {"time": 746, "text": "Strength, power, endurance, skills, strategy, or mental toughness, how do these components all come into play in arm wrestling?"}, {"time": 756, "text": "They're all important."}, {"time": 758, "text": "You can use everything and you can adjust your strategy based off of the tools that you have."}, {"time": 763, "text": "I would say if I could pick ever just one thing to have more of, I would say that it would be strength."}, {"time": 773, "text": "Gained while fighting."}, {"time": 776, "text": "While actually arm wrestling, so not off the table."}, {"time": 779, "text": "No, no, no, so you get stronger from arm wrestling."}, {"time": 782, "text": "How do you get stronger from arm wrestling?"}, {"time": 783, "text": "In jiu jitsu and grappling, you can get good by training with people much technically worse than you."}, {"time": 791, "text": "So with white belts and blue belts, it's actually beneficial because you get to work stuff out."}, {"time": 796, "text": "But I wouldn't say it develops that intensity and power required to go against people at your level."}, {"time": 807, "text": "So how do you balance that?"}, {"time": 810, "text": "Is it okay to go against people that are much weaker than you?"}, {"time": 813, "text": "Or do you really have to go against people at the same level?"}, {"time": 818, "text": "I think that a blended strategy is probably the best."}, {"time": 824, "text": "I'd say kind of a rule is whatever you do, you get better at, right?"}, {"time": 829, "text": "So you wanna be kind of as precise as possible."}, {"time": 834, "text": "You don't wanna get hurt."}, {"time": 836, "text": "And it's just about investment."}, {"time": 838, "text": "And the answer's not always the same."}, {"time": 842, "text": "Things are gonna change."}, {"time": 844, "text": "I am currently a big believer in what I call tower building, right?"}, {"time": 849, "text": "So you have to do a lot of volume to build a great tower."}, {"time": 855, "text": "You need to have a ton, a ton of volume."}, {"time": 859, "text": "So when you look at how to best build volume, you want to do workouts that aren't particularly challenging to make you feel good and do them so that when you add them all together, you get the biggest number."}, {"time": 875, "text": "So many easy workouts a day that are specific as possible, in my opinion, is the best way to lay the foundation for an extreme peak."}, {"time": 887, "text": "And precision, right?"}, {"time": 889, "text": "Like there's no more precise way to get strong at arm wrestling than arm wrestle."}, {"time": 897, "text": "So how often can you arm wrestle?"}, {"time": 900, "text": "What's your training regimen?"}, {"time": 902, "text": "You've talked about this as the climb."}, {"time": 907, "text": "What is the training process to get great at arm wrestling?"}, {"time": 912, "text": "Well, again, it's gonna depend on what level you're at."}, {"time": 917, "text": "The answer at the beginning might not be the same."}, {"time": 921, "text": "For me, a guy who's been doing it almost 30 years, I have to harvest."}, {"time": 927, "text": "I have to harvest energy from clubs."}, {"time": 930, "text": "I call it cosmic punch."}, {"time": 933, "text": "You were here in Austin, Texas."}, {"time": 934, "text": "You are in Austin, Texas, but you were at the, what was it called?"}, {"time": 938, "text": "The water tank."}, {"time": 940, "text": "And you had an awesome crowd."}, {"time": 942, "text": "I get to watch."}, {"time": 943, "text": "I got to interact with a lot of those guys."}, {"time": 946, "text": "Yes, just amazing community, amazing human beings."}, {"time": 949, "text": "I got to talk to Dmitry in Russian and in English."}, {"time": 955, "text": "His wife is an engineer."}, {"time": 956, "text": "He's a brilliant dude, but also one of the toughest, I guess, guys you faced there."}, {"time": 961, "text": "But you faced, I don't know how many people."}, {"time": 963, "text": "It must've been hundreds of matches."}, {"time": 965, "text": "So the bar was full."}, {"time": 967, "text": "Yeah, and that for me is a perfect training scenario."}, {"time": 971, "text": "So if I go in and just kind of be, I'm like a lightning rod, and I just absorb everything that I can get from people, all their effort, that's perfect."}, {"time": 985, "text": "I'm lucky because I'm in a place that I can handle it."}, {"time": 989, "text": "If I was losing or failing, this would not be optimal."}, {"time": 995, "text": "But because I'm strong enough, I've been doing it long enough that I can kind of absorb it without damaging me, this is perfect."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "I typically, when I'm training up for a very serious match, I'll try and do that three or four times a week."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "And then the days in between, I will just do blood flow rehab, blood flow rehab."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "I will never hit a PR, a record."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "I'll never do it anymore."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "I don't do it."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "I used to."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "A lot of things change, and that's why I say there's a lot of ways to do it."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "This is currently a system that's working very well for me."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "So when you say PR, you're not aggressively chasing a peak."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "You're just building and building and building."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "My only peak that I care about is for this cycle, the 25th of June."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "That's my only PR."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "Let's talk about the 25th of June."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "Let's talk about Levan Siginashvili, the Georgian Hulk."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "Question number one, is it possible to beat him?"}, {"time": 1062, "text": "He is widely acknowledged as the most powerful person in arm wrestling today."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "Is he beatable?"}, {"time": 1072, "text": "And if so, how?"}, {"time": 1077, "text": "Levan is incredible."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "He is what this modern peak of arm wrestling represents."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "So for people who are just listening, we also have an overlay of a video of Levan going against Vitaliy Levin, another top three person in the world, perhaps, in arm wrestling."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And Levan's the guy on the right, just big."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "And the aggression, I mean, actually, sort of underneath it all, he seems to be a teddy bear, but when he turns it on, it's raw power."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "He's the full package."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "Levan is, he represents the pinnacle."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "There's Dennis in the background."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "He's like, I wanna be back in there."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "Levan has a lot of bases covered."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "He's, I mean, he's curling 300 pounds with one arm."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "I mean, the strength that he shows for arm wrestling is so far ahead of the field."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "He's very, very strong."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "But it's absolutely possible."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "It's absolutely possible."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "The one thing that I'm confident about, well, I'd say there's two things."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "The two things I'm confident about is that I have more experience than he does."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "And experience counts for a lot."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "The other thing is my ability to breathe and recover."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "So if ever there's an opportunity for the tide to turn, that's, I think, where you'll never get it back."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "So I think if I can somehow find a hole in his game, then, yeah."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "So you want to hold off the initial assault of power and then worm out and to find the hole."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "And then, how much of that is mental?"}, {"time": 1200, "text": "How much of it is just the physical ability to do for your muscles to have the endurance to hold off?"}, {"time": 1208, "text": "I like to make the sport bigger."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "And a lot of things that most arm wrestlers believe the sport is, I always try and push those boundaries."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "So there is definitely a mental aspect to it when you're faced with something that you've never seen before."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "That's when things like experience comes in."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "He can become surprised."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Where what's a surprise for him is routine for me."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "So my adjustments will be more precise, more accurate."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "Yeah, that's how I get in."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "That's how I get in."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "Yeah, I play a dirty game."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "So some of it, how important is confidence in the progression of the match?"}, {"time": 1258, "text": "Is there ups and downs of confidence?"}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Like, holy shit, I actually have a chance to win this."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "Holy shit, I'm winning this, you're done."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "There's some of my favorite moments."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "I don't know if those are fake or not in terms of your expressions, if it's fake until you make it."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "But whenever you shake your head or whatever, you make it apparent that you believe the match is finished."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "When you start to actually, so I'm sure you're doing things, like precise, detailed things with your hands to also indicate that you believe they're fake."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "They're finished."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "But you're facially just."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "See this?"}, {"time": 1303, "text": "Quit."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "Oh, that's right, because it's facing the other."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "So that's ultimately what the battle is about."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "It's like, you're done."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "You might as well give up."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Commitment is so important in anything that you do, right?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Like, I always kind of try and bring things to a level of commitment that's uncommon."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "I think that that's a lot of reasons why I do well, is because I just get so committed in the whole process."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "And by the time that I actually show up to fight, I sometimes just wish that they would kill me."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "I wish that they would, because that's how far I want to go."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "People talk about like, how committed are you to the match?"}, {"time": 1350, "text": "If you're committed to the match and you lose, you should be hurt."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "I'm often unhappy when I lose a match and I don't have an injury."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "I'm like, damn, what the fuck?"}, {"time": 1362, "text": "I shoulda."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "I feel like I didn't commit, you know?"}, {"time": 1367, "text": "I don't know if you know Dan Gable as the wrestler."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "Oh yeah, he was on."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "He was on the podcast?"}, {"time": 1375, "text": "He talked about his whole career."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "He dreamed of working so hard that he can't get off the mat."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "By himself."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "And he's disappointed ultimately at the end of his career because he was always able to get off the mat on his own accord."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "So he wants to, yeah, leave it all on the mat just from exhaustion."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "So that's what commitment looks like."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "What is this process, what is this climb for probably the toughest match of your career?"}, {"time": 1406, "text": "I would say the most epic match in arm wrestling history."}, {"time": 1411,

whatever."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "Like, I will show him things that he's not seen before."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "And he hasn't competed often in this rule set, which will be a challenge for

handed."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "So knowing that's possible is almost like inspiration to you that I can be at that level, too."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "Seeing what Dennis did, just trying to absorb a little bit of his knowledge planted seeds in me."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "When I look at my career, it's a bit like the stock market."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "But for sure, I'm trending upwards."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And since really kind of wrapping my mind around some of the Russian philosophies, they really changed my training systems."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "There were some base philosophies that they talked to me about over there that massively impacted my training."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "Is it possible to convert some of those philosophies into words?"},

2961, "text": "Always feel good."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "It should always feel good."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "And those two philosophies express themselves very differently."}, {"time": 2971,

massive principle."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "And volume is very hard to achieve when you're believing in no pain, no gain."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "They don't really go together."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "No pain, no gain, more injuries."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "So is there parallels?"}, {"time": 3000, "text": "Because in wrestling, some of the greatest wrestlers of all time are Russian."},

that's how you achieve higher volume."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "Like, over the stretch of years, the way to reduce injury."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "I mean, in wrestling also, technique might have greater value than it does in arm wrestling."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "Obviously, technique is extremely important in arm wrestling."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "But power can defeat technique, it seems like."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "In wrestling, you can get away."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "There's a lot of ways you can really do sneak attacks, sort of use leverage on those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "So there's even more incentive to do play and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "But do you see the parallels between the two worlds, wrestling and arm wrestling?"}, {"time": 3059, "text": "Well, you saw what I did the other night, right?"}, {"time": 3061, "text": "So I'm playing on the table for hours, right?"}, {"time": 3064, "text": "So that's my number one training thing that I do, is I go on the table for hours and I play."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "Yeah, when you did, Sergey, can you pull up that video?"}, {"time": 3076, "text": "It's on Devin's channel, the water tank one."}, {"time": 3080, "text": "Oh, it's like 180p."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "It's like, the wifi in there was so bad."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "It's great, I love it."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "It's, maybe, I don't know if it was fish eye, but it had a fish eye feel, it was crowded."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "I mean, so much camaraderie, it was amazing."},

when you go against a bunch of different people, a bunch of strangers, what are all the differences and how do you grow from them, how do you learn from them?"}, {"time": 3116, "text": "Well, everybody's a bit different."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "So, I love to go to new clubs, because the energy's always high."}, {"time": 3124, "text": "Like, the first time you go to a club, everybody's trying to kill you."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "Yeah, so they're gonna."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "There's excitement and there's this, and so you feed off of that."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "Yeah, you do, you can, if you're able to be strong enough to absorb it without injury, it's awesome, it's awesome."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "Because they're giving you everything they can."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "Right, so it's very specific, right?"}, {"time": 3146, "text": "Like, I'm gonna get way stronger at arm wrestling."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "And what I try and do, when I go to these places, is I make an assumption, I make an assumption that I'm the best guy there."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "And so, I'll arm wrestle in a way that kind of protects them, because the more I can protect them and kind of keep them kind of in a good position, they can actually give me more, right?"}, {"time": 3169, "text": "So, I kind of give them little pieces that I think will put them in a place that they can really give me more."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "And so, yeah, that's what I'm doing."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "And then, when I see somebody like Dimitri, I pull that in a little bit, right?"}, {"time": 3186, "text": "So, okay, so I know Dimitri's the number one guy in Texas."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "Lots of respect to the guy."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "I won't give him all the pieces until I really kind of gauge where he's at, because I certainly, in training, don't wanna fail."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "I don't want that, I don't want to."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "When you fail in arm wrestling, imagine it's just bad technique."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "And you're trying, and bad technique, you're gonna get hurt, yeah."}, {"time": 3211, "text": "So, you always want to be in a strong position here."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "What about, how does endurance come into play here?"}, {"time": 3217, "text": "And here's video of you strapping up with Dimitri."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "How do you, I mean, you went for like, I don't know, two hours?"}, {"time": 3223, "text": "Yeah, it was long."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "So, this first run of the video, I think, was a little over an hour, and then I took a break, and I probably did another 45 minutes or so, but."}, {"time": 3233, "text": "I mean, do you, how can, are you okay with the endurance aspect of this?"}, {"time": 3238, "text": "Yeah, that's probably, like, when you talk to the arm wrestling world, that's probably what I'm best known for, is my endurance."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "So, this helps build that."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "It does, but that's not why I'm doing it."}, {"time": 3248, "text": "I'm doing it to get strong."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "In my opinion, this is one of the best ways to get strong, especially far away from a tournament, or any kind of an event."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "I wouldn't wanna do this, you know, even a month, or even six weeks, or even, maybe even eight weeks before a big event."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "I'd want to already be kind of shrinking my volume, but far away from an event, yeah, as much volume as your body can handle, and you'll feel it."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "You'll feel it."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "Like, I felt it at times, like, you know, after the hour mark, I'm like, okay, I can feel my blood sugar kind of diminishing."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "I can feel, like, the blood that's going to my muscles is kinda like, it's not really pushing more good stuff in."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "It's, I'm starting to break down, and you don't want that."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "You don't want that."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "Bathroom break?"}, {"time": 3299, "text": "I'm good, I'm good."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "I kinda need one."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "I'll maybe get a sweater, it's a bit."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "Does that matter?"}, {"time": 3306, "text": "Does that care for kind of continuity?"}, {"time": 3308, "text": "I can make it warmer."}, {"time": 3309, "text": "No, no, no, I'll just put a sweater on, it's fine, but that doesn't matter."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "And I still love the idea of you going to Russia."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And training there."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "I'm also making a trip out to Russia."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "Oh yeah, when?"}, {"time": 3319, "text": "For different reasons."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "Well, it's hard with the current conflict, the tensions there, but I'm hoping before your match, actually, so May, for a couple of interviews with a couple of folks, some of which people know."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "Maybe I could ask you about, to comment on some matches that stand out to you in your career."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Is there something, is there a particular, I have a bunch that I really enjoy, but is there something that stands out to you as memorable?"}, {"time": 3354, "text": "We talked about sort of a defining loss, perhaps, to Dennis."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "Then you faced Michael Todd, like you mentioned, John Brzenk, you faced Matt."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "Is there something that stands out to you that technically or psychologically you've learned a lot from?"}, {"time": 3377, "text": "I feel like I try and learn something from every match, but there is a very special match to me that to this day, I can't explain."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "Very weird phenomenon."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "So, I think it was 2005 was my first combat tour overseas."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "So, it was a active tour."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "Among other things, I got shot during that tour, we got blown, long tour, rough tour."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "And I trained the whole time through knowing that at the end of this, I was gonna have a big match."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "So, there's a champion, a guy called Ron Bath."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "He's kind of, if there was no John Brzenk, there would be Ron Bath."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "Okay, so, extremely decorated, unbelievable arm wrestler from the United States."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "And this is kind of when I was just kind of coming up in the sport still."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "I was fairly well established, I was definitely the best guy in Canada."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "And I had been for a few years, but I hadn't really expanded internationally too much."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "So, I had a one on one match with Ron Bath and that's the one."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "Yeah, extremely hard fought battle."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "Was three one, I think, three one, but every match was really close and he won the first one."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "And I had to kind of dig my way out of the trenches and ended up coming back and winning."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "But it was a match that was probably, it was probably one of my closest matches ever."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "It seems like there's frustration on you."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "What was going through your mind here with these?"}, {"time": 3486, "text": "Was it, first of all, going in, did you think you could beat him?"}, {"time": 3489, "text": "What was the level of confidence?"}, {"time": 3490, "text": "I always think I can win, like I always do."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "But, you know, a lot of respect to the guy."}, {"time": 3497, "text": "But yeah, I mean, I always think I can do it."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "So how did, what lessons did you take away from it?"}, {"time": 3504, "text": "Why is it so meaningful to you?"}, {"time": 3507, "text": "Well, it's what happened afterwards."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "So, I had some kind of a release afterwards."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "And that was the strange thing to me."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "So, match ended and I felt like, so relaxed afterwards, so calm, so, so, you know, satisfied."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "Because it was one of those matches that kind of takes everything from you, but you win it."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "And I was relaxing in the chair and I've never had this sensation before."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "I've never had it afterwards, but it's like the center of my backbone just exploded."}, {"time": 3547, "text": "And it was like, it's so weird, right?"}, {"time": 3551, "text": "Cause I'm not really spiritual that much or religious even, but it's like a fire just ripped through me and it only lasted an instant."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "Just exploded through my whole body, out the top, through my feet."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "And then it was gone, that was it."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "Weirdest thing I've ever felt in my entire life."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "Yeah, but it was as a result of, yeah, but it was as a result of what happened in the match and leading up to it, I had some kind of a release."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "To what it does, it almost, how did you interpret it psychologically?"}, {"time": 3588, "text": "Was it like some kind of, I mean, not to be spiritual or whatever, but some kind of superpower that was like, like a lingering feeling like, holy shit, I, you know."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "I can't, I can't explain it."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "And I haven't really tried hard enough to try to."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "But something changed."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "Something happened there, yeah."}, {"time": 3612, "text": "Something happened to me."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "I was sore for about three or four months afterwards."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "It's like it smoked out my entire body."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "Yeah, that whole summer I was kind of sore."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And yeah, and then after that, like two or three years later, that's when I won the world championships."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "Yeah, I mean, all the matches are, you know, you get something from people, like, you know, you study them, you take something from them."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "People have an invisible crown and he had one."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "And I think I took it from him."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "Maybe that was the feeling of wearing the crown."}, {"time": 3650, "text": "What about all the trash talk?"}, {"time": 3651, "text": "How much of that did you learn?"}, {"time": 3653, "text": "Does that come naturally to you?"}, {"time": 3654, "text": "You're one of the most charismatic, fun."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "I mean, there's always like respect behind it."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "I would say to me, and I'm a fan of a lot of sports, you're one of the greatest trash talkers in all of sports that I've ever seen because you're able to talk shit, but there's so much love and respect behind it."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "It's just masterful."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "But you also get into people's heads in the moment."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "It's beautiful to watch because it really gets to some people."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "It's a powerful weapon, right?"}, {"time": 3685, "text": "Your voice is a powerful, powerful weapon."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "And it's underutilized by so many athletes because they think that it's not sportsmanlike or something like that."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "But the truth is, I mean, you can be a weak person, but with your voice, you can influence and change any number of things."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "And the same thing happens in a fight between two people."}, {"time": 3712, "text": "If you can just be a never ending, you know, flow of negative encouragement to someone or, you know, suggestion, anything can happen."}, {"time": 3725, "text": "It's a tool."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "And when you're fighting a person, you're not just fighting them."}, {"time": 3733, "text": "You're fighting everyone who's watching."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "You're fighting the crowd, the referees."}, {"time": 3739, "text": "And, you know, to get in the most ideal positions, situations, you need to use your voice, yeah."}, {"time": 3747, "text": "Yeah, and there's, for people who haven't seen, I definitely recommend you watch a bunch of arm wrestling matches because there's a crowd really gets into it."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And it feels like there's a really intimate connection with the crowd."}, {"time": 3759, "text": "I suppose because the crowd is allowed to be very close to you."}, {"time": 3765, "text": "I want the crowd like right up on me."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "So sometimes, oh yeah."}, {"time": 3772, "text": "So who are you, whenever you talk to somebody, you literally pick somebody from the crowd?"}, {"time": 3779, "text": "Oh yeah, I'll fucking, like I'll start fucking off his fans and like, yeah, like I'll start talking to their wives or whatever."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "Yeah, yeah, there's Jody."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "She's pretty dangerous to listen to also."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "But yeah, one of his buddies, Mike Solares, who's, you know, really good arm wrestler, was cheering for him, so I started to go after him."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "Smiling the whole time."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "Yeah, it's fun, right?"}, {"time": 3809, "text": "It's a fan, it's fun to listen to, but it's also, what's fun is how much it actually affects some of the people you're facing."}, {"time": 3816, "text": "They get frustrated."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "It's great to see."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "Well, you have to fight, right?"}, {"time": 3820, "text": "Like a lot of people think things will be given to them."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "And the thing that, you know, I've always believed from the time I was very young,

well, this person is cheating, but everybody is like kind of trying to cheat, get an edge within the rules."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "So I try and just ramp it, ramp it, ramp it."}, {"time": 3904,

been a personal failure of mine because I've said things like, it's the highest level that you can do."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "And I don't believe that to be true anymore."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "But at the time, I thought it was the best way I could express my drives that I had, you know, to be a fighter."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "So your sense in the past and maybe in part now is that sort of fighting is when humans get a chance to express themselves deeply, like that mix of the bravery, the integrity, the, whatever that is that makes us human, that human spirit can really shine."},

starts to feel the same."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "But at the time, that, you know, expression to me was really, really awesome."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "I loved close quarter battle."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "That was my favorite thing."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "That's really the whole reason I was there."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "Can you describe close quarter battle?"}, {"time": 4363, "text": "Close quarter battle is team fighting."}, {"time": 4366, "text": "So, and it can look a lot of different ways, but basically it's ground troops doing something and it's ground troops doing some kind of a mission."}, {"time": 4380, "text": "And it's the orchestrated movement that is the skill."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "The orchestrated movement and the drills done quickly and accurately, it's very difficult to do."}, {"time": 4390, "text": "With communication?"}, {"time": 4391, "text": "With communication."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "Yeah, so it's basically cooperating together, communicating, there's some strategy, there's some adapting to the changing environment."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "And the more the team works together, the less communication there is."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "And that's an amazing thing to do, to be part of a machine, well, machine, a team of people who can fight together like that."}, {"time": 4415, "text": "I think it's, we're really designed to do it."}, {"time": 4419, "text": "Like, as good as we can fight as individuals, the thing that makes us really good is our ability to fight as a team."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "Yeah, that's one of the things that makes us really human is that collective intelligence, that social aspect."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "And fighting is the highest of stakes."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "So that social interaction under the highest of stakes is, really does bring out something that's deeply human."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "I mean, war in general brings out something deeply human."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "It's, I mean, obvious to say that it's tragic that it results in so much loss of life and well being."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "Let me, if it's okay, for a brief moment to take us back to arm wrestling."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "We did this offline, we talked about, you gave me some advice about arm wrestling."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "But maybe do a high level overview of the different styles and strategies that we've talked about."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "We talked about the importance of strength and power."}, {"time": 4486, "text": "But is there offensive, defensive styles?"}, {"time": 4489, "text": "Is there, we mentioned King's move."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "What would you classify your style as?"}, {"time": 4495, "text": "It's nice for people that don't know."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "Maybe even zoom back out."}, {"time": 4499, "text": "So arm wrestling is a sport where two people have to, when we talk about strictly the sport, put their elbow on a particular pad, means they have to keep that elbow on that pad."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "And they win when the back of one of their hands crosses some kind of, or basically touches the table."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "And when you actually lock up, you do so, depending on the organization, without straps, meaning there's just you, agree, it's like mutual agreement that you're going to clasp your hands in a way that's fair and there's a referee that helps ensure that it's fair."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "But of course there's these little games going on."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "And then when you actually go all out with this battle, if there's no straps, you can slip out."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "So often you'll put the straps, which means you're, it's like marriage, you're committed for, like somebody will have to lose essentially."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "There's no pulling out."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "So that's sort of the battle within that."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "What are the different styles that you can speak to that people that don't know arm wrestling could understand?"}, {"time": 4577, "text": "Yeah, we can start to kind of just dance around the subject a bit."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "I'd say there's a lot of different types."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "There's specialists and there's kind of blenders and people who are very versatile."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "A lot of guys win world championships on one singular move."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "They get just extremely crisp at say a hook or a top roll."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "And their style is very kind of focused."}, {"time": 4606, "text": "And you'll see it with a lot of athletes, like kind of a talk about guy who's very active, a guy called Jerry Cataret."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "As soon as you think Jerry Cataret, he's got a very unique style."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "He's got a flop wrist press."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "So most of his technique is built around this one system."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "Flop wrist means what it sounds like."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "Your wrist is flopped, so it looks like you're losing."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "So he is pushing from a losing position."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "No, he will be offensive."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "So he will be in a press, so offensively, so he'll give his hand away so that he can get his shoulder behind it properly."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "So he doesn't, wow."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "So you can press, press means push."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "Push, yeah, without having that hook position."}, {"time": 4656, "text": "Which is what most people are always looking for."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "And Jerry's looking for it as well."}, {"time": 4661, "text": "And then, so example, there's another one."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "There's another specialist, Matt Mask."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "He's a top roller, right?"}, {"time": 4668, "text": "Basically, that's his great move is a top roll."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "And his other weapons aren't nearly as powerful."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "Just incredible top roll."}, {"time": 4677, "text": "And then you have a lot of athletes that are more blended."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "They have a lot of good options."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "I think that I probably fall more into that category."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "You have people who are more speed guys, okay?"}, {"time": 4690, "text": "So they try and do very little, I call it attrition, right?"}, {"time": 4697, "text": "So a lot of people are very willing to trade energy, right?"}, {"time": 4701, "text": "Because they have faith that their gas tank or their pool eventually will tire the other person out."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "So anytime there's a trade, they'll trade."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "Whereas a guy like Travis Bajan, he was very, very well known as being extremely explosive, right?"}, {"time": 4718, "text": "But if the match stops, typically he's gonna lose."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "All right, so based off of your genetics, your hands, there's a lot of ways to skin it."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "So I think you said something like you're a 22nd guy."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "That's right, I'm a 22nd guy."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "So what are the seconds we're talking about?"}, {"time": 4743, "text": "So a lot of the power people, they want to win in the first maybe five seconds, like just that first push, that first press."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "Absolutely, right to the pad, yeah."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "And so you're trying to hold off that attack."}, {"time": 4757, "text": "Yeah, if I beat you in a second, we're not in the same world, yeah."}, {"time": 4761, "text": "But when I'm with my peer group, I will typically win 20 seconds and beyond."}, {"time": 4768, "text": "That's a typical win for me when I'm with a peer."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "Whereas other guys, when they're with their peers, they'll win in a second, right?"}, {"time": 4777, "text": "That's how they do it, that's the way they're built, that's the way they train."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "Yeah, most guys at a higher level at all starts to kind of, it starts to get more and more difficult to be a specialist at the high level now."}, {"time": 4791, "text": "Some people just have little holes in their games."}, {"time": 4796, "text": "It's rare to get someone who can really do all the moves."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "Where would you put Levan?"}, {"time": 4806, "text": "I would not say he's a specialist."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "I'd say his top roll is his strongest move."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "Top roll?"}, {"time": 4812, "text": "Top roll is his strongest move, yeah."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "And the interesting thing about the specialist versus the blender, there's a counter, right?"}, {"time": 4823, "text": "Every move has a move that theoretically should be the right choice."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "So if you're a single move guy, there's gonna be a guy out there who'll get you."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "Yeah, it'll be very difficult for you to beat that guy."}, {"time": 4839, "text": "But when you come to a tournament, typically specialists do much better in tournament scenarios because their singular move can get them through a tournament very quickly and efficiently."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "Whereas you get a blender in a tournament, they typically will have longer and more difficult matches."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "And by, oh, right, yeah."}, {"time": 4860, "text": "But in supermatch format, typically blenders do better."}, {"time": 4866, "text": "So we offline also talked about arm sumo or freedom arm wrestling."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "I don't know how you wanna call it."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "Oh, I love freedom."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "Well, exactly, North American way."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "So this is this idea, and I watched a few videos, and it looks fun, is basically removing the restriction of having to keep your elbow on the pad and just being able to arm wrestle over the whole table."}, {"time": 4895, "text": "I think you've mentioned that the criticism that gets is it might be injury prone or something like that."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "So can you describe this arm sumo, freedom arm wrestling idea?"}, {"time": 4905, "text": "When you come to freedom arm wrestling, basically it removes the limitation of a standard arm wrestling table."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "So basically every single thing is a freedom arm wrestling table."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "Some are better than others."}, {"time": 4917, "text": "So looking for that nice table where we can kind of stand apart from each other and we're anatomically in a fairly safe position."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "And the rules in freedom, the way you win, is the knuckles must either touch the tabletop or you hold it off the edge for a three count."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "So this is the main way to win."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "Yes, you can foul, like if you lift your elbow up, it's still a foul, but you have the entire playing surface."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "So your elbow's no longer limited to your seven by seven or seven by nine pad, so you can move it all over the table."}, {"time": 4950, "text": "You can move your body around the table a bit too."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "And if it's a big table, your body could largely be on the table."}, {"time": 4958, "text": "Yeah, so basically it's like adjusting your ring size."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "So arm wrestling, you're fighting in a phone booth, right?"}, {"time": 4964, "text": "So you're fighting in a field, you're fighting just bigger."}, {"time": 4967, "text": "So it just makes the sport bigger."}, {"time": 4970, "text": "Yeah, this is Japan."}, {"time": 4971, "text": "But even on a small table, even in a slightly larger phone booth, you can get a lot more fun and variety."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "It's very interesting to watch."}, {"time": 4981, "text": "I think it makes the sport bigger."}, {"time": 4982, "text": "I actually believe that it's the future of the sport."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "Because it makes it more accessible."}, {"time": 4988, "text": "Like you don't need the equipment."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "You can do it at a bar, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4991, "text": "Yeah, less equipment requirements."}, {"time": 4995, "text": "Most kids start freedom."}, {"time": 4996, "text": "Like most kids arm wrestle on school desks."}, {"time": 4999, "text": "And like if you see a guy on the street, you're like, whatever, you can arm wrestle anywhere."}, {"time": 5003, "text": "You don't need to bring your table around with you."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "If we talked about the elite level, if somebody was interested in starting in arm wrestling or going from just like, you go to the gym, you kind of lift, you've arm wrestled a few times, trying to get better at it, trying to learn."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "How would you advise getting better to where you can beat your closest buddies?"}, {"time": 5031, "text": "That first step."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "First step, I'd say find people."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "Find people."}, {"time": 5037, "text": "Find good people."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "Well, get with a club."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "Get with people who know what they're doing, who can mentor you."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "I realized there's a club in Austin."}, {"time": 5049, "text": "I'm sure there's in a lot of places."}, {"time": 5050, "text": "Oh, they're everywhere."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "We got this app called Armbet."}, {"time": 5055, "text": "Which is a app that helps you find other people there."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "Yeah, very easy."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "But I mean, they're all over social networks."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "I mean, it's kind of widespread now."}, {"time": 5064, "text": "But yeah, find people."}, {"time": 5066, "text": "Find people and it's just much easier to learn with another person and you'll get stronger that way."}, {"time": 5073, "text": "But I mean, do the lifts."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "I mean, if you go to the gym, just start doing the lifts."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "And right away, those will technically prepare you."}, {"time": 5082, "text": "What are the lifts?"}, {"time": 5084, "text": "Can we describe what the first one is?"}, {"time": 5085, "text": "Yeah, so I'd say if you wanna just keep it very, very simple, let's just talk about three."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "There's much more than three."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "But when you talk about energy allocation, these three lifts, in my opinion, should be like 90% of your investment."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "It's very big, these three lifts."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "And the exact percentages, you can argue about it, but we'll start off with the cupping of the wrist."}, {"time": 5114, "text": "Just this, it's a simple thing."},

5126, "text": "Because any good armrest is gonna attack your fingers."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "So like open hand."}, {"time": 5131, "text": "Well, I mean, for health, yes, you could."}, {"time": 5133, "text": "But if you wanna be really specific, you train exactly the way you would at a table."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "In the position that you actually start that match."}, {"time": 5140,

aiming for that pin pad."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "The center."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "The chest up here."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "Bring it close to you."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "Make it come close to you, right?"}, {"time": 5159, "text": "You see like whenever I do my exercises, the vector is always pulling straight towards me."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "Yeah, so just cupping close to you."}, {"time": 5170, "text": "The most dangerous thing that a person can do to me on an armwrestling match is just pull me away from my body."}, {"time": 5175, "text": "That's a terrible thing for me."}, {"time": 5177, "text": "Yeah, so that cupping, that's a massive part of the sport."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "So now when you think what does the cup do to the other person, if I cup, they get turned over."}, {"time": 5193, "text": "So this has to get really strong."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "This pronation."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "So to fight that rolling."}, {"time": 5204, "text": "So that's through the thumb."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "Oh, so you put, got it, you put on the thumb and you put this motion."}, {"time": 5215, "text": "So those two things, those two things together, this cupping and rolling, this is what's gonna make the person's hand bend back, and once the person's hand is bent back, just their whole game gets cut to pieces."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "They have very little good options."}, {"time": 5229, "text": "It's all like nasty stuff."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "Yeah, so those two things, that's a huge part of your investment."}, {"time": 5239, "text":

art wrestler."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "So bands would be good for this?"}, {"time": 5255, "text": "Bands are great because they're easy to transport."}, {"time": 5257, "text": "The only problem I have with bands is like if you like to measure, you know, and if you like to be precise, bands just aren't that precise."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "Right, so to have growth."}, {"time": 5267, "text": "Just, I mean, it's just like, you know, you know exactly what you need, the prescription is kind of, a band is kind of like, and a lot of people, myself included, I like to know exactly my outputs, so weights."}, {"time": 5282, "text": "So would it be like cables?"}, {"time": 5285, "text": "Cables are nice."}, {"time": 5286, "text": "Bands are great, too."}, {"time": 5287, "text": "I mix the two."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "Bands are when I kind of don't need to, they're more like easy for me."}, {"time": 5295, "text": "When I train bands, bands are dangerous because the acceleration is so high on them."}, {"time": 5300, "text": "Like when you screw up with band training, the acceleration is way faster than gravity, right?"}, {"time": 5305, "text": "So if you do something bad, it can make it go really much worse."}, {"time": 5310, "text": "It's funny that you didn't mention bicep curls or."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "Well, it's a chain."}, {"time": 5316, "text": "It's a chain."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "And so you're, I mean, the idea if you focus on these three, the other stuff catches up, like it's all involved."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "This whole thing is involved."}, {"time": 5325, "text": "So if you have an ax, right, the blade of the ax, that's these things, right?"}, {"time": 5334, "text": "Like you need the pointy end of all your attacks to be awesome, right?"}, {"time": 5339, "text": "If you have a super sharp ax, you could have a shitty handle."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "Yeah, so focus on that, the tip of the ax."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "Yeah, the tip of the ax is so important, right?"}, {"time": 5351, "text": "Like if I have an awesome bicep and I can't quite use it, what's it good for, right?"}, {"time": 5356, "text": "Yeah, I think a lot of the motions with the wrist that you mentioned are, just thinking about jiu jitsu, especially in the gi, there's a lot of, I mean, there's so much importance to this, and people don't often work it explicitly."}, {"time": 5372, "text": "So many of the chokes require ability to, it's almost like exactly like arm wrestling."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "Very close."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "Because you're weak here, what's that called, flop wrist, and you're strong with the cup, yeah."}, {"time": 5385, "text": "And so just getting the, whatever that's involved, the muscle, the turning, the pressure, because that's where also the choke comes."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "That little, the thing that makes you win in arm wrestling is also the thing that finishes the person when you have them grabbed."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "The strength is very similar."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "Yeah, it's fascinating, actually."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "Of course, like you said, if you wanna be very good, you should be doing the very specific exact motion."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "Yeah, so if I was gonna do jiu jitsu, I'd be like working out with the gi."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "Yeah, the problem is, you know, it's difficult to construct the exact, so you have to actually go with people, and then they don't like being choked on, right?"}, {"time": 5428, "text": "So like it's hard to, I'm actually a big, we have these kinds of debates all the time, is, you know, I'm a big believer in drilling."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "I love doing something thousands of times."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "Like John Donahoe is somebody I mentioned to you about who, the jiu jitsu folks here, they're less believers in drilling."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "They see the value of almost like the mind of going live and exploring ideas."}, {"time": 5455, "text": "It's that play."}, {"time": 5456, "text": "You don't need to do the thing a thousand times."}, {"time": 5458, "text": "You just need to

volume."}, {"time": 5482, "text": "You can play a lot."}, {"time": 5485, "text": "Well, that's the, if you really wanna get it good is you're talking about, I mean, that's why a lot of these folks are training three times a day."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "They're doing, you know, they're putting in the hours, eight hours, nine hours, just."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "Well, that's tough, oh my God."}, {"time": 5501, "text": "Well, so there are a lot of them are not going hard."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "It's just being on the mat."}, {"time": 5505, "text": "Some of it is just sitting there talking through ideas, watching others or teaching, explaining stuff."}, {"time": 5510, "text": "It's just, it's like, it's not just physical."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "It's mental too, because you're keeping in your mind."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "And some of the greatest, they talk about the wrestlers I've talked with, the fighters, at the top of their career, they basically, George St. Pierre is like this, another fellow Canadian, is like, has stick figures in his head that he can't help."}, {"time": 5537, "text": "They're like in there, because if you train enough hours, you're, it's just gonna be in your head and they're all going to be playing around in your head."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "And some little detail over time, it's almost like computing or something like that."}, {"time": 5549, "text": "And that ends up having a result even though you're not physically doing anything."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "It's always in there."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "I do have to return to diet real quick."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "I know we talk about pancakes."}, {"time": 5562, "text": "Let me, quite seriously, you are one of the, I mean, strongest athletes in the world for your sport."}, {"time": 5574, "text": "So you have to get big, you have to get powerful, you have to get strong."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "What is the right diet for you for that?"}, {"time": 5582, "text": "Like, what do you eat?"}, {"time": 5584, "text": "How often do you eat, yeah, from the highest detail to the smallest, or the things that make you happy and feel good?"},

like a bodybuilder, you know, you name it, I've probably tried it, I don't believe that it's as important in the sport of arm wrestling as it is perhaps in other sports."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "I believe that, I mean, just to be very basic, I mean, if you're eating enough food, you're probably gonna be okay."}, {"time": 5632, "text": "So it's just calories."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "I mean, really, I mean, not to overcomplicate it, but I mean, that's where the conversation starts where you're eating enough food."}, {"time": 5641, "text": "And it can come in any number of ways, and I don't think it's as important as a lot of other people do."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "I'm certainly irresponsible in a lot, but the thing is, back to like, volume, right?"}, {"time": 5657, "text": "Like, you need to, like, if you wanna be a super heavyweight, it's very different than if you wanna be a weight category guy."}, {"time": 5666, "text": "If you wanna be a weight category guy, I'd say that you need to be more responsible, make better choices."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "If you wanna be a super heavyweight, everything."}, {"time": 5676, "text": "Just so we're watching a delicious looking omelet, so eggs, bacon, syrup, so you don't care, carbs."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "So in all the things you try, so I mostly eat meat now."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "And I landed on that, there's several things, obviously I'm not, but I do a lot of sport."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "And I was very surprised how my particular, very specific body could perform better with only meat."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "Why better?"}, {"time": 5701, "text": "The sports I do, the mind matters."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "And so for some reason, my mind's just clear."}, {"time": 5706, "text": "And I don't think, because it feels unhealthy."}, {"time": 5709, "text": "It just makes me feel really good."}, {"time": 5710, "text": "I don't think I would recommend it to anybody else."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "So it's interesting that that journey of just exploring can take you to figure out something about your own self."}, {"time": 5722, "text": "One of the most interesting things that I heard about nutrition was, I heard there was a."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "Actually, Doritos, I forgot about that."}, {"time": 5731, "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm an idiot."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "Now, I'd say over the last couple of years, I've really gone into carbs a lot and high glycemic carbs."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "And just to, I feel like it's one of the best things you can do if you're working out really hard."}, {"time": 5745, "text": "Just add carbs, yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 5748, "text": "But, oh, where was I?"}, {"time": 5755, "text": "So you've added, syrup is so delicious it's distracting."}, {"time": 5759, "text": "No, so you've added the high glycemic carbs into the mix."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "So those help, but that's for mass building."}, {"time": 5766, "text": "Right, so there was a study that I heard about by somebody who was trying to identify heart attacks."}, {"time": 5772, "text": "They did this great big study."}, {"time": 5774, "text": "And at the end of it, I mean, didn't matter what the people ate, the most important thing was how they felt about the food that they were eating."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "Yeah, so if you believe in the food, if you believe that it's gonna do good things for you, if you allocate it the right way, it's gonna have a positive impact."}, {"time": 5795, "text": "And I try and do that no matter what it is."}, {"time": 5797, "text": "Like I have my foods that I think do certain things."}, {"time": 5800, "text": "And so, you know, for me, I know that, actually, I mean, I learned about corn fed pumps when I was overseas."}, {"time": 5810, "text": "I realized that I never used to eat crap, really didn't."}, {"time": 5815, "text": "I ate super clean all the time."}, {"time": 5818, "text": "And when I was faced with imminent death more, I would be like, okay, I'm going out tonight, let's have a couple ice cream bars."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "You know, like whatever."}, {"time": 5832, "text": "And what I realized is if I eat like an entire bag of chips or like, you know, a bunch of chocolate bars, and then I go and have a workout, my workout will be incredible."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "It'll be incredible."}, {"time": 5850, "text": "There's something about easily processed carbohydrates that will continue to quickly get into your blood as fast as you can burn it."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "And there's something about that that will give you incredible blood flow, yeah."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "And also your mind plugging in, enjoying that."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "And then believing it works, and that's how it makes it work better."}, {"time": 5879, "text": "I mean, I feel that way."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "I think this is really not, this has been frustrating to me about the health culture in the United States in the studies that are done."}, {"time": 5889, "text": "You know, you look at like the importance of sleep, the importance of X diet, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5896, "text": "I wish incorporated into that would be your mental relationship with all of these things."}, {"time": 5902, "text": "So for example, people that tell me, well, your sleep schedule is insane."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "Yes, perhaps."}, {"time": 5908, "text": "But also, it's insane because I'm doing what I love and I don't see it as a problem."}, {"time": 5915, "text": "And I think that's really important to understand."}, {"time": 5918, "text": "If you sleeping crazy hours is not affecting your stress and is actually making you happy or you're drawing some kind of source of happiness and pleasure and satisfaction, like being awake when others aren't."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "It's like the Mike Tyson thing or something, like training when you've convinced yourself everybody's sleeping and therefore you're somehow training much better."}, {"time": 5944, "text": "That's powerful even if you look statistically six hours may be worse than eight hours or four hours may be worse than six hours."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "So the mind is a powerful thing."}, {"time": 5954, "text": "Super powerful."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "But if you want to be a super heavyweight."}, {"time": 5958, "text": "Eat."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "You got to eat like stupid amounts all the time, yeah."}, {"time": 5963, "text": "You have to test your digestive system."}, {"time": 5965, "text": "What's your favorite meal by the way?"}, {"time": 5966, "text": "Just if you had to, you know, your last meal."}, {"time": 5969, "text": "I am, I do, oh geez, I like so much food, it's tough."}, {"time": 5974, "text": "But I'd say the food that I rely on a lot when I'm getting ready to compete is sushi."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "Just because it normally comes in an all you can eat format, you know."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "So I love to go and just binge all you can eat buffets."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "Sushi is just super convenient."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "If I was a sushi all you can eat buffet place I'd be terrified when I saw you."}, {"time": 5998, "text": "Have you had barbecue at Texas?"}, {"time": 6001, "text": "Yeah, I love it, I love it, yeah."}, {"time": 6003, "text": "So you, just a small tangent on this."}, {"time": 6006, "text": "You faced The Mountain for Bjornsson."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "Well first of all you arm wrestled him."}, {"time": 6012, "text": "It's interesting to ask, so this is The Mountain from the Game of Thrones, a strong man, one of the strongest people in the world, for a time the strongest person in the world."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "What was it like, I know sort of you guys maybe weren't going 1,000%, but what's it like?"}, {"time": 6028, "text": "Well he probably wasn't going 1,000%."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "But like what, it's interesting to think what does that strength feel like?"}, {"time": 6036, "text": "So it's a specialized strength in another sport."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "What, how strong was he, what are some kind of deep insights you've drawn from that battle?"}, {"time": 6050, "text": "I feel like if we were to go back 1,000 years and if you give him armor and a two handed sword he will just rip across the landscape."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "And no one will stop him."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "So this is the boxing match you came to, but there's also a video of them arm wrestling."}, {"time": 6072, "text": "Yeah, what a titan though, what a titan."}, {"time": 6075, "text": "A guy like that, tall, strong, fit, disciplined."}, {"time": 6081, "text": "I mean he is quite a warrior."}, {"time": 6084, "text": "419 pounds?"}, {"time": 6085, "text": "Yeah, yeah, he's incredibly impressive."}, {"time": 6089, "text": "I really like Hap Thor and I like Eddie Hall too."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "And I was just so, I'm just so caught up with the drama."}, {"time": 6098, "text": "Okay, so Eddie Hall and Hap Thor Bjornsson, two of the strongest legendary strongmen that we have."}, {"time": 6108, "text": "And they were the coolest, they were the top when strongman was really super cool."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "I don't know all the details, but they legit hit each other."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "Like legit."}, {"time": 6120, "text": "So I think it kind of stems, I don't know, like I say, I'm not right there with them, but Eddie won the World's Strongest Man event or something one year and the thing is, one of those victories where Hap Thor was not accepting of his defeat."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "Okay, and there was a little bit of back and forth."}, {"time": 6142, "text": "And basically from what I understand, they were gonna fight the knight of the World's Strongest Man."}, {"time": 6147, "text": "And they kind of got pulled apart and this heat between them got translated into a potential boxing match."}, {"time": 6155, "text": "So it's very real."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "It's a very real fight."}, {"time": 6158, "text": "So you have the two strongest dudes on the planet are gonna fight each other."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "So I've been like, you know, because arm wrestling and strongman, it's kind of similar communities."}, {"time": 6169, "text": "Who do you got?"}, {"time": 6171, "text": "If you were giving me financial advice in the middle of the fight."}, {"time": 6175, "text": "I am so bad, I always call it wrong."}, {"time": 6177, "text": "They're very different."}, {"time": 6179, "text": "I see Hap Thor as being, you know, more."}, {"time": 6183, "text": "Eddie Hall slimming down, is that what you mean as well?"}, {"time": 6186, "text": "I see Hap Thor as a bit more regimented, but I see Eddie Hall as like way more barbaric and like, I think he's a little bit more athletic, but Hap Thor is bigger and, you know, they've chosen slightly different paths to prepare for the match."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "But what happened was like, they were about to fight and Eddie Hall blew his bicep."}, {"time": 6211, "text": "So me, I was getting ready for Levan in December."}, {"time": 6214, "text": "We were supposed to arm wrestle in December, but he's got his movie."}, {"time": 6218,

6227, "text": "You stepped in."}, {"time": 6228, "text": "An opportunity to fight."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "I'm like, I'll do it, so."}, {"time": 6230, "text": "How much training, you trained a little bit, so can you tell about your own decision to do that?"}, {"time": 6236, "text": "What was the training like?"}, {"time": 6237, "text": "What was the experience like?"}, {"time": 6238, "text": "Oh, it was so much fun."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "So basically, I made a funny video and I sent it to the organizers of Core Sports that I would do it."}, {"time": 6249, "text": "I'm like, I'll do it."}, {"time": 6250, "text": "I'm sure they got a thousand people who wanted to do it."}, {"time": 6253, "text": "But I'm like, listen, I'm an old man."}, {"time": 6256, "text": "Like I'm gimped up like everywhere outside the arm wrestling lanes."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "I said, but I will 100%."}, {"time": 6263, "text": "Like if you let me fight them, I'll give it my all."}, {"time": 6266, "text": "And whatever, they didn't get back to me."}, {"time": 6269, "text": "They're like, yeah, whatever, okay."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "So then they call me on a Friday, like five weeks before the event, and they're like, hey, Devin, were you serious?"}, {"time": 6279, "text": "And I'm like, oh, shit."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "And I'm like, yes, I was serious."}, {"time": 6286, "text": "Yeah, I'll do it."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "And they're like, okay, they're like, it's down to you and like two other people we'll get back to you in a day or two, but you would do it."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "So they got back to me on Sunday, like, so right away I'm like skipping rope."}, {"time": 6303, "text": "And I'm like, and I'm so, I only arm wrestle legs."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "That's all I do."}, {"time": 6307, "text": "So what was your, you did some striking training."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "Yeah, so I went to this guy that he was awesome, Zach, Ben Bushida there, that was it from TriStar."}, {"time": 6319, "text": "Do you know for us the hobby and that's."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "And yes, people in the comments, I will interview him on this podcast and people can."}, {"time": 6326, "text": "He's brilliant, right?"}, {"time": 6328, "text": "He's an incredible guy."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "So right away, like I had no idea about the fight community across Canada really."}, {"time": 6333, "text": "And I got like by the fifth message that said you must train with Feras."}, {"time": 6340, "text": "I was like, okay, called him up."},

real."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "Like as scary as Thor is, like there's guys in that TriStar gym that don't look like anything that would murder me much worse, much worse."}, {"time": 6670, "text":

a negative perspective on it."}, {"time": 6963, "text": "And then mortality?"}, {"time": 6964, "text": "Yeah, just think, well, now you just, you can get all those things done that you want to do."},

important topic."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "Do you actually think about this has been an increased interest, and there's been increased UFO sightings and encounters, all that kind of stuff, the US

what they pass on, your kids."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "But I think that you are quite special because you're part of this thing that's potentially giving birth to the next thing."}, {"time": 7189,

the world."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "You think that they'll take us with them?"}, {"time": 7287, "text": "Yeah, I think so because I, so there's this fear of robots that they become super intelligent and run away from us humans, and basically become so intelligent and then they almost just not giving a damn will destroy us."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "But I think in order for robots to become intelligent, they have to integrate themselves with society."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "So they, by the very nature of how they become intelligent, have to bring us along."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "So it's not that there'll be this separate thing."}, {"time": 7322, "text": "They have to, like, we'll have robots in the home."}, {"time": 7325, "text": "Well, they'll be interacting with us."},

be developing smarter and smarter as, like, sentient beings by themselves."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "I think that's very difficult to do."}, {"time": 7352, "text": "You have to be doing that together

cyborgs, right?"}, {"time": 7363, "text": "With the phones and so on, but more and more."}, {"time": 7366, "text": "So with Elon and Neuralink, deeper integration of robots and AI into, like, increasing the bandwidth at which they can communicate."}, {"time": 7376, "text": "So if we do implants in the brain, I think, again, a lot of people are really nervous about this, as am I, but I
