really deep fundamental understanding."}, {"time": 386, "text": "And that's what gives us such confidence in rockets."}, {"time": 390, "text": "And my vision is that in the future, all machine learning systems that actually have impact on people's lives will be understood at a really, really deep level."}, {"time": 403, "text": "So we trust them, not because some sales rep told us to, but because they've earned our trust."}, {"time": 410, "text": "And really safety critical things even prove that they will always do what we expect them to do."}, {"time": 415, "text": "That's very much the physics mindset."}, {"time": 417, "text": "So it's interesting, if you look at big breakthroughs that have happened in machine learning this year, from dancing robots, it's pretty fantastic."}, {"time": 428, "text": "Not just because it's cool, but if you just think about not that many years ago, this YouTube video at this DARPA challenge with the MIT robot comes out of the car and face plants."}, {"time": 440, "text": "How far we've come in just a few years."}, {"time": 443, "text": "Similarly, Alpha Fold 2, crushing the protein folding problem."}, {"time": 451, "text": "We can talk more about implications for medical research and stuff."}, {"time": 454, "text": "But hey, that's huge progress."}, {"time": 459, "text": "You can look at the GPT3 that can spout off English text, which sometimes really, really blows you away."}, {"time": 468, "text": "You can look at DeepMind's MuZero, which doesn't just kick our butt in Go and Chess and Shogi, but also in all these Atari games."}, {"time": 479, "text": "And you don't even have to teach it the rules now."}, {"time": 482, "text": "What all of those have in common is, besides being powerful, is we don't fully understand how they work."}, {"time": 490, "text": "And that's fine if it's just some dancing robots."}, {"time": 493, "text": "And the worst thing that can happen is they face plant."}, {"time": 496, "text": "Or if they're playing Go, and the worst thing that can happen is that they make a bad move and lose the game."}, {"time": 502, "text": "It's less fine if that's what's controlling your self driving car or your nuclear power plant."}, {"time": 509, "text": "And we've seen already that even though Hollywood had all these movies where they try to make us worry about the wrong things, like machines turning evil, the actual bad things that have happened with automation have not been machines turning evil."}, {"time": 525, "text": "They've been caused by overtrust in things we didn't understand as well as we thought we did."}, {"time": 531, "text": "Even very simple automated systems like what Boeing put into the 737 MAX killed a lot of people."}, {"time": 540, "text": "Was it that that little simple system was evil?"}, {"time": 543, "text": "But we didn't understand it as well as we should have."}, {"time": 547, "text": "And we trusted without understanding."}, {"time": 551, "text": "That's the overtrust."}, {"time": 552, "text": "We didn't even understand that we didn't understand."}, {"time": 555, "text": "The humility is really at the core of being a scientist."}, {"time": 559, "text": "I think step one, if you want to be a scientist, is don't ever fool yourself into thinking you understand things when you actually don't."}, {"time": 567, "text": "That's probably good advice for humans in general."}, {"time": 569, "text": "I think humility in general can do us good."}, {"time": 571, "text": "But in science, it's so spectacular."}, {"time": 573, "text": "Why did we have the wrong theory of gravity ever from Aristotle onward until Galileo's time?"}, {"time": 580, "text": "Why would we believe something so dumb as that if I throw this water bottle, it's going to go up with constant speed until it realizes that its natural motion is down?"}, {"time": 589, "text": "It changes its mind."}, {"time": 591, "text": "Because people just kind of assumed Aristotle was right."}, {"time": 595, "text": "He's an authority."}, {"time": 596, "text": "We understand that."}, {"time": 597, "text": "Why did we believe things like that the sun is going around the Earth?"}, {"time": 601, "text": "Why did we believe that time flows at the same rate for everyone until Einstein?"}, {"time": 606, "text": "Same exact mistake over and over again."}, {"time": 608, "text": "We just weren't humble enough to acknowledge that we actually didn't know for sure."}, {"time": 613, "text": "We assumed we knew."}, {"time": 615, "text": "So we didn't discover the truth because we assumed there was nothing there to be discovered, right?"}, {"time": 620, "text": "There was something to be discovered about the 737 Max."}, {"time": 624, "text": "And if you had been a bit more suspicious and tested it better, we would have found it."}, {"time": 628, "text": "And it's the same thing with most harm that's been done by automation so far, I would say."}, {"time": 633, "text": "So I don't know if you heard here of a company called Knight Capital?"}, {"time": 638, "text": "That means you didn't invest in them earlier."}, {"time": 642, "text": "They deployed this automated trading system, all nice and shiny."}, {"time": 647, "text": "They didn't understand it as well as they thought."}, {"time": 649, "text": "And it went about losing $10 million per minute for 44 minutes straight until someone presumably was like, oh, no, shut this up."}, {"time": 659, "text": "Was it evil?"}, {"time": 661, "text": "It was, again, misplaced trust, something they didn't fully understand, right?"}, {"time": 665, "text": "And there have been so many, even when people have been killed by robots, which is quite rare still, but in factory accidents, it's in every single case been not malice, just that the robot didn't understand that a human is different from an auto part or whatever."}, {"time": 684, "text": "So this is why I think there's so much opportunity for a physics approach, where you just aim for a higher level of understanding."}, {"time": 693, "text": "And if you look at all these systems that we talked about from reinforcement learning systems and dancing robots to all these neural networks that power GPT3 and go playing software and stuff, they're all basically black boxes, not so different from if you teach a human something, you have no idea how their brain works, right?"}, {"time": 718, "text": "Except the human brain, at least, has been error corrected during many, many centuries of evolution in a way that some of these systems have not, right?"}, {"time": 727, "text": "And my MIT research is entirely focused on demystifying this black box, intelligible intelligence is my slogan."}, {"time": 735, "text": "That's a good line, intelligible intelligence."}, {"time": 738, "text": "Yeah, that we shouldn't settle for something that seems intelligent, but it should be intelligible so that we actually trust it because we understand it, right?"}, {"time": 746, "text": "Like, again, Elon trusts his rockets because he understands Newton's laws and thrust and how everything works."}, {"time": 753, "text": "And can I tell you why I'm optimistic about this?"}, {"time": 757, "text": "I think we've made a bit of a mistake where some people still think that somehow we're never going to understand neural networks."}, {"time": 767, "text": "We're just going to have to learn to live with this."}, {"time": 769, "text": "It's this very powerful black box."}, {"time": 772, "text": "Basically, for those who haven't spent time building their own, it's super simple what happens inside."}, {"time": 779, "text": "You send in a long list of numbers, and then you do a bunch of operations on them, multiply by matrices, et cetera, et cetera, and some other numbers come out that's output of it."}, {"time": 789, "text": "And then there are a bunch of knobs you can tune."}, {"time": 793, "text": "And when you change them, it affects the computation, the input output relation."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And then you just give the computer some definition of good, and it keeps optimizing these knobs until it performs as good as possible."}, {"time": 804, "text": "And often, you go like, wow, that's really good."}, {"time": 807, "text": "This robot can dance, or this machine is beating me at chess now."}, {"time": 811, "text": "And in the end, you have something which, even though you can look inside it, you have very little idea of how it works."}, {"time": 818, "text": "You can print out tables of all the millions of parameters in there."}, {"time": 823, "text": "Is it crystal clear now how it's working?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "Many of my colleagues seem willing to settle for that."}, {"time": 829, "text": "And I'm like, no, that's like the halfway point."}, {"time": 834, "text": "Some have even gone as far as sort of guessing that the mistrutability of this is where some of the power comes from, and some sort of mysticism."}, {"time": 845, "text": "I think that's total nonsense."}, {"time": 846, "text": "I think the real power of neural networks comes not from inscrutability, but from differentiability."}, {"time": 855, "text": "And what I mean by that is simply that the output changes only smoothly if you tweak your knobs."}, {"time": 863, "text": "And then you can use all these powerful methods we have for optimization in science."}, {"time": 868, "text": "We can just tweak them a little bit and see, did that get better or worse?"}, {"time": 871, "text": "That's the fundamental idea of machine learning, that the machine itself can keep optimizing until it gets better."}, {"time": 877, "text": "Suppose you wrote this algorithm instead in Python or some other programming language, and then what the knobs did was they just changed random letters in your code."}, {"time": 889, "text": "Now it would just epically fail."}, {"time": 891, "text": "You change one thing, and instead of saying print, it says, synth, syntax error."}, {"time": 896, "text": "You don't even know, was that for the better or for the worse, right?"}, {"time": 899, "text": "This, to me, is what I believe is the fundamental power of neural networks."}, {"time": 905, "text": "And just to clarify, the changing of the different letters in a program would not be a differentiable process."}, {"time": 910, "text": "It would make it an invalid program, typically."}, {"time": 913, "text": "And then you wouldn't even know if you changed more letters if it would make it work again, right?"}, {"time": 918, "text": "So that's the magic of neural networks, the inscrutability."}, {"time": 923, "text": "The differentiability, that every setting of the parameters is a program, and you can tell is it better or worse, right?"}, {"time": 931, "text": "So you don't like the poetry of the mystery of neural networks as the source of its power?"}, {"time": 935, "text": "I generally like poetry, but."}, {"time": 937, "text": "Not in this case."}, {"time": 939, "text": "It's so misleading."}, {"time": 940, "text": "And above all, it shortchanges us."}, {"time": 942, "text": "It makes us underestimate the good things we can accomplish."}, {"time": 947, "text": "So what we've been doing in my group is basically step one, train the mysterious neural network to do something well."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And then step two, do some additional AI techniques to see if we can now transform this black box into something equally intelligent that you can actually understand."}, {"time": 967, "text": "So for example, I'll give you one example, this AI Feynman project that we just published, right?"}, {"time": 971, "text": "So we took the 100 most famous or complicated equations from one of my favorite physics textbooks, in fact, the one that got me into physics in the first place, the Feynman lectures on physics."}, {"time": 985, "text": "And so you have a formula."}, {"time": 988, "text": "Maybe it has what goes into the formula as six different variables, and then what comes out as one."}, {"time": 995, "text": "So then you can make a giant Excel spreadsheet with seven columns."}, {"time": 999, "text": "You put in just random numbers for the six columns for those six input variables, and then you calculate with a formula the seventh column, the output."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So maybe it's like the force equals in the last column some function of the other."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "And now the task is, OK, if I don't tell you what the formula was, can you figure that out from looking at my spreadsheet I gave you?"}, {"time": 1020, "text": "This problem is called symbolic regression."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "If I tell you that the formula is what we call a linear formula, so it's just that the output is sum of all the things, input, the times, some constants, that's the famous easy problem we can solve."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "We do it all the time in science and engineering."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "But the general one, if it's more complicated functions with logarithms or cosines or other math, it's a very, very hard one and probably impossible to do fast in general, just because the number of formulas with n symbols just grows exponentially, just like the number of passwords you can make grow dramatically with length."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "But we had this idea that if you first have a neural network that can actually approximate the formula, you just trained it, even if you don't understand how it works, that can be the first step towards actually understanding how it works."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "So that's what we do first."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "And then we study that neural network now and put in all sorts of other data that wasn't in the original training data and use that to discover simplifying properties of the formula."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "And that lets us break it apart, often into many simpler pieces in a kind of divide and conquer approach."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "So we were able to solve all of those 100 formulas, discover them automatically, plus a whole bunch of other ones."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "And it's actually kind of humbling to see that this code, which anyone who wants now is listening to this, can type pip install AI Feynman on the computer and run it."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "It can actually do what Johannes Kepler spent four years doing when he stared at Mars data until he was like, finally, Eureka, this is an ellipse."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "This will do it automatically for you in one hour."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "Or Max Planck, he was looking at how much radiation comes out from different wavelengths from a hot object and discovered the famous blackbody formula."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "This discovers it automatically."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "I'm actually excited about seeing if we can discover not just old formulas again, but new formulas that no one has seen before."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "I do like this process of using kind of a neural network to find some basic insights and then dissecting the neural network to then gain the final."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "So in that way, you've forcing the explainability issue, really trying to analyze the neural network for the things it knows in order to come up with the final beautiful, simple theory underlying the initial system that you were looking at."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "And the reason I'm so optimistic that it can be generalized to so much more is because that's exactly what we do as human scientists."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Think of Galileo, whom we mentioned, right?"}, {"time": 1195, "text": "I bet when he was a little kid, if his dad threw him an apple, he would catch it."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "Because he had a neural network in his brain that he had trained to predict the parabolic orbit of apples that are thrown under gravity."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "If you throw a tennis ball to a dog, it also has this same ability of deep learning to figure out how the ball is going to move and catch it."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "But Galileo went one step further when he got older."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "He went back and was like, wait a minute."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "I can write down a formula for this."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "Y equals x squared, a parabola."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "And he helped revolutionize physics as we know it, right?"}, {"time": 1236, "text": "So there was a basic neural network in there from childhood that captured the experiences of observing different kinds of trajectories."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And then he was able to go back in with another extra little neural network and analyze all those experiences and be like, wait a minute."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "There's a deeper rule here."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "He was able to distill out in symbolic form what that complicated black box neural network was doing."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "Not only did the formula he got ultimately become more accurate, and similarly, this is how Newton got Newton's laws, which is why Elon can send rockets to the space station now, right?"}, {"time": 1275, "text": "So it's not only more accurate, but it's also simpler, much simpler."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "And it's so simple that we can actually describe it to our friends and each other, right?"}, {"time": 1286, "text": "We've talked about it just in the context of physics now."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "But hey, isn't this what we're doing when we're talking to each other also?"}, {"time": 1293, "text": "We go around with our neural networks, just like dogs and cats and chipmunks and Blue Jays."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "And we experience things in the world."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "But then we humans do this additional step on top of that, where we then distill out certain high level knowledge that we've extracted from this in a way that we can communicate it to each other in a symbolic form in English in this case, right?"}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So if we can do it and we believe that we are information processing entities, then we should be able to make machine learning that does it also."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "Well, do you think the entire thing could be learning?"}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Because this dissection process, like for AI Feynman, the secondary stage feels like something like reasoning."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And the initial step feels more like the more basic kind of differentiable learning."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "Do you think the whole thing could be differentiable learning?"}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Do you think the whole thing could be basically neural networks on top of each other?"}, {"time": 1352, "text": "It's like turtles all the way down."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "Could it be neural networks all the way down?"}, {"time": 1355, "text": "I mean, that's a really interesting question."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "We know that in your case, it is neural networks all the way down because that's all you have in your skull is a bunch of neurons doing their thing, right?"}, {"time": 1365, "text": "But if you ask the question more generally, what algorithms are being used in your brain, I think it's super interesting to compare."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "I think we've gone a little bit backwards historically because we humans first discovered good old fashioned AI, the logic based AI that we often call GoFi for good old fashioned AI."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And then more recently, we did machine learning because it required bigger computers."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "So we had to discover it later."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "So we think of machine learning with neural networks as the modern thing and the logic based AI as the old fashioned thing."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "But if you look at evolution on Earth, it's actually been the other way around."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "I would say that, for example, an eagle has a better vision system than I have using."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "And dogs are just as good at casting tennis balls as I am."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "All this stuff which is done by training in neural network and not interpreting it in words is something so many of our animal friends can do, at least as well as us, right?"}, {"time": 1433, "text": "What is it that we humans can do that the chipmunks and the eagles cannot?"}, {"time": 1438, "text": "It's more to do with this logic based stuff, right, where we can extract out information in symbols, in language, and now even with equations if you're a scientist, right?"}, {"time": 1452, "text": "So basically what happened was first we built these computers that could multiply numbers real fast and manipulate symbols."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And we felt they were pretty dumb."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And then we made neural networks that can see as well as a cat can and do a lot of this inscrutable black box neural networks."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "What we humans can do also is put the two together in a useful way."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "Yes, in our own brain."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "So if we ever want to get artificial general intelligence that can do all jobs as well as humans can, right, then that's what's going to be required to be able to combine the neural networks with symbolic, combine the old AI with the new AI in a good way."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "We do it in our brains."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "And there seems to be basically two strategies I see in industry now."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "One scares the heebie jeebies out of me, and the other one I find much more encouraging."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "OK, which one?"}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Can we break them apart?"}, {"time": 1508, "text": "Which of the two?"}, {"time": 1509, "text": "The one that scares the heebie jeebies out of me is this attitude that we're just going to make ever bigger systems that we still don't understand until they can be as smart as humans."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "I think it's just such a reckless thing to do."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "And unfortunately, if we actually succeed as a species to build artificial general intelligence, then we still have no clue how it works."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "I think at least 50% chance we're going to be extinct before too long."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "It's just going to be an utter epic own goal."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "So it's that 44 minute losing money problem or the paper clip problem where we don't understand how it works, and it just in a matter of seconds runs away in some kind of direction that's going to be very problematic."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "Even long before, you have to worry about the machines themselves somehow deciding to do things."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And to us, we have to worry about people using machines that are short of AGI and power to do bad things."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "I mean, just take a moment."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "And if anyone is not worried particularly about advanced AI, just take 10 seconds and just think about your least favorite leader on the planet right now."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "Don't tell me who it is."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "I want to keep this apolitical."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "But just see the face in front of you, that person, for 10 seconds."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "Now imagine that that person has this incredibly powerful AI under their control and can use it to impose their will on the whole planet."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "So can we break that apart just briefly?"}, {"time": 1609, "text": "For the 50% chance that we'll run to trouble with this approach, do you see the bigger worry in that leader or humans using the system to do damage?"}, {"time": 1620, "text": "Or are you more worried, and I think I'm in this camp, more worried about accidental, unintentional destruction of everything?"}, {"time": 1630, "text": "So humans trying to do good, and in a way where everyone agrees it's kind of good, it's just they're trying to do good without understanding."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "Because I think every evil leader in history thought they're, to some degree, thought they're trying to do good."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "I'm sure Hitler thought he was doing good."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "I've been reading a lot about Stalin."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "I'm sure Stalin is from, he legitimately thought that communism was good for the world, and that he was doing good."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "I think Mao Zedong thought what he was doing with the Great Leap Forward was good too."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "I'm actually concerned about both of those."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "Before, I promised to answer this in detail, but before we do that, let me finish answering the first question."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "Because I told you that there were two different routes we could get to artificial general intelligence, and one scares the hell out of me, which is this one where we build something, we just say bigger neural networks, ever more hardware, and just train the heck out of more data, and poof, now it's very powerful."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "That, I think, is the most unsafe and reckless approach."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "Maybe we can even prove theorems about it, that this car here will never be hacked when it's driving, because here is the proof."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "There is a whole science of this."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "It doesn't work for neural networks that are big black boxes, but it works well and works with certain other kinds of codes, right?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "That approach, I think, is much more promising."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "That's exactly why I'm working on it, frankly, not just because I think it's cool for science, but because I think the more we understand these systems, the better the chances that we can make them do the things that are good for us that are actually intended, not unintended."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "So you think it's possible to prove things about something as complicated as a neural network?"}, {"time": 1767, "text": "That's the hope?"}, {"time": 1768, "text": "Well, ideally, there's no reason it has to be a neural network in the end either, right?"}, {"time": 1774, "text": "We discovered Newton's laws of gravity with neural network in Newton's head."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "But that's not the way it's programmed into the navigation system of Elon Musk's rocket anymore."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "It's written in C++, or I don't know what language he uses exactly."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "And then there are software tools called symbolic verification."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "DARPA and the US military has done a lot of really great research on this, because they really want to understand that when they build weapon systems, they don't just go fire at random or malfunction, right?"}, {"time": 1807, "text": "And there is even a whole operating system called Cell 3 that's been developed by a DARPA

exposed to actually more sort of academic style or more respectful, portrayals of different views."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "And finally, the one kind of bias I think people are mostly aware of is the left, right, because it's so obvious, because both left and right are very powerful here, right?"}, {"time": 4110, "text": "Both of them have well funded TV stations and newspapers, and it's kind of hard to miss."}, {"time": 4115, "text": "But there's another one, the establishment slider, which is also really fun."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "I love to play with it."}, {"time": 4122, "text":

certain thing, that's what you're gonna read in both the big media, mainstream media on the left and on the right, of course."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "And the powerful companies can push back very hard, like tobacco companies push back very hard back in the day when some newspapers started writing articles about tobacco being dangerous, so that it was hard to get a lot of coverage about it

have been better for American national security if those voices had also come up."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "I think it harmed America's national security actually that we invaded Iraq."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "And arguably there's a lot more interest in that kind of thinking too, from those small sources."}, {"time": 4260, "text": "So like when you say big, it's more about kind of the reach of the broadcast, but it's not big in terms of the interest."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "I think there's a lot of interest in that kind of anti establishment or like skepticism towards, you know, out of the box thinking."}, {"time": 4280, "text": "There's a lot of interest in that kind of thing."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "Do you see this news project or something like it being basically taken over

have a few little questions around this."}, {"time": 9381, "text": "One, the scientific question, in which way would you be, if you were wrong in that intuition, in which way do you think you would be surprised?"}, {"time": 9396, "text": "Like why were you wrong?"}, {"time": 9398, "text": "We find out that you ended up being wrong."}, {"time": 9401, "text": "Like in which dimension?"}, {"time": 9403, "text": "So like, is it because we can't see them?"}, {"time": 9408, "text": "Is it because the nature of their intelligence or the nature of their life is totally different than we can possibly imagine?"}, {"time": 9416, "text": "Is it because the, I mean, something about the great filters and surviving them, or maybe because we're being protected from signals, all those explanations for why we haven't heard a big, loud, like red light that says we're here."}, {"time": 9441, "text": "So there are actually two separate things there that I could be wrong about, two separate claims that I made, right?"}, {"time": 9448, "text": "One of them is, I made the claim, I think most civilizations, when you're going from simple bacteria like things to space colonizing civilizations, they spend only a very, very tiny fraction of their life being where we are."}, {"time": 9475, "text": "That I could be wrong about."}, {"time": 9477, "text": "The other one I could be wrong about is the quite different statement that I think that actually I'm guessing that we are the only civilization in our observable universe from which light has reached us so far that's actually gotten far enough to invent telescopes."}, {"time": 9492, "text": "So let's talk about maybe both of them in turn because they really are different."}, {"time": 9495, "text": "The first one, if you look at the N equals one, the data point we have on this planet, right?"}, {"time": 9502, "text": "So we spent four and a half billion years fluxing around on this planet with life, right?"}, {"time": 9508, "text": "We got, and most of it was pretty lame stuff from an intelligence perspective, you know, it was bacteria and then the dinosaurs spent, then the things gradually accelerated, right?"}, {"time": 9521, "text": "Then the dinosaurs spent over a hundred million years stomping around here without even inventing smartphones."}, {"time": 9526, "text": "And then very recently, you know, it's only, we've only spent 400 years going from Newton to us, right?"}, {"time": 9535, "text": "In terms of technology."}, {"time": 9536, "text": "And look what we've done even, you know, when I was a little kid, there was no internet even."}, {"time": 9542, "text": "So it's, I think it's pretty likely for, in this case of this planet, right?"}, {"time": 9548, "text": "That we're either gonna really get our act together and start spreading life into space, the century, and doing all sorts of great things, or we're gonna wipe out."}, {"time": 9558, "text": "It's a little hard."}, {"time": 9560, "text": "If I, I could be wrong in the sense that maybe what happened on this earth is very atypical."}, {"time": 9565, "text": "And for some reason, what's more common on other planets is that they spend an enormously long time futzing around with the ham radio and things, but they just never really take it to the next level for reasons I don't, I haven't understood."}, {"time": 9578, "text": "I'm humble and open to that."}, {"time": 9580, "text": "But I would bet at least 10 to one that our situation is more typical because the whole thing with Moore's law and accelerating technology, it's pretty obvious why it's happening."}, {"time": 9591, "text": "Everything that grows exponentially, we call it an explosion, whether it's a population explosion or a nuclear explosion, it's always caused by the same thing."}, {"time": 9598, "text": "It's that the next step triggers a step after that."}, {"time": 9601, "text": "So I, we, tomorrow's technology, today's technology enables tomorrow's technology and that enables the next level."}, {"time": 9609, "text": "And as I think, because the technology is always better, of course, the steps can come faster and faster."}, {"time": 9617, "text": "On the other question that I might be wrong about, that's the much more controversial one, I think."}, {"time": 9622, "text": "But before we close out on this thing about, if, the first one, if it's true that most civilizations spend only a very short amount of their total time in the stage, say, between inventing telescopes or mastering electricity and leaving there and doing space travel, if that's actually generally true, then that should apply also elsewhere out there."}, {"time": 9649, "text": "So we should be very, very, we should be very, very surprised if we find some random civilization and we happen to catch them exactly in that very, very short stage."}, {"time": 9658, "text": "It's much more likely that we find a planet full of bacteria."}, {"time": 9662, "text": "Or that we find some civilization that's already post biological and has done some really cool galactic construction projects in their galaxy."}, {"time": 9673, "text": "Would we be able to recognize them, do you think?"}, {"time": 9675, "text": "Is it possible that we just can't, I mean, this post biological world, could it be just existing in some other dimension?"}, {"time": 9683, "text": "It could be just all a virtual reality game for them or something, I don't know, that it changes completely where we won't be able to detect."}, {"time": 9692, "text": "We have to be honestly very humble about this."}, {"time": 9695, "text": "I think I said earlier the number one principle of being a scientist is you have to be humble and willing to acknowledge that everything we think, guess might be totally wrong."}, {"time": 9705, "text": "Of course, you could imagine some civilization where they all decide to become Buddhists and very inward looking and just move into their little virtual reality and not disturb the flora and fauna around them and we might not notice them."}, {"time": 9718, "text": "But this is a numbers game, right?"}, {"time": 9719, "text": "If you have millions of civilizations out there or billions of them, all it takes is one with a more ambitious mentality that decides, hey, we are gonna go out and settle a bunch of other solar systems and maybe galaxies."}, {"time": 9737, "text": "And then it doesn't matter if they're a bunch of quiet Buddhists, we're still gonna notice that expansionist one, right?"}, {"time": 9743, "text": "And it seems like quite the stretch to assume that, now we know even in our own galaxy that there are probably a billion or more planets that are pretty Earth like."}, {"time": 9755, "text": "And many of them are formed over a billion years before ours, so had a big head start."}, {"time": 9791, "text": "That seems like a bit of a stretch, frankly."}, {"time": 9793, "text": "And this leads into the second thing you challenged me that I might be wrong about, how rare or common is life, you know?"}, {"time": 9802, "text": "So Francis Drake, when he wrote down the Drake equation, multiplied together a huge number of factors and then we don't know any of them."}, {"time": 9809, "text": "So we know even less about what you get when you multiply together the whole product."}, {"time": 9815, "text": "Since then, a lot of those factors have become much better known."}, {"time": 9818, "text": "One of his big uncertainties was how common is it that a solar system even has a planet?"},

many of them, even in our galaxy."}, {"time": 9832, "text": "At the same time, you know, we have thanks to, I'm a big supporter of the SETI project and its cousins and I think we should keep doing this and we've learned a lot."}, {"time": 9842, "text": "We've learned that so far, all we have is still unconvincing hints, nothing more, right?"}, {"time": 9848, "text": "And there are certainly many scenarios where it would be dead obvious."}, {"time": 9853, "text": "If there were a hundred million other human like civilizations in our galaxy, it would not be that hard to notice some of them with today's technology and we haven't, right?"}, {"time": 9863, "text": "So what we can say is, well, okay, we can rule out that there is a human level of civilization on the moon and in fact, the many nearby solar systems where we cannot rule out, of course, that there is something like Earth sitting in a galaxy five billion light years away."}, {"time": 9885, "text": "But we've ruled out a lot and that's already kind of shocking given that there are all these planets there, you know?"}, {"time": 9890, "text": "So like, where are they?"}, {"time": 9891, "text": "Where are they all?"}, {"time": 9892, "text": "That's the classic Fermi paradox."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "And so my argument, which might very well be wrong, it's very simple really, it just goes like this."}, {"time": 9901, "text": "Okay, we have no clue about this."}, {"time": 9905, "text": "It could be the probability of getting life on a random planet, it could be 10 to the minus one a priori or 10 to the minus

math and ask the question, how close is our nearest neighbor?"}, {"time": 9927, "text": "It's again, equally likely that it's 10 to the 10 meters away, 10 to 20 meters away, 10 to the 30 meters away."}, {"time": 9933, "text": "We have some nerdy ways of talking about this with Bayesian statistics and a uniform log prior, but that's irrelevant."}, {"time": 9939, "text": "This is the simple basic argument."}, {"time": 9942, "text": "And now comes the data."}, {"time": 9943, "text": "So we can say, okay, there are all these orders of magnitude, 10 to the 26 meters away, there's the edge

within Earth's, it's no farther away than the sun."}, {"time": 9963, "text": "We can definitely rule that out."}, {"time": 9967, "text": "So I think about it like this, a priori before we looked at the telescopes, it could be 10 to the 10 meters, 10 to the 20, 10 to the 30, 10 to the 40, 10 to the 50, 10 to blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 9976, "text": "Equally likely anywhere here."}, {"time": 9978, "text": "And now we've ruled out like this chunk."}, {"time": 9981, "text": "And here is the edge of our observable universe already."}, {"time": 9987, "text": "So I'm certainly not saying I don't think there's any life elsewhere in space."}, {"time": 9992, "text": "If space is infinite, then you're basically a hundred percent guaranteed that there is, but the probability that there is
