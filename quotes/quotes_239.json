feel like in these other places, people are, it's a destination for people who want to come and perform."}, {"time": 261, "text": "I think maybe the early San Francisco people, it was different for them."}, {"time": 266, "text": "But later as prosperity starts to come in and success comes in, then you attract a different breed."}, {"time": 274, "text": "At first, we're the people who made it, who made this place be what it is."}, {"time": 278, "text": "And then it attracts all the bling followers and the bling attracted people."}, {"time": 283, "text": "And when those people show up, it's time for all of us to get out."}, {"time": 287, "text": "And that's one of my worries about Austin too."}, {"time": 289, "text": "And I guess I'm one of, I count myself in it, but you know, because we're also new arrivees, always been furious now."}, {"time": 296, "text": "But how are we gonna protect this place?"}, {"time": 300, "text": "Yeah, these are, you know, the best possible version of the Austin history."}, {"time": 304, "text": "This is the early days of Silicon Valley in Austin."}, {"time": 307, "text": "And so you get a chance to build on top of this culture that's already been here of the weirdos, the artists, the sort of the characters, but also the general kindness and love that just permeates the whole place, build on top of that entrepreneurial spirit."}, {"time": 327, "text": "So like the tech companies, new startups, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 331, "text": "And then you get a chance to build totally new ideas, totally revolutionary ideas and make them a reality and dream big and build it here."}, {"time": 340, "text": "I think Elon represents that with all the people that kind of try to do the cutting edge stuff they're doing at Tesla and SpaceX."}, {"time": 352, "text": "But there's a bunch of other companies, they're just like coming up."}, {"time": 354, "text": "I get to talk to a bunch of tech people and they're just incredible."}, {"time": 358, "text": "Versus San Francisco, there's a cynicism a bit."}, {"time": 363, "text": "And also some of the interaction with strangers, there's always a bit of a calculation, like how good is this going to be for my career?"}, {"time": 371, "text": "Or how can, yeah."}, {"time": 372, "text": "How can hanging out with this person can advance me?"}, {"time": 374, "text": "You go to a party, they're seizing up."}, {"time": 378, "text": "It's like, I'm not gonna talk to so and so because that's not gonna advance me."}, {"time": 381, "text": "Who's gonna advance me next?"}, {"time": 382, "text": "And so this is what I would not wanna see here in Austin."}, {"time": 387, "text": "And I think maybe there's one way to try to, I really would like to see Austin not go the way San Francisco did and other towns before."}, {"time": 394, "text": "I like how you pronounce San Francisco with a French accent."}, {"time": 396, "text": "San Francisco?"}, {"time": 399, "text": "That's the one word you go with a French accent."}, {"time": 402, "text": "It sounds beautiful."}, {"time": 403, "text": "San Francisco."}, {"time": 405, "text": "But you know, so now that you find that cute, you're gonna have to forgive me when I mess up my English because English is not my first language."}, {"time": 415, "text": "So I always try to make sure people know that."}, {"time": 418, "text": "But you know Lex, this is why I am very interested in what some folks here are working on."}, {"time": 423, "text": "And I'm just gonna be very selfish here because I wanna help her with what she's doing."}, {"time": 427, "text": "It's someone like, you know, Nicole Nodzak and her project, you know, with the housing project that they have right now, making sure that Austin remains a town that's affordable for people of all walks of lives."}, {"time": 440, "text": "If we can accomplish making sure that all walks of lives, doesn't matter how little or big you're making money wise, that you can stay in this town so the diversity at that level can remain, then I think Austin stands a chance to really show the world how to do things differently."}, {"time": 456, "text": "And what I love about, you know, her initiative is just how they're really trying, you know, to again work on keeping affordability down for most people."}, {"time": 466, "text": "I think it's important to, because it seems like it matters to you, I know that it matters to me."}, {"time": 471, "text": "I absolutely would not wanna see Austin go away that San Francisco did."}, {"time": 476, "text": "And I think the key to that is making sure that true diversity, not like the fluff, fluff crap diversity we're hearing over there."}, {"time": 482, "text": "And that's another thing by the way, because San Francisco likes to pride itself in, oh, you know, we are so into diversity, but I'm like, if diversity for you means gender, difference of gender, skin color, you know, maybe the different accents we have, and you think check, check, check, check, check, I'm like, it's not enough."}, {"time": 501, "text": "Can we also add diversity of thoughts?"}, {"time": 504, "text": "And that's the other problem I have with that place, you know?"}, {"time": 506, "text": "And I know some folks who are scared of saying much around people, that's also another thing."}, {"time": 511, "text": "So not only they're sizing you up, but everybody's also, there is this invisible, this invisible, how should I say this?"}, {"time": 520, "text": "There's this invisible agreement that they all seem to have to stay on script."}, {"time": 527, "text": "Yeah, there's a feeling like you're following a certain kind of script that's very kind of shallow."}, {"time": 531, "text": "And there is a bit of a categorization going on, which category do you belong to?"}, {"time": 535, "text": "And let's put this into a simple math equation, what comes out, as opposed to just the free, open embrace of people, the weirdos, the characters, the interesting, the full, deep sense of diversity."}, {"time": 549, "text": "Not just ideas, but backgrounds, and rich and poor."}, {"time": 556, "text": "Artists, engineers."}, {"time": 557, "text": "High school dropouts, PhDs, all of this."}, {"time": 560, "text": "Yes, yes, that's what makes for a rich society if it's gonna get ahead."}, {"time": 565, "text": "I'm glad you mentioned Nicole's efforts, I know she really is passionate about."}, {"time": 570, "text": "I don't know how complicated that work is, because there's probably a big force trying to increase how much it costs to live in Austin."}, {"time": 582, "text": "I don't know how you resist that."}, {"time": 585, "text": "Whenever I go to New York City, just the fact that there's a giant park in the middle of it, I wonder, how did they pull this off?"}, {"time": 594, "text": "It's like to resist the force of the increasing price of the land, and still to protect this idea of having a park."}, {"time": 605, "text": "And then in the same way, protecting the ability for people from all walks of life to live in the center of the city, to live around the city, to chase a dream when they don't get any money in their pocket."}, {"time": 618, "text": "I don't know how you do that."}, {"time": 619, "text": "It's partly political, probably, regulation, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 623, "text": "A lot of it has to do with regulations."}, {"time": 625, "text": "And this is where her and I also very much see eye to eye in terms of the free markets and also prosperity building, because it's always the same problems most of the time, most places."}, {"time": 640, "text": "Here, what you have is some people in the name of, we gotta stand for, and I don't like to use this word, but maybe you help me find a better one, but at least that's a word that people can understand."}, {"time": 651, "text": "We gotta stand for the lesser fortunate among us."}, {"time": 654, "text": "Some people would call them, maybe oftentimes use the word, maybe the underdogs, whatever it is."}, {"time": 658, "text": "I will just say maybe the lesser fortunate among us, right?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "In the name of standing up for them, you're promoting policies that are actually gonna backfire and where they end up being the first ones to suffer from it."}, {"time": 671, "text": "So let's take this whole housing issue that Nicole and her team are working on."}, {"time": 677, "text": "We find that oftentimes the cost at the end of the day, it's the good old supply and demand equation."}, {"time": 686, "text": "If you're gonna make it so hard that the supply level of housing remains below a certain threshold, remains lower than the demand of people who need, especially affordable housing, housing altogether, what's gonna happen is scarcity, prices go up, and who gets kicked out first?"}, {"time": 707, "text": "The lesser fortunate among us."}, {"time": 709, "text": "And so, but I find that oftentimes people in the name of We Care don't engage their mind."}, {"time": 715, "text": "And a friend of mine said this, and he said it so well."}, {"time": 717, "text": "He said, having a heart for the poor, that's easy."}, {"time": 723, "text": "Having a mind for the poor, that's the challenge."}, {"time": 726, "text": "And oftentimes we all have a heart for the poor."}, {"time": 729, "text": "But when it comes then to, then what do we do to have a real impact on making sure that people get a chance at going up, then that's where everything starts falling apart."}, {"time": 743, "text": "And then you have people who, then they start pushing for policies, housing policies, making it super hard for you to even renovate or add one more store to your home or anything like that."}, {"time": 753, "text": "By doing that, you're messing up with the supply, with the supply of housing."}, {"time": 759, "text": "And therefore the people who can't afford, people get priced out of the market."}, {"time": 765, "text": "And so what people like Nicole are doing are going back to where all of this is taking place and they're going back to the regulation side."}, {"time": 771, "text": "And just like, I'm sure we'll talk about it here, but people wonder today, why is Africa the poorest region in the world?"}, {"time": 777, "text": "We go back to the same culprit."}, {"time": 779, "text": "Bad laws and tons of senseless regulations."}, {"time": 784, "text": "If you make it so hard that in Berkeley, for someone to build one more store to their home, which means maybe one more unit that could be rented out to someone."}, {"time": 793, "text": "And if many more people do that, then you have a much bigger supply, which means the prices will go down, which means more people have access and among them, especially the lesser fortunate among us, then we're starting to see a winning proposal, aren't we?"}, {"time": 805, "text": "But instead, if you go the other way around, then all of a sudden you're pricing them out of the market."}, {"time": 809, "text": "Same thing was done with us."}, {"time": 810, "text": "So oftentimes when I see problems of this nature, you can betcha that regulations and census laws are the heart of it."}, {"time": 817, "text": "And that's what they're tackling."}, {"time": 819, "text": "It's not popular, it's not fun."}, {"time": 821, "text": "And people tend to not even understand where you're coming from."}, {"time": 824, "text": "But this is a problem we have with people not understanding economic econ 101."}, {"time": 828, "text": "Well, so it's the regulation and the laws and the system that props them up and increases the span of those laws."}, {"time": 833, "text": "And we'll talk about that, the fascinating way those kinds of things develop when it works, when it doesn't."}, {"time": 839, "text": "Let me sort of step back and ask you a question about Africa."}, {"time": 843, "text": "In the West, in many places in the world, Africa is almost talked about like it's one country, like it's one place."}, {"time": 852, "text": "So in what ways is Africa one community?"}, {"time": 856, "text": "And in what ways is it many, many, many communities?"}, {"time": 860, "text": "Just from your perspective from in Senegal and beyond."}, {"time": 865, "text": "So at the most basic of what makes us one goes back to even what makes you African."}, {"time": 873, "text": "You are African, I'm African."}, {"time": 874, "text": "We're one big family."}, {"time": 876, "text": "Africa is very much at the end of the day, the foundation and the birth of the human race."}, {"time": 884, "text": "So from that standpoint, at the most basic level, we're all Africans."}, {"time": 888, "text": "Where this whole thing started."}, {"time": 891, "text": "Where this whole thing started and how at some point humanity was hanging by its fingernails."}, {"time": 897, "text": "Only 2000 of us were left on this earth."}, {"time": 899, "text": "And eventually we started, we went for survival."}, {"time": 902, "text": "And that's how we started to spread around and some going up north, some going this way, that way."}, {"time": 907, "text": "And as you're traveling to different places then features start to change to adapt to where you are, right?"}, {"time": 913, "text": "So hair gets lighter for some people, eyes get different shape for others to adjust to our new natural habitat."}, {"time": 921, "text": "You know, the genomics program, I think at the National Geographic did that so well for people who are interested in going back to that work with Spencer Wells and such."}, {"time": 930, "text": "But yeah, so at the very basic, most basic level, that's what unites us all first of all."}, {"time": 937, "text": "And then I would say that the continent, especially here I will group it into black Africa, you know, black Africa."}, {"time": 947, "text": "Unfortunately our common stories, you know, of having gone through this terrible, horrible period of around the same time the whole continent being, you know, enslaved and colonized."}, {"time": 958, "text": "So that in a way forms, not that we were ever the first people or only people ever, you know, enslaved in this world."}, {"time": 966, "text": "As a matter of fact, I mean, the word slaves comes from esclav, you know, esclav, slave, slavs, les slavs, right, from the Eastern block."}, {"time": 975, "text": "So the first slaves were actually people looking more like you than looking like me, right?"}, {"time": 979, "text": "So, but we don't necessarily remember all of that because in our human psyche, the closest to us in history of a big mass of people being enslaved is African people."}, {"time": 992, "text": "We were the last, you know, group like that."}, {"time": 995, "text": "You know, the pain of World War I and World War II permeates Europe, but it certainly does for the former Soviet Union, the countries that made up the former Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Does in the same way, the pain of slavery and empires using Africa, does that permeate the culture?"}, {"time": 1021, "text": "Is there still echoes of that?"}, {"time": 1022, "text": "In a way, yes, especially the fact that, you know, in many different places, whether it's Ghana or my country or Benin, where you have these places that we call the door of no return or the places of no return, which this was the last place where the slaves were standing or, you know, this is in Senegal, we call it the door of no return."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "There is this one door, you're there in the slave house."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And once they go, they go, that's it."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "That's gonna be the last time they see back home."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "So, you know, those, of course, of course, it creates for a common lived experience, which becomes a common lived history."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "And of course, it's gonna tire us up."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "Is there a resentment, because you mentioned hospitality, is there a kind of a resentment of the foreigner that there's a rich, vibrant land?"}, {"time": 1087, "text": "There's many resources, there's powerful cultures."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "Are they just going to show up and use us?"}, {"time": 1094, "text": "That's a way to see geopolitics in this modern world."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "This is, okay, so where it plays very differently is, so if you came to Senegal today, there is not really a problem at that level."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Where people's resentment start to come from is, of course, when bad behavior shows up, meaning like you have so many white people who can show up and just in the attitude, they have an entitlement attitude, right?"}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And they think that in a way, we're all still servants."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "Some people in your face, some people more, but that can cause some little resentment, but where really the resentment is."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "And that can, the entitlement can take different forms, like even pity."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "Yes, don't even get me going on that one."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "I was trying to be polite today."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "So just don't, Lex, do not."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "You know, sometimes I tell myself, my God, today you're going to be all composed."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "You know, Lex is all composed."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "So don't go there and make a fool of yourself."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "Just behave."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "But if you get me on some grounds, that's when it's all going to go to hell."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "So yeah, let's move beyond that too."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "So resentment, there's a dance between hospitality and resentment."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "And resentment."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "So when you come in, you're you, you live your life."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "You're just a normal human being and you treat me decently like you would treat a friend, normal people."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "I have no problem with you."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "I'm not going to come back and be like, well, you and your ancestors have enslaved me."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "You, you're not going to see that stuff."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Sometimes I'm in this country where I feel like that's, you know, it might look like that, but we in Africa don't do that."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "Now, if you come, you have this nasty attitude."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "You think you're still serving servants around."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "Well, you can have a problem with someone like me."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "I might even grab you by the back of your neck and, you know, take you back to the airport."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "That's when you're lucky."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "I'll be you very quickly."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "But where things come up is, especially nowadays with the African youth, when we have to be reminded of the World Bank, when we have to be reminded of even the world, places like the World Economic Forum, you know, like all of these places that seem to constitute, they would, the way they describe them, when I say they, it's primarily my Pan African friends."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "So here maybe terms are worth describing."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "So the Pan African movement goes way back when, we're talking about, you know, way back when, started in the thirties going on all the way from there."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "So what you have there is people who have started coming together and dreaming up an emancipated Africa away from the colonies, because at that point there were still colonies and dreaming up all of that."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "So we're talking about people like Kwame Kuma of Ghana, we're talking about Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, talking about Blaise Diagne of Senegal and other people like that, Bandi of Malawi."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "So anyway, so, and the African youth of today, we're still hanging on to those, onto some of these ideas of, and on some of these dreams of a reunited Africa."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "So when you were talking about what seems to unite you, there is that, you know, also, meaning like we all feel like we're part of the same family."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "Is it only in our heads?"}, {"time": 1289, "text": "Is it in reality?"}, {"time": 1290, "text": "Many, for many different reasons, there is definitely what we call a Pan African movement."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And I very much myself, consider myself one of them."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "I don't agree all the time with our, where we want to go and how we want to go there, but not where we want to go."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "Where we want to go is we would love to see a united Africa for sure."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "But how to get that accomplished, that's where oftentimes we have issues."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "So on something like that, so this Pan African, especially the Pan African youth, but it's beyond the Pan African youth, it's the youth in general in Africa, World Bank, UN, all of these organizations that they tend to qualify as imperialist organizations."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "And it's not always a correct way to describe them, but I'm sure you get the sentiment."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "And from that place, there is tons of resentment because for the longest time, these groups, organizations, and some that preceded them, have proceeded to actually decide what even our new frontiers would be."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "You see, when you go to a place like Senegal, Mali, all of that, different countries, but we were one people, one group, one kingdom."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "And then at some point they decided just, when you look at Africa, have you looked at how straight some of these borders are?"}, {"time": 1368, "text": "You're like, did a robot just draw these?"}, {"time": 1373, "text": "No offense to robot, especially this one, he looks so cute."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "So they have continued deciding what it would be to be us, to live on our land, and how do we even progress?"}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And it just keeps on going."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "They get to decide how are we gonna, which type of even economic development path are we gonna choose or not?"}, {"time": 1400, "text": "So it's very, so from that standpoint, yes, there's a lot of resentment, including even from people like me."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "Yeah, and it's interesting that the invader and the oppressor and the empires have actually created a force for unity."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "I've seen that in Ukraine and the invasion of Ukraine, where it was a pretty divided, not a pretty, a very divided country with many factions."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "But the invasion really forced everyone to think about the identity of this nation together, beyond factions, beyond all of that."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "It allowed it to look at its history and its future."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "Like they all say that all great nations have had to have a war of independence."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "And this is our war to find our own identity."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And so in that sense, Africa as one place, as one continent had to find multiple times its identity through the resistance of the oppressor."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Especially subterranean Africa, especially subterranean Africa, yes."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And there's an interesting aspect to this because the president of Senegal is also the head of the African Union."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "So we'll talk about the fascinating geopolitics of that whole situation."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "But let me ask in general, you talk about this question, this fascinating question, what does it take for a country to prosper?"}, {"time": 1484, "text": "What does it take for a country to prosper?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "You see many countries in the world that really struggle and many that flourish."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And it's not always obvious why because some have natural resources, some don't."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "Some have wars, some don't."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "Some have sort of authoritarian regimes, some don't."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "And some have democracies and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "So the dynamics aren't exactly obvious."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "Is there commonalities?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "Is there fundamental ideas that result in a prosperity of a nation?"}, {"time": 1524, "text": "Today, I can confidently say yes, despite all the differences that you talked about."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "And I think then this is where it becomes very important that we are very clear about the question you asked me."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "You said, what does it take to make a country prosperous?"}, {"time": 1541, "text": "So I'm just gonna stick to prosperity because prosperity doesn't necessarily mean, sometimes it has nothing to do with maybe how you conduct yourself otherwise, socially speaking, right?"}, {"time": 1556, "text": "So you can be prosperous."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "And still when it comes to your family laws, all the way you approach the other aspects of your life, maybe you're running a very communist lifestyle or you're in a very liberal society."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "So for me, when we talk about prosperity, I just want to make sure that we're clear on that because some people might say that, might be somewhere and be like, well, because I know what I'm gonna talk to you about next."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "And some people are gonna sit there and be like, well, China is not like that."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Or even Dubai is not like that."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "No, so what I'm talking about is this thing."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "And that's what I love about this."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "If we just stick to the word prosperity."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "To me, I see prosperity as this."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "It's like, economically speaking, what are we gonna be to be a

the tariff so high that you're going to render me, you know, noncompetitive, then that's where, for people who might make sense, when the product arrives at port, they say, hey, I give you this."},

things cleanly."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "And I believe in doing things that way."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "So what I had to do was go to the ask again mayor."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "We have a problem."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "Mayors, whenever he sees me, he's like, now what?"}, {"time": 3970, "text": "So I'm like, we've got a problem."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "You're best friends now."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "So I say, now it's the customs."}, {"time": 3978, "text": "And he's like, what do you want me to do?"}, {"time": 3980, "text": "I said, do you know anybody at customs?"}, {"time": 3981, "text": "I need to hire up at customs, because I got to explain to them what's going on here."}, {"time": 3985, "text": "They all know, of course, but I think they're not

not very, yeah, this."}, {"time": 3999, "text": "And I said, what do we do now?"}, {"time": 4001, "text": "And I saw him going through binders and binders in his office, because he's going to try to go and look where in the law can we find something that can help me escape these rules."}, {"time": 4015, "text": "And you know, the best he found Lex was, oh, well here, see this one."}, {"time":

allow you to bring your raw material, but you have to tell us exactly how much you're bringing."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "And it has to match your formulation because, you know, they don't want you to bring in more that we need and maybe sell some of that to the rest of the market and they didn't make their money on it."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "So there, it means I have to give them my recipe."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "Imagine Coca Cola being asked to give their secret sauce to government officials in a country that you can't even know what might happen, let alone even in business, you don't do that."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "I mean, trade secrets are trade secrets, but here you're asked to be putting it in front of some people you don't know where it's going to go after that."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "Because there they get to see, okay, her recipe calls for X amount of Candelilla Wax, X amount of coconut oil."}, {"time": 4076, "text": "Okay, and on top of that, we have to think about how much foliage might there be or not because again, we don't want her to buffer it over there."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "So you have to get naked in front of them in terms of your recipe, which might end up only God knows where tomorrow, maybe competition or maybe even them, they start a business and they compete with you because we've seen that."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "So you have to do that."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "And then each time fill out a paperwork, get the approval, then it can come in."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "So when it can come in, you don't have to pay the tax."}, {"time": 4101, "text": "Oh, and by the way, you have one year, one year to make this product and get it out."}, {"time": 4106, "text": "And all of it needs to be back out because if

you know, and it's about, it's in you, we're talking about you, we're not."}, {"time": 9427, "text": "And then from there, you're like replace the bias, like bias replacement."}, {"time": 9433,

accepting this demeaning of yourself, not understanding everything else that comes with it."}, {"time": 9489, "text": "But through, as she understood that she even had that bias, then she went on through all the different processes."}, {"time": 9495, "text": "And then eventually when comes the next step, cultural immersion, she started going to the mosque during Ramadan when the Muslims are doing, you know, they're, it's the holy month of, you know, fasting and then we break at night."}, {"time": 9509, "text": "And she started understanding very different things."}, {"time": 9512,
