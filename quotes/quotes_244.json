know anything about me, you don't want to give anything away about yourself."}, {"time": 288, "text": "So ideally you'd have like a little dice or somewhat, you know, perfect randomizer that makes you randomize 33% of the time each of the three different things."}, {"time": 296, "text": "And in response to that, well, actually I can kind of do anything, but I would probably just randomize back too, but actually it wouldn't matter because I know that you're playing randomly."}, {"time": 305, "text": "So that would be us in a Nash equilibrium where we're both playing this like unexploitable strategy."}, {"time": 310, "text": "However, if after a while you then notice that I'm playing rock a little bit more often than I should."}, {"time": 316, "text": "Yeah, you're the kind of person that would do that, wouldn't you?"}, {"time": 320, "text": "I'm more of a scissors girl, but anyway."}, {"time": 321, "text": "You are?"}, {"time": 322, "text": "No, I'm a, as I said, randomizer."}, {"time": 325, "text": "So you notice I'm throwing rock too much or something like that."}, {"time": 328, "text": "Now you'd be making a mistake by continuing playing this game theory optimal strategy, well, the previous one, because you are now, I'm making a mistake and you're not deviating and exploiting my mistake."}, {"time": 341, "text": "So you'd want to start throwing paper a bit more often in whatever you figure is the right sort of percentage of the time that I'm throwing rock too often."}, {"time": 348, "text": "So that's basically an example of where, what game theory optimal strategy is in terms of loss minimization, but it's not always the maximally profitable thing if your opponent is doing stupid stuff, which in that example."}, {"time": 362, "text": "So that's kind of then how it works in poker, but it's a lot more complex."}, {"time": 367, "text": "And the way poker players typically, nowadays they study, the games change so much."}, {"time": 372, "text": "And I think we should talk about how it sort of evolved, but nowadays like the top pros basically spend all their time in between sessions running these simulators using like software where they do basically Monte Carlo simulations, sort of doing billions of fictitious self play hands."}, {"time": 391, "text": "You input a fictitious hand scenario, like, oh, what do I do with Jack nine suited on a King 10 four to two spades board and against this bet size."}, {"time": 403, "text": "So you'd input that press play, it'll run its billions of fake hands and then it will converge upon what the game theory optimal strategies are."}, {"time": 413, "text": "And then you wanna try and memorize what these are."}, {"time": 415, "text": "Basically they're like ratios of how often, what types of hands you want to bluff and what percentage of the time."}, {"time": 421, "text": "So then there's this additional layer of inbuilt randomization built in."}, {"time": 424, "text": "Yeah, those kinds of simulations incorporate all the betting strategies and everything else like that."}, {"time": 429, "text": "So as opposed to some kind of very crude mathematical model of what's the probability you win just based on the quality of the card, it's including everything else too."}, {"time": 438, "text": "The game theory of it."}, {"time": 440, "text": "Yes, yeah, essentially."}, {"time": 441, "text": "And what's interesting is that nowadays, if you want to be a top pro and you go and play in these really like the super high stakes tournaments or tough cash games, if you don't know this stuff, you're gonna get eaten alive in the long run."}, {"time": 453, "text": "But of course you could get lucky over the short run and that's where this like luck factor comes in because luck is both a blessing and a curse."}, {"time": 460, "text": "If luck didn't, if there wasn't this random element and there wasn't the ability for worse players to win sometimes, then poker would fall apart."}, {"time": 468, "text": "You know, the same reason people don't play chess professionally for money against, you don't see people going and hustling chess like not knowing, trying to make a living from it because you know there's very little luck in chess, but there's quite a lot of luck in poker."}, {"time": 481, "text": "Have you seen Beautiful Mind, that movie?"}, {"time": 483, "text": "Years ago."}, {"time": 484, "text": "Well, what do you think about the game theoretic formulation of what is it, the hot blonde at the bar?"}, {"time": 491, "text": "What they illustrated is they're trying to pick up a girl at a bar and there's multiple girls."}, {"time": 496, "text": "They're like friend, it's like a friend group and you're trying to approach, I don't remember the details, but I remember."}, {"time": 501, "text": "Don't you like then speak to her friends first or something like that, feign disinterest."}, {"time": 505, "text": "I mean, it's classic pickup artist stuff, right?"}, {"time": 507, "text": "You wanna."}, {"time": 508, "text": "And they were trying to correlate that somehow, that being an optimal strategy game theoretically."}, {"time": 516, "text": "What, what, like, I don't think, I remember."}, {"time": 518, "text": "I can't imagine that there is, I mean, there's probably an optimal strategy."}, {"time": 521, "text": "Is it, does that mean that there's an actual Nash equilibrium of like picking up girls?"}, {"time": 526, "text": "Do you know the marriage problem?"}, {"time": 529, "text": "It's optimal stopping."}, {"time": 531, "text": "So where it's an optimal dating strategy where you, do you remember what it is?"}, {"time": 536, "text": "Yeah, I think it's like something like, you know you've got like a set of a hundred people you're gonna look through and after, how many do you, now after that, after going on this many dates out of a hundred, at what point do you then go, okay, the next best person I see, is that the right one?"}, {"time": 551, "text": "And I think it's like something like 37%."}, {"time": 554, "text": "Uh, it's one over E, whatever that is."}, {"time": 557, "text": "Right, which I think is 37%."}, {"time": 561, "text": "We're gonna fact check that."}, {"time": 565, "text": "So, but it's funny under those strict constraints, then yes, after that many people, as long as you have a fixed size pool, then you just pick the next person that is better than anyone you've seen before."}, {"time": 578, "text": "Anyone else you've seen, yeah."}, {"time": 580, "text": "Have you tried this?"}, {"time": 581, "text": "Have you incorporated it?"}, {"time": 582, "text": "I'm not one of those people."}, {"time": 584, "text": "And we're gonna discuss this."}, {"time": 585, "text": "I, and, what do you mean, those people?"}, {"time": 589, "text": "I try not to optimize stuff."}, {"time": 592, "text": "I try to listen to the heart."}, {"time": 595, "text": "I don't think, I like, my mind immediately is attracted to optimizing everything."}, {"time": 604, "text": "Optimizing everything."}, {"time": 606, "text": "And I think that if you really give in to that kind of addiction, that you lose the joy of the small things, the minutiae of life, I think."}, {"time": 618, "text": "I'm concerned about the addictive nature of my personality in that regard."}, {"time": 621, "text": "In some ways, while I think the, on average, people under try and quantify things, or try, under optimize."}, {"time": 632, "text": "There are some people who, you know, with all these things, it's a balancing act."}, {"time": 637, "text": "I've been on dating apps, but I've never used them."}, {"time": 640, "text": "I'm sure they have data on this, because they probably have the optimal stopping control problem."}, {"time": 645, "text": "Because there aren't a lot of people that use social, like dating apps, are on there for a long time."}, {"time": 651, "text": "So the interesting aspect is like, all right, how long before you stop looking before it actually starts affecting your mind negatively, such that you see dating as a kind of, A game."}, {"time": 668, "text": "A kind of game versus an actual process of finding somebody that's going to make you happy for the rest of your life."}, {"time": 677, "text": "They have the data."}, {"time": 678, "text": "I wish they would be able to release that data."}, {"time": 680, "text": "And I do want to hop to it."}, {"time": 681, "text": "It's OkCupid, right?"}, {"time": 682, "text": "I think they ran a huge, huge study on all of that."}, {"time": 685, "text": "Yeah, they're more data driven, I think, OkCupid folks are."}, {"time": 688, "text": "I think there's a lot of opportunity for dating apps, in general, even bigger than dating apps, people connecting on the internet."}, {"time": 695, "text": "I just hope they're more data driven."}, {"time": 697, "text": "And it doesn't seem that way."}, {"time": 700, "text": "I think like, I've always thought that Goodreads should be a dating app."}, {"time": 707, "text": "Like the."}, {"time": 708, "text": "I've never used it."}, {"time": 709, "text": "After what?"}, {"time": 710, "text": "Goodreads is just lists like books that you've read."}, {"time": 715, "text": "And allows you to comment on the books you read and what books you're currently reading."}, {"time": 718, "text": "But it's a giant social networks of people reading books."}, {"time": 721, "text": "And that seems to be a much better database of like interests."}, {"time": 724, "text": "Of course it constrains you to the books you're reading, but like that really reveals so much more about the person."}, {"time": 730, "text": "Allows you to discover shared interests because books are a kind of window into the way you see the world."}, {"time": 736, "text": "Also like the kind of places, people you're curious about, the kind of ideas you're curious about."}, {"time": 741, "text": "Are you a romantic or are you cold calculating rationalist?"}, {"time": 744, "text": "Are you into Ayn Rand or are you into Bernie Sanders?"}, {"time": 748, "text": "Are you into whatever?"}, {"time": 749, "text": "And I feel like that reveals so much more than like a person trying to look hot from a certain angle in a Tinder profile."}, {"time": 757, "text": "Well, and it'd also be a really great filter in the first place for people."}, {"time": 760, "text": "It's less people who read books and are willing to go and rate them and give feedback on them and so on."}, {"time": 767, "text": "So that's already a really strong filter."}, {"time": 768, "text": "Probably the type of people you'd be looking for."}, {"time": 770, "text": "Well, at least be able to fake reading books."}, {"time": 772, "text": "I mean, the thing about books, you don't really need to read it."}, {"time": 774, "text": "You can just look at the click counts."}, {"time": 775, "text": "Yeah, game the dating app by feigning intellectualism."}, {"time": 779, "text": "Can I admit something very horrible about myself?"}, {"time": 783, "text": "The things that, you know, I don't have many things in my closet, but this is one of them."}, {"time": 787, "text": "I've never actually read Shakespeare."}, {"time": 790, "text": "I've only read Cliff Notes and I got a five in the AP English exam."}, {"time": 798, "text": "The which books have I read?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "Oh yeah, which was the exam on which book?"}, {"time": 801, "text": "Oh no, they include a lot of them."}, {"time": 804, "text": "But Hamlet, I don't even know if you read Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth."}, {"time": 810, "text": "I don't remember, but I don't understand it."}, {"time": 812, "text": "It's like really cryptic."}, {"time": 814, "text": "It's really, I don't, and it's not that pleasant to read."}, {"time": 817, "text": "It's like ancient speak."}, {"time": 820, "text": "Anyway, maybe I was too dumb."}, {"time": 821, "text": "I'm still too dumb, but I did get... You got a five, which is... Yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 826, "text": "I don't know how the US grading system... Oh no, so AP English is a, there's kind of this advanced versions of courses in high school, and you take a test that is like a broad test for that subject and includes a lot."}, {"time": 838, "text": "It wasn't obviously just Shakespeare."}, {"time": 840, "text": "I think a lot of it was also writing, written."}, {"time": 844, "text": "You have like AP Physics, AP Computer Science, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and then AP English or AP Literature, I forget what it was."}, {"time": 853, "text": "But I think Shakespeare was a part of that."}, {"time": 856, "text": "But I... And the point is you gamified it?"}, {"time": 859, "text": "Gamified."}, {"time": 859, "text": "Well, in entirety, I was into getting As."}, {"time": 862, "text": "I saw it as a game."}, {"time": 864, "text": "I don't think any..."}, {"time": 867, "text": "I don't think all of the learning I've done has been outside of school."}, {"time": 873, "text": "The deepest learning I've done has been outside of school with a few exceptions, especially in grad school, like deep computer science courses."}, {"time": 880, "text": "But that was still outside of school because it was outside of getting..."}, {"time": 884, "text": "It was outside of getting the A for the course."}, {"time": 886, "text": "The best stuff I've ever done is when you read the chapter and you do many of the problems at the end of the chapter, which is usually not what's required for the course, like the hardest stuff."}, {"time": 896, "text": "In fact, textbooks are freaking incredible."}, {"time": 898, "text": "If you go back now and you look at like biology textbook or any of the computer science textbooks on algorithms and data structures, those things are incredibly..."}, {"time": 909, "text": "They have the best summary of a subject, plus they have practice problems of increasing difficulty that allows you to truly master the basic, like the fundamental ideas behind that."}, {"time": 919, "text": "I got through my entire physics degree with one textbook that was just this really comprehensive one that they told us at the beginning of the first year, buy this, but you're gonna have to buy 15 other books for all your supplementary courses."}, {"time": 933, "text": "And I was like, every time I was just checked to see whether this book covered it and it did."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And I think I only bought like two or three extra and thank God, cause they're super expensive textbooks."}, {"time": 941, "text": "It's a whole racket they've got going on."}, {"time": 945, "text": "They could just... You get the right one, it's just like a manual for..."}, {"time": 949, "text": "But what's interesting though, is this is the tyranny of having exams and metrics."}, {"time": 956, "text": "The tyranny of exams and metrics, yes."}, {"time": 958, "text": "I loved them because I'm very competitive and I liked finding ways to gamify things and then like sort of dust off my shoulders afterwards when I get a good grade or be annoyed at myself when I didn't."}, {"time": 969, "text": "But yeah, you're absolutely right."}, {"time": 970, "text": "And that the actual... How much of that physics knowledge I've retained, like I've learned how to cram and study and please an examiner, but did that give me the deep lasting knowledge that I needed?"}, {"time": 984, "text": "I mean, yes and no, but really like nothing makes you learn a topic better than when you actually then have to teach it yourself."}, {"time": 994, "text": "Like I'm trying to wrap my teeth around this like game theory Moloch stuff right now."}, {"time": 998, "text": "And there's no exam at the end of it that I can gamify."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "There's no way to gamify and sort of like shortcut my way through it."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "I have to understand it so deeply from like deep foundational levels to then to build upon it and then try and explain it to other people."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And like, you're about to go and do some lectures, right?"}, {"time": 1014, "text": "You can't sort of just like, you presumably can't rely on the knowledge that you got through when you were studying for an exam to reteach that."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "Yeah, and especially high level lectures, especially the kind of stuff you do on YouTube, you're not just regurgitating material."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "You have to think through what is the core idea here."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "And when you do the lectures live especially, you have to, there's no second takes."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "That is the luxury you get if you're recording a video for YouTube or something like that."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "But it definitely is a luxury you shouldn't lean on."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "I've gotten to interact with a few YouTubers that lean on that too much."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "And you realize, oh, you've gamified this system because you're not really thinking deeply about stuff."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "You're through the edit, both written and spoken, you're crafting an amazing video, but you yourself as a human being have not really deeply understood it."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "So live teaching or at least recording video with very few takes is a different beast."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "And I think it's the most honest way of doing it, like as few takes as possible."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "That's why I'm nervous about this."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "Don't go back and be like, ah, let's do that."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "Don't fuck this up, Liv."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "The tyranny of exams."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "I do think people talk about high school and college as a time to do drugs and drink and have fun and all this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "But looking back, of course I did a lot of those things."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "Yes, no, yes, but it's also a time when you get to read textbooks or read books or learn with all the time in the world."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "You don't have these responsibilities of laundry and having to sort of pay for mortgage, all that kind of stuff, pay taxes, all this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "In most cases, there's just so much time in the day for learning and you don't realize it at the time because at the time it seems like a chore, like why the hell does there's so much homework?"}, {"time": 1154, "text": "But you never get a chance to do this kind of learning, this kind of homework ever again in life, unless later in life you really make a big effort out of it."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "Like basically your knowledge gets solidified."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "You don't get to have fun and learn."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Learning is really fulfilling and really fun if you're that kind of person."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Like some people like, you know, like knowledge is not something that they think is fun."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "But if that's the kind of thing that you think is fun, that's the time to have fun and do the drugs and drink and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "But the learning, just going back to those textbooks, the hours spent with the textbooks is really, really rewarding."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "Do people even use textbooks anymore?"}, {"time": 1196, "text": "Kids these days with their TikTok and their... Well, not even that, but it's just like so much information, really high quality information, you know, it's now in digital format online."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "Yeah, but they're not, they are using that, but you know, college is still very, there's a curriculum."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "I mean, so much of school is about rigorous study of a subject and still on YouTube, that's not there."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "YouTube has, YouTube has, Grant Sanderson talks about this."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "He's this math... 3Blue1Brown."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "Yeah, 3Blue1Brown."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "He says like, I'm not a math teacher."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "I just take really cool concepts and I inspire people."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "But if you wanna really learn calculus, if you wanna really learn linear algebra, you should do the textbook."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "You should do that, you know."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And there's still the textbook industrial complex that like charges like $200 for textbook and somehow, I don't know, it's ridiculous."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Well, they're like, oh, sorry, new edition, edition 14.6."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "Sorry, you can't use 14.5 anymore."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "It's like, what's different?"}, {"time": 1263, "text": "We've got one paragraph different."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "So we mentioned offline, Daniel Negrano."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "I'm gonna get a chance to talk to him on this podcast."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "And he's somebody that I found fascinating in terms of the way he thinks about poker, verbalizes the way he thinks about poker, the way he plays poker."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "So, and he's still pretty damn good."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "He's been good for a long time."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So you mentioned that people are running these kinds of simulations and the game of poker has changed."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "Do you think he's adapting in this way?"}, {"time": 1293, "text": "Like the top pros, do they have to adopt this way?"}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Or is there still like over the years, you basically develop this gut feeling about, like you get to be like good the way, like alpha zero is good."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "You look at the board and somehow from the fog comes out the right answer."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Like this is likely what they have."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "This is likely the best way to move."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And you don't really, you can't really put a finger on exactly why, but it just comes from your gut feeling."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "So gut feelings are definitely very important."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "You know, that we've got our two, you can distill it down to two modes of decision making, right?"}, {"time": 1339, "text": "You've got your sort of logical linear voice in your head, system two, as it's often called, and your system one, your gut intuition."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "And historically in poker, the very best players were playing almost entirely by their gut."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "You know, often they do some kind of inspired play and you'd ask them why they do it and they wouldn't really be able to explain it."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "And that's not so much because their process was unintelligible, but it was more just because no one had the language with which to describe what optimal strategies were because no one really understood how poker worked."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "This was before, you know, we had analysis software."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "You know, no one was writing, I guess some people would write down their hands in a little notebook, but there was no way to assimilate all this data and analyze it."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "But then, you know, when computers became cheaper and software started emerging, and then obviously online poker, where it would like automatically save your hand histories."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Now, all of a sudden you kind of had this body of data that you could run analysis on."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "And so that's when people started to see, you know, these mathematical solutions."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "And so what that meant is the role of intuition essentially became smaller."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "And it went more into, as we talked before about, you know, this game theory optimal style."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "But also, as I said, like game theory optimal is about loss minimization and being unexploitable."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "But if you're playing against people who aren't, because no person, no human being can play perfectly game theory optimal in poker, not even the best AIs."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "They're still like, you know, they're 99.99% of the way there or whatever, but it's kind of like the speed of light."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "You can't reach it perfectly."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "So there's still a role for intuition?"}, {"time": 1443, "text": "Yes, so when, yeah, when you're playing this unexploitable style, but when your opponents start doing something, you know, suboptimal that you want to exploit, well, now that's where not only your like logical brain will need to be thinking, well, okay, I know I have this, I'm in the sort of top end of my range here with this hand."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "So that means I need to be calling X percent of the time and I put them on this range, et cetera."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "But then sometimes you'll have this gut feeling that will tell you, you know what, this time, I know mathematically I'm meant to call now."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "You know, I'm in the sort of top end of my range and this is the odds I'm getting."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "So the math says I should call, but there's something in your gut saying, they've got it this time, they've got it."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Like they're beating you, your hand is worse."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "So then the real art, this is where the last remaining art in poker, the fuzziness is like, do you listen to your gut?"}, {"time": 1503, "text": "How do you quantify the strength of it?"}, {"time": 1506, "text": "Or can you even quantify the strength of it?"}, {"time": 1508, "text": "And I think that's what Daniel has."}, {"time":

he just, the card, he's like a wizard and he gets the cards to do what he needs them to."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "Because he just expects to win and he expects to receive, you know, to get flopper

something?"}, {"time": 2087, "text": "So I think in this scenario, I had a flush draw."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "So I had two clubs, two clubs came out on the flop."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "And

people, not people, creatures from outside of the simulation sort of can tune in and play your character."}, {"time": 3864, "text": "And that feeling you got is somebody just like, they got to play a poker tournament through you."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "Honestly, it felt like that."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "It did actually feel a little bit like that."}, {"time": 3873, "text": "But it's been 12 years now."}, {"time": 3875, "text": "I've retold the story many times."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "Like, I don't even know how much I can trust my memory."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "You're just an

of dark period because I had this incredible, like the highs of winning that, just on a like material level were insane, winning the money."}, {"time": 3907, "text": "I was on the front page of newspapers because there was like this girl that came out of nowhere and won this big thing."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "And so again, like sort of chasing that feeling was difficult."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "But then on top of that, there was this feeling of like almost being touched by something bigger that was like, ah."}, {"time": 3924, "text": "So maybe, did you have a sense that I might be somebody special?"}, {"time": 3929, "text": "Like this kind of, I think that's the confidence thing that maybe you could do something special in this world after all kind of feeling."}, {"time": 3942,

this person or that person is brilliant, but really no, they're just like sitting there and thinking through stuff just like the rest of us."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "I think they're in the habit of

it is you're trying to do, you know?"}, {"time": 4234, "text": "And that's partly another thing that's now led me to explore the concept of God, whether you wanna call it a simulator, the classic

like all benevolent, endless love."}, {"time": 4253, "text": "The simulation, at least one of the simulation hypothesis is like, as you said, like a teenager in his bedroom who doesn't really care,

thing they called Moloch in order to get power to win wars."}, {"time": 4499, "text": "So really dark, horrible things."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "And it was literally like about child sacrifice,

then I don't know, it seemed like it was kind of quiet throughout history in terms of mythology beyond that, until this movie Metropolis in 1927 talked about this, you see that there was this incredible futuristic city that everyone was living great in, but then the protagonist goes underground into the sewers and sees that the city is run by this machine."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "And this machine basically would just like kill the workers all the time because it was just so hard to keep it running."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "They were always dying."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "So there was all this suffering that was required in order to keep the city going."}, {"time": 4544, "text": "And then the protagonist has this vision that this machine is actually this demon Moloch."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "So again, it's like this sort of like mechanistic consumption of humans in order to get more power."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "And then Allen Ginsberg wrote a poem in the 60s,

capitalism."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "But then the sort of piece to resistance that's moved Moloch into this idea of game theory was Scott Alexander of Slate Style Codex wrote this incredible, well, literally I think it might be my favorite piece of writing of all time."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "It's called Meditations on Moloch."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "Everyone must go read it."}, {"time":

yeah."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "So anyway, so he writes, he writes this piece, Meditations on Moloch, and basically he analyzes the poem and he's like, okay, so it seems to be something relating to where competition goes wrong."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "And, you know, Moloch was historically this thing of like where people would sacrifice a thing that they care about, in this case, children, their own children, in order to gain power, a competitive advantage."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "And if you look at almost everything that sort of goes wrong in our society, it's that same process."},

technologies come along, it's everyone is incentivized to that short term strategy."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "But over on net, it's bad for everyone because now everyone is kind of feeling like they have to use these things."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "And these things like they make you like, the reason why I talked about them in this video is because I noticed it myself, you know, like I was trying to grow my Instagram for a while, I've given up on it now."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "But yeah, and I noticed these filters, how good they made me look."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "And I'm like, well, I know that everyone else is kind of doing it."}, {"time": 4737, "text": "Go subscribe to Liv's Instagram."}, {"time": 4738, "text": "Please, so I don't have to use the filters."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "I'll post a bunch of, yeah, make it blow up."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "So yeah, you felt the pressure actually."}, {"time": 4748, "text": "Exactly, these short term incentives to do this like, this thing that like either sacrifices your integrity or something else in order to like stay competitive, which on aggregate turns like, creates this like sort of race to the bottom spiral where everyone else ends up in a situation which is worse off than if they hadn't started, you know, than they were before."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "Kind of like if, like at a football stadium, like the system is so badly designed, a competitive system of like everyone sitting and having a view that if someone at the very front stands up to get an even better view, it forces everyone else behind

God's eye coordination to make it go back to the better state."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "But from within the system, you can't actually do that."}, {"time": 4796, "text": "So that's kind of what this Moloch thing is."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "It's this thing that makes people sacrifice values in order to optimize for the winning the game in question, the short term game."}, {"time": 4805, "text":

responsibility for, I mean, social media is a really nice place for a large number of people to play game theory."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "And so they also have the ability to then design the rules

he did, yeah."}, {"time": 5296, "text": "But there's truth to that."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "It's very, there is wisdom in that because memes have driven history."}, {"time": 5302, "text": "You

like talking out my ass here, there are studies here that have looked into this."}, {"time": 5478, "text": "Whereas like if someone's like, disgusted or fearful, they actually tend to then be like, oh, I don't wanna deal with this."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "So they're less likely to actually engage and share it and so on, they're just gonna be like, ugh."}, {"time": 5487, "text": "Whereas if they're enraged by a thing, well now that triggers all the like, the old tribalism emotions."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "And so that's how then things get sort of spread, you know, much more easily."},

attention, in the war of attention is constantly maximizing rage."}, {"time": 5530, "text": "What it is optimizing for is engagement."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "And it happens to be that engagement is more propaganda, you know."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "I mean, it just sounds like everything is putting, more and more things are being put through this like propagandist lens of winning whatever the

that, we have actual bad actors who are intentionally trying to, like, manipulate the other side into doing things."}, {"time": 5657, "text": "And using, so because it's a digital space, they're able

exciting."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "You know what I want to do?"}, {"time": 5674, "text": "You know what I want to do that, because there is, you know, people are talking about bots manipulating and,

is, there's always unforeseen circumstances, you know, outcomes, externalities of you trying to adopt a thing, even if you do it in the very best of faith."}, {"time": 5723, "text": "But you can learn lessons of history."}, {"time": 5725, "text": "If you can run some sims on it first, absolutely."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "But also there's certain aspects of a system, as we've learned through

it."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "Because in the beginning, I might have a good understanding of what's good and not, but over time, that starts to get deviated, because I'll get annoyed at some assholes, and I'll think, okay, wouldn't it be nice to get rid of those assholes?"}, {"time": 5753, "text": "But then that power starts getting to your head, you become corrupted, that's basic human

"Yeah, and without a leader, like without...

still need the ability to coordinate, because that's the issue when something is too, you know, that's really, to me, like the culture wars, the bigger war we're dealing with is actually between the

like present, cause basically I'm painting the picture of like what Moloch is and how it's affecting almost all these issues in our society and how it's driving."}, {"time": 5886, "text": "It's like kind of the generator function as people describe it of existential risk."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "And then at the end of that."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "Wait, wait, the generator function of existential risk."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "So you're saying Moloch is sort of the engine that creates a bunch of X risks."}, {"time": 5899, "text": "Yes, not all of them."}, {"time": 5900, "text":

because it's, you know, it's just like this one big external thing."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "It's not like a competition thing going on."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "But, you know, synthetic bio, you know, bio weapons, that's one because everyone's incentivized to build, even for defense, you know, bad, bad viruses, you know, just to threaten someone else, et cetera."}, {"time": 5943, "text": "Or AI, technically the race to AGI is kind of potentially a Molochi situation."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "But yeah, so if Moloch is this like generator function that's driving all of these issues over the coming century that might wipe us out, what's the inverse?"}, {"time": 5960, "text": "And so far what I've gotten to is this character that I want to put out there called Winwin."}, {"time": 5966,

ends up worse off."}, {"time": 5974, "text": "So I was like, well, what's the opposite of that?"}, {"time": 5975, "text": "It's Winwin."}, {"time": 5976, "text": "And I was thinking for ages, like, what's a good name for this character?"}, {"time": 5979, "text": "And then tomorrow I was like, okay, well, don't try and, you know, think through it logically."}, {"time": 5984, "text": "What's the vibe of Winwin?"}, {"time": 5986, "text": "And to me, like in my mind, Moloch is like, and I addressed that in the video, like it's red and black."}, {"time": 5992, "text": "It's kind of like very, you know, hyper focused on it's one goal you must win."}, {"time": 5998, "text": "So Winwin is kind of actually like these colors."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "It's like purple, turquoise."}, {"time": 6004, "text": "It's loves games too."}, {"time": 6006, "text": "It loves a little bit of healthy competition, but constrained, like kind of like before, like knows how to ring fence zero sum competition into like just the right amount, whereby its externalities can be controlled and kept positive."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "And then beyond that, it also loves cooperation, coordination, love, all these other things."}, {"time": 6023, "text": "But it's also kind of like mischievous, like, you know, it will have a good time."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "It's not like kind of like boring, you know, like, oh God, it knows how to have fun."}, {"time": 6033, "text": "It can get like, it can get down, but ultimately it's like unbelievably wise and it just wants the game to keep going."},

think it's formal name when it has to do like official functions is Omnia."}, {"time": 6055, "text": "Omnia."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "From like omniscience kind of, why Omnia?"}, {"time": 6059,

would like, you know, and this is."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "I like Omnia."}, {"time": 6065, "text": "But there is an angelic kind of sense to Omnia though."}, {"time": 6068, "text": "So Winwin is more fun."}, {"time": 6069, "text": "So it's more like, it embraces the fun aspect."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "The fun aspect."}, {"time": 6076, "text": "I mean, there is something about sort of, there's some aspect to Winwin interactions that requires embracing the chaos of the game and enjoying the game itself."}, {"time": 6095, "text": "That's almost like a Zen like appreciation of the game itself, not optimizing for the consequences of the game."}, {"time": 6102, "text": "Right, well, it's recognizing the value of competition in of itself about, it's not like about winning."}, {"time": 6108, "text": "It's about you enjoying the process of having a competition and not knowing whether you're gonna win or lose this little thing."}, {"time": 6113, "text": "But then also being aware that, you know, what's the boundary?"}, {"time": 6117, "text": "How big do I want competition to be?"}, {"time": 6119, "text": "Because one of the reason why Moloch is doing so well now in our society, in our civilization is because we haven't been able to ring fence competition."}, {"time": 6127, "text": "You know, and so it's just having all these negative externalities and it's, we've completely lost control of it."}, {"time": 6133, "text": "You know, it's, I think my guess is, and now we're getting really like, you know, metaphysical technically, but I think we'll be in a more interesting universe if we have one that has both pure cooperation, you know, lots of cooperation and some pockets of competition than one that's purely competition, cooperation entirely."}, {"time": 6156, "text": "Like it's good to have some little zero sumness bits, but I don't know that fully and I'm not qualified as a philosopher to know that."}, {"time": 6164, "text": "And that's what reverse

to kind of try to start to formulate different ideas, different frameworks of how we think about that."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "At the small scale of a collection of individuals and a large scale of

that's the advice on YouTube, Twitter, you name it."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "And that's why, and the trouble with that is that it's a complexity reduction."}, {"time": 6402, "text": "And generally speaking, you know, complexity reduction is bad."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "It's making things more, it's an oversimplification."}, {"time": 6408, "text": "Not that simplification is always a bad thing."}, {"time": 6411, "text": "But when you're trying to take, you know, what is social media doing?"}, {"time": 6416, "text": "It's trying to like encapsulate the human experience and put it into digital form and commodify it to an extent."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "That, so you do that, you compress people down into these like narrow things."}, {"time": 6429, "text": "And that's why I think it's kind of ultimately fundamentally incompatible with at least my definition of beauty."}, {"time": 6435, "text": "It's interesting because there is some sense in which a simplification sort of in the Einstein kind of sense of a really complex idea, a simplification in a way that still captures some core power of an idea of a person is also beautiful."}, {"time": 6456, "text": "And so maybe it's possible for social media to do that."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "A presentation, a sort of a slither, a slice, a look into a person's life that reveals something real about them."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "But in a simple way, in a way that can be displayed graphically or through words."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "Some way, I mean, in some way Twitter can do that kind of thing."}, {"time": 6479, "text": "A very few set of words can reveal the intricacies of a person."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "Of course, the viral machine that spreads those words often results in people taking the thing out of context."}, {"time": 6494, "text": "People often don't read tweets in the context of the human being that wrote them."}, {"time": 6500, "text": "The full history of the tweets they've written, the education level, the humor level, the world view they're playing around with, all that context is forgotten and people just see the different words."}, {"time": 6513, "text": "So that can lead to trouble."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "But in a certain sense, if you do take it in context, it reveals some kind of quirky little beautiful idea or a profound little idea from that particular person that shows something about that person."}, {"time": 6528, "text": "So in that sense, Twitter can be more successful if we're talking about Mollux is driving a better kind of incentive."}, {"time": 6536, "text": "Yeah, I mean, how they can, like if we were to rewrite, is there a way to rewrite the Twitter algorithm so that it stops being the fertile breeding ground of the culture wars?"}, {"time": 6552, "text": "Because that's really what it is."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "I mean, maybe I'm giving it, Twitter too much power, but just the more I looked into it and I had conversations with Tristan Harris from Center of Humane Technology."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "And he explained it as like, Twitter is where you have this amalgam of human culture and then this terribly designed algorithm that amplifies the craziest people and the angriest most divisive takes and amplifies them."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "And then the media, the mainstream media, because all the journalists are also on Twitter, they then are informed by that."}, {"time": 6592, "text": "And so they draw out the stories they can from this already like very boiling lava of rage and then spread that to their millions and millions of people who aren't even on Twitter."}, {"time": 6607, "text": "And so I honestly, I think if I could press a button, turn them off, I probably would at this point, because I just don't see a way of being compatible with healthiness, but that's not gonna happen."}, {"time": 6619, "text": "And so at least one way to like stem the tide and make it less malachy would be to change, at least if like it was on a subscription model, then it's now not optimizing for impressions."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "Cause basically what it wants is for people to keep coming back as often as possible."}, {"time": 6640, "text": "That's how they get paid, right?"}, {"time": 6642, "text": "Every time an ad gets shown to someone and the way is to get people constantly refreshing their feed."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "So you're trying to encourage addictive behaviors."}, {"time": 6649, "text": "Whereas if someone, if they moved on to at least a subscription model, then they're getting the money either way, whether someone comes back to the site once a month or 500 times a month, they get the same amount of money."}, {"time": 6662, "text": "So now that takes away that incentive, to use technology, to build, to design an algorithm that is maximally addictive."}, {"time": 6670, "text": "That would be one way, for example."}, {"time": 6672, "text": "Yeah, but you still want people to, yeah, I just feel like that just slows down, creates friction in the virality of things."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "But that's good."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "We need to slow down virality."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "It's good, it's one way."}, {"time": 6686, "text": "Virality is malach, to be clear."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "So malach is always negative then?"}, {"time": 6694, "text": "Yes, by definition."}, {"time": 6697, "text": "Competition is not always negative."}, {"time": 6699, "text": "Competition is neutral."}, {"time": 6700, "text": "I disagree with you that all virality is negative then, is malach then."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "Because it's a good intuition, because we have a lot of data on virality being negative."}, {"time": 6712, "text": "But I happen to believe that the core of human beings, so most human beings want to be good more than they want to be bad to each other."}, {"time": 6723, "text": "And so I think it's possible, it might be just harder to engineer systems that enable virality, but it's possible to engineer systems that are viral that enable virality."}, {"time": 6735, "text": "And the kind of stuff that rises to the top is things that are positive."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "And positive, not like la la positive, it's more like win win, meaning a lot of people need to be challenged."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "Wise things, yes."}, {"time": 6749, "text": "You grow from it, it might challenge you, you might not like it, but you ultimately grow from it."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "And ultimately bring people together as opposed to tear them apart."}, {"time": 6758, "text": "I deeply want that to be true."}, {"time": 6760, "text": "And I very much agree with you that people at their core are on average good, care for each other, as opposed to not."}, {"time": 6766, "text": "Like I think it's actually a very small percentage of people are truly wanting to do just like destructive malicious things."}, {"time": 6774, "text": "Most people are just trying to win their own little game."}, {"time": 6776, "text": "And they don't mean to be, they're just stuck in this badly designed system."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "That said, the current structure, yes, is the current structure means that virality is optimized towards Moloch."}, {"time": 6790, "text": "That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "Sometimes positive stories do go viral and I think we should study them."}, {"time": 6795, "text": "I think there should be a whole field of study into understanding, identifying memes that above a certain threshold of the population agree is a positive, happy, bringing people together meme."}, {"time": 6807, "text": "The kind of thing that brings families together that would normally argue about cultural stuff at the table, at the dinner table."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "Identify those memes and figure out what it was, what was the ingredient that made them spread that day."}, {"time": 6821, "text": "And also like not just like happiness and connection between humans, but connection between humans in other ways that enables like productivity, like cooperation, solving difficult problems and all those kinds of stuff."}, {"time": 6836, "text": "So it's not just about let's be happy and have a fulfilling lives."}, {"time": 6840, "text": "It's also like, let's build cool shit."}, {"time": 6843, "text": "Let's get excited."}, {"time": 6844, "text": "Which is the spirit of collaboration, which is deeply anti Moloch, right?"}, {"time": 6846, "text": "That's, it's not using competition."}, {"time": 6849, "text": "It's like, Moloch hates collaboration and coordination and people working together."}, {"time": 6854, "text": "And that's, again, like the internet started out as that and it could have been that, but because of the way it was sort of structured in terms of, you know, very lofty ideal, they wanted everything to be open source, open source and also free."}, {"time": 6870, "text": "And, but they needed to find a way to pay the bills anyway, because they were still building this on top of our old economics system."}, {"time": 6876, "text": "And so the way they did that was through third party advertisement."}, {"time": 6880, "text": "But that meant that things were very decoupled."}, {"time": 6882, "text": "You know, you've got this third party interest, which means that you're then like, people having to optimize for that."}, {"time": 6888, "text": "And that is, you know, the actual consumer is actually the product, not the person you're making the thing for."}, {"time": 6896, "text": "In the end, you start making the thing for the advertiser."}, {"time": 6899, "text": "And so that's why it then like breaks down."}, {"time": 6903, "text": "Yeah, like it's, there's no clean solution to this."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "And I, it's a really good suggestion by you actually to like figure out how we can optimize virality for positive sum topics."}, {"time": 6919, "text": "I shall be the general of the love bot army."}, {"time": 6924, "text": "Distributed."}, {"time": 6926, "text": "Distributed,

your thinking."}, {"time": 6935, "text": "We've been talking about this, sort of a game theoretic view on life and putting probabilities behind estimates."}, {"time": 6942, "text": "Like if you think about different trajectories you can take through life, just actually analyzing life in game theoretic way, like your own life, like personal life."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "I think you've given an example that you had an honest conversation with Igor about like, how long is this relationship gonna last?"}, {"time": 6957, "text": "So similar to our sort of marriage problem kind of discussion, having an honest conversation about the probability of things that we sometimes are a little bit too shy or scared to think of in a probabilistic terms."}, {"time": 6971, "text": "Can you speak to that kind of way of reasoning, the good and the bad of that?"}, {"time": 6977, "text": "Can you do this kind of thing with human relations?"}, {"time": 6980, "text": "Yeah, so the scenario you're talking about, it was like."}, {"time": 6985, "text": "Yeah, tell me about that scenario."}, {"time": 6986, "text": "Yeah, I think it was about a year into our relationship and we were having a fairly heavy conversation because we were trying to figure out whether or not I was gonna sell my apartment."}, {"time": 6997, "text": "Well, you know, he had already moved in, but I think we were just figuring out what like our longterm plans would be."}, {"time": 7003, "text": "We should be by a place together, et cetera."}, {"time": 7006, "text": "When you guys are having that conversation, are you like drunk out of your mind on wine or is he sober and you're actually having a serious?"}, {"time": 7012, "text": "I think we were sober."}, {"time": 7013, "text": "How do you get to that conversation?"}, {"time": 7014, "text": "Because most people are kind of afraid to have that kind of serious conversation."}, {"time": 7018, "text": "Well, so our relationship was very, well, first of all, we were good friends for a couple of years before we even got romantic."}, {"time": 7028, "text": "And when we did get romantic, it was very clear that this was a big deal."}, {"time": 7035, "text": "It wasn't just like another, it wasn't a random thing."}, {"time": 7040, "text": "So the probability of it being a big deal was high."}, {"time": 7042, "text": "It was already very high."}, {"time": 7044, "text": "And then we'd been together for a year and it had been pretty golden and wonderful."}, {"time": 7048, "text": "So, you know, there was a lot of foundation already where we felt very comfortable having a lot of frank conversations."}, {"time": 7055, "text": "But Igor's MO has always been much more than mine."}, {"time": 7058, "text": "He was always from the outset, like just in a relationship, radical transparency and honesty is the way because the truth is the truth, whether you want to hide it or not, you know, but it will come out eventually."}, {"time": 7070, "text": "And if you aren't able to accept difficult things yourself, then how could you possibly expect to be like the most integral version that, you know, you can't, the relationship needs this bedrock of like honesty as a foundation more than anything."}, {"time": 7086, "text": "Yeah, that's really interesting, but I would like to push against some of those ideas, but that's the down the line, yes, throw them up."}, {"time": 7093, "text": "I just rudely interrupt."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "And so, you know, we'd been about together for a year and things were good and we were having this hard conversation and then he was like, well, okay, what's the likelihood that we're going to be together in three years then?"}, {"time": 7108, "text": "Because I think it was roughly a three year time horizon."}, {"time": 7111, "text": "And I was like, ooh, ooh, interesting."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "And then we were like, actually wait, before you said out loud, let's both write down our predictions formally because we'd been like, we're just getting into like effective altruism and rationality at the time, which is all about making formal predictions as a means of measuring your own, well, your own foresight essentially in a quantified way."}, {"time": 7133, "text": "So we like both wrote down our percentages and we also did a one year prediction and a 10 year one as well."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "So we got percentages for all three and then we showed each other."}, {"time": 7143, "text": "And I remember like having this moment of like, ooh, because for the 10 year one, I was like, well, I mean, I love him a lot, but like a lot can happen in 10 years, and we've only been together for, so I was like, I think it's over 50%, but it's definitely not 90%."}, {"time": 7157, "text": "And I remember like wrestling, I was like, oh, but I don't want him to be hurt."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "I don't want him to, I don't want to give a number lower than his."}, {"time": 7162, "text": "And I remember thinking, I was like, ah, ah, don't game it."}, {"time": 7165, "text": "This is an exercise in radical honesty."}, {"time": 7168, "text": "So just give your real percentage."}, {"time": 7169, "text": "And I think mine was like 75%."}, {"time": 7171, "text": "And then we showed each other and luckily we were fairly well aligned."}, {"time": 7174, "text": "And, but honestly, even if we weren't."}, {"time": 7178, "text": "20%."}, {"time": 7180, "text": "It definitely would have, I, if his had been consistently lower than mine, that would have rattled me for sure."}, {"time": 7188, "text": "Whereas if it had been the other way around, I think he would have, he's just kind of like a water off a duck's back type of guy."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "It'd be like, okay, well, all right, we'll figure this out."}, {"time": 7195, "text": "Well, did you guys provide error bars on the estimate?"}, {"time": 7197, "text": "Like the level of uncertainty?"}, {"time": 7198, "text": "They came built in."}, {"time": 7199, "text": "We didn't give formal plus or minus error bars."}, {"time": 7202, "text": "I didn't draw any or anything like that."}, {"time": 7203, "text": "Well, I guess that's the question I have is, did you feel informed enough to make such decisions?"}, {"time": 7212, "text": "Cause like, I feel like if you were, if I were to do this kind of thing rigorously, I would want some data."}, {"time": 7220, "text": "I would want to set one of the assumptions you have is you're not that different from other relationships."}, {"time": 7226, "text": "And so I want to have some data about the way."}, {"time": 7229, "text": "You want the base rates."}, {"time": 7230, "text": "Yeah, and also actual trajectories of relationships."},

"text": "Like how informative is your past to your future?"}, {"time": 7265, "text": "Like can you look at my life and have a good prediction about in terms of my characteristics and my relationships, what that's going to look like in the future or not?"}, {"time": 7275, "text": "I don't even know the answer to that question."}, {"time": 7277, "text": "I'll be very ill informed in terms of making the probability."}, {"time": 7280, "text": "I would be far, yeah, I just would be under informed."}, {"time": 7285, "text": "I would be under informed."}, {"time": 7286, "text": "I'll be over biasing to my prior experiences, I think."}, {"time": 7291, "text": "Right, but as long as you're aware of that and you're honest with yourself, and you're honest with the other person, say, look, I have really wide error bars on this for the following reasons, that's okay."}, {"time": 7300, "text": "I still think it's better than not trying to quantify it at all."}, {"time": 7303, "text": "If you're trying to make really major irreversible life decisions."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "And I feel also the romantic nature of that question for me personally, I try to live my life thinking it's very close to 100%."}, {"time": 7315, "text": "Like, allowing myself actually the, this is the difficulty of this is allowing myself to think differently, I feel like has a psychological consequence."}, {"time": 7326, "text": "That's where that, that's one of my pushbacks against radical honesty is this one particular perspective."}, {"time": 7334, "text": "So you're saying you would rather give a falsely high percentage to your partner."}, {"time": 7340, "text": "Going back to the wide sage filth."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "In order to sort of create this additional optimism."}, {"time": 7344,

hashtag."}, {"time": 7355, "text": "Well, so that, and this comes back to this idea of useful fictions, right?"}, {"time": 7359, "text": "And I agree, I don't think there's a clear answer to this."}, {"time": 7362, "text": "And I think it's actually quite subjective."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "Some people this works better for than others."}, {"time": 7368, "text": "You know, to be clear, Igor and I weren't doing this formal prediction in it."}, {"time": 7371, "text": "Like we did it with very much tongue in cheek."}, {"time": 7375, "text": "It wasn't like we were going to make, I don't think it even would have drastically changed what we decided to do even."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "We kind of just did it more as a fun exercise."}, {"time": 7385, "text": "For the consequence of that fun exercise, you really actually kind of, there was a deep honesty to it."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "Exactly, it was a deep, and it was, yeah, it was just like this moment of reflection."}, {"time": 7393, "text": "I'm like, oh wow, I actually have to think like through this quite critically and so on."}, {"time": 7397, "text": "And it's also what was interesting was I got to like check in with what my desires were."}, {"time": 7405, "text": "So there was one thing of like what my actual prediction is, but what are my desires and could these desires be affecting my predictions and so on."}, {"time": 7412, "text": "And you know, that's a method of rationality."}, {"time": 7414, "text": "And I personally don't think it loses anything in terms of, I didn't take any of the magic away from our relationship, quite the opposite."}, {"time": 7419, "text": "Like it brought us closer together because it was like, we did this weird fun thing that I appreciate a lot of people find quite strange."}, {"time": 7427, "text": "And I think it was somewhat unique in our relationship that both of us are very, we both love numbers, we both love statistics, we're both poker players."}, {"time": 7438, "text": "So this was kind of like our safe space anyway."}, {"time": 7441, "text": "For others, one partner really might not like that kind of stuff at all, in which case this is not a good exercise to do."}, {"time": 7447, "text": "I don't recommend it to everybody."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "But I do think there's, it's interesting sometimes to poke holes in the probe at these things that we consider so sacred that we can't try to quantify them, which is interesting because that's in tension with like the idea of what we just talked about with beauty and like what makes something beautiful, the fact that you can't measure everything about it."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "And perhaps something shouldn't be tried to measure, maybe it's wrong to completely try and value

know, there's a balance, probably is a personal balance to strike is the amount of rationality you apply to a question versus the useful fiction, the fake it till you make it."}, {"time": 7540,
