economy with a large degree of specialization, because it's very difficult to find people who want the thing that you have and have the thing that you want."}, {"time": 277, "text": "We call this the coincidence of wants."}, {"time": 280, "text": "And that's really the problem that money solves."}, {"time": 282, "text": "So you make apples and I make oranges."}, {"time": 286, "text": "I'd like to have some of your apples, but you don't want my oranges."}, {"time": 290, "text": "And that's, we have a problem of coincidence of wants."}, {"time": 293, "text": "You want bananas."}, {"time": 294, "text": "I need to find somebody who has bananas, give them my oranges, take their bananas, give you their bananas, and then I take the apples."}, {"time": 300, "text": "In that case, bananas are a medium of exchange."}, {"time": 303, "text": "So it's natural that a medium of exchange will evolve and will emerge in an economy as an economy becomes more sophisticated."}, {"time": 309, "text": "As we move beyond 10 people and 10 goods, it's inevitable that we're going to come to a situation where we have the problem of coincidence of wants."}, {"time": 318, "text": "And the way to solve that is to use a medium of exchange."}, {"time": 321, "text": "And it can be anything."}, {"time": 322, "text": "It can be a banana, it can be food stuff, it can be any kind of good."}, {"time": 328, "text": "As long as I acquire the good with the purpose of passing it on to you, not for the purpose of me consuming it or using it, then that's a medium of exchange."}, {"time": 336, "text": "So when we look at the entirety of human society of millions of billions of people, you think of them, just a bunch of individuals running around."}, {"time": 346, "text": "I love the term coincidence of wants."}, {"time": 349, "text": "So each one of them, it's like a stochastic system."}, {"time": 352, "text": "They have desires, it's like a random collection of desires, somehow rooted in our evolutionary history, but mostly random in terms of preference of banana or apple, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 364, "text": "And then they also have the capacity for competence and excellence in particular kind of labor."}, {"time": 371, "text": "So like specialization, they're able to be like incredible at a particular set of tasks."}, {"time": 378, "text": "So there's a bunch of ants running around with consciousness and intelligence, and they have desires and they have capabilities."}, {"time": 386, "text": "And then there's a coincidence of both the wants they have and the capabilities they have, and you wanted to create a system that kind of exchanges those things."}, {"time": 399, "text": "So when you imagine like what is a good, what is markets?"}, {"time": 405, "text": "When you imagine a market is like a hierarchical system, what do you imagine?"}, {"time": 410, "text": "What is a market?"}, {"time": 412, "text": "A market is just the name for the naturally emergent phenomena of people voluntarily exchanging things."}, {"time": 418, "text": "It's at any scale."}, {"time": 420, "text": "At any scale, yeah."}, {"time": 421, "text": "Individually, it could be a market of two people on an island on their own."}, {"time": 424, "text": "It could be 8 billion people across the planet."}, {"time": 427, "text": "Naturally emerging."}, {"time": 429, "text": "Yes, this is the thing I think that is very hard for many people who don't have a good understanding of economics to grasp that capitalism and markets are not something that you need a central planner or a government officer to make happen."}, {"time": 446, "text": "Capitalism is just what happens when people are left to their own devices."}, {"time": 450, "text": "It's just our cognitive capacity allows us to develop tools that we can use for production."}, {"time": 456, "text": "And that's what we do."}, {"time": 457, "text": "That's what humans have been doing since they started making spears to hunt."}, {"time": 462, "text": "That's the first capital good probably."}, {"time": 464, "text": "So we're constantly accumulating capital."}, {"time": 466, "text": "We're constantly trading with one another."}, {"time": 467, "text": "We find an opportunity."}, {"time": 469, "text": "You've got a lot of oranges."}, {"time": 470, "text": "I've got a lot of apples."}, {"time": 472, "text": "Then I'll take some of yours."}, {"time": 473, "text": "You'll take some of mine."}, {"time": 474, "text": "We're both better off."}, {"time": 476, "text": "This is just a naturally emergent thing."}, {"time": 478, "text": "And money is what makes it enormously powerful."}, {"time": 483, "text": "Money is what allows it to scale really."}, {"time": 485, "text": "Money is what allows it to go beyond small societies into just something that is global."}, {"time": 491, "text": "Because with money, again, as I was saying earlier, all you need to do is specialize in doing one thing, the thing that you do best, and then you exchange that for money."}, {"time": 499, "text": "And you don't have to worry about whether the other people involved in this want what you have and have what you want."}, {"time": 506, "text": "You just sell it for money to whoever wants it."}, {"time": 510, "text": "And you buy whatever you want from whoever has it."}, {"time": 512, "text": "And that's an enormous reduction in the mental burden of how a market economy functions."}, {"time": 519, "text": "So the first thing that I would say about money is that it allows for the division of labor and it allows for the market system to grow."}, {"time": 525, "text": "And the second thing is that money is a mechanism for storing value into the future."}, {"time": 530, "text": "So again, as humans, we develop the capacity to think for the future."}, {"time": 535, "text": "We make a spear so that we can hunt, and then we see that it works."}, {"time": 540, "text": "And then we take it out of the animal that we hunted it with, and we keep it for the next day's hunt."}, {"time": 545, "text": "And then we start making a better spear, and we make a better fishing rod, and then we make a fishing net, and then we make a fishing boat."}, {"time": 551, "text": "And that's our ability to think of the future."}, {"time": 555, "text": "And as we start building durable goods, we start thinking more and more of the future."}, {"time": 559, "text": "We start becoming more and more future oriented."}, {"time": 562, "text": "And that's really the process of civilization, the process of denying our needs now in order to think for the future."}, {"time": 571, "text": "So instead of spending all of our day on the beach, enjoying ourselves, we take time off from leisure on the beach and spend some time making a spear or making a fishing rod so that our productivity in hunting or fishing tomorrow is gonna be higher."}, {"time": 588, "text": "And so that ability to think for the future is enhanced by our ability to provide for the future."}, {"time": 594, "text": "And we do that with durable goods."}, {"time": 596, "text": "But then money ends up being the best mechanism for providing for the future, because the future is uncertain."}, {"time": 604, "text": "So you can save your apples and oranges."}, {"time": 607, "text": "You can save the spears."}, {"time": 609, "text": "You can save the animal that you hunted."}, {"time": 612, "text": "But these things, first they rot."}, {"time": 615, "text": "They're not very good at holding onto their value over time."}, {"time": 617, "text": "But even if they were, even if you have objects that are durable, the problem with them is that you don't know if you need them tomorrow or next month or next year."}, {"time": 628, "text": "You're not sure if you're going to be needing them."}, {"time": 630, "text": "And you might end up not needing them."}, {"time": 631, "text": "And you might end up not finding anybody who needs them or finding somebody who needs them, but doesn't value them much and won't give you much in exchange."}, {"time": 638, "text": "Money allows you the optionality of saving the most liquid good, the most saleable good."}, {"time": 643, "text": "So it's something that you can sell tomorrow with the least uncertainty."}, {"time": 647, "text": "It has the most liquidity, the most ability to be sold without a loss in its value."}, {"time": 652, "text": "So money is our most advanced technology and our best technology for moving value into the future."}, {"time": 658, "text": "And so I think history really, I argue this in all my books, is that really history we see, we can think of it as a process of our money gets harder."}, {"time": 670, "text": "And so our money gets better at holding onto its value for the future."}, {"time": 676, "text": "And by harder, I mean harder to produce."}, {"time": 678, "text": "We find things that are hard to produce that are better at holding onto their value."}, {"time": 683, "text": "So they hold onto their value better for the future."}, {"time": 685, "text": "And that allows us to plot and plan for the future."}, {"time": 688, "text": "That makes the future less uncertain."}, {"time": 691, "text": "And that makes us more future oriented."}, {"time": 693, "text": "In other words, it lowers our time preference."}, {"time": 696, "text": "And the harder the money is, the better it is at allowing us to think of the future."}, {"time": 701, "text": "So people should know that you've written the book Bitcoin Standard from 2018, I believe."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And then a new book called Fiat Standard."}, {"time": 712, "text": "The Bitcoin Standard is considered kind of the Bible in the cryptocurrency space, in the Bitcoin space of just a very rigorous systematic explanation of why Bitcoin, what is it, why should it be, why is it good?"}, {"time": 727, "text": "So you're describing in that book and in the new book, different implementations of the technology of money."}, {"time": 734, "text": "In the new book, you talk about fiat money, which is another way to do money."}, {"time": 739, "text": "So obviously, there's a lot of different ways to do money."}, {"time": 742, "text": "And maybe you haven't discovered the best way to do money, yet our conversation today is how to do money better."}, {"time": 749, "text": "Maybe we'll go back to bananas eventually, right?"}, {"time": 753, "text": "Very good reasons why we won't."}, {"time": 755, "text": "Well, we can disagree."}, {"time": 757, "text": "We can agree to disagree on this."}, {"time": 759, "text": "I'm open minded to the bananas."}, {"time": 762, "text": "One of the biggest source of joy to me when I first came to this country is eating bananas."}, {"time": 768, "text": "And so maybe money, happiness, perishable happiness will eventually become the best medium of exchange."}, {"time": 778, "text": "I don't know, open minded."}, {"time": 780, "text": "Anyway, so you mentioned hard money and soft money."}, {"time": 783, "text": "So there's different ways to do money."}, {"time": 785, "text": "What is hard money?"}, {"time": 786, "text": "What is soft money?"}, {"time": 788, "text": "In the Bitcoin standard, I present the argument that money is always whatever is the hardest thing to make."}, {"time": 794, "text": "Historically, I think we see many examples of that."}, {"time": 797, "text": "So for instance, in prison, people use cigarettes as money because nobody can make cigarettes in prison."}, {"time": 802, "text": "In societies, we have the example of Yap Island, for instance, it's an island that doesn't have any limestone but there's a nearby island that has a lot of limestone."}, {"time": 811, "text": "And it's very expensive obviously with primitive technology to move limestone from Palau to Yap."}, {"time": 818, "text": "So on Yap, limestones were money."}, {"time": 821, "text": "Seashells, rare seashells that are not easy to find end up serving as money in places where they're rare."}, {"time": 828, "text": "Glass beads were money in West Africa where there was no glass making technology because they were imported from abroad and they were very hard to make."}, {"time": 837, "text": "And I think there's a conscious effort of some people might recognize the hardness and the scarcity and choose this as money."}, {"time": 844, "text": "But I think what's more important is just a natural evolutionary process whereby people choose all kinds of random things as money, bananas maybe even."}, {"time": 854, "text": "But then the people who end up making these bad choices don't end up with any wealth left."}, {"time": 858, "text": "Whereas the people who store their wealth in the things that are hard to make end up maintaining their wealth and maybe even increasing it over time."}, {"time": 869, "text": "And of course this culminated in the 19th century, in the end of the 19th century by basically the entire planet being on a gold standard."}, {"time": 876, "text": "And that's... What is a gold standard?"}, {"time": 878, "text": "The gold standard is basically when money is gold or at least government currencies backed by gold."}, {"time": 884, "text": "But the reason gold became money and not copper, not nickel, not bananas is that gold is the hardest metal in the world."}, {"time": 892, "text": "And it is the hardest metal to increase the supply of."}, {"time": 895, "text": "And the reason for that is based in chemistry."}, {"time": 898, "text": "So gold is indestructible."}, {"time": 901, "text": "You can't destroy gold in any meaningful sense."}, {"time": 903, "text": "It's been accumulating stockpiles for thousands of years."}, {"time": 908, "text": "The gold that was worn by Nefertiti back in ancient Egypt is today probably in somebody's necklace or in somebody's gold coin."}, {"time": 917, "text": "So for thousands of years, humans have been digging for gold."}, {"time": 921, "text": "They dig it out of the ground, they refine it and then they put it in a jewelry or a coin and then it just stays there."}, {"time": 927, "text": "It gets melted down into new other forms."}, {"time": 929, "text": "The jewelry gets turned into coins or coins get turned into bars."}, {"time": 934, "text": "But it's just stockpiles that are accumulating."}, {"time": 938, "text": "On the other hand, every year we get better at our technology of looking for gold."}, {"time": 943, "text": "There's more people all over the world."}, {"time": 945, "text": "The population increases, the technology improves."}, {"time": 947, "text": "So we keep finding more and more gold and we keep making the stockpiles bigger."}, {"time": 952, "text": "However, because we're constantly adding to a stockpile that is not being devalued, sorry, that is not being consumed because there's no way of consuming gold."}, {"time": 960, "text": "You can't eat it, you can't burn it, it doesn't rust."}, {"time": 965, "text": "Because of that, we're constantly adding to a constantly growing stockpile."}, {"time": 968, "text": "So if you look at the numbers, you see over the last 100 years, we've got pretty reliable data on gold production worldwide."}, {"time": 976, "text": "We see that pretty much gold stockpiles increase at around one and a half to 2% per year, every year."}, {"time": 982, "text": "So yes, we're making more every year, but we're making more so we're adding to the stockpile."}, {"time": 988, "text": "The stockpile grows more."}, {"time": 989, "text": "So every year we're adding only around one and a half to 2%."}, {"time": 993, "text": "Compare that to the second highest, the second hardest metal historically was silver."}, {"time": 999, "text": "And that increased historically at around maybe 5% per year or so."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "Now it probably increases at something like closer to 30% because it's now getting used extensively in industrial uses."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So when you use it in industry, when you put silver in a laptop or in a camera or in a machine, effectively, you are consuming the stockpile because it's not used as money."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "It's taken out of the monetary stockpile."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "So over the last 150 years, since 1870 in particular, and I discussed this in detail in the Bitcoin standard, what happened in 1870 was Germany won the Franco Prussian war and Germany was on a silver standard, but the value of silvers was declining."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "So Germany did something very smart, which is they took their indemnity from France in silver and gold and use that big chunk of gold to switch to going on a gold standard."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "And since then, silver has been collapsing in value next to gold."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "So back then the price of an ounce of gold was around 15 ounces of silver."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Today it's closer to 100."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "It's just been declining for the last 150 years."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And so because of that, because of the fact that it's lost its monetary role as people shifted toward gold, the value of silver went down and so it became economical to use it in more and more industrial applications."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "So the stockpile declines and then as a result that weakens its monetary properties more and more and more."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "So that's why by the end of the 19th century, I mean at the beginning of the 19th century, gold and silver were money."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "By the end, it was basically only gold."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "And the countries that were still on a silver standard, China and India in particular suffered enormously from it because their money was devaluing very quickly next to gold and so Europeans who would come to China or India were able to buy things at practically a big discount."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "So I hope it's okay if I ask very simple, very basic questions."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "There's few people in this world that are good, as good as you are at answering very basic, almost ridiculously basic questions because I think exploring questions like what is money is a really great way to think from first principles, to really think deeply about this world."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "So I really appreciate you doing that."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "When you say standard, what does it mean?"}, {"time": 1135, "text": "When you say silver standard, gold standard, again with a basic question."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "The term really I think was based out of gold."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "The first time this came out was the gold standard because so I said gold was money at the end of the 19th century, but it wasn't just that everybody was using gold coins and trading with gold coins because that's got a problem of divisibility."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "So a lot of things are worth less than one gold coin."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "So how do you buy that thing?"}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And the answer was that you created the monetary instruments that were backed by gold and so currencies, national currencies under the gold standard were specific units of gold and that's how a gold standard functioned."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Money was gold, but you had pieces of paper that were redeemable in gold."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "So you could go to the central bank, you'd give them the piece of paper, the $100 bill or the $10 bill and they'll give you gold in exchange and they give you a specific quantity of gold in exchange."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Effectively, the paper was just a receipt for gold."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So the paper exactly represented the amount of gold."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "Exactly, that was the plan."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "That was what it's supposed to do, but arguably we never had a pure gold standard because the nature of gold means that the people who are in charge of the gold, they have an enormous amount of power because the gold is concentrated with them and as long as not everybody shows up at the same time asking for their gold, then you can make more receipts than you have gold."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "So there's always shady stuff going on, but at least that's the state of gold is the receipts should exactly represent the amount of gold there."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "And also when you say standard, it means that governments sort of publicly stated that this is the approved, the main way of making transactions that are monetary."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "So this is the money, this is the official money that you should be using if you live in this country."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "Yes, although I would say it's more like the other way around."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "It's not that the governments established gold as money."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "It's more like gold gave the governments the credibility for their currencies."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So governments were not the ones that made gold money."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "Gold has been money before states were invented."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "States, if you have a government and you'd like to have some legitimacy and you'd like to be able to deal with other governments on an equal footing, you had to go by the gold standard."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "You had to have a currency that was redeemable in gold so that you could trade with the rest of the world so that people could in your country use that currency."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "So it's not that governments were choosing gold."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "It's more like they were having to adapt their own currencies to gold in order to give their currencies credibility."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "So there's a dance there though, because if they had to, then why did they switch away from it after?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "So there is a dance where the governments, the people pressure."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "So first of all, the basic characteristics of the hard money pressures the governments and the people in terms of what should be used."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "Then the people, based on their community, the network effects, the narratives they tell each other, all that kind of stuff, they pressure the governments to take on a particular money."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "Then the governments, they like power, they like control, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "They pressure the people and tell different kinds of narratives."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "So there's a dance going on in this evolution of what technology to use for a monetary system."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "So the reason I don't know if governments had to, because they clearly didn't have to, because they eventually moved away from it."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "But there was pressure probably."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "Yeah, but even after they moved away from it, central banks, until today, they still hold a lot of gold reserves."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "In fact, if you look at 1914, when the world really went off the gold standard, the amount of gold reserves held by central banks was a tiny fraction of what it was."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "As time went on, central banks accumulated more and more gold."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "What ended up happening is they prevented their citizens from using the gold, but they continued to use it."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So gold continued to be money up until 1971 because effectively the world was on a dollar standard and the dollars were backed by gold."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "But then after 1971, even then, central banks continued to accumulate gold because why would you as a central bank want to accumulate pieces of paper effectively or credit liabilities of another central bank that can produce them infinitely?"}, {"time": 1407, "text": "And it's a lesson that's becoming more and more obvious to governments today, as we see US sanctions taking, say, Russian reserves or Afghanistan reserves."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And this is why we see China and Russia have accumulated a lot of gold over the last 10, 20 years."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "So just to return to the question of definitions, so what is hard money versus soft money?"}, {"time": 1431, "text": "Yes, so hard, I mean, it's a relative thing, but the hardness refers to the difficulty of producing more units of the money supply."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "So an easy money would be a money that is relatively easy to make."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "So you can increase the supply by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50% or something like that."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "So pretty much all commodities, all market commodities, other than gold and silver, they're easy money and they're not suitable as a monetary medium because they're being consumed."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "So if you look at, and in the Bitcoin standard, I mentioned this metric called the stock to flow ratio, which is the ratio of the annual production, the flow, to the stockpile, the existing stockpile."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "If you look at all the other metals, they're easy money because they're being consumed."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "So think about how much stockpiles of copper there are in the world today."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "So copper companies obviously have some stockpiles of copper."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Major copper consumers will have stockpiles of copper, but the vast majority of copper is essentially on a conveyor belt of production from the mine straight to the consumer good that it's being used for."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "So the existing stockpiles are roughly in the range of one year's production."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "If you take all of the companies, I don't have exact statistics, hence it's very difficult to get these, but it's roughly in the same range."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "Like if copper production were to stop completely today, we'll have about a year's production stored in various places."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "So that makes copper terrible money because if you started using copper as money, and this is why a lot of people say, well, money is a collective illusion."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Money is a social construct."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "If we all agree that something is money, then something is money."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "I think this is completely clueless, and it's usually Marxists who believe this, obviously no understanding of economics."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "It's completely clueless because even if everybody in society decided we wanted to make copper as money, even if we all decided to collectively take part in this hallucination or illusion, it would not make copper money."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "It would just make everybody who decides to take part in this hallucination poor, that's it."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "It would make copper miners rich."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "It would make all of the people who chose copper as money poor, and copper would not be money."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "Price of copper is gonna go up a lot, but what's gonna stop copper miners from flooding the market with even more copper than what the billionaires

be the credit and because it gets centralized it can easily be captured by the government."}, {"time": 6483, "text": "So to be fair, the benefits of the fiat system is that it saves us on the cost of

transactions?"}, {"time": 6543, "text": "Yeah, arguably it does help in that regard."}, {"time": 6546, "text": "However, it isn't as if you couldn't have fast transactions built on top of gold."},

you define settlement just for people who are outside of this world?"}, {"time": 6565, "text": "Because we'll mention that word quite a bit probably."}, {"time": 6568, "text": "So the way that it works is, let's say right now I'm gonna pay you $10 over PayPal or credit card."}, {"time": 6575, "text": "So it shows up in your PayPal or credit card within a few seconds that I've sent you the money and then that's yours."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "But it didn't also happen in those 10 seconds that my bank, which could be in another country, sent the money to your bank into your account."},

bank."}, {"time": 6601, "text": "And when the message is communicated from my app to yours, my bank crosses out the money and your bank credits you with the money."}, {"time": 6610, "text": "And then at the end of the day, week or month, banks in the same city will settle with one another, banks in the same country will settle with one another and banks from different countries will settle with one another."}, {"time": 6622, "text": "So they won't move the $10 from my account to yours."}, {"time": 6627, "text": "At the end of the day or week or month, they'll tally all of the money that was sent from one bank to the other and then just settle the difference."}, {"time": 6635, "text": "So it turns out at the end of the month, my bank had sent $15 million to your bank and your bank had sent $14 million to my bank."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "So they give them $1 million and that settles it, that finalizes the transaction."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "So final settlement 3D is like the, you can think about it as the infrastructure of the system."}, {"time": 6654, "text": "And then you can think of these things as being the higher layer levels."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "And you had a wonderful discussion about that with Michael Saylor."}, {"time": 6662, "text": "So the final settlement is like the moment when you paper and ideas connect to physical reality."}, {"time": 6671, "text": "Or to some representation of physical reality."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "Yeah, and under gold, everything was tethered to physical reality because there was a market commodity at the bottom of all of this and nobody could print that market commodity."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "And so at the end of the month, if your bank made too many payments, if you made too many payments, there was a reckoning."}, {"time": 6689, "text": "If you were reckless, if you were insolvent, you went out of business."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "So there was no way to fool that."}, {"time": 6697, "text": "But then we moved to the fiat century and everything is credit."}, {"time": 6701, "text": "At the end of the day, the final layer is government credit."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "And so as long as you're friends with the government, basically you never go bankrupt."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "So all kinds of hucksters managed to find their way into getting into position where they don't get bankrupt."}, {"time": 6718, "text": "So in part two of the fiat standard called Fiat Life, you describe the effects of fiat money on a bunch of things like life, food, science, education."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "What is the most pernicious effect of fiat money on our world, on our life?"}, {"time": 6735, "text": "So taking a step outside of the monetary system, actually like how that affects our life from this book?"}, {"time": 6741, "text": "I mean, there's a whole bunch of things and I won't be able to go over them and I highly recommend reading the book."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "But if I were to pick one, I would say it's the impact that it has on our time preference, on our valuation of the future."}, {"time": 6753, "text": "So remember when we started the discussion, I said that the key function of money is that it serves as a store of value."}, {"time": 6761, "text": "And the harder the money is, the better it is at providing us with a way for providing for our future."}, {"time": 6768, "text": "And so the harder the money is, the less we discount the future."}, {"time": 6771, "text": "We always discount the future compared to the present."}, {"time": 6773,

next 10 years."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "So we always prefer the present to the future."}, {"time": 6786, "text": "There's always a discount on the future."}, {"time": 6789, "text": "And that discount is called time preference."}, {"time": 6790, "text": "The degree to which we prefer the present to the future is called our time preference."}, {"time": 6795, "text": "So the higher our time preference, the less we care about the future."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "And the process of civilization is the process of lowering our time preference, where we start caring more for the future, we start prioritizing the present less and less."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "So we start being able to not consume everything that we have and store it."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "And so money is essential for that."}, {"time": 6816, "text": "And under the gold standard, everyone in the world had the ability to provide for their future by simply using the same money that they use."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "You would work a day and you would get paid in a gold coin and you could take that gold coin and keep it safe for 10 years and know that at the end of those 10 years, that gold coin would buy you slightly more than what it bought you the day that you earned it."}, {"time": 6839, "text": "So anybody could provide for their future and anybody could have very high degree of certainty that whatever they're saving is going to be there when they want it in the future."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "Because the money supply was only increasing at one and a half percent, whereas the production of goods and services was increasing for most cases, for most periods at a higher rate than that."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "So you could buy more apples and oranges and houses and cars at the end of the 10 years than you could at the beginning of the 10 years."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "So everybody had a way of providing for the future."}, {"time": 6871, "text": "And with that, people lower their time preference."}, {"time": 6874, "text": "And that is reflected across all aspects of life."}, {"time": 6878, "text": "I think it's not just the economic thing."}, {"time": 6880, "text": "You see it in the savings rate, the ability to deny yourself gratification today."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "I could take the money that I have and throw a giant party, buy a sports car, buy a yacht."}, {"time": 6890, "text": "And yet you decided, I'm not going to do that."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "I'm going to keep it so that tomorrow I can throw a bigger party or buy a better yacht or have a better life or give my children a better life."}, {"time": 6901, "text": "So all of human civilization really is the process of us lowering our time preference and finding harder monies that

borrowers in the world."}, {"time": 7914, "text": "And that's how they are the richest and the most powerful, because every time you're borrowing, you're giving the bank an excuse to print new

"text": "What is SWIFT?"}, {"time": 8167, "text": "What are the possible future evolutions of the global monetary system?"}, {"time": 8171, "text": "Yeah, so SWIFT is the network that the US Federal Reserve uses for moving money around the world."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "So basically the US government can sanction you off of SWIFT as they've done with Russian banks, as they've done with Iran, and as they've done with Afghanistan."}, {"time": 8187, "text": "So effectively, I mean, this is really the catastrophe of the current monetary system is that in order to be able to trade as a member, as a citizen of your country, you need your monopoly local central bank to be on good terms with the US government so that they would let them operate."}, {"time": 8204, "text": "And this is really like on top of the aspect of the hardness of money, this is the other really powerful thing about Bitcoin, which is that it's just purely a technological thing."}, {"time": 8214, "text": "It doesn't matter if you're Russian, if you're Iranian, if you're American, if you're Chinese, it's a technology."}, {"time": 8220, "text": "And so it's like a spoon or a knife or a car, you operate it properly and it works."}, {"time": 8226, "text": "And so with Bitcoin, it's the same thing."}, {"time": 8227, "text": "It doesn't care about your passport."}, {"time": 8229, "text": "If you have the private key, you click send and the money goes, well, it doesn't really go, but effectively it does go anywhere at once and the money can move without having to abide by political situations."}, {"time": 8242, "text": "And the point here is not to bash US foreign policy much as that might be deserved."}, {"time": 8247, "text": "I'm just going to discuss it from a kind of technical perspective."}, {"time": 8251, "text": "It has to be a political system with fiat because ultimately it relies on credit."}, {"time": 8255, "text": "And then the government is the one that has the guns and the government is going to decide who gets to pay their loans anyway."}, {"time": 8260, "text": "And the government's going to have to make its own rules about who gets to play and who doesn't."}, {"time": 8267, "text": "And so it has to be political as this kind of fiat system."}, {"time": 8272, "text": "And when I wrote the Bitcoin standard, initially I used to be much more of a gold bug."}, {"time": 8278, "text": "And in my mind, gold bugs have spent the last 50 years saying the global monetary system is going to collapse next week and we're going to go back to a gold standard."}, {"time": 8287, "text": "And writing the fiat standard gave me a very good appreciation for why this hasn't happened and why it's not very likely to happen."}, {"time": 8295, "text": "I think the reason is, as I said earlier, just gold is very expensive to move around and perhaps more importantly, it's very expensive to verify."}, {"time": 8304, "text": "That's really the problem with it."}, {"time": 8305, "text": "It's very expensive to verify that the gold that you're receiving is original gold."}, {"time": 8309, "text": "So the only way to do this properly is to melt the gold bars down and recast them, which is pretty expensive."}, {"time": 8317, "text": "So we have this situation now where Russia, which is one of the biggest economies in the world has been kicked off to varying degrees off the global monetary system and the US has confiscated their reserves."}, {"time": 8329, "text": "And I don't have political opinions about the war."}, {"time": 8332, "text": "It's not something I'm very familiar with."}, {"time": 8334, "text": "It's outside of my area of expertise."}, {"time": 8336, "text": "I'm just analyzing the monetary aspects of it."}, {"time": 8338, "text": "It is, on the one hand, whether you think the war is justified or the sanctions are justified is not something I can opine on."}, {"time": 8348, "text": "But the implication of this is that effectively the US might be shooting itself in the foot because it's telling everybody in the world, your money in our system is not really your money."}, {"time": 8358, "text": "It's just a token to play in our arcade."}, {"time": 8362, "text": "And any point in time, if you misbehave, we kick you out of the arcade and we take your tokens."}, {"time": 8367, "text": "And so, I mean, this is something that China, Russia, Iran and many countries have made a lot of noise about over the past decades."}, {"time": 8375, "text": "It got real this year, but it's been decades of China, Iran and Russia to some extent saying that, you know, we wanna build an alternative to the US dollar based system."}, {"time": 8388, "text": "And yet they haven't."}, {"time": 8390, "text": "And I think there's very good reasons they haven't."}, {"time": 8391, "text": "And the reason is, what do you do based on?"}, {"time": 8394, "text": "How do you build it?"}, {"time": 8395, "text": "So you can do a credit based system based on, but then who's gonna be the big boss?"}, {"time": 8400, "text": "Is it gonna be China?"}, {"time": 8401, "text": "Is it gonna be Russia?"}, {"time": 8402, "text": "Is it gonna be Iran?"}, {"time": 8403, "text": "Is it gonna be India?"}, {"time": 8404, "text": "None of these countries wants to be, you know, they don't wanna jump out of the US based system to get into somebody else's based system."}, {"time": 8412, "text": "So China doesn't wanna use a Russian system."}, {"time": 8414, "text": "Russia doesn't wanna use a Chinese system."}, {"time": 8416, "text": "And so therefore you can't use their own central bank's currencies."}, {"time": 8419, "text": "Don't you think they have enough leverage, India, China, Russia combined with several other nations have enough leverage and incentive to create their own system?"}, {"time": 8432, "text": "So any one player, yes, but if they collaborate."}, {"time": 8435, "text": "Yeah, but then, okay, so what are you based on?"}, {"time": 8437, "text": "Like who's going to be the boss?"}, {"time": 8439, "text": "Who's going to be the one who can?"}, {"time": 8440, "text": "In this case, China, right?"}, {"time": 8444, "text": "Because China's becoming increasingly an economic power in the world."}, {"time": 8448, "text": "That's hard to deny."}, {"time": 8449, "text": "Yes, it's true."}, {"time": 8450, "text": "And it's the most likely scenario perhaps if we were to witness something like this is going to be a Chinese based system."}, {"time": 8457, "text": "So is it possible to have like a split in what is the driving currency of the world?"}, {"time": 8464, "text": "It's possible, but I don't think it's sustainable."}, {"time": 8466, "text": "Again, money wants to be won."}, {"time": 8468, "text": "And that's the kind of thing that I argue in that seminar."}, {"time": 8470, "text": "So we could see this emerge based around the Yuan and likely, I mean, Russia is obviously going to hurt economically from what happened from the confiscation of the reserves and from the sanctions."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "So it's not going to be in a position."}, {"time": 8484, "text": "And of course, because it's outside of the US based system, it's not in the strongest negotiating position with the Chinese."}, {"time": 8490, "text": "So the Chinese might be able to get them to join their Yuan based system."}, {"time": 8494, "text": "But I don't think that's sustainable in the long run because these governments can issue their laws and make their designs and then make their monetary systems."}, {"time": 8505, "text": "But ultimately, there are billions of Chinese people and billions of dollar based people and they're going to want to trade with one another."}, {"time": 8513, "text": "And the power to want to trade with one another is too strong."}, {"time": 8516, "text": "We can't just split the world economy into two monetary systems that don't trade with one another."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "So then they're going to want to trade with one another."}, {"time": 8522, "text": "Or the dark possibility is the inability to trade as opposed to being a forcing function for trade."}, {"time": 8534, "text": "It will become a forcing function for conflict in cyberspace and potentially hot war."}, {"time": 8540, "text": "Yes, this is the scary part of it."}, {"time": 8542, "text": "And this is basically how World War II happened because there's an old historian who used to say when I think his name is Otto Mallory and I quote him in the Bitcoin standard,

fight."}, {"time": 8562, "text": "And it was the death of global trade in the 1930s because of the failure of the fiat system that brought about the rise of the populism and the rise of all those leaders that hated each other and helped finance the war and bring it about."}, {"time": 8576, "text": "So that is the scary possibility."}, {"time": 8579, "text": "And of course, you can't discount that with all of the escalation that you see, that is a possibility that it could turn into a real war."}, {"time": 8585, "text": "But then even so, I think ultimately, you can't fight wars forever."}, {"time": 8592, "text": "It's going to end at some point."}, {"time": 8593, "text": "And we're going to be back at square one or well, not square one."}, {"time": 8596, "text": "We're going to be back at the same dilemma of who's going to have the global monetary system."}, {"time": 8601, "text": "And so one alternative is that what the Chinese and the Russians could do is they could base it on a commodity."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "So a lot of people are now saying, well, they're going to base it on copper and corn and agricultural commodities."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "And that's the analysis of saleability that we discuss in the Bitcoin standard and the fiat standard."}, {"time": 8620, "text": "I don't think that's workable."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "If you end up basing the monetary system on copper, as we said earlier, it doesn't matter how many governments say that we're going to make a new monetary system based on copper grains and nickel and iron and so on."}, {"time": 8637, "text": "You're going to have to stockpile those things in order to make a market in them."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "And then if you stockpile those things, you're just raising their value, inviting the producers to make more, flood the market."}, {"time": 8648, "text": "I hope they don't try this because it's going to be a devastating, devastating impact on the world economy."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "You're going to have central banks bidding up the price of essential commodities that people need for real uses in order to back their currencies with them, and then just incentivizing the producers to make more and more and more of it, and then bringing the price back down."}, {"time": 8668, "text": "So it's going to be a very expensive mistake where we raise the price of copper, destroy a lot of industries dependent on copper, and it's not just copper, but also food, and then increase the supply beyond what we need."}, {"time": 8678, "text": "And the end result is copper miners make out well, governments go broke, and we end up with a lot of rust in copper in government warehouses."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "That's why I don't think it works to use commodities that are not monetary commodities."}, {"time": 8696, "text": "Then the question is maybe gold."}, {"time": 8698, "text": "Can we go back on another gold standard?"}, {"time": 8700, "text": "And I mean, Russia seems to have done that."}, {"time": 8705, "text": "It's very difficult to get reliable information."}, {"time": 8707, "text": "I'm trying to look into this more, but they seem to have said that they're fixing the price of gold in rubles."}, {"time": 8715, "text": "So they will buy and sell gold at a fixed ruble rate, which effectively means you're on a gold standard."}, {"time": 8720, "text": "Now, I'm not sure how much, how serious this is, how they've managed to stick to it, but it seems to have stabilized the ruble and in fact brought it back to its pre war level, which I found absolutely astonishing, considering all the sanctions going on."}, {"time": 8735, "text": "But in the short run, it's obviously much better than having your currency pegged to nothing."}, {"time": 8741, "text": "But in the long run, I also don't think gold is gonna cut it in the 21st century."}, {"time": 8746, "text": "Do you think there's any chance they go full gangster move and go into the digital space on the blockchain and go with Bitcoin?"}, {"time": 8756, "text": "I think the point of this discussion is that, we run through all these other options, a Chinese based system, why it probably won't work, a commodity based system, why it won't work, and a gold based system, why it won't work."}, {"time": 8768, "text": "I think they might have to learn this the wrong way."}, {"time": 8772, "text": "I mean, the hard way."}, {"time": 8773, "text": "But eventually, I don't see them doing it now, but eventually I think the winning move is going to be to go on a Bitcoin based monetary system."}, {"time": 8781, "text": "Well, I don't know if everything always has to be the hard way."}, {"time": 8785, "text": "I'd love it not to be, but I mean, it doesn't look like there is any kind of desire in China or in Russia to switch to a Bitcoin based system."}, {"time": 8794, "text": "To take a leap to Bitcoin."}, {"time": 8796, "text": "So unfortunately, I think we're gonna go through a few years, maybe many years of learning the lesson the hard way, of trying to accumulate these commodities and seeing the limitations that make them unsuitable as money today."}, {"time": 8810, "text": "One of the things I'm really concerned about is the tension, the amount, the increasing amount of hate in the world."}, {"time": 8818, "text": "And the increasing amount of power centers in the world between which hate is making a regular appearance."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "And because the weapons of war are becoming more and more powerful as they have been in the past many decades, I'm really concerned about nuclear war."}, {"time": 8842, "text": "So let us see if Bitcoin can fix this."}, {"time": 8845, "text": "Yes, Bitcoin fixes all of this."}, {"time": 8847, "text": "The first rule of Bitcoin is if it's a problem, Bitcoin fixes it."}, {"time": 8852, "text": "All right, well I have some personal questions for Bitcoin then, because I have some, my life is pretty fucked up, so I'll have to try to see."}, {"time": 8860, "text": "A quick pause for bathroom breaking, any?"}, {"time": 8866, "text": "We started with what is money, what is Bitcoin?"}, {"time": 8869, "text": "We talked about hard money, inflation, fiat, the history of money, the history of war in the 20th century, and that takes us into the 21st century."}, {"time": 8882, "text": "Bitcoin is a software, and it's a distributed software to operate peer to peer network between members who are all equal on the network, they're all peers."}, {"time": 8891, "text": "And what this software does is that it allows you to operate a payment network between those peers, and that payment network has its own currency."}, {"time": 8902, "text": "And that seems like just a simple software game, but the reason this is such a big deal is, I believe Bitcoin is the most advanced form of money ever invented."}, {"time": 8912, "text": "And the reason for that comes from two properties that this network has."}, {"time": 8916, "text": "The first one is that the currency is the hardest money ever invented."}, {"time": 8921, "text": "It's the money whose supply is the most resistant to inflation."}, {"time": 8925, "text": "It's the first monetary asset that we've ever invented that is guaranteed to be fixed in its supply, that cannot be increased beyond a certain number."}, {"time": 8934, "text": "So there's only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoins."}, {"time": 8936, "text": "And that's a qualitative leap forward in our technologies of money."}, {"time": 8942, "text": "All of our monies leak, essentially, because people can always make more and more and more of them."}, {"time": 8948, "text": "You know, the best money is the one that leaks the least, which is gold, because it only leaks one and a half percent."}, {"time": 8953, "text": "In other words, your share of the gold stock is diluted by one and a half percent every year."}, {"time": 8961, "text": "Ideally, you'd like it to be zero."}, {"time": 8963, "text": "Bitcoin is currently at around 1.8% headed towards zero."}, {"time": 8967, "text": "So it's the first money that we've ever had that goes to zero in terms of terminal supply."}, {"time": 8971, "text": "So there'll never be more than 21 million Bitcoin."}, {"time": 8974, "text": "I think that's a huge deal because, you know, as I said earlier, money is always whatever is the hardest to make, and now Bitcoin is the hardest thing to make."}, {"time": 8983, "text": "And then the second property, which is extremely important as well, is the fact that it operates without the need to trust in anybody."}, {"time": 8991, "text": "It doesn't have a party that is in charge of it."}, {"time": 8994, "text": "It doesn't have a central authority that can, you know, as I said, it's peer to peer."}, {"time": 8998, "text": "So it only has users."}, {"time": 9000, "text": "It doesn't have any admins."}, {"time": 9002, "text": "There's no authority in charge of Bitcoin that can take your Bitcoin, that can stop you from using Bitcoin, that can change the rules of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 9009, "text": "They can't make more of it."}, {"time": 9011, "text": "So it's fixed."}, {"time": 9012, "text": "It's available for anybody in the world."}, {"time": 9015, "text": "It's the hardest money ever invented."}, {"time": 9017, "text": "And it is absolutely, I think, an enormously, enormously significant invention because if you read the fiat standard and the Bitcoin standard as well, you'll see my perspective for why I think a very large number of problems in the world are caused by easy money, are caused by inflation, and caused by government having access to essentially an infinite recourse to people's wealth."}, {"time": 9045, "text": "And I think Bitcoin fixes this because it allows us to have money that has the salability of gold across time, meaning it holds its value across time like gold, but much better than gold."}, {"time": 9058, "text": "But also it is similar to fiat in that fiat can travel quickly, but Bitcoin can travel even faster than fiat."}, {"time": 9066, "text": "So it combines gold's salability across time with fiat's salability across space in one immutable package that nobody can change and nobody can control."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "Can you define the word salability?"}, {"time": 9080, "text": "Salability is the essential property of money."}, {"time": 9082, "text": "It's the ability of a good to be sold easily on the market, specifically to be sold without much loss in its value."}, {"time": 9091, "text": "So houses are great for living in, but they're not very salable."}, {"time": 9095, "text": "If you wanna sell a house, you can just click a button and sell a house and have a giant market of people buying houses from you."}, {"time": 9101, "text": "You need to find somebody who wants the exact house that you have with the exact specifications that you have."}, {"time": 9108, "text": "And because houses are not identical, there's no liquid giant market for people to just buy and sell identical houses from."}, {"time": 9116, "text": "So gold, for instance, has good salability as money because it's a liquid good, it's uniform, and people are always buying it."}, {"time": 9126, "text": "Fiat dollars have great salability because everybody's always buying and exchanging dollars for other goods."}, {"time": 9131, "text": "So if you have $100 bill, you can easily get rid of it and you'll get $100 worth of stuff for it."}, {"time": 9138, "text": "If you have $100 worth of stuff, it's harder to get rid of it."}, {"time": 9142, "text": "If you have $100 worth of phone, it's not as easy to spend it as a $100 bill."}, {"time": 9146, "text": "That's salability."}, {"time": 9148, "text": "What do you mean that Bitcoin, I understand that Bitcoin has the salability of gold across time."}, {"time": 9155, "text": "Better even, yeah."}, {"time": 9156, "text": "Better, yes, like on the order or whatever."}, {"time": 9159, "text": "And then it has the salability of fiat across space."}, {"time": 9163, "text": "So if you remember when you asked me what is the advantage of fiat, what is the advantage it offers us, it's cheaper to move fiat across space than it is to move gold."}, {"time": 9172, "text": "With the current fiat monetary system, for all of its flaws, you can send money, I could send money from my bank account in the US to a bank account in China in a couple of days, or in Britain, in France, in a day or two, which is much faster than you could do with gold and much cheaper than you could do with gold."}, {"time": 9193, "text": "But in reality, with fiat, the reason Bitcoin improves on that is that with Bitcoin, you're actually selling, you're sending final settlement in a couple of hours."}, {"time": 9203, "text": "So you send the Bitcoin transaction, you get six confirmations in an hour, you get about 12 confirmations in two hours on average."}, {"time": 9209, "text": "With 12 confirmations, you're pretty definitely clearly safe on this."}, {"time": 9216, "text": "So within a couple of hours, you could send a billion dollars across the ocean and have final settlement on them."}, {"time": 9224, "text": "It's not just that you've sent a credit obligation that's gonna need weeks and months to settle, which is the case with fiat."}, {"time": 9231, "text": "So it is faster than fiat, effectively."}, {"time": 9234, "text": "So it's harder than gold and faster than fiat."}, {"time": 9236, "text": "That's a good way of putting it."}, {"time": 9240, "text": "One other aspect of Bitcoin I have to ask, to me on a human level, it's fascinating, is it was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous founder, there's no leader."}, {"time": 9252, "text": "So that's another aspect of the decentralization is leaderless."}, {"time": 9257, "text": "So unfortunately, it's not a monarchy."}, {"time": 9260, "text": "Or fortunately, yes."}, {"time": 9262, "text": "Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, do you think?"}, {"time": 9266, "text": "It definitely is not me."}, {"time": 9270, "text": "If it was, would you tell me?"}, {"time": 9272, "text": "That's a trick question."}, {"time": 9274, "text": "Yeah, I know, trick question."}, {"time": 9275, "text": "But I mean, everybody who knows me knows I can't read the code."}, {"time": 9278, "text": "So you would say that even if you could."}, {"time": 9282, "text": "But that's true."}, {"time": 9283, "text": "Do you think it's one person?"}, {"time": 9284, "text": "Do you think it's multiple people?"}, {"time": 9285, "text": "Is it interesting to you?"}, {"time": 9287, "text": "Do you think it's fundamental to the coin itself to not to coin the entirety of the concept that it's founders and animus?"}, {"time": 9296, "text": "And how much guts do you think it takes if it's one person to just walk away from so much money?"}, {"time": 9302, "text": "I've considered all these questions many times."}, {"time": 9304, "text": "It's very hard to formulate a definitive answer to all of them."}, {"time": 9310, "text": "And I don't know why he or them or she are not spending the coins that they most likely have."}, {"time": 9319, "text": "I think what really matters in Bitcoin about Satoshi is the fact that he's not there."}, {"time": 9324, "text": "And this is what's truly astonishing about it."}, {"time": 9328, "text": "The most important fact in Bitcoin is the fact that the creators disappeared and the thing has continued to operate now for almost 12 years without him being there or 11 years I think it's been since he's left."}, {"time": 9338, "text": "And this is really the most important thing."}, {"time": 9341, "text": "And maybe he died or she died or they got into an accident on a road trip or whatever and that's why they haven't accessed their coins."}, {"time": 9351, "text": "Maybe they're incapacitated for some reason."}, {"time": 9354, "text": "But whatever reason it is, I really think it's fate or serendipity that has given us this very vital, very, very, very vital building ingredient in Bitcoin which no other digital currency would ever recreate, which is that because it was the first, it was the one that was able to establish the first mover advantage and get all of the people who are interested in the technology to get into it."}, {"time": 9382, "text": "And so that's an enormous advantage, but the cherry on top or what made the whole thing really function well is the fact that the guy who made it disappeared and that it continued to operate, which is just a clear illustration that this is a network with no admins."}, {"time": 9432, "text": "They may have no access to the coins and that's why they can't move them."}, {"time": 9435, "text": "I could see that happening, but I find it harder to believe that they would resist the temptation to mess with the network."}, {"time": 9441, "text": "You know, it's funny, I find that the founders of ideas are often principled and have the integrity that the eventual users of those ideas don't fully have."}, {"time": 9455, "text": "I tend to, you know, we have the kind of cynical view, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "And we tend to, in our mind, generalize that all humans are corruptible."}, {"time": 9465, "text": "And perhaps that's true to some degree, but I think some people are more corruptible than others."}, {"time": 9471, "text": "And I find that there is, I mean, I like to think that Satoshi Nakamoto's out there and, you know, just like George Washington chose to walk away and it's a principle."}, {"time": 9483, "text": "And

really the criticism, but Bitcoin mining is not fully decentralized because a small number of miners control a majority of the hashing power."}, {"time": 9726, "text": "I looked it up, there's 10,000, 15,000, whatever the number is of computers that are full nodes, that have the full, that are actively connected to the network."}, {"time": 9736, "text": "So you could argue that's decentralized because it's global, it's all across the world, but the miners, they're still, it's more centralized."}, {"time": 9745, "text": "So if you're thinking of making a case for Bitcoin being decentralized,

centralized and not?"}, {"time": 9762, "text": "The nodes are what matters because the nodes are what determines Bitcoin's consensus parameters."}, {"time": 9766, "text": "I think the best way to think about it is that miners simply sell a commodity to the nodes and that commodity is Bitcoin blocks."}, {"time": 9776, "text": "So what a miner does is they solve the proof of work problem so they keep operating their computers until they can get a solution to the problem."}, {"time": 9784, "text": "And then they attach that to a bunch of transactions and present it to the nodes for the nodes to ratify and approve it."}, {"time": 9791, "text": "So therefore, this is, and this is, I strongly recommend people learn about the 2017 block size war to understand why miners don't control Bitcoin."}, {"time": 9801, "text": "I discussed this briefly in my Bitcoin standard, but there's a recent book that discusses this in detail called The Block Size War by Jonathan Beer."}, {"time": 9810, "text": "It's a great description of, in 2017, essentially the miners thought that they can control Bitcoin."}, {"time": 9845, "text": "But they thought that they could pass this change, they could force this change on the network."}, {"time": 9850, "text": "And the members of the network rejected it and they weren't able to do it."}, {"time": 9855, "text": "So the nodes are what is sovereign."}, {"time": 9857, "text": "The nodes are what determine the rules of the game."}, {"time": 9860, "text": "The miners are a service provider."}, {"time": 9863, "text": "The miners invest capital upfront."}, {"time": 9865, "text": "You know, they buy the machines, they buy the electricity, they buy the storage, they buy the locations, they pay the rent, and they invest all of that money based on the idea that if they behave according to what the nodes want, the nodes will reward them with Bitcoin."}, {"time": 9882, "text": "So the miners are in no position to dictate terms for anyone."}, {"time": 9885, "text": "You know, they've put up their capital upfront and they will only recoup it if they do what the nodes want."}, {"time": 9891, "text": "So therefore what really matters is the decentralization of the nodes."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "So we wanna, you wanna have as many nodes as possible."}, {"time": 9897, "text": "You should, you wanna have a system where there's a large number of nodes."}, {"time": 9901, "text": "And this is of course the biggest problem with other digital currencies is that, you know, because basically Bitcoin has cornered the market

other digital currencies are optimized for bells and whistles and buzzwords."}, {"time": 9927, "text": "And that means adding computational load, which makes the nodes bigger, harder to operate, and

true sense."}, {"time": 9944, "text": "And it doesn't even matter how many nodes they have because de facto, you know, you can spin up a million nodes tomorrow on AWS, doesn't really matter."},

frequently and they can change the supply all the time means that there's a small group of people who agree amongst themselves how to move forward."}, {"time": 9971, "text": "Yeah, so you threw in a few criticisms of all coins there."}, {"time": 9975, "text": "So one is the small group."}, {"time": 9977, "text": "That one we could talk about."}, {"time": 9978, "text": "It's a tricky one, and we talked about that with Satoshi Nakamoto."}, {"time": 9982, "text": "But the other one is small number of nodes sort of to push back on that."}, {"time": 9987, "text": "As computational power increases, you can argue that that enables more and more cheap computers to serve as nodes."}, {"time": 9995, "text": "So at least it paints a future where nodes are always increasing because computational power is always increasing and getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper."}, {"time": 10004, "text": "So at least there's a hope for the future for greater and greater decentralization on the node front."}, {"time": 10010, "text": "Yeah, but I mean, ultimately, again, it doesn't really matter how many nodes you have if the way that the currency is run is that you're gonna have a hard fork every few months, which is the case with most other currencies."}, {"time": 10023, "text": "Bitcoin's the only one that's not have a hard fork."}, {"time": 10027, "text": "Basically, the unique thing about Bitcoin in a technical sense is that you could get the original software that Satoshi himself ran in 2009 to start the network."}, {"time": 10038, "text": "And you could run it today and
