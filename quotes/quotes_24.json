one of them, I'm convinced each time."}, {"time": 289, "text": "They all say different things, but they're so convincing."}, {"time": 291, "text": "I'm like, yes, hire that one, right?"}, {"time": 293, "text": "Is it like historical philosophy, like a particular talk?"}, {"time": 296, "text": "Or do they have an actual belief?"}, {"time": 299, "text": "They're practicing metaphysicians."}, {"time": 301, "text": "Metaphysicians, yes."}, {"time": 303, "text": "So, what they do is they come and they're usually excellent philosophers from Harvard or USC or whatever."}, {"time": 311, "text": "They come and they give what's called a job talk."}, {"time": 313, "text": "That's what every academic does a job talk in order to get it."}, {"time": 318, "text": "They talk to us about a department about what they do."}, {"time": 321, "text": "And so, it so happens that we need a metaphysician and now we're hiring again for one."}, {"time": 327, "text": "And so, I've learned a lot about metaphysics in the last year."}, {"time": 331, "text": "And this is what I've learned that they use physics as a basis for understanding what we can know about what is real."}, {"time": 339, "text": "And what is real is really difficult to pin down."}, {"time": 342, "text": "And so, your question is, what is belief?"}, {"time": 345, "text": "Well, belief, does it correspond to reality?"}, {"time": 348, "text": "That's the question I would ask."}, {"time": 350, "text": "And first, we don't even know what is real."}, {"time": 352, "text": "So, the table, they would say, how do we know that the table even exists?"}, {"time": 355, "text": "Well, how do we differentiate it from the floor, for example?"}, {"time": 359, "text": "So, these are the questions that philosophers are asking."}, {"time": 361, "text": "No one else is, of course."}, {"time": 362, "text": "But philosophers are asking these questions and they have different answers for it."}, {"time": 366, "text": "So, I would say that it's very difficult to know what is real."}, {"time": 370, "text": "And in fact, what I do usually is I paraphrase my friend and colleague, Brother Guy Consolmagno."}, {"time": 377, "text": "He's a Jesuit priest who's also an astronomer and he's the director of the Vatican Observatory."}, {"time": 383, "text": "And so, he says this, he's a very smart person."}, {"time": 385, "text": "He says, well, truth is a moving target."}, {"time": 390, "text": "So, basically, to know what is real out there, like gravity or something like that, you've got to approximate it."}, {"time": 398, "text": "And as human beings, we have senses to tell us what, at least so we don't get hurt."}, {"time": 405, "text": "We're not going to fall off a building or something like that."}, {"time": 408, "text": "We have eyes to see and things like that."}, {"time": 410, "text": "So, we can approximate what reality is, but we're never going to get to it unless we develop better senses, okay?"}, {"time": 418, "text": "And I think that that is what we are in the process of doing."}, {"time": 421, "text": "We're developing better senses."}, {"time": 423, "text": "We have telescopes, we have microscopes, we have extensions of ourselves, which are now called technology."}, {"time": 429, "text": "And we can get to a better understanding of what reality is and what the objective world is."}, {"time": 435, "text": "And therefore, our beliefs can be honed."}, {"time": 438, "text": "So, we can get better beliefs, more accurate beliefs."}, {"time": 440, "text": "But can we get beliefs that actually correspond to reality?"}, {"time": 444, "text": "Not in any precise way, but in approximate ways."}, {"time": 448, "text": "So, I hope that's not like too big an answer to your question."}, {"time": 451, "text": "Well, do you think beliefs are in themselves can become reality?"}, {"time": 455, "text": "I mean, so you've now adapted the, in this little bit of a conversation, adapted the metaphysician view of reality, which is the physics."}, {"time": 466, "text": "But, you know, we humans kind of operate in the space of ideas very much so."}, {"time": 471, "text": "Like we've kind of in the collective intelligence of human beings, have come up with a set of ideas that persist in the minds of these many people."}, {"time": 479, "text": "And they become quite strong and powerful."}, {"time": 482, "text": "Like in terms of like impact on our lives, they can have sometimes more impact than this table does than the physics."}, {"time": 492, "text": "And in that sense, is there some sense in which our beliefs are reality, even if they're not connected to the physics?"}, {"time": 502, "text": "Yes, even if they're not real."}, {"time": 503, "text": "Yeah, even if, okay."}, {"time": 505, "text": "So, yes, absolutely."}, {"time": 506, "text": "So, our beliefs are tremendously, they create social effects, absolutely."}, {"time": 514, "text": "There was a belief that, I'm going to use this example."}, {"time": 518, "text": "There was a belief back in the day, and we're talking about, when I say back in the day, I'm a historian, so I'm talking about like 1000 years ago, right?"}, {"time": 525, "text": "That women had no souls, okay?"}, {"time": 527, "text": "So, look, I don't know if human beings have souls."}, {"time": 529, "text": "I can tell you this, though, that if human beings have souls, probably animals do too."}, {"time": 534, "text": "That's my own personal belief."}, {"time": 535, "text": "That's not a professor belief there."}, {"time": 538, "text": "But there was this belief among the Catholic magisterium, which runs Europe, that women had no souls."}, {"time": 545, "text": "So, they had to have this big meeting about it, you know, did women have souls?"}, {"time": 548, "text": "But that belief had consequences for women."}, {"time": 553, "text": "I mean, women were treated and have been treated as if they didn't have souls."}, {"time": 558, "text": "Okay, so there's... And the soul was really the essence of the human being."}, {"time": 562, "text": "It's called the animus, right?"}, {"time": 564, "text": "It's what is the essence of what is eternal, you know, when women weren't eternal."}, {"time": 569, "text": "Here's another example, okay?"}, {"time": 571, "text": "This is an example from my own research."}, {"time": 574, "text": "So, in the Catholic tradition, there's this idea of purgatory, hell, and heaven."}, {"time": 580, "text": "And these are three destinations that people can go to when they die."}, {"time": 585, "text": "And if you're great, you go to heaven automatically and you're considered a saint."}, {"time": 589, "text": "If you're okay, you go to purgatory, right?"}, {"time": 592, "text": "And you suffer for a time and then get back into heaven."}, {"time": 595, "text": "If you're terrible, you go to hell, right?"}, {"time": 598, "text": "Well, there was a place that the Catholics determined, and this was a belief for a long time, like a thousand years or more, and it was called limbo, all right?"}, {"time": 609, "text": "And limbo comes from the Latin limbus, and it means edge."}, {"time": 613, "text": "And it was either on the edge of hell or on the edge of heaven."}, {"time": 616, "text": "No one really could determine which it was."}, {"time": 618, "text": "No historians are like, well, this person says it was on the edge of heaven."}, {"time": 622, "text": "Well, listen, this was a terrible... First of all, there is no limbo anymore."}, {"time": 626, "text": "In 2007, Benedict, the then Pope, got rid of the idea that there was limbo, okay?"}, {"time": 632, "text": "So Catholics kind of went crazy because they didn't really know."}, {"time": 635, "text": "They forgot that limbo existed and they thought it was purgatory."}, {"time": 638, "text": "And they said, how could you get rid of purgatory?"}, {"time": 640, "text": "But actually, he just got rid of this idea of limbo."}, {"time": 643, "text": "Oh, so that's a distinct thing from purgatory."}, {"time": 645, "text": "And by the way, people should know they have a book on purgatory that came before... American Cosmic."}, {"time": 650, "text": "Yes, I wrote a book on purgatory, yeah."}, {"time": 652, "text": "Anyway, so limbo is a distinct thing from purgatory?"}, {"time": 656, "text": "And the types of people who go to limbo happen to be virtuous pagans, okay?"}, {"time": 664, "text": "Like Socrates or somebody like that."}, {"time": 667, "text": "And children who weren't baptized."}, {"time": 669, "text": "So think of this."}, {"time": 671, "text": "Think of for like more than a thousand years, mothers and fathers gave birth to babies who weren't baptized and couldn't be buried with their family in these burial... And then they couldn't be reunited with them in heaven."}, {"time": 686, "text": "Think of the pain and suffering that that caused."}, {"time": 688, "text": "And that was nothing."}, {"time": 690, "text": "Limbo's nothing."}, {"time": 692, "text": "Yet the belief in it caused untold suffering."}, {"time": 695, "text": "And that's just a small example."}, {"time": 697, "text": "And that was as real to them?"}, {"time": 699, "text": "It was absolutely real."}, {"time": 700, "text": "I mean, the effects were real, let's put it that way."}, {"time": 702, "text": "The place itself, not real."}, {"time": 704, "text": "But the families themselves, do you think they really believed it?"}, {"time": 707, "text": "They totally believed it."}, {"time": 708, "text": "As much as the table is real?"}, {"time": 711, "text": "I've read, listen, we have trigger warnings today, right?"}, {"time": 714, "text": "So don't read this, it's gonna make you upset, okay?"}, {"time": 717, "text": "History, primary sources, no trigger warnings, okay?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "So you're going through like somebody's diary from 1400 and you hear the suffering and pain that they went through."}, {"time": 728, "text": "There were times in my research where I'd have to put my primary source down and just basically go outside and take a walk because it was so horrific."}, {"time": 738, "text": "I knew it was true because they wouldn't write something, they're not gonna write in their diary something that's not true and it was horrible."}, {"time": 744, "text": "So yes, these people went through untold suffering for nothing because they had an erroneous belief."}, {"time": 750, "text": "But they didn't know it was erroneous."}, {"time": 752, "text": "So it was real to them?"}, {"time": 754, "text": "So I don't know if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman."}, {"time": 757, "text": "He has this idea that in terms of the distance we are from being able to know the reality, which is there, the physics reality, is we're actually really, really, really, really far away from that."}, {"time": 772, "text": "So like it's, I think his ideas that were basically like completely detached from it."}, {"time": 781, "text": "What's your sense, how close are we to the reality?"}, {"time": 784, "text": "We'll talk about a bunch of ideas about our beliefs in technology and beyond, but in terms of what is actually real from a physical sense, how close are we to understanding that?"}, {"time": 798, "text": "Pretty far."}, {"time": 799, "text": "I'm gonna use examples from what I do."}, {"time": 801, "text": "Okay, so this idea that we're suspicious of what we actually think is real is not new."}, {"time": 809, "text": "Of course, it goes back a long time, thousands of years, in fact."}, {"time": 813, "text": "And philosophers, I'm not actually technically a philosopher, but I was one."}, {"time": 819, "text": "I'm a professor of religious studies."}, {"time": 822, "text": "Yeah, what do you introduce yourself at, like at a bar when the bartender asks, what do you do?"}, {"time": 827, "text": "I never tell people what I do, especially on airplanes."}, {"time": 832, "text": "It's a bad idea."}, {"time": 833, "text": "So generally if they push though, I say, I'm the chair of philosophy and religion, although I stepped down last year, so I'm no longer the chair."}, {"time": 840, "text": "But I have like a master's degree in philosophy and I was a philosophy major and I still study philosophy, so I integrate it into my research."}, {"time": 849, "text": "All right, so this idea that we can't know, we're suspicious of what we know, it's called external world skepticism."}, {"time": 858, "text": "That's the official philosophical name for it."}, {"time": 861, "text": "Our faculties and our senses don't give us accurate perceptions of what is there, okay, especially at a quantum level or a molecular level."}, {"time": 870, "text": "I mean, that's just obvious."}, {"time": 872, "text": "So yeah, so I think that the person you mentioned is correct in that."}, {"time": 876, "text": "I think we're far away from it."}, {"time": 877, "text": "I think you're talking about our direct senses, but you know, we have tools, measurement tools from microscopes to all the tools of astronomy, cosmology that gives us a sense of the big universe and also the sense of the very small."}, {"time": 894, "text": "Do you think there's some other things that are completely sort of other dimensions or there's ideas of panpsychism, that consciousness permeates all matter, that there's like fundamental forces of physics we're not even aware of yet?"}, {"time": 914, "text": "I do think, and this is why I write about technology and I mean, that's actually what I specialize in is belief in technology with respect to religion."}, {"time": 925, "text": "So in my opinion, thank goodness for technology because where would we be without it?"}, {"time": 932, "text": "I mean, frankly, I think that it's like Marshall McLuhan was the person who said technology is like an extension of our senses and I absolutely believe that to be true."}, {"time": 944, "text": "I think that we're lucky that Prometheus gave us technology, okay, and that we use it and we're making it better and better and better and better."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And that makes us more efficient."}, {"time": 957, "text": "It makes us more efficient as a species."}, {"time": 960, "text": "And like my point is that I think that our instruments, I mean, I don't want to be a religious technologist, you know, but our instruments will save us."}, {"time": 976, "text": "I mean, they're already making life better for us."}, {"time": 978, "text": "You think it's important that they also help us understand reality more directly, more deeply?"}, {"time": 984, "text": "I think directly is better than deeply."}, {"time": 986, "text": "I think directly, more directly is probably a more accurate term for what you're trying to, I think, ask me, you know, can we actually, I mean, I think you're asking me that question that Kant basically was trying to get at was can we know the thing in itself?"}, {"time": 1000, "text": "Can we know that?"}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Can we have like some kind of like intense knowing of it?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "It's almost mystical."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "And I would say that that's where religion comes in, okay?"}, {"time": 1012, "text": "That's where we talk about religion."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "And if I may also go back to Immanuel Kant."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "This idea that he, just before he died, just as he died, he was working on, he did this critique of reason where basically he believed, he basically talks about can we know what's real?"}, {"time": 1032, "text": "He basically has this long, you know, that question, can we know what's real?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And then, you know, a thousand pages later, no."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "I'll just give you the rundown."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "So, okay, yeah, yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "Then he does this other critique and okay, so he does like three critiques."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "Then he does this critique of judgment."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "Well, judgment is this other thing altogether."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "And I think that that's what you're getting at."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "So how do we know things?"}, {"time": 1057, "text": "How can we know things really intensely and intimately?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "And I think that he thought that judgment was the idea that we can actually know the thing in itself."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "And he was working on that as he died and then he never finished it."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Hannah Arendt, another philosopher of the 20th century, took it up, took up the critique of judgment and tried to finish it."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "Why the word judgment?"}, {"time": 1083, "text": "Because judgment, think about it, when you see a work of art, who judges that to be decent?"}, {"time": 1089, "text": "So there is a group of people who come to the decision that that's rotten or, you know, that's pretty good."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "You know, like, I noticed that you like to play guitar."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Well, you choose music that I happen to like too."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So you and I both have a sense of judgment."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "It's a sense."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "So he said, there's a sense that some people have."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "Why do certain communities have a similar sense?"}, {"time": 1117, "text": "What dictates that?"}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And so he was working on that."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "He thought it had something to do with the knowledge, the intimate knowledge of the thing in itself."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "Yeah, so another philosopher that philosophers actually don't like at all, but religious studies people do, is Martin Heidegger."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "So Martin Heidegger has some great essays."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "One is called What is a Work of Art?"}, {"time": 1136, "text": "And again, he gets to, you know, he talks about Van Gogh and Van Gogh's shoes."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "You know, that picture, the painting Van Gogh's shoes, it's really a really intense picture."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "It's just shoes."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "It's, you know, it's an amazing painting of shoes."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "And I think everybody can agree that's a cool picture of shoes, right?"}, {"time": 1156, "text": "And so why, you know, the question is, why is that a cool picture of shoes?"}, {"time": 1160, "text": "You know, what kind of knowledge are we accessing to determine that indeed that works, right?"}, {"time": 1167, "text": "And in fact, we still like it."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "So basically the nature of knowledge and what does it represent?"}, {"time": 1172, "text": "It can operate in the space of, that's detached from reality or can it ultimately represent reality?"}, {"time": 1179, "text": "I guess that's the, is that, that's the space of metaphysics?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Is that the, is that the... Yeah."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "So what can we know is actually called epistemology."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "Epistemology."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "But metaphysics is, is basically what is the nature of reality."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "And those intersect."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "A lot of things intersect in philosophy."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "We just have fancy names for them."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "Another non philosopher that may be considered a philosopher, since we're talking about reality is Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "What are your thoughts on her sense of taking this idea of reality, calling her philosophy objectivism, and kind of starting at the idea that you really could know everything, and it's pretty obvious, and then from that, you can derive an ethics about how to live life, like what is the, what is the good ethical life and all the virtue of selfishness, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "So you talked to a lot of academic philosophers."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "So I'd be curious to see from the perspective of like, is she somebody that's taken seriously at all?"}, {"time": 1255, "text": "Why is she dismissed as I see from my distant perspective by serious philosophers, and also like your own personal thoughts of like, is there some interesting bits that you find inspiring in her work or not?"}, {"time": 1270, "text": "Okay, so Ayn Rand, I've had so many exceedingly intelligent students basically give me her books, and basically say, please, Dr. Basilka, read this book."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "And I'll tell them, yes, thank you, I've read this book before."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "And then want to engage in, let me put it this way, they're religious about Ayn Rand."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "Okay, so to them, Ayn Rand represents some type of way of life, her objectivism."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "Now, why is she not taken seriously by philosophers in general?"}, {"time": 1308, "text": "Well, let me put it this way, philosophers in general tend to get pretty, I guess you could call it, they're kind of scientists, but with words."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "I always call philosophy, when I describe it to someone who's going to take a philosophy class, I say, it's basically math problems, like word math problems, okay?"}, {"time": 1330, "text": "So that's basically what it is."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "So they take words very seriously, and they're very formal."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "And definitions very seriously, yeah."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "So they all want to get on the same page, so there is no confusion."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So for Ayn Rand to basically say, you can know everything, and you know, it's like, okay, and establish ethics from that, I think philosophers automatically say no."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "Now, that doesn't mean I say no."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "In fact, we have at my university a wonderful business school."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "And when you walk into the dean of the business school's office, Ayn Rand is everywhere."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "So I want to say that not all academics are anti Ayn Rand."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "And in fact, I don't think philosophers are either, except that they don't teach Ayn Rand, okay?"}, {"time": 1376, "text": "So in one sense, you could say that because they don't teach her, they're being exclusive in what they teach, or very particular, perhaps, is another way to put it."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "Yeah, it's hard to know where to place people like her, because, you know, do you put Albert Camus as a philosopher?"}, {"time": 1393, "text": "So I guess, what's the good term for that?"}, {"time": 1395, "text": "Like literary philosophers, or whatever the term is, it's annoying to me that the academic philosophers get to own the word philosophy, because like, it's just like people who think deeply about life is what I think about as philosophy."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "And like, to me, it's like, all right, so I know Nietzsche is another person that's probably not respected in the philosophy circles, because he is, you know, full of contradictions, full of..."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "I love Nietzsche."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "Nietzsche is my favorite philosopher."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Yes, I absolutely love Nietzsche."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "So he's definitely, you know, I love people that are full of ideas, even if they're full of contradictions, and Nietzsche is certainly that."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "And Ayn Rand is also that."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "I'm able to look past the obvious ego that's there on the page, and the fact that she actually has, in my view, a lot of wrong ideas."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "But there's a lot of interesting tidbits to pick up, and the same goes with Nietzsche."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "And I'm weirded out by the religious aspect here, on both the people who like worship Ayn Rand, and people who completely dismiss her."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "I just kind of see it as, oh, can we just read a few interesting things and get inspired by it and move on, as opposed to... No."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "...have a diplomatic conversation."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "Is there something you find about her work that's interesting to you?"}, {"time": 1476, "text": "Or her personality, or any of that?"}, {"time": 1479, "text": "Oh, I think she's fascinating."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "I don't dismiss her."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "She was a woman who reached a level of success with her mind at a time when that was difficult."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "So, I mean, she's definitely worth looking at for even that reason."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "But also, her idea, I guess, part of the situation with Rand, first of all, I think that she her work is, you have to, it's misinterpreted, okay?"}, {"time": 1508, "text": "And I think that's the same with Nietzsche."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "A lot of people think that, I mean, in fact, it is the case that Nietzsche's writing before the 20th century, so he's got the, he's somewhat, his rhetoric is sexist and racist

have dignity at the time converged to Christianity in droves."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "And so what happened was that all of a sudden it became this belief system that was undercurrent."}, {"time":

on fire, right?"}, {"time": 2175, "text": "And so they had to deal with that fire somehow."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "And so they narrativized it."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "They decided, how do we interpret this?"}, {"time": 2182, "text": "And they interpreted it as they wished."}, {"time": 2185, "text": "But that wasn't the only interpretation of Christianity."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "I have another example."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "In the Catholic Church, a lot of times, and I'm going to use the example of Faustina."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "She's a nun, and she's Polish."}, {"time":

okay?"}, {"time": 2236, "text": "And so they were very successful in trying to keep her quiet, and she died, okay?"}, {"time": 2240, "text": "Years later, John Paul II, Polish, sainted her and created the divine mercy devotion, which is worldwide now, and millions and millions of people."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "But do you see how they completely controlled it there?"}, {"time": 2255, "text": "So fascinating that it just starts with a single, like you said, contact experience."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "Experience is the key word."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "And is your sense that those experiences are legitimate, so it's not..."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "Yes, for the most part."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "Somehow artificially constructed?"}, {"time": 2272, "text": "I think for the most part, they're legitimate experiences that people have."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "Why would someone want to put themselves through what they go through?"}, {"time": 2278, "text": "Like, why would Jesus want to get crucified?"}, {"time": 2280, "text": "I mean, that's a pretty nasty way to die."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "Why would Faustina bring this upon herself?"}, {"time": 2288, "text": "The people that I meet who said that they've seen UFOs, that most of them don't want to be known because of the ridicule that goes along with it."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "So I honestly think that there are people who are maybe not stable and would like the attention, but for the most part, normal people don't want this attention."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "So you mentioned building blocks."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "You didn't mention the word God or sort of the afterlife."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "Are those essential to the myth?"}, {"time": 2316, "text": "So there's a contact experience."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "Is there some other aspects of myth and religion which makes them viral?"}, {"time": 2323, "text": "Which makes them spread and captivate the imagination of people?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "Is there a pattern to them?"}, {"time": 2333, "text": "I think that for each era, it's different and people have... First, let's talk about the definition of religion, if that's okay, because most people assume the definitions that we in the West are familiar with, which is that, you know, that of Christianity, Islam, Judaism, you know, monotheistic religions."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "And those are just some religions."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "There are so many different types of religions."}, {"time":

things so that you can actually have the experience, like you were talking about earlier, of the thing in itself."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "And they call that Satori."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "So there are people who believe, you know, they try to..."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "They call it meditation, Zen meditation, and it's fairly radical, actually."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "In some monasteries, I don't know if they still do this, but they'll whack you on the head if you appear to be not focusing and, you know, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "You know, they do things to basically take you away from your conceptions of reality and bring you into a state of all that is, which is what they call Satori."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "And that has nothing to do with God."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "I like this religion."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "And anything that involves sticks and whacking in order for you to focus better, I'm gonna have to join a monastery."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "So, okay, so digging into definitions of religion."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "So like, what do you think is the scope that defines a religion?"}, {"time": 2441, "text": "So in my field, we have a few different definitions of religion, as you can imagine, just like philosophers have different definitions of what is real."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "So I take this definition and it comes from John Livingston."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And it's, religion is that set of beliefs and practices that is inspired by a transformative, what is perceived actually to be a transformative and sacred power."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "So religion is a set of, it's not just belief, it's also practices."}, {"time": 2473, "text": "It's both belief and practices, because you won't have the practices without the belief."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "So you have those together, okay, and it's inspired by what is perceived, because we don't know if it's real or not, what is perceived to be of sacred and transforming power."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "So perceived by the followers, or is this connected to the original sort of experience?"}, {"time": 2493, "text": "No, no, well, it's perceived by the followers."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "So, and that's the governing idea is that there's something of great power, perceived to be of great power, which you can connect yourself either emotionally or intellectually somehow in order to explore the world that is beyond your own capabilities."}, {"time": 2516, "text": "And is there communication also involved?"}, {"time": 2518, "text": "Generally, yeah."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "That's a great definition."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "So within that falls everything that we've talked about so far, including

religion good for?"}, {"time": 2545, "text": "Okay, yeah, that's a great question."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "Thanks for asking that."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "Most people don't ask that."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "And I think it's the question to ask, why do we still have religion?"}, {"time": 2554, "text": "That's the question, right?"}, {"time": 2556, "text": "Because scientists and others, scholars, humanists even thought that there's this thing called the secularization thesis, and it's this idea that the more we progress rationally and we have better instruments for understanding our reality, the less religious we will be."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "But that's been found to be untrue."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "We're still very religious, okay?"}, {"time": 2582, "text": "Why is it around?"}, {"time": 2583, "text": "Well, it's adaptive in some way, in my opinion."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "Many people would not agree with me, but I kind of see it as an evolutionary

saying."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "When you say religion, I would use the word religiosity because I think that we're moving out of the dogmatic types of religions into more of a, I hate to put it

the context that I'm coming from."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "So, in each case, for one thing, Irish weren't considered, Catholics weren't considered, they were considered to be terrible and there was a lot of anti Catholic rhetoric here in the United States, which is kind of strange because one of the, in fact, the most wealthy colonial family were the Carrolls in Maryland and they were

believe he died in 1900."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Okay, so he's writing in the 1800s."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "And he's basically saying God is dead, and we killed Him, okay?"}, {"time": 3224,

future."}, {"time": 3266, "text": "And he's speaking and writing to them, is my belief."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "So he's basically telling you and me, because we're now the philosophers of his

3308, "text": "So if people don't believe that anymore, what will happen?"}, {"time": 3310, "text": "And so that's what he's basically saying, is that the basic anchor for Western society is now

out being agnostic."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Kind of believer."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "But agnostic, sort of open to the mysteries of the world."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "And I didn't think

technology."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "Yeah, there might be a gray area between what is technology and what the aliens are."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "Yeah, so but you're saying like basically a robotic probe that would be the equivalent of us, our human civilization created technology."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "Way more advanced than what we could believe to be a probe, all right?"},

but what forms can it possibly take?"}, {"time": 3884, "text": "So like I really love this idea that I tend to be humble in the face of all that we don't know and I tend to believe that the form alien life forms would take."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "And the way they would communicate is much more likely to be of a form that we can't even comprehend or perhaps can't even perceive directly."},

heck consciousness is."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "Like maybe consciousness itself is communication with aliens."}, {"time": 3925, "text": "Or like, I don't know, it could be just our own thoughts is actually the alien life forms communicating."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "Like, I know all that sounds crazy, but I'm saying like, I'm just trying to come up with the craziest possible thing that

way that's helpful for you to think about beyond the little green men?"}, {"time": 3991, "text": "It accords exactly with how I think, actually."}, {"time": 3995, "text": "So I'll explain."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "I liked in American Cosmic, I attained the status of full professor."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "So I was like, OK, I can pretty much write this book like I want to do it."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "So I used a lot of quotes from cool artists like David Bowie."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "So David Bowie opens the book, and he basically says, and so does Nietzsche, by the way."},

think is absolutely correct."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "David Bowie said, the internet is an alien life form."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "OK, and if you've not seen David Bowie's interview where he says that, I highly recommend it."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "He's so brilliant."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "OK, so David Bowie is actually quite brilliant about the idea of UFOs."}, {"time": 4047,

right."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "So I started to think about it."}, {"time": 4061, "text": "OK, so he's a technologist."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "He has a Ph.D. in information technology from computer science, basically, from Northwestern."}, {"time": 4068, "text": "And he got that back in the day."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "You know, when I say back in the day, I'm not talking a thousand years ago."}, {"time": 4072, "text": "I'm talking like in the 60s."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "OK, so he's back when computer science wasn't really even the field you can get a degree."}, {"time":

around brilliant guy, right?"}, {"time": 4091, "text": "And he's also interested in UFOs."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "And most people take those two interests of his as separate interests."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "And I remember being at a very small conference and listening to him, being in awe, of course, because he's an awe inspiring person, and then thinking, wait a minute, why do people compartmentalize those two things about him?"}, {"time": 4110, "text": "They're one in the same."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "OK, so when we talk about UFOs and UAPs and stuff, we have to talk about digital technology and things like that."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "And things like that."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "Now, if we're going back to what I so if I were to say what if I were to believe in

communicating with us."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "I'm going to tell you how I think they communicate with us."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "And I go back to the Greeks again."}, {"time": 4144, "text":

understand."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "Like, so only people with like, you know, in super amazing capacities, like poetic, creative, you know, intelligent, mathematical, whatever, you know, because they tend to do this symbolically."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "They tend to communicate with us in symbols form."}, {"time": 4178, "text": "And so music, you know, symbols, we've got math that are, you know, it's a symbolic language."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "And so what?"}, {"time": 4183, "text": "So, OK, so muses are probably a good idea for me of what this would be."}, {"time": 4189, "text":

"text": "So then you go to the Russian side, and they had a very specific non dogmatic, according to Catholics or Orthodox Christianity, idea of what Christianity was, and they believed that they were interacting with angels, nonhuman intelligences."}, {"time": 4273, "text": "So if you look back and you see muses, you can contextualize them within this tradition."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "And so when I started to talk to people who were actually in the space program and who were in these programs that now the government has said, oh, yeah, we do have these programs, they have the same belief structures."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "They believe that they were also in contact with these nonhuman intelligences, and they were getting what they called downloads of information and creating, sometimes with Tyler Dee in my book, creating technologies that were real, and they were selling them on NASDAQ for a lot of money, like, say, $100 million or something like that, undisclosed amounts, but a lot."}, {"time": 4312, "text": "And these things are viable technologies that we use now, and they make our lives better, and we progress as a species because of them."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "Now, that has nothing to do with the scientific method."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "As much as I know, as much as anybody's going to get angry at me for saying that, but sorry, those were strange encounters that created our ability to go into space."}, {"time": 4336, "text": "I don't know if they're real or not, but these people believe they were real."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "YARO Right, so they have a power in actually having an impact on this world, in inspiring humans to create technology, which enables us to do things we haven't been able to do before."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "KATE Yeah."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "YARO And these, I like how we're putting angels, alien life forms, aliens, and technology all in the nonhuman intelligence camp, which I really like that because that's very true."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "It's this other source of wisdom, intelligence, maybe a connection to the mysterious."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "KATE Yes, I was really surprised by it."}, {"time": 4405, "text": "Why did you come to believe that they are one and the same, or at least part of the same intellectual journey?"}, {"time": 4416, "text": "KATE Thanks for asking that again, because nobody asks me that question, and it's central to my project."}, {"time": 4426, "text": "So Jacques was a huge influence, is a huge influence on me."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "He taught me a lot."}, {"time": 4434, "text": "He gave me access to some of his information that he keeps."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "But a lot of his information is actually there out there for everyone to read."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "He has an academia.edu page, so he didn't have this, unfortunately, when I was doing my research in 2012 and 2013."}, {"time": 4453, "text": "So I had to go back and do microfiche type stuff."}, {"time": 4456, "text": "What I did was I began to read everything that he wrote, and he actually gave me a lot of his books too."}, {"time": 4461, "text": "And he told me, I remember, he dropped me off from, this is actually quite interesting if you'll allow me to tell you a little story, and it also includes ayahuasca."}, {"time": 4471, "text": "SIMON Great, every story that includes ayahuasca is a great story."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "KATE Okay, so I was at a conference, and it was a small conference of very interesting people in California, on the Pacific Ocean."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "And Jacques was there."}, {"time": 4486, "text": "And this actually opens my book."}, {"time": 4489, "text": "This is the, I go, it's the preface to my book."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "I go on this ride."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "He takes me through Silicon Valley."}, {"time": 4496, "text": "I've lived there, right?"}, {"time": 4498, "text": "My grandparents grew up in the same place that he raised his children, in Belmont."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "And so, but we were there with Robbie Graham, who's a great ufologist in his own right, and film theorist."}, {"time": 4512, "text": "I highly recommend his work."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "So we were together, and he was taking us to San Francisco, where I was going to meet my brother, who was going to take me home."}, {"time": 4520, "text": "And so he took us on this long journey, and he talked to us."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "And as we got out of the car, he gave me several of his books."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "And one in particular he gave me, and he said, read this first."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "And I was like, okay, I definitely will read that first."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "Okay, so this is how the ayahuasca figures in."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "So we were, I didn't take it, nor have I taken it."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Okay, so we were at this place in California, and Alex Gray and his wife were there."}, {"time": 4549, "text": "And they were talking about their experiences with psychedelics."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "He's an amazing visionary artist, okay?"}, {"time": 4556, "text": "So he believes that there's a place that you can enter, and he and his wife would enter this space with either ayahuasca or LSD or something like that."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "And they would not talk to each other, but they would be having the same exact experience."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "So it was almost like having the same dream, right?"}, {"time": 4574, "text": "Okay, so somehow that whole event with Jacques there, and them talking about their experiences in these realms, of which religious studies people are quite familiar, by the way, because visionary experiences are what we study."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "So all of this seems super familiar to me, and I recognized that immediately that Jacques, that it hit me like, you know, very obvious that UFOs and these experiences and technology all seemed, they were all meshed together."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "And I knew that I had to take them, I knew I had to read everything Jacques ever wrote."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "And the best stuff he's written, by the way, is his little essays that he wrote in the 1970s, and they were peer reviewed essays about the beginning of the internet and how a lot of it was based on basically neural connection with the internet, like somehow psychic connection through the internet with others and things like that."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "So the brain is a biological neural network, there's this connection between visual neurons and so on, and that's what ultimately is able to have memories and has cognitive ability and is able to perceive the world and generate ideas."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "And those ideas are then spread on the internet, even from the very early days to other humans."}, {"time": 4657, "text": "So it gets injected or travels into the brains of other humans and that goes around in there and then spits out other stuff and it goes back and forth."}, {"time": 4665, "text": "So it's nice to think of the network that's in our mind, individual mind as, I mean, very much even deeply connected to the network that is the connection between humans through the internet."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "And so in that sense, Jacques saw the internet as this powerful, as a source of power and wisdom that is beyond our own."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "Exactly, that's external to us, like if you could call it autonomous AI, right?"}, {"time": 4697, "text": "It's nonhuman intelligence in a sense, even though humans are a part of it."}, {"time": 4701, "text": "Yes, or we're invaded by it or whatever you want to call it."}, {"time": 4704, "text": "Yeah, whoever, right, it's the chicken and the egg, right."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "So if I can go on, I don't want to experience things, I'm not done with that."}, {"time": 4713, "text": "So this is where I come to this idea that we're in this space, we're in now a new space of religion, of religiosity."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "So what happens is then, and it's like a biosphere and I'll talk about that in a minute."}, {"time": 4728, "text": "So Jacques takes us back, we get to San Francisco and my brother, who is your straight lace person, army guy and everything like that, I get into his car and the first thing he tells me is, I took ayahuasca and I was like, what?"}, {"time": 4744, "text": "And he goes, it's going to save humanity."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "As I mentioned to you offline, I talked to Matthew Johnson, he's a Hopkins professor and he's really a scholar of most, he's studied most drugs, he's also really deeply studied cocaine and all those stuff and negative effects and he's focused on a lot of positive effects of the different psychedelics."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "So I'm very much interested in exploring the science of what these things do to the human mind and also personally exploring it."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "Although it's like this weird gray area, which he's masterful at, which is he's a professor at John Hopkins, one of the most prestigious universities in the world and doing large scale studies of this stuff and until he got a lot of money for these studies, even in Hopkins itself, there's not much respect."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "It's not even respect, it was like people just didn't want to talk about it as a legitimate field of inquiry."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "It's kind of fascinating how hesitant we are as a little human civilization to legitimize the exploration of the mysterious, of whatever the definition of the mysterious is for that particular period of time."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "So for us now, there's like little groups of things."}, {"time": 4832, "text": "I would say consciousness in the space of computer science research is something that's still like, I don't know, maybe let philosophers kick it around for a little longer."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "And then certainly extraterrestrial life forms in most formulations of that problem space is still the other, it's still the source of the mysterious, except maybe like SETI, which is like, how can we detect signals from far away alien intelligences that we'll be able to perceive?"}, {"time": 4870, "text": "And psychedelics is another one of those that's like, we're starting to see, okay, well, can we try to see if there's some medical applications of like helping you get, like he does studies of help you quit smoking or help you in some kind of treatment of some disease."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "And he's sneaking into that, I mean, it's like openly sneaking into it, he's doing studies on it of like, how can you expand the mind with these tools and what can the mind discover through psychedelics and so on."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "And we're like slowly creeping into the space of being able to explore these mysterious questions."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "But it's like, it sucks that sometimes a lot of people have to die, meaning, sorry, they have to age out."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "Like it's like faculty have, and people have a fixed set of ideas and they stick by them."}, {"time": 4926, "text": "In order for new ideas to come in, then the young folks have to be born with an open mind, the possibility of those ideas, and then they have to become old enough and get A's in school and whatever to then carry those ideas forward."}, {"time": 4941, "text": "So the acceptance of the exploration of the mysterious takes time."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "It is sad."}, {"time": 4951, "text": "Maybe to go into my source of passion, which is artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 4958, "text": "What's your sense about the possibility, like Pamela McCordick has this quote that I like, I talked to her a couple of years ago, I guess already on this podcast, that artificial intelligence began with the ancient wish to forge the gods."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "So do you think artificial intelligence may become the very kind of gods that were at the center of our, the religions of most of our history?"}, {"time": 4997, "text": "Yeah, there's a lot there."}, {"time": 4999, "text": "So I'm going to start by addressing this idea of artificial intelligence being separate from human beings."}, {"time": 5007, "text": "So I don't think that's actually, that might happen."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "I mean, it's already happened, but let's put it this way."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "You're talking about super artificial intelligence, like autonomous, conscious artificial intelligence?"}, {"time": 5024, "text": "Something with artificial consciousness."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "First of all, I think she's correct, but also there's an awesome quote."}, {"time": 5032, "text": "I'd also like to bring up this writer of fiction, actually, Ted Chiang, and one of his essays, he writes short essays."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "One of them was The Basis for the Movie Arrival, which if you haven't seen it, it's a really great movie about UFOs, and it has a very creative way of proposing an idea of how they might be able to communicate, first of all, how they appear to us, and second of all, how they may be communicating with us humans."}, {"time": 5065, "text": "The author Ted Chiang has a lot, I recommend his writings, his short stories."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "One is very short, and it appeared in Nature about 20 years ago, and it is called, I think it's called Eating the Crumbs from the Table or something like that, and it's basically this short essay, and I hate to do a spoiler here, but if you don't want to know what it's about, don't listen right now for five minutes."}, {"time": 5094, "text": "Yeah, spoiler alert."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "So this is what it's about."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "So basically it's about human beings becoming two different species, okay?"}, {"time": 5103, "text": "And one of them is created, they're called metahumans, and they start biohacking themselves with tech."}, {"time": 5111, "text": "Sound familiar?"}, {"time": 5112, "text": "So they do this, and they become metahumans and another species, right, and just kind of another fork, such that humans can barely understand them because they're so far removed."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "So in a sense, are they gods, right?"}, {"time": 5132, "text": "No, they're metahumans, they're superhumans, they're enhanced humans, okay?"}, {"time": 5135, "text": "I see that hopefully on the horizon, frankly."}, {"time": 5139, "text": "Not that we have two species, but that we can use our technology or we can become so integrated with our technology that we can survive, okay?"}, {"time": 5150, "text": "We can survive the radiation in space."}, {"time": 5153, "text": "We can't go places now because of the radiation in space."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "Perhaps we can develop our bodies such that we can survive the radiation in space."}, {"time": 5161, "text": "So there's this idea of these metahumans."}, {"time": 5163, "text": "Now, there's also this idea that technology is just another form of humans."}, {"time": 5169, "text": "We've created it, right?"}, {"time": 5171, "text": "And so maybe it is bent on surviving, thereby using us kind of as a meme or a team."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "Some people are calling them teams now, these self generating, they're replicating themselves through us, okay?"}, {"time": 5184, "text": "I see that also, and I don't think that's terribly bad."}, {"time": 5189, "text": "Maybe it's just the way that we are evolving."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "It doesn't mean that we're evolving all the time, like we're taller than we used to be, we have different skills."}, {"time": 5200, "text": "So I don't see that as a bad thing."}, {"time": 5203, "text": "I think a lot of people see it as if we're not how we are now, it's a tragedy."}, {"time": 5207, "text": "But it's not a tragedy."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "How we are now is actually a tragedy for most people alive."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "Yeah, and we might be evolving in ways we can't possibly perceive."}, {"time": 5214, "text": "Like you said, that humans have created Twitter and Twitter may be changing us in ways that we can't even understand now, currently."}, {"time": 5226, "text": "From a perspective, if you look at the entirety of the network of Twitter, that might be an organism that the organism understands what's happening from its level of perception."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "But we humans are just like the cells of the human body, we're interacting individually, but we're not actually aware of the big picture that's happening."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "And we naturally somehow, or whatever the force that's creating the entirety of this, whatever one version of it is the evolutionary process, like biological evolution, whatever force that is, is just creating these greater and greater level of complexity, and maybe somehow not other kinds of non human intelligence are involved that we're calling alien intelligences."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "So just to step back, and we'll come back to AI, because I love the topic, but through American Cosmic and in general, you've interacted with much of the UFO community, you mentioned ufologists."}, {"time": 5286, "text": "By the way, is it ufologists or is it ufologists?"}, {"time": 5292, "text": "It's ufologists."}, {"time": 5293, "text": "Ufologists."}, {"time": 5295, "text": "So first of all, what is a ufologist?"}, {"time": 5297, "text": "And second of all, what have you learned about this community of ufologists?"}, {"time": 5303, "text": "Or also as you refer to them as the invisibles, or the members of the invisible college, or just in general, people who study UFOs from the different, all the different kinds of groups that study UFOs?"}, {"time": 5317, "text": "Generally, what I found is that they are okay, so people who are interested in UFOs from like being a kid, you know, and seeing some cool movie like Star Wars or something, and then they become interested, and then they study it as best they can, UFOs, or UAPs."}, {"time": 5334, "text": "They're generally an honest group of people who are using their tools, and they're generally two types of them."}, {"time": 5343, "text": "There are those who believe in the nuts and bolts, like the physical craft, and they believe in that these are things from other planets, okay?"}, {"time": 5350, "text": "So that's like the ETH hypothesis, you know."}, {"time": 5355, "text": "I'm sorry, ETH hypothesis, ETH is what we call it."}, {"time": 5360, "text": "Sorry about that."}, {"time": 5361, "text": "So this is like there's an actual spaceship, like something akin, but much more advanced than the rockets we use now."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "And there's some kind of, not necessarily biological, but something like biological organisms that travel on these spaceships."}, {"time": 5378, "text": "So this would be like what, to the Star Academy, is trying to decipher, like how, you know, how do they do it?"}, {"time": 5384, "text": "You know, maybe we could use that technology, the propulsion and things like that."}, {"time": 5388, "text": "They look at the rocket technology."}, {"time": 5390, "text": "Okay, so there are those, and then there are people who believe that it's more consciousness based, okay?"}, {"time": 5395, "text": "So these are your two types of ufologists who are known, and these are people who we know about."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "And so they had to be really careful."}, {"time": 5431, "text": "So he called it the invisible college."}, {"time": 5433, "text": "So Hynek took that term and reused it, or what do you call it, repurposed it."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "So he repurposed it."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "So they were still talking to each other, though."}, {"time": 5444, "text": "So what I found to be the case was that there was a group of people who were scientists but were not on the internet."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "You know, people today, and students of mine in particular, and my own kids, actually, they think that you only exist if you're on the internet or something only exists if it's on the internet."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "And that's, of course, untrue."}, {"time": 5464, "text": "And so what I found was that most people who are the most powerful people of our society and are doing things are not on the internet."}, {"time": 5470, "text": "You're not going to find any trace of them."}, {"time": 5472, "text": "So a lot of these people are what I call invisibles, people who are studying, at least their work is invisible."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "You might find them on the internet, but you're going to find that they're part of the bowling league or something like that."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "You will not find that they are actually engaged in research about this topic."}, {"time": 5490, "text": "And so I called them the invisibles because I was surprised to find them."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "And I thought, well, this is no longer the invisible college because these people are not even talking to each other."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "And that's why I reference this movie Fight Club."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "In it, you have an invisible, and his name is Tyler Durden, and he's incredible."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "He does incredible things."}, {"time": 5512, "text": "He's like a person who should not exist because he does so many things that are amazing."}, {"time": 5518, "text": "And so I found a person like that, and he's a real person."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "He's partially on the internet, but nothing that he does around that topic of UFOs is on the internet."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "So I decided to call him Tyler D after Tyler Durden."}, {"time": 5531, "text": "And so these people, I've termed the UFO Fight Club because they work together, but they don't know, in fact, his boss doesn't know what he does."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "They don't talk to each other because, you know, the first rule of Fight Club."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "Same as the second, yeah."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "You don't talk about people."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "No, you don't do it."}, {"time": 5550, "text": "Why do you have a sense that there's such a, I don't want to say fear, but a

others you can tell me about, but Bob, who's also been on Joe Rogan, but his story has been told quite a bit that he's got, I think he said that he witnessed some of the work being done on the

all right."}, {"time": 7721, "text": "That said, if your audience is interested, I think the best theory about the meaning of the monolith is Robert Ager or Robert Ayer."}, {"time": 7734, "text": "I think it's Robert Ager."}, {"time": 7736, "text": "He's got a website where he does analyses of films and it's called Collative Learning or Collative Learning, and he does the meaning of the

"text": "So basically, he says that the monolith is, okay, can you pick up your phone here?"}, {"time": 7769, "text": "It looks awfully a lot like a monolith."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "So basically, that's what he was saying was that Kubrick was basically, the monolith was technology or the screen in particular, and he basically was saying that the cinema screen, we're being completely... And if you think about it, look at all this, we live in a screen culture."}, {"time": 7790, "text": "We have computer screens, iPhone screens, there's phone screens, we have TV screens, everything is something... And now that COVID has come, we're forced to go into these screens and we're forced to live a different material existence than we have lived before."}, {"time": 7806, "text": "So in my sense, I think

creatures that ultimately wins out."}, {"time": 8135, "text": "I think there's an evolutionary advantage to being good to other living creatures."}, {"time": 8143, "text": "And so, ultimately, I think that if there's intelligent civilizations out there that prosper sufficiently to be able to travel across the great spans of space, that they've evolved past silly aggression, that it's more likely in my mind to be deeply cooperative."}, {"time": 8168, "text": "So like growth over destruction, like growth does not require destruction, I think."}, {"time": 8176, "text": "But if you see the universe

optimistic, too."}, {"time": 8242, "text": "It might kill us."}, {"time": 8243, "text": "But there's, talking to you offline a little bit, there was a sense that we humans are facing existential

us, pollution."}, {"time": 8288, "text": "Here we're in a pandemic, a meteor."}, {"time": 8292, "text": "So we can use technology, or the thing is, is that we say we use technology, but actually that's not a correct way of putting it, in my opinion."}, {"time": 8304, "text": "So there is a term used by others, coined by somebody I don't know, and I'm sorry to not give credit where credit's due, but it's called technogenesis."}, {"time": 8315, "text": "And it's this idea, Heidegger actually had this idea, but he didn't use that term."}, {"time": 8319, "text": "And it's this idea that we

actually when we engage with technology, we actually engage with it and it engages back with us and we engage with it."}, {"time": 8337, "text": "So it's this coevolution that's happening."}, {"time": 8339, "text": "And in that sense, I think that as we create more autonomous, intelligent AI, it will help us survive because if we coevolve with it, it will need us as much as we need it, is my opinion."}, {"time": 8363, "text": "How that happens or if that bears out to be true, we'll see, but I don't think the idea that we use technology is a correct way to put it."}, {"time": 8374, "text":

don't think it's going to be a Frankenstein."}, {"time": 8401, "text": "I think it's actually going, like a Mary Shelley type idea of technology."}, {"time": 8405, "text": "I think it's actually going to be more Promethean in the sense of, think about it, we create children and then we get old and we rely upon our children to help us, okay?"}, {"time": 8418, "text": "Well, I feel like that about technology."}, {"time": 8420, "text": "We've created, well, we've created it, right?"}, {"time": 8423, "text": "And so it's kind of growing up now."}, {"time": 8428, "text": "Or maybe it's in its teenage years and we'll see."}, {"time": 8434, "text": "What do you think about in terms of this coevolution of the work around brain computer interfaces and maybe Neuralink and Elon seeing Neuralink

already, I mean, not in the specific ways that he is doing it, but I think we are already doing that, okay?"}, {"time": 8497, "text": "And I can give you some examples."}, {"time": 8501, "text": "And there are really trivial examples, but they do make the point and this is one of them."}, {"time": 8505, "text": "So before he started this research on UFOs and UAPs and technology, I actually was looking at the effects of technology and in particular media on religion."}, {"time": 8521, "text": "And what I did was I was lucky to be asked to be a consultant for various movies and one in

thought, wow, this is a great example for me."}, {"time": 8548, "text": "You know, I didn't do it for the money."}, {"time": 8550, "text": "It doesn't pay well, but I did it to learn, right?"},

found was this, I found that as the most interesting part of the creation of this movie was the editing process because it would go through editing and they would use test audiences and a lot of the test audiences would be like, you know, there's like these things where they test their flicker rates and things like that, the eye flicker rates."}, {"time": 8582, "text": "And so, and when it goes really intense, they go to UC Irvine and they do this thing called cognitive consumption, which is basically, or I'm sorry, cognitive consumerism, where they basically hook test audiences up to EKGs

like, darn, they woke me up, eh, might as well read this book by Nietzsche."}, {"time": 9400, "text": "So I picked it up and lo and behold, I turned to a page that was exactly about, it was called

super Catholic and it was a really beautiful little aphorism."}, {"time": 9419, "text": "It's actually a book of aphorisms, which are kind of religious, right?"}, {"time": 9423, "text": "And so it's religious, the genre is religious, let's put it that way, but he's not."}, {"time": 9428, "text": "So basically he says, today's the day when people are supposed to make these resolutions, right?"},

get angry at it."}, {"time": 9445, "text": "And then he also says, I will be like St. January."}, {"time": 9448, "text": "And St. January is actually the saint whose blood is in this place in

now, it flows again."}, {"time": 9467, "text": "And I was like, wow, that's really beautiful."}, {"time": 9468, "text": "And I said, and a strange coincidence because it just turned 12th."}, {"time": 9474, "text": "So it's like New Year's Eve, I pick up the book, I read this aphorism and I said, strange coincidence that."}, {"time": 9480, "text": "And then I turned the page, and the page is about coincidences."}, {"time": 9483, "text": "And I was like, I shut it, and I thought, this is weird."}, {"time": 9487, "text": "And I felt like it was alive, I felt like the book was alive and Nietzsche was speaking to me, right?"}, {"time": 9492, "text": "I had a experience and engagement with Nietzsche."}, {"time": 9495, "text": "And so after that, I couldn't put his stuff down, it was engaging,

Yeah, the idea is basically that truth, he's got awesome one liners."}, {"time": 9515, "text": "So truth is a woman."}, {"time": 9519, "text": "So okay, what does he mean by that?"}, {"time": 9522, "text": "Truth is a woman."}, {"time": 9523, "text": "Basically, she's going to lie to you."}, {"time": 9525, "text": "She looks real attractive, but she's not going to tell you the truth."}, {"time": 9532, "text": "So okay, so basically, I'm not saying that that's true about women."}, {"time": 9536, "text": "I'm obviously a woman."}, {"time": 9538, "text": "So basically what he's saying is that truth is like what I said, Brother Guy said, it's a moving target, okay?"}, {"time": 9546, "text": "We started this whole conversation with what's real, right?"}, {"time": 9549, "text": "So I should have just gone straight to Nietzsche."}, {"time": 9551, "text": "Haven't you heard truth is a woman?"}, {"time": 9553, "text": "Okay, so truth is a woman."}, {"time": 9557, "text": "All right, so that and also, and Foucault, this other philosopher, French philosopher actually takes up this idea and creates his own framework called genealogy from it."}, {"time": 9568, "text": "So the genealogy of morals, so that we only believe certain things and we sediment them into truth."}, {"time": 9575, "text": "So we say a truth told, who said that?"}, {"time": 9578, "text": "Was it Lenin or Stalin?"}, {"time": 9580, "text": "A truth told enough times, I mean, a lie told enough times becomes the truth."}, {"time": 9586, "text": "So that's basically Nietzschean right there, okay?"}, {"time": 9588, "text": "So that's Nietzsche."}, {"time": 9589, "text": "So Nietzsche also is a huge critic of Christianity, which I'm actually Catholic, I'm a practicing Catholic."}, {"time": 9597, "text": "So I appreciated his critique, I thought it was actually quite accurate."}, {"time": 9602, "text": "He's a critique of religion in general and he's fascinating."}, {"time": 9606, "text": "And also I find that he talks about altered states of consciousness and he calls them elevated states."}, {"time": 9614, "text": "And I think through his book, you can actually experience elevated states."}, {"time": 9618, "text": "So yeah, Nietzsche, thumbs up."}, {"time": 9623, "text": "So what other books?"}, {"time": 9625, "text": "So Hannah Rent, she is a philosopher that not a lot of people know about, but she was a Jewish woman during the Holocaust and she was interned at Bergen Belsen, which was basically Auschwitz for women and she escaped."}, {"time": 9642, "text": "She came to the United States and she had worked with Heidegger, even though he's supposed to be anti Semitic and a Nazi and everything, but they were lovers, okay?"}, {"time": 9650, "text": "So she comes out and she's at Columbia University and she teaches philosophy there."}, {"time": 9655, "text": "And she writes two books, which I'll recommend."}, {"time": 9658, "text": "One is called Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she attends the Nuremberg trials."}, {"time": 9663, "text": "And she basically makes this really astute observation about evil."}, {"time": 9667, "text": "And she says, Eichmann is one of the people who sent the Jews to the concentration camps who ran the trains, okay?"}, {"time": 9674, "text": "And she said, the thing about Eichmann was that he didn't seem particularly evil."}, {"time": 9679, "text": "Actually, he seemed to be quite a nice guy."}, {"time": 9683, "text": "She said, what was interesting about him was he seemed incredibly thoughtless and stupid."}, {"time": 9688, "text": "And she said, and he used a lot of stereotypes like memes."}, {"time": 9691, "text": "So she actually wrote about memes before we had them."}, {"time": 9694, "text": "And now people just use memes and they're actually used against us even."}, {"time": 9698, "text": "There's even a segments of warfare called memetic warfare, all right?"}, {"time": 9702, "text": "So memes are something that can sway a whole population of people."}, {"time": 9707, "text": "So she wrote about memes before they were even in existence."}, {"time": 9710, "text": "And that's Eichmann in Jerusalem."}, {"time": 9711, "text": "And I think she also has some really amazing things to say about evil is that when people remain thoughtless, she has another book called The Life of the Mind, which is gigantic."}, {"time": 9722, "text": "And I don't think anybody will read it, but frankly, it's one of the best books I've ever read."}, {"time": 9728, "text": "And I've read it many times."}, {"time": 9729, "text": "And basically, The Life of the Mind, in The Life of the Mind, she asks a very simple question."}, {"time": 9733, "text": "She says, why do people do bad things?"}, {"time": 9735, "text": "Why are they evil?"}, {"time": 9737, "text": "And what she says is she wonders if it's, she says that bad people sleep well at night contrary to, you know how the saying, how do you sleep at night?"}, {"time": 9745, "text": "Well, that's only because you're a good person that you're asking that question because you actually have a conscience and a conscience is this dual kind of, you fight with yourself about the consequences of your actions."}, {"time": 9756, "text": "And she says, bad people don't seem to have a conscience."}, {"time": 9759, "text": "Do they actually sleep well at night?"}, {"time": 9761, "text": "And so she goes through a whole history of philosophy about evil, and that's really a good one too."}, {"time": 9766, "text": "But I also have to recommend this one too."}, {"time": 9769, "text": "There's one more."}, {"time": 9770, "text": "So I know I recommended two, but just from the same philosopher."}, {"time": 9773, "text": "My friend Jeffrey Kreipel, he's at Rice University and he's in my field, religious studies."}, {"time": 9778, "text": "He's written several books."}, {"time": 9779, "text": "I mean, he's written a heck of a lot of books, let's put it that way."}, {"time": 9782, "text": "But I think his best book or the one that impacted me the most is called Authors of the Impossible."}, {"time": 9789, "text": "And his book, his writing is very much like Nietzsche's writing in the sense that he, it's almost as if he reaches out of the pages and he grabs you and he kind of slaps you around and says, think about this, you know, and you can't help but be changed after you've read it."}, {"time": 9807, "text": "Oh, so he covers a bunch of different thinkers and authors that somehow are, what is it?"}, {"time": 9817, "text": "Some aspect of revolutionism aspect."}, {"time": 9819, "text": "They're thinking the impossible."}, {"time": 9822, "text": "There's a great one he's written called Mutants and Mystics, where he talks about the comic strips, the, gosh, why can't I remember the name of the person?"}, {"time": 9832, "text": "He just died, Stan Lee."}, {"time": 9833, "text": "He talks about the history of the comics by Stan Lee and they're all paranormal."}, {"time": 9838, "text": "They all start off super paranormal and it's fascinating."}, {"time": 9843, "text": "On the topic of Hannah Arendt, so I haven't read her work, but I've vaguely touched upon sort of like commentary of her work and it seems like some people think her work is dangerous in some aspect."}, {"time": 9861, "text": "I don't know if you can comment on why that is."}, {"time": 9867, "text": "It feels like similar with Ayn Rand or something like that, where like this is, I should say not dangerous, but controversial."}, {"time": 9875, "text": "Yes, they think it's controversial."}, {"time": 9876, "text": "This is the reason I believe, I've heard of the controversy."}, {"time": 9880, "text": "The controversy is that she didn't, first of all, she is Jewish and she did escape a concentration camp and yet she's called, she's been called anti Jewish."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "And I think part of that was that she basically was saying something that I believe that a lot of normal people are like Eichmann and evil things are done by people who just follow the rules and they don't think about what they're doing."}, {"time": 9912, "text": "And that's one of the most pernicious forms of evil of our time."}, {"time": 9918, "text": "So we talked quite a bit about the definitions of religion and what are the different building blocks of religion."}, {"time": 9961, "text": "So what are your thoughts in the context of religion or maybe in the context of your own mind about the role of death in life or fear of death in life and are you afraid of death?"}, {"time": 9979, "text": "We cover everything in this podcast."}, {"time": 9982, "text": "Every single topic is covered."}, {"time": 9987, "text": "I so happen to have benefited perhaps from living with an older brother who seemingly had no fear of death while growing up and he did everything, okay?"}, {"time": 10002, "text": "So he climbed mountains, he was a rock climber, he jumped out of airplanes."}, {"time": 10009, "text": "Of course, he had to be a Green Beret and go into the special forces where that type of thing is a requirement, right?"}, {"time": 10017,

the death panel."}, {"time": 10042, "text": "It's called the death panel."}, {"time": 10043, "text": "No, it's like it's the panel to think about death in religious studies and I was that for many years."}, {"time": 10052, "text": "So you've thought about it a bit."}, {"time": 10055, "text": "Let's see, I think that people are a little too confident, I think about life in general that they're gonna kind of live all the time and not die."}, {"time": 10063, "text": "I happen to, I mean, I hate to say it, I'm super positive and most people would consider me to be too happy almost, right?"},

10087, "text": "I tend to believe that the fact that this life ends gives each day a significant amount of meaning."}, {"time": 10099, "text": "So I don't know, it seems like an important feature of life."}, {"time": 10103, "text": "It's not like a bug, it seems like a feature that it ends, but it's a strange feature because I wish it, like all the good stuff you wish it wouldn't end."}, {"time": 10112, "text": "Well, you know what's interesting, Lex, and I do point this out to my students because we cover in a lot of the basic studies courses I teach, we cover all religions or as many as we
