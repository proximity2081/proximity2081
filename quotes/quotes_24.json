coded underneath, which it might or might not be just the physical abilities of doing that parkour, that's a very impressive."}, {"time": 272, "text": "So have you met Spot Mini or any of those robots in person?"}, {"time": 276, "text": "Met Spot Mini last year in April at the Mars event that Jeff Bezos organizes."}, {"time": 282, "text": "They brought it out there and it was nicely following around Jeff."}, {"time": 287, "text": "When Jeff left the room, they had it follow him along, which is pretty impressive."}, {"time": 292, "text": "So I think there's some confidence to know that there's no learning going on in those robots."}, {"time": 298, "text": "The psychology of it, so while knowing that, while knowing there's not, if there's any learning going on, it's very limited."}, {"time": 304, "text": "I met Spot Mini earlier this year and knowing everything that's going on, having one on one interaction, so I got to spend some time alone and there's immediately a deep connection on the psychological level."}, {"time": 318, "text": "Even though you know the fundamentals, how it works, there's something magical."}, {"time": 323, "text": "So do you think about the psychology of interacting with robots in the physical world?"}, {"time": 329, "text": "Even you just showed me the PR2, the robot, and there was a little bit something like a face, had a little bit something like a face."}, {"time": 338, "text": "There's something that immediately draws you to it."}, {"time": 340, "text": "Do you think about that aspect of the robotics problem?"}, {"time": 345, "text": "Well, it's very hard with Brad here."}, {"time": 348, "text": "We'll give him a name, Berkeley Robot for the Elimination of Tedious Tasks."}, {"time": 352, "text": "It's very hard to not think of the robot as a person and it seems like everybody calls him a he for whatever reason, but that also makes it more a person than if it was a it, and it seems pretty natural to think of it that way."}, {"time": 367, "text": "This past weekend really struck me."}, {"time": 368, "text": "I've seen Pepper many times on videos, but then I was at an event organized by, this was by Fidelity, and they had scripted Pepper to help moderate some sessions, and they had scripted Pepper to have the personality of a child a little bit, and it was very hard to not think of it as its own person in some sense because it would just jump in the conversation, making it very interactive."}, {"time": 395, "text": "Moderate would be saying, Pepper would just jump in, hold on, how about me?"}, {"time": 400, "text": "Can I participate in this too?"}, {"time": 401, "text": "And you're just like, okay, this is like a person, and that was 100% scripted, and even then it was hard not to have that sense of somehow there is something there."}, {"time": 410, "text": "So as we have robots interact in this physical world, is that a signal that could be used in reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 417, "text": "You've worked a little bit in this direction, but do you think that psychology can be somehow pulled in?"}, {"time": 424, "text": "Yes, that's a question I would say a lot of people ask, and I think part of why they ask it is they're thinking about how unique are we really still as people?"}, {"time": 436, "text": "Like after they see some results, they see a computer play Go, they see a computer do this, that, they're like, okay, but can it really have emotion?"}, {"time": 443, "text": "Can it really interact with us in that way?"}, {"time": 476, "text": "And why wouldn't it then naturally become more and more interactive and more and more maybe like a person or like a pet?"}, {"time": 483, "text": "I don't know what it would exactly be, but more and more have those features and acquire them automatically."}, {"time": 488, "text": "As long as you can formalize an objective of what it means to like something, what, how you exhibit, what's the ground truth?"}, {"time": 496, "text": "How do you get the reward from human?"}, {"time": 499, "text": "Because you have to somehow collect that information within you, human."}, {"time": 502, "text": "But you're saying if you can formulate as an objective, it can be learned."}, {"time": 507, "text": "There's no reason it couldn't emerge through learning, and maybe one way to formulate as an objective, you wouldn't have to necessarily score it explicitly, so standard rewards are numbers, and numbers are hard to come by."}, {"time": 518, "text": "This is a 1.5 or a 1.7 on some scale."}, {"time": 521, "text": "It's very hard to do for a person, but much easier is for a person to say, okay, what you did the last five minutes was much nicer than what you did the previous five minutes, and that now gives a comparison."}, {"time": 533, "text": "And in fact, there have been some results on that."}, {"time": 535, "text": "For example, Paul Christiano and collaborators at OpenAI had the Hopper, Mojoko Hopper, a one legged robot, going through backflips purely from feedback."}, {"time": 545, "text": "I like this better than that."}, {"time": 546, "text": "That's kind of equally good, and after a bunch of interactions, it figured out what it was the person was asking for, namely a backflip."}, {"time": 554, "text": "And so I think the same thing."}, {"time": 555, "text": "Oh, it wasn't trying to do a backflip."}, {"time": 558, "text": "It was just getting a comparison score from the person based on?"}, {"time": 563, "text": "Person having in mind, in their own mind, I wanted to do a backflip, but the robot didn't know what it was supposed to be doing."}, {"time": 570, "text": "It just knew that sometimes the person said, this is better, this is worse, and then the robot figured out what the person was actually after was a backflip."}, {"time": 578, "text": "And I'd imagine the same would be true for things like more interactive robots, that the robot would figure out over time, oh, this kind of thing apparently is appreciated more than this other kind of thing."}, {"time": 590, "text": "So when I first picked up Sutton's, Richard Sutton's reinforcement learning book, before sort of this deep learning, before the reemergence of neural networks as a powerful mechanism for machine learning, RL seemed to me like magic."}, {"time": 608, "text": "It was beautiful."}, {"time": 610, "text": "So that seemed like what intelligence is, RL reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 615, "text": "So how do you think we can possibly learn anything about the world when the reward for the actions is delayed, is so sparse?"}, {"time": 625, "text": "Like where is, why do you think RL works?"}, {"time": 630, "text": "Why do you think you can learn anything under such sparse rewards, whether it's regular reinforcement learning or deep reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 638, "text": "What's your intuition?"}, {"time": 640, "text": "The counterpart of that is why is RL, why does it need so many samples, so many experiences to learn from?"}, {"time": 649, "text": "Because really what's happening is when you have a sparse reward, you do something maybe for like, I don't know, you take 100 actions and then you get a reward."}, {"time": 657, "text": "And maybe you get like a score of three."}, {"time": 659, "text": "And I'm like okay, three, not sure what that means."}, {"time": 663, "text": "You go again and now you get two."}, {"time": 665, "text": "And now you know that that sequence of 100 actions that you did the second time around somehow was worse than the sequence of 100 actions you did the first time around."}, {"time": 671, "text": "But that's tough to now know which one of those were better or worse."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Some might have been good and bad in either one."}, {"time": 677, "text": "And so that's why it needs so many experiences."}, {"time": 679, "text": "But once you have enough experiences, effectively RL is teasing that apart."}, {"time": 683, "text": "It's trying to say okay, what is consistently there when you get a higher reward and what's consistently there when you get a lower reward?"}, {"time": 690, "text": "And then kind of the magic of sometimes the policy gradient update is to say now let's update the neural network to make the actions that were kind of present when things are good more likely and make the actions that are present when things are not as good less likely."}, {"time": 705, "text": "So that is the counterpoint, but it seems like you would need to run it a lot more than you do."}, {"time": 710, "text": "Even though right now people could say that RL is very inefficient, but it seems to be way more efficient than one would imagine on paper."}, {"time": 718, "text": "That the simple updates to the policy, the policy gradient, that somehow you can learn, exactly you just said, what are the common actions that seem to produce some good results?"}, {"time": 729, "text": "That that somehow can learn anything."}, {"time": 732, "text": "It seems counterintuitive at least."}, {"time": 735, "text": "Is there some intuition behind it?"}, {"time": 736, "text": "Yeah, so I think there's a few ways to think about this."}, {"time": 741, "text": "The way I tend to think about it mostly originally, so when we started working on deep reinforcement learning here at Berkeley, which was maybe 2011, 12, 13, around that time, John Schulman was a PhD student initially kind of driving it forward here."}, {"time": 759, "text": "And the way we thought about it at the time was if you think about rectified linear units or kind of rectifier type neural networks, what do you get?"}, {"time": 771, "text": "You get something that's piecewise linear feedback control."}, {"time": 775, "text": "And if you look at the literature, linear feedback control is extremely successful, can solve many, many problems surprisingly well."}, {"time": 783, "text": "I remember, for example, when we did helicopter flight, if you're in a stationary flight regime, not a non stationary, but a stationary flight regime like hover, you can use linear feedback control to stabilize a helicopter, very complex dynamical system, but the controller is relatively simple."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And so I think that's a big part of it is that if you do feedback control, even though the system you control can be very, very complex, often relatively simple control architectures can already do a lot."}, {"time": 810, "text": "But then also just linear is not good enough."}, {"time": 812, "text": "And so one way you can think of these neural networks is that sometimes they tile the space, which people were already trying to do more by hand or with finite state machines, say this linear controller here, this linear controller here."}, {"time": 823, "text": "Neural network learns to tile the space and say linear controller here, another linear controller here, but it's more subtle than that."}, {"time": 830, "text": "And so it's benefiting from this linear control aspect, it's benefiting from the tiling, but it's somehow tiling it one dimension at a time."}, {"time": 837, "text": "Because if let's say you have a two layer network, if in that hidden layer, you make a transition from active to inactive or the other way around, that is essentially one axis, but not axis aligned, but one direction that you change."}, {"time": 852, "text": "And so you have this kind of very gradual tiling of the space where you have a lot of sharing between the linear controllers that tile the space."}, {"time": 859, "text": "And that was always my intuition as to why to expect that this might work pretty well."}, {"time": 864, "text": "It's essentially leveraging the fact that linear feedback control is so good, but of course not enough."}, {"time": 869, "text": "And this is a gradual tiling of the space with linear feedback controls that share a lot of expertise across them."}, {"time": 876, "text": "So that's really nice intuition, but do you think that scales to the more and more general problems of when you start going up the number of dimensions when you start going down in terms of how often you get a clean reward signal?"}, {"time": 895, "text": "Does that intuition carry forward to those crazier, weirder worlds that we think of as the real world?"}, {"time": 903, "text": "So I think where things get really tricky in the real world compared to the things we've looked at so far with great success in reinforcement learning is the time scales, which takes us to an extreme."}, {"time": 918, "text": "So when you think about the real world, I mean, I don't know, maybe some student decided to do a PhD here, right?"}, {"time": 926, "text": "Okay, that's a decision."}, {"time": 928, "text": "That's a very high level decision."}, {"time": 930, "text": "But if you think about their lives, I mean, any person's life, it's a sequence of muscle fiber contractions and relaxations, and that's how you interact with the world."}, {"time": 940, "text": "And that's a very high frequency control thing, but it's ultimately what you do and how you affect the world, until I guess we have brain readings and you can maybe do it slightly differently."}, {"time": 949, "text": "But typically that's how you affect the world."}, {"time": 952, "text": "And the decision of doing a PhD is so abstract relative to what you're actually doing in the world."}, {"time": 959, "text": "And I think that's where credit assignment becomes just completely beyond what any current RL algorithm can do."}, {"time": 966, "text": "And we need hierarchical reasoning at a level that is just not available at all yet."}, {"time": 972, "text": "Where do you think we can pick up hierarchical reasoning?"}, {"time": 974, "text": "By which mechanisms?"}, {"time": 976, "text": "Yeah, so maybe let me highlight what I think the limitations are of what already was done 20, 30 years ago."}, {"time": 986, "text": "In fact, you'll find reasoning systems that reason over relatively long horizons, but the problem is that they were not grounded in the real world."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So people would have to hand design some kind of logical, dynamical descriptions of the world and that didn't tie into perception."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "And so it didn't tie into real objects and so forth."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "And so that was a big gap."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "Now with deep learning, we start having the ability to really see with sensors, process that and understand what's in the world."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "And so it's a good time to try to bring these things together."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "I see a few ways of getting there."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "One way to get there would be to say deep learning can get bolted on somehow to some of these more traditional approaches."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "Now bolted on would probably mean you need to do some kind of end to end training where you say my deep learning processing somehow leads to a representation that in term uses some kind of traditional underlying dynamical systems that can be used for planning."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "And that's, for example, the direction Aviv Tamar and Thanard Kuretach here have been pushing with causal info again and of course other people too."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "That's one way."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "Can we somehow force it into the form factor that is amenable to reasoning?"}, {"time": 1063, "text": "Another direction we've been thinking about for a long time and didn't make any progress on was more information theoretic approaches."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So the idea there was that what it means to take high level action is to take and choose a latent variable now that tells you a lot about what's gonna be the case in the future."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Because that's what it means to take a high level action."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "I say okay, I decide I'm gonna navigate to the gas station because I need to get gas for my car."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "Well, that'll now take five minutes to get there."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "But the fact that I get there, I could already tell that from the high level action I took much earlier."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "That we had a very hard time getting success with."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "Not saying it's a dead end necessarily, but we had a lot of trouble getting that to work."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "And then we started revisiting the notion of what are we really trying to achieve?"}, {"time": 1117, "text": "What we're trying to achieve is not necessarily hierarchy per se, but you could think about what does hierarchy give us?"}, {"time": 1124, "text": "What we hope it would give us is better credit assignment."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "What is better credit assignment?"}, {"time": 1131, "text": "It's giving us, it gives us faster learning, right?"}, {"time": 1135, "text": "And so faster learning is ultimately maybe what we're after."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "And so that's where we ended up with the RL squared paper on learning to reinforcement learn, which at a time Rocky Dwan led."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "And that's exactly the meta learning approach where you say, okay, we don't know how to design hierarchy."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "We know what we want to get from it."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "Let's just enter and optimize for what we want to get from it and see if it might emerge."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "And we saw things emerge."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "The maze navigation had consistent motion down hallways, which is what you want."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "A hierarchical control should say, I want to go down this hallway."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "And then when there is an option to take a turn, I can decide whether to take a turn or not and repeat."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Even had the notion of where have you been before or not to not revisit places you've been before."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "It still didn't scale yet to the real world kind of scenarios I think you had in mind, but it was some sign of life that maybe you can meta learn these hierarchical concepts."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "I mean, it seems like through these meta learning concepts, get at the, what I think is one of the hardest and most important problems of AI, which is transfer learning."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So it's generalization."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "How far along this journey towards building general systems are we?"}, {"time": 1211, "text": "Being able to do transfer learning well."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "So there's some signs that you can generalize a little bit, but do you think we're on the right path or it's totally different breakthroughs are needed to be able to transfer knowledge between different learned models?"}, {"time": 1231, "text": "Yeah, I'm pretty torn on this in that I think there are some very impressive."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Well, there's just some very impressive results already."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "I mean, I would say when, even with the initial kind of big breakthrough in 2012 with AlexNet, the initial thing is okay, great."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "This does better on ImageNet, hence image recognition."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "But then immediately thereafter, there was of course the notion that, wow, what was learned on ImageNet and you now wanna solve a new task, you can fine tune AlexNet for new tasks."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "And that was often found to be the even bigger deal that you learn something that was reusable, which was not often the case before."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "Usually machine learning, you learn something for one scenario and that was it."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "And that's really exciting."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "I mean, that's a huge application."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "That's probably the biggest success of transfer learning today in terms of scope and impact."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "That was a huge breakthrough."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "And then recently, I feel like similar kind of, by scaling things up, it seems like this has been expanded upon."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Like people training even bigger networks, they might transfer even better."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "If you looked at, for example, some of the OpenAI results on language models and some of the recent Google results on language models, they're learned for just prediction and then they get reused for other tasks."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "And so I think there is something there where somehow if you train a big enough model on enough things, it seems to transfer some deep mind results that I thought were very impressive, the Unreal results, where it was learned to navigate mazes in ways where it wasn't just doing reinforcement learning, but it had other objectives it was optimizing for."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "So I think there's a lot of interesting results already."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "I think maybe where it's hard to wrap my head around this, to which extent or when do we call something generalization?"}, {"time": 1346, "text": "Or the levels of generalization in the real world, or the levels of generalization involved in these different tasks, right?"}, {"time": 1356, "text": "You draw this, by the way, just to frame things."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "I've heard you say somewhere, it's the difference between learning to master versus learning to generalize, that it's a nice line to think about."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "And I guess you're saying that it's a gray area of what learning to master and learning to generalize, where one starts."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "I think I might have heard this."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "I might have heard it somewhere else."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And I think it might've been one of your interviews, maybe the one with Yoshua Benjamin, I'm not 100% sure."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "But I liked the example, I'm not sure who it was, but the example was essentially, if you use current deep learning techniques, what we're doing to predict, let's say, the relative motion of our planets, it would do pretty well."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "But then now if a massive new mass enters our solar system, it would probably not predict what will happen, right?"}, {"time": 1412, "text": "And that's a different kind of generalization."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "That's a generalization that relies on the ultimate simplest, simplest explanation that we have available today to explain the motion of planets, whereas just pattern recognition could predict our current solar system motion pretty well, no problem."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "And so I think that's an example of a kind of generalization that is a little different from what we've achieved so far."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "And it's not clear if just regularizing more and forcing it to come up with a simpler, simpler, simpler explanation and say, look, this is not simple."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "But that's what physics researchers do, right?"}, {"time": 1445, "text": "They say, can I make this even simpler?"}, {"time": 1448, "text": "How simple can I get this?"}, {"time": 1449, "text": "What's the simplest equation that can explain everything?"}, {"time": 1452, "text": "The master equation for the entire dynamics of the universe, we haven't really pushed that direction as hard in deep learning, I would say."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "Not sure if it should be pushed, but it seems a kind of generalization you get from that that you don't get in our current methods so far."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "So I just talked to Vladimir Vapnik, for example, who's a statistician of statistical learning, and he kind of dreams of creating the E equals MC squared for learning, right?"}, {"time": 1481, "text": "The general theory of learning."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "Do you think that's a fruitless pursuit in the near term, within the next several decades?"}, {"time": 1491, "text": "I think that's a really interesting pursuit in the following sense, in that there is a lot of evidence that the brain is pretty modular."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "And so I wouldn't maybe think of it as the theory, maybe the underlying theory, but more kind of the principle where there have been findings where people who are blind will use the part of the brain usually used for vision for other functions."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "And even after some kind of, if people get rewired in some way, they might be able to reuse parts of their brain for other functions."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "And so what that suggests is some kind of modularity."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And I think it is a pretty natural thing to strive for to see, can we find that modularity?"}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Can we find this thing?"}, {"time": 1543, "text": "Of course, every part of the brain is not exactly the same."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "Not everything can be rewired arbitrarily."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "But if you think of things like the neocortex, which is a pretty big part of the brain, that seems fairly modular from what the findings so far."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "Can you design something equally modular?"}, {"time": 1559, "text": "And if you can just grow it, it becomes more capable probably."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "I think that would be the kind of interesting underlying principle to shoot for that is not unrealistic."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "Do you think you prefer math or empirical trial and error for the discovery of the essence of what it means to do something intelligent?"}, {"time": 1579, "text": "So reinforcement learning embodies both groups, right?"}, {"time": 1582, "text": "To prove that something converges, prove the bounds."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "And then at the same time, a lot of those successes are, well, let's try this and see if it works."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "So which do you gravitate towards?"}, {"time": 1593, "text": "How do you think of those two parts of your brain?"}, {"time": 1599, "text": "Maybe I would prefer we could make the progress with mathematics."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And the reason maybe I would prefer that is because often if you have something you can mathematically formalize, you can leapfrog a lot of experimentation."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "And experimentation takes a long time to get through."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "And a lot of trial and error, kind of reinforcement learning, your research process, but you need to do a lot of trial and error before you get to a success."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "So if you can leapfrog that, to my mind, that's what the math is about."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "And hopefully once you do a bunch of experiments, you start seeing a pattern."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "You can do some derivations that leapfrog some experiments."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "But I agree with you."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "I mean, in practice, a lot of the progress has been such that we have not been able to find the math that allows you to leapfrog ahead."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "And we are kind of making gradual progress one step at a time, a new experiment here, a new experiment there that gives us new insights and gradually building up, but not getting to something yet where we're just, okay, here's an equation that now explains how, you know, that would be, have been two years of experimentation to get there, but this tells us what the result's going to be."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "Unfortunately, not so much yet."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "Not so much yet, but your hope is there."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "In trying to teach robots or systems to do everyday tasks or even in

you?"}, {"time": 1701, "text": "What's more promising you think as a research direction?"}, {"time": 1704, "text": "So when we look at self play, what's so beautiful about it is goes back to kind of the challenges in reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "So the challenge of reinforcement learning is getting signal."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "And if you don't never succeed, you don't get any signal."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "In self play, you're on both sides."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "So one of you succeeds."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "And the beauty is also one of you fails."},

yourself, you get signal."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And so whenever you can turn something into self play, you're in a beautiful situation where you can naturally learn much more quickly than in most other reinforcement learning environments."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "So I think if somehow we can turn more reinforcement learning problems into self play formulations, that would go really, really far."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "So far, self play has been largely around games where there is natural opponents."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "But if we could do self play for other things, and let's say, I don't know, a robot learns to build a house."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "I mean, that's a pretty advanced thing to try to do for a robot, but maybe it tries to build a hut or something."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "If that can be done through self play, it would learn a lot more quickly if somebody can figure that out."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "And I think that would be something where it goes closer to kind of the mathematical leapfrogging where somebody figures out a formalism to say, okay, any RL problem by playing this and this idea, you can turn it into a self play problem where you get signal a lot more easily."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "Reality is, many problems we don't know how to turn into self play."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "And so either we need to provide

year."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "This was led by Chelsea Finn here."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "It's almost like learning a machine translation for demonstrations, where you have a human demonstration,

approach of third person watching, the autonomous driving is amenable to this kind of approach?"}, {"time": 1893, "text": "So for autonomous driving, I would say third person is slightly easier."},

autonomous driving."}, {"time": 1921, "text": "They're very similar."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "Because the distinction is really about who turns the steering wheel."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "Or

versus RL."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "So imitation gives you a lot more signal."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "I think where imitation is lacking and needs some extra machinery is, it doesn't, in its normal format, doesn't think about goals or objectives."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "And of course, there are versions of imitation learning and versus reinforcement learning type imitation learning

well."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "If it really doesn't have a notion of objectives to generalize well to the kind of general that you would want."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "You'd want more than just that reactivity that you get from just behavioral cloning slash supervised learning."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "So a lot of the work, whether it's self play or even imitation learning, would benefit

could satisfy me that something has multiple steps that are each parameterized separately."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "I think of gradient descent as being all about that other piece, the how do you actually update the parameters piece?"}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So you could imagine having a deep model like a convolutional net and training it with something like evolution or a genetic algorithm."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "And I would say that still qualifies as deep learning."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "And then in terms of models that aren't necessarily differentiable, I guess Bolton machines are probably the main example of something where you can't really take a derivative and use that for the learning process."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "But you can still argue that the model has many steps of processing that it applies when you run inference in the model."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "So it's the steps of processing that's key."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "So Jeff Hinton

training neural networks look like?"}, {"time": 1250, "text": "I don't know that back propagation is gonna go away entirely."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Most of the time when we decide that a machine learning algorithm isn't on the critical path to research for improving AI, the algorithm doesn't die."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "It just becomes used for some specialized set of things."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "A lot of algorithms like logistic regression don't seem that exciting to AI researchers who are working on things like speech recognition or autonomous cars today."}, {"time": 1278,

human AI."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "Are you optimistic about us discovering back propagation has been around for a few decades?"}, {"time": 1310, "text": "So are you optimistic about us as a

"You could imagine things like having stacks of models where some of the lower level models predict parameters of the higher level models."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "And so at the top level, you're not learning in terms of literally calculating gradients, but just predicting how different values will perform."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "You can kind of see that already in some areas like Bayesian optimization, where you have a Gaussian process that predicts how well different parameter values will perform."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "We already use those kinds of algorithms for things like hyper parameter optimization."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "And in general, we know a lot of things other than back prop that work really well for specific problems."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "The main thing we haven't found is a way of taking one of these other non back prop based algorithms and having it really advanced the state of the art on an AI level problem."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "But I wouldn't be surprised if eventually we find that some of these algorithms that even the ones that already exist, not even necessarily new one, we might find some way of customizing one of these

better."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "But there's a lot of expert input required and it's very limited in that sense."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "Do you ever look back to that as something that we'll have to return to eventually?"}, {"time": 1476, "text": "Sort of dust off the book from the shelf and think about how we build knowledge, representation, knowledge base."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "Like will we have to use graph searches?"}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Graph searches, right."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And like first order logic and entailment and things like that."}, {"time": 1488,

like that."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "It's a differentiable knowledge base of sorts."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "If we had a really easy way of giving feedback to machine learning models, that would clearly help a lot with generative models."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "And so you could imagine one way of getting there would be get a lot better at natural language processing."}, {"time": 1536,

a lot of data would be a really useful feature."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "I could see a lot of ways of getting there without bringing back some of the 1980s technology, but I also see some ways that you could imagine extending the 1980s technology to play nice with neural nets and have it help get there."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So you talked about the story of you coming up with the idea of GANs at a bar with some friends."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "You were arguing that this, you know, GANs would work, generative adversarial networks, and the others didn't think so."}, {"time": 1614,

really nice idea, but I'm very skeptical that it would work."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "What was the basis of their skepticism?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "What was the basis of your intuition why it should work?"}, {"time": 1634, "text": "I don't want to be someone who goes around promoting alcohol for the purposes of science, but in this case, I do actually think that drinking helped a little bit."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "When your inhibitions are lowered, you're more willing to try out things that you wouldn't try out otherwise."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "So I have noticed in general that I'm less prone to shooting down some of my own ideas when I have had a little bit to drink."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "I think if I had had that idea at lunchtime, I probably would have thought, it's hard enough to train one neural net, you can't train a second neural net in the inner loop of the outer neural net."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "That was basically my friend's objection, was that trying to train two neural nets at the same time would be too hard."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "So it was more about the training process, unless, so my skepticism would be, you know, I'm sure you could train it, but the thing it would converge to would not be able to generate anything reasonable, any kind of reasonable realism."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "Yeah, so part of what all of us were thinking about when we had this conversation was deep Bolton machines, which a lot of us in the lab, including me, were a big fan of deep Bolton machines at the time."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "They involved two separate processes running at the same time."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "One of them is called the positive phase, where you load data into the model and tell the model to make the data more likely."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "The other one is called the negative phase, where you draw samples from the model and tell the model to make those samples less likely."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "In a deep Bolton machine, it's not trivial to generate a sample."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "You have to actually run an iterative process that gets better and better samples coming closer and closer to the distribution the model represents."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So during the training process, you're always running these two systems at the same time, one that's updating the parameters of the model and another one that's trying to generate samples from the model."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "And they worked really well in things like MNIST, but a lot of us in the lab, including me, had tried to get deep Bolton machines to scale past MNIST to things like generating color photos, and we just couldn't get the two processes to stay synchronized."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "So when I had the idea for GANs, a lot of people thought that the discriminator would have more or less the same problem as the negative phase in the Bolton machine, that trying to train the discriminator in the inner loop, you just couldn't get it to keep up with the generator in the outer loop, and that would prevent it from converging to anything useful."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "Yeah, I share that intuition."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "But turns out to not be the case."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "A lot of the time with machine learning algorithms, it's really hard to predict ahead of time how well they'll actually perform."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "You have to just run the experiment and see what happens."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "And I would say I still today don't have like one factor I can put my finger on and say, this is why GANs worked for photo generation and deep Bolton machines don't."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "There are a lot of theory papers showing that under some theoretical settings, the GAN algorithm does actually converge, but those settings are restricted enough that they don't necessarily explain the whole picture in terms of all the results that we see in practice."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "So taking a step back, can you, in the same way as we talked about deep learning, can you tell me what generative adversarial networks are?"}, {"time": 1829, "text": "Yeah, so generative adversarial networks are a particular kind of generative model."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "A generative model is a machine learning model that can train on some set of data."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Like, so you have a collection of photos of cats and you want to generate more photos of cats, or you want to estimate a probability distribution over cats."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "So you can ask how likely it is that some new image is a photo of a cat."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "GANs are one way of doing this."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Some generative models are good at creating new data."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "Other generative models are good at estimating that density function and telling you how likely particular pieces of data are to come from the same distribution as the training data."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "GANs are more focused on generating samples rather than estimating the density function."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "There are some kinds of GANs like FlowGAN that can do both, but mostly GANs are about generating samples, generating new photos of cats that look realistic."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And they do that completely from scratch."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "It's analogous to human imagination."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "When a GAN creates a new image of a cat, it's using a neural network to produce a cat that has not existed before."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "It isn't doing something like compositing photos together."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "You're not literally taking the eye off of one cat and the ear off of another cat."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "It's more of this digestive process where the neural net trains in a lot of data and comes up with some representation of the probability distribution and generates entirely new cats."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "There are a lot of different ways of building a generative model."}, {"time": 1921, "text": "What's specific to GANs is that we have a two player game in the game theoretic sense."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And as the players in this game compete, one of them becomes able to generate realistic data."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "The first player is called the generator."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "It produces output data such as just images, for example."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And at the start of the learning process, it'll just produce completely random images."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "The other player is called the discriminator."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "The discriminator takes images as input and guesses whether they're real or fake."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "You train it both on real data, so photos that come from your training set, actual photos of cats, and you train it to say that those are real."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "You also train it on images that come from the generator network and you train it to say that those are fake."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "As the two players compete in this game, the discriminator tries to become better at recognizing whether images are real or fake."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "And the generator becomes better at fooling the discriminator into thinking that its outputs are real."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "And you can analyze this through the language of game theory and find that there's a Nash equilibrium where the generator has captured the correct probability distribution."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "So in the cat example, it makes perfectly realistic cat photos."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "And the discriminator is unable to do better than random guessing because all the samples coming from both the data and the generator look equally likely to have come from either source."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "So do you ever sit back and does it just blow your mind that this thing works?"}, {"time": 2011, "text": "So from very, so it's able to estimate that density function enough to generate realistic images."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "I mean, does it, yeah."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "Do you ever sit back and think how does this even, why, this is quite incredible, especially where GANs have gone in terms of realism."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "Yeah, and not just to flatter my own work, but generative models, all of them have this property that if they really did what we ask them to do, they would do nothing but memorize the training data."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "Models that are based on maximizing the likelihood, the way that you obtain the maximum likelihood for a specific training set is you assign all of your probability mass to the training examples and nowhere else."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "For GANs, the game is played using a training set."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "So the way that you become unbeatable in the game is you literally memorize training examples."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "One of my former interns wrote a paper, his name is Vaishnav Nagarajan, and he showed that it's actually hard for the generator to memorize the training data, hard in a statistical learning theory sense, that you can actually create reasons for why it would require quite a lot of learning steps and a lot of observations of different latent variables before you could memorize the training data."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "That still doesn't really explain why when you produce samples that are new, why do you get compelling images rather than just garbage that's different from the training set."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "And I don't think we really have a good answer for that, especially if you think about how many possible images are out there and how few images the generative model sees during training."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "It seems just unreasonable that generative models create new images as well as they do, especially considering that we're basically training them to memorize rather than generalize."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "I think part of the answer is there's a paper called Deep Image Prior where they show that you can take a convolutional net and you don't even need to learn the parameters of it at all, you just use the model architecture."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And it's already useful for things like inpainting images."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "I think that shows us that the convolutional network architecture captures something really important about the structure of images."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And we don't need to actually use the learning to capture all the information coming out of the convolutional net."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "That would imply that it would be much harder to make generative models in other domains."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So far, we're able to make reasonable speech models and things like that."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "But to be honest, we haven't actually explored a whole lot of different data sets all that much."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "We don't, for example, see a lot of deep learning models of like biology data sets where you have lots of microarrays measuring the amount of different enzymes and things like that."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "So we may find that some of the progress that we've seen for images and speech turns out to really rely heavily on the model architecture."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "And we were able to do what we did for vision by trying to reverse engineer the human visual system."}, {"time": 2195, "text": "And maybe it'll turn out that we can't just use that same trick for arbitrary kinds of data."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "Right, so there's aspect to the human vision system, the hardware of it, that makes it without learning, without cognition, just makes it really effective at detecting the patterns we see in the visual world."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "Yeah, that's really interesting."}, {"time": 2217, "text": "What, in a big, quick overview, in your view, what types of GANs are there and what other generative models besides GANs are there?"}, {"time": 2229, "text": "Yeah, so it's maybe a little bit easier to start with what kinds of generative models are there other than GANs."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "So most generative models are likelihood based where to train them, you have a model that tells you how much probability it assigns to a particular example and you just maximize the probability assigned to all the training examples."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "It turns out that it's hard to design a model that can create really complicated images or really complicated audio waveforms and still have it be possible to estimate the likelihood function from a computational point of view."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "Most interesting models that you would just write down intuitively, it turns out that it's almost impossible to calculate the amount of probability they assign to a particular point."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "So there's a few different schools of generative models in the likelihood family."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "One approach is to very carefully design the model so that it is computationally tractable to measure the density it assigns to a particular point."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "So there are things like autoregressive models, like PixelCNN, those basically break down the probability distribution into a product over every single feature."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "So for an image, you estimate the probability of each pixel given all of the pixels that came before it."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "There's tricks where if you want to measure the density function, you can actually calculate the density for all these pixels more or less in parallel."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "Generating the image still tends to require you to go one pixel at a time, and that can be very slow."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "But there are, again, tricks for doing this in a hierarchical pattern where you can keep the runtime under control."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "Are the quality of the images it generates, putting runtime aside, pretty good?"}, {"time": 2342, "text": "They're reasonable, yeah."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "I would say a lot of the best results are from GANs these days, but it can be hard to tell how much of that is based on who's studying which type of algorithm, if that makes sense."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "The amount of effort invested in a particular."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "Yeah, or like the kind of expertise."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "So a lot of people who've traditionally been excited about graphics or art and things like that have gotten interested in GANs."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "And to some extent, it's hard to tell are GANs doing better because they have a lot of graphics and art experts behind them, or are GANs doing better because they're more computationally efficient, or are GANs doing better because they prioritize the realism of samples over the accuracy of the density function."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "I think all of those are potentially valid explanations, and it's hard to tell."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So can you give a brief history of GANs from 2014?"}, {"time": 2397, "text": "Were you paper 13?"}, {"time": 2399, "text": "Yeah, so a few highlights."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "In the first paper, we just showed that GANs basically work."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "If you look back at the samples we had now, they look terrible."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "On the CIFAR 10 data set, you can't even recognize objects in them."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "Your paper, sorry, you used CIFAR 10?"}, {"time": 2415, "text": "We used MNIST, which is little handwritten digits."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "We used the Toronto Face database, which is small grayscale photos of faces."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "We did have recognizable faces."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "My colleague Bing Xu put together the first GAN face model for that paper."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "We also had the CIFAR 10 data set, which is things like very small 32 by 32 pixels of cars and cats and dogs."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "For that, we didn't get recognizable objects, but all the deep learning people back then were really used to looking at these failed samples and kind of reading them like tea leaves."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "And people who are used to reading the tea leaves recognize that our tea leaves at least look different."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "Maybe not necessarily better, but there was something unusual about them."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "And that got a lot of us excited."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "One of the next really big steps was LAPGAN by Emily Denton and Sumit Chintala at Facebook AI Research, where they actually got really good high resolution photos working with GANs for the first time."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "They had a complicated system where they generated the image starting at low res and then scaling up to high res, but they were able to get it to work."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "And then in 2015, I believe later that same year, Alec Radford and Sumit Chintala and Luke Metz published the DCGAN paper, which it stands for deep convolutional GAN."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "It's kind of a non unique name because these days basically all GANs and even some before that were deep and convolutional, but they just kind of picked a name for a really great recipe where they were able to actually using only one model instead of a multi step process, actually generate realistic images of faces and things like that."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "That was sort of like the beginning of the Cambrian explosion of GANs."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "Like once you had animals that had a backbone, you suddenly got lots of different versions of fish and four legged animals and things like that."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "So DCGAN became kind of the backbone for many different models that came out."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "It's used as a baseline even still."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "And so from there, I would say some interesting things we've seen are there's a lot you can say about how just the quality of standard image generation GANs has increased, but what's also maybe more interesting on an intellectual level is how the things you can use GANs for has also changed."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "One thing is that you can use them to learn classifiers without having to have class labels for every example in your training set."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "So that's called semi supervised learning."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "My colleague at OpenAI, Tim Solomons, who's at Brain now, wrote a paper called Improve Techniques for Training GANs."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "I'm a coauthor on this paper, but I can't claim any credit for this particular part."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "One thing he showed in the paper is that you can take the GAN discriminator and use it as a classifier that actually tells you, this image is a cat, this image is a dog, this image is a car, this image is a truck, and so on."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "Not just to say whether the image is real or fake, but if it is real to say specifically what kind of object it is."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "And he found that you can train these classifiers with far fewer labeled examples than traditional classifiers."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "So if you supervise based on also not just your discrimination ability, but your ability to classify, you're going to do much, you're going to converge much faster to being effective at being a discriminator."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "So for example, for the MNIST dataset, you want to look at an image of a handwritten digit and say whether it's a zero, a one, or a two, and so on."},

was able to get below 1% error using only 100 labeled examples."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "So that was about a 600X decrease in the amount of labels that he needed."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "He's still using more images than that, but he doesn't need to have each of them labeled as this one's a one, this one's a two, this one's a zero, and so on."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Then to be able to, for GANs to be able to generate recognizable objects, so objects from a particular class, you still need labeled data because you need to know what it means to be a particular class cat, dog."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "How do you think we can move away from that?"}, {"time": 2684, "text": "Yeah, some researchers at Brain Zurich actually just released a really great paper on semi supervised GANs where their goal isn't to classify, it's to make recognizable objects despite not having a lot of labeled data."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "They were working off of DeepMind's BigGAN project and they showed that they can match the performance of BigGAN using only 10%, I believe, of the labels."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "BigGAN was trained on the ImageNet data set, which is about 1.2 million images and had all of them labeled."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "This latest project from Brain Zurich shows that they're able to get away with only having about 10% of the images labeled."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "If you train a GAN with no class labels, you tend to get things that look sort of like grass or water or brick or dirt, but without necessarily a lot going on in them."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "And I think that's partly because if you look at a large ImageNet image, the object doesn't necessarily occupy the whole image."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "And so you learn to create realistic sets of pixels, but you don't necessarily learn that the object is the star of the show and you want it to be in every image you make."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Yeah, I've heard you talk about the horse, the zebra cycle GAN mapping and how it turns out, again, thought provoking that horses are usually on grass and zebras are usually on drier terrain."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "So when you're doing that kind of generation, you're going to end up generating greener horses or whatever, so those are connected together."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "It's not just, you're not able to segment, be able to generate in a segment away."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "So are there other types of games you come across in your mind that neural networks can play with each other to be able to solve problems?"}, {"time": 2824, "text": "Yeah, the one that I spend most of my time on is in security."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "You can model most interactions as a game where there's attackers trying to break your system and you're the defender trying to build a resilient system."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "There's also domain adversarial learning, which is an approach to domain adaptation that looks really a lot like GANs."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "The authors had the idea before the GAN paper came out, their paper came out a little bit later and they're very nice and cited the GAN paper, but I know that they actually had the idea before it came out."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "Domain adaptation is when you want to train a machine learning model in one setting called a domain and then deploy it in another domain later."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "And you would like it to perform well in the new domain, even though the new domain is different from how it was trained."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "So for example, you might want to train on a really clean image data set like ImageNet, but then deploy on users phones where the user is taking pictures in the dark and pictures while moving quickly and just pictures that aren't really centered or composed all that well."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "When you take a normal machine learning model, it often degrades really badly when you move to the new domain because it looks so different from what the model was trained on."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "Domain adaptation algorithms try to smooth out that gap and the domain adversarial approach is based on training a feature extractor where the features have the same statistics regardless of which domain you extracted them on."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "So in the domain adversarial game, you have one player that's a feature extractor and another player that's a domain recognizer."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "The domain recognizer wants to look at the output of the feature extractor and guess which of the two domains the features came from."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So it's a lot like the real versus fake discriminator in GANs and then the feature extractor, you can think of as loosely analogous to the generator in GANs, except what it's trying to do here is both fool the domain recognizer into not knowing which domain the data came from and also extract features that are good for classification."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "So at the end of the day, in the cases where it works out, you can actually get features that work about the same in both domains."}, {"time": 2960, "text": "Sometimes this has a drawback where in order to make things work the same in both domains, it just gets worse at the first one."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "But there are a lot of cases where it actually works out well on both."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "So do you think of GANs being useful in the context of data augmentation?"}, {"time": 2975, "text": "Yeah, one thing you could hope for with GANs is you could imagine I've got a limited training set and I'd like to make more training data to train something else like a classifier."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "You could train the GAN on the training set and then create more data and then maybe the classifier would perform better on the test set after training on this bigger GAN generated data set."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "So that's the simplest version of something you might hope would work."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "I've never heard of that particular approach working, but I think there's some closely related things that I think could work in the future and some that actually already have worked."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "So if we think a little bit about what we'd be hoping for if we use the GAN to make more training data, we're hoping that the GAN will generalize to new examples better than the classifier would have generalized if it was trained on the same data."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "And I don't know of any reason to believe that the GAN would generalize better than the classifier would, but what we might hope for is that the GAN could generalize differently from a specific classifier."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "So one thing I think is worth trying that I haven't personally tried but someone could try is what if you trained a whole lot of different generative models on the same training set, create samples from all of them and then train a classifier on that?"}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Because each of the generative models might generalize in a slightly different way."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "They might capture many different axes of variation that one individual model wouldn't and then the classifier can capture all of those ideas by training in all of their data."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "So it'd be a little bit like making an ensemble of classifiers."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "And I think that... Ensemble of GANs in a way."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "I think that could generalize better."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "The other thing that GANs are really good for is not necessarily generating new data that's exactly like what you already have, but by generating new data that has different properties from the data you already had."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "One thing that you can do is you can create differentially private data."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "So suppose that you have something like medical records and you don't want to train a classifier on the medical records and then publish the classifier because someone might be able to reverse engineer some of the medical records you trained on."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "There's a paper from Casey Green's lab that shows how you can train a GAN using differential privacy."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "And then the samples from the GAN still have the same differential privacy guarantees as the parameters of the GAN."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "So you can make fake patient data for other researchers to use."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "And they can do almost anything they want with that data because it doesn't come from real people."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "And the differential privacy mechanism gives you clear guarantees on how much the original people's data has been protected."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "That's really interesting, actually."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "I haven't heard you talk about that before."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "In terms of fairness, I've seen from AAAI, your talk, how can adversarial machine learning help models be more fair with respect to sensitive variables?"}, {"time": 3145, "text": "Yeah, so there's a paper from Amos Starkey's lab about how to learn machine learning models that are incapable of using specific variables."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "So say, for example, you wanted to make predictions that are not affected by gender."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "It isn't enough to just leave gender out of the input to the model."}, {"time": 3162, "text": "You can often infer gender from a lot of other characteristics."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "Like say that you have the person's name, but you're not told their gender."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "Well, if their name is Ian, they're kind of obviously a man."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "So what you'd like to do is make a machine learning model that can still take in a lot of different attributes and make a really accurate informed prediction, but be confident that it isn't reverse engineering gender or another sensitive variable internally."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "You can do that using something very similar to the domain adversarial approach, where you have one player that's a feature extractor and another player that's a feature analyzer."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "And you want to make sure that the feature analyzer is not able to guess the value of the sensitive variable that you're trying to keep private."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "Right, that's, yeah, I love this approach."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "So yeah, with the feature, you're not able to infer the sensitive variables."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Brilliant, that's quite brilliant and simple actually."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "Another way I think that GANs in particular could be used for fairness would be to make something like a CycleGAN, where you can take data from one domain and convert it into another."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "We've seen CycleGAN turning horses into zebras."}, {"time": 3233, "text": "We've seen other unsupervised GANs made by Mingyu Liu doing things like turning day photos into night photos."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "I think for fairness, you could imagine taking records for people in one group and transforming them into analogous people in another group and testing to see if they're treated equitably across those two groups."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "There's a lot of things that'd be hard to get right to make sure that the conversion process itself is fair."}, {"time": 3261, "text": "And I don't think it's anywhere near something that we could actually use yet, but if you could design that conversion process very carefully, it might give you a way of doing audits where you say, what if we took people from this group, converted them into equivalent people in another group, does the system actually treat them how it ought to?"}, {"time": 3278, "text": "That's also really interesting."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "You know, in popular press and in general, in our imagination, you think, well, GANs are able to generate data and you start to think about deep fakes or being able to sort of maliciously generate data that fakes the identity of other people."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "Is this something of a concern to you?"}, {"time": 3303, "text": "Is this something, if you look 10, 20 years into the future, is that something that pops up in your work, in the work of the community that's working on generating models?"}, {"time": 3313, "text": "I'm a lot less concerned about 20 years from now than the next few years."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "I think there'll be a kind of bumpy cultural transition as people encounter this idea that there can be very realistic videos and audio that aren't real."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "I think 20 years from now, people will mostly understand that you shouldn't believe something is real just because you saw a video of it."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "People will expect to see that it's been cryptographically signed or have some other mechanism to make them believe that the content is real."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "There's already people working on this."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Like there's a startup called Truepick that provides a lot of mechanisms for authenticating that an image is real."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "They're maybe not quite up to having a state actor try to evade their verification techniques, but it's something that people are already working on and I think we'll get right eventually."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "So you think authentication will eventually win out."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "So being able to authenticate that this is real and this is not."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "As opposed to GANs just getting better and better or generative models being able to get better and better to where the nature of what is real is normal."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "I don't think we'll ever be able to look at the pixels of a photo and tell you for sure that it's real or not real."},

able to fool your fake detector and your fake detector says this image is not fake, then it's even more credible than if you've never made a fake detector in the first place."}, {"time": 3406, "text": "What I do think we'll get to is systems that we can kind of use behind the scenes to make estimates of what's going on and maybe not like use them in court for a definitive analysis."}, {"time": 3419, "text": "I also think we will likely get better authentication systems where, imagine that every phone cryptographically signs everything that comes out of it."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "You wouldn't be able to conclusively tell that an image was real, but you would be able to tell somebody who knew the appropriate private key for this phone was actually able to sign this image and upload it to this server at this timestamp."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "Okay, so you could imagine maybe you make phones that have the private keys hardware embedded in them."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "If like a state security agency really wants to infiltrate the company, they could probably plant a private key of their choice or break open the chip and learn the private key or something like that."},

of ideas that can be developed really quickly."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "GANs were probably a little bit of an outlier on the whole like one hour timescale."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "But just in terms of like low resource ideas where you do something really different on the algorithm scale and get a big payback."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "I think it's not as likely that you'll see that in terms of things like core machine learning technologies like a better classifier or a better reinforcement learning algorithm or a better generative model."}, {"time": 3521, "text": "If I had the GAN idea today, it would be a lot harder to prove that it was useful than it was back in 2014 because I would need to get it running on something like ImageNet or Celeb A at high resolution."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "You know, those take a while to train."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "You couldn't train it in an hour and know that it was something really new and exciting."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "Back in 2014, training on MNIST was enough."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "But there are other areas of machine learning where I think a new idea could actually be developed really quickly with low resources."}, {"time": 3553, "text": "What's your intuition about what areas of machine learning are ripe for this?"}, {"time": 3557, "text": "Yeah, so I think fairness and interpretability are areas where we just really don't have any idea how anything should be done yet."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "Like for interpretability, I don't think we even have the right definitions."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "And even just defining a really useful concept, you don't even need to run any experiments, could have a huge impact on the field."}, {"time": 3580, "text": "We've seen that, for example, in differential privacy that Cynthia Dwork and her collaborators made this technical definition of privacy where before a lot of things were really mushy."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "And then with that definition, you could actually design randomized algorithms for accessing databases and guarantee that they preserved individual people's privacy in like a mathematical quantitative sense."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "Right now, we all talk a lot about how interpretable different machine learning algorithms are, but it's really just people's opinion."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "And everybody probably has a different idea of what interpretability means in their head."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "If we could define some concept related to interpretability that's actually measurable, that would be a huge leap forward even without a new algorithm that increases that quantity."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "And also once we had the definition of differential privacy, it was fast to get the algorithms that guaranteed it."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "So you could imagine once we have definitions of good concepts and interpretability, we might be able to provide the algorithms that have the interpretability guarantees quickly too."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "So what do you think it takes to build a system with human level intelligence as we quickly venture into the philosophical?"}, {"time": 3651, "text": "So artificial general intelligence, what do you think it takes?"}, {"time": 3655, "text": "I think that it definitely takes better environments than we currently have for training agents that we want them to have a really wide diversity of experiences."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "I also think it's gonna take really a lot of computation."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "It's hard to imagine exactly how much."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "So you're optimistic about simulation, simulating a variety of environments as the path forward?"}, {"time": 3679, "text": "I think it's a necessary ingredient."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "Yeah, I don't think that we're going to get to artificial general intelligence by training on fixed data sets or by thinking really hard about the problem."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "I think that the agent really needs to interact and have a variety of experiences within the same lifespan."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "And today we have many different models that can each do one thing."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "And we tend to train them on one data set or one RL environment."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "Sometimes there are actually papers about getting one set of parameters to perform well in many different RL environments."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "But we don't really have anything like an agent that goes seamlessly from one type of experience to another and really integrates all the different things that it does over the course of its life."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "When we do see multi agent environments, they tend to be, or

the nervous system and the body are naturally two separate entities."}, {"time": 770, "text": "So you have to look at an entire animal as one agent."}, {"time": 773, "text": "But then you start realizing as you observe an animal over any length of time, that a lot of the intelligence of an animal is actually externalized."}, {"time": 784, "text": "That's especially true for humans."}, {"time": 786, "text": "A lot of our intelligence is externalized."}, {"time": 788, "text": "When you write down some notes, that is externalized intelligence."}, {"time": 791, "text": "When you write a computer program, you are externalizing cognition."}, {"time": 796, "text": "So it's externalizing books, it's externalized in computers, the internet, in other humans."}, {"time": 803, "text": "It's externalizing language and so on."}, {"time": 805, "text": "So there is no hard delimitation of what makes an intelligent agent."}, {"time": 812, "text": "It's all about context."}, {"time": 814, "text": "Okay, but AlphaGo is better at Go than the best human player."}, {"time": 822, "text": "There's levels of skill here."}, {"time": 825, "text": "So do you think there's such a ability, such a concept as intelligence explosion in a specific task?"}, {"time": 834, "text": "And then, well, yeah."}, {"time": 837, "text": "Do you think it's possible to have a category of tasks on which you do have something like an exponential growth of ability to solve that particular problem?"}, {"time": 847, "text": "I think if you consider a specific vertical, it's probably possible to some extent."}, {"time": 855, "text": "I also don't think we have to speculate about it because we have real world examples of recursively self improving intelligent systems, right?"}, {"time": 866, "text": "So for instance, science is a problem solving system, a knowledge generation system, like a system that experiences the world in some sense and then gradually understands it and can act on it."}, {"time": 880, "text": "And that system is superhuman and it is clearly recursively self improving because science feeds into technology."}, {"time": 887, "text": "Technology can be used to build better tools, better computers, better instrumentation and so on, which in turn can make science faster, right?"}, {"time": 896, "text": "So science is probably the closest thing we have today to a recursively self improving superhuman AI."}, {"time": 904, "text": "And you can just observe is science, is scientific progress to the exploding, which itself is an interesting question."}, {"time": 912, "text": "You can use that as a basis to try to understand what will happen with a superhuman AI that has a science like behavior."}, {"time": 921, "text": "Let me linger on it a little bit more."}, {"time": 923, "text": "What is your intuition why an intelligence explosion is not possible?"}, {"time": 928, "text": "Like taking the scientific, all the semi scientific revolutions, why can't we slightly accelerate that process?"}, {"time": 938, "text": "So you can absolutely accelerate any problem solving process."}, {"time": 943, "text": "So a recursively self improvement is absolutely a real thing."}, {"time": 948, "text": "But what happens with a recursively self improving system is typically not explosion because no system exists in isolation."}, {"time": 956, "text": "And so tweaking one part of the system means that suddenly another part of the system becomes a bottleneck."}, {"time": 962, "text": "And if you look at science, for instance, which is clearly a recursively self improving, clearly a problem solving system, scientific progress is not actually exploding."}, {"time": 972, "text": "If you look at science, what you see is the picture of a system that is consuming an exponentially increasing amount of resources, but it's having a linear output in terms of scientific progress."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And maybe that will seem like a very strong claim."}, {"time": 988, "text": "Many people are actually saying that, scientific progress is exponential, but when they're claiming this, they're actually looking at indicators of resource consumption by science."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "For instance, the number of papers being published, the number of patents being filed and so on, which are just completely correlated with how many people are working on science today."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "So it's actually an indicator of resource consumption, but what you should look at is the output, is progress in terms of the knowledge that science generates, in terms of the scope and significance of the problems that we solve."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "And some people have actually been trying to measure that."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Like Michael Nielsen, for instance, he had a very nice paper, I think that was last year about it."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "So his approach to measure scientific progress was to look at the timeline of scientific discoveries over the past, you know, 100, 150 years."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "And for each major discovery, ask a panel of experts to rate the significance of the discovery."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And if the output of science as an institution were exponential, you would expect the temporal density of significance to go up exponentially."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "Maybe because there's a faster rate of discoveries, maybe because the discoveries are, you know, increasingly more important."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "And what actually happens if you plot this temporal density of significance measured in this way, is that you see very much a flat graph."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "You see a flat graph across all disciplines, across physics, biology, medicine, and so on."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "And it actually makes a lot of sense if you think about it, because think about the progress of physics 110 years ago, right?"}, {"time": 1108, "text": "It was a time of crazy change."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Think about the progress of technology, you know, 170 years ago, when we started having, you know, replacing horses with cars, when we started having electricity and so on."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "It was a time of incredible change."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And today is also a time of very, very fast change, but it would be an unfair characterization to say that today technology and science are moving way faster than they did 50 years ago or 100 years ago."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "And if you do try to rigorously plot the temporal density of the significance, yeah, of significance, sorry, you do see very flat curves."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "And you can check out the paper that Michael Nielsen had about this idea."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "And so the way I interpret it is, as you make progress in a given field, or in a given subfield of science, it becomes exponentially more difficult to make further progress."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Like the very first person to work on information theory."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "If you enter a new field, and it's still the very early years, there's a lot of low hanging fruit you can pick."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "But the next generation of researchers is gonna have to dig much harder, actually, to make smaller discoveries, probably larger number of smaller discoveries, and to achieve the same amount of impact, you're gonna need a much greater head count."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "And that's exactly the picture you're seeing with science, that the number of scientists and engineers is in fact increasing exponentially."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "The amount of computational resources that are available to science is increasing exponentially and so on."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "So the resource consumption of science is exponential, but the output in terms of progress, in terms of significance, is linear."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "And the reason why is because, and even though science is regressively self improving, meaning that scientific progress turns into technological progress, which in turn helps science."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "If you look at computers, for instance, our products of science and computers are tremendously useful in speeding up science."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "The internet, same thing, the internet is a technology that's made possible by very recent scientific advances."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And itself, because it enables scientists to network, to communicate, to exchange papers and ideas much faster, it is a way to speed up scientific progress."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "So even though you're looking at a regressively self improving system, it is consuming exponentially more resources to produce the same amount of problem solving, very much."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "So that's a fascinating way to paint it, and certainly that holds for the deep learning community."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "If you look at the temporal, what did you call it, the temporal density of significant ideas, if you look at in deep learning, I think, I'd have to think about that, but if you really look at significant ideas in deep learning, they might even be decreasing."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "So I do believe the per paper significance is decreasing, but the amount of papers is still today exponentially increasing."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "So I think if you look at an aggregate, my guess is that you would see a linear progress."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "If you were to sum the significance of all papers, you would see roughly in your progress."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And in my opinion, it is not a coincidence that you're seeing linear progress in science despite exponential resource consumption."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "I think the resource consumption is dynamically adjusting itself to maintain linear progress because we as a community expect linear progress, meaning that if we start investing less and seeing less progress, it means that suddenly there are some lower hanging fruits that become available and someone's gonna step up and pick them, right?"}, {"time": 1351, "text": "So it's very much like a market for discoveries and ideas."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "But there's another fundamental part which you're highlighting, which as a hypothesis as science or like the space of ideas, any one path you travel down, it gets exponentially more difficult to get a new way to develop new ideas."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "And your sense is that's gonna hold across our mysterious universe."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Yes, well, exponential progress triggers exponential friction."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "So that if you tweak one part of the system, suddenly some other part becomes a bottleneck, right?"}, {"time": 1390, "text": "For instance, let's say you develop some device that measures its own acceleration and then it has some engine and it outputs even more acceleration in proportion of its own acceleration and you drop it somewhere, it's not gonna reach infinite speed because it exists in a certain context."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "So the air around it is gonna generate friction and it's gonna block it at some top speed."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "And even if you were to consider the broader context and lift the bottleneck there, like the bottleneck of friction, then some other part of the system would start stepping in and creating exponential friction, maybe the speed of flight or whatever."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And this definitely holds true when you look at the problem solving algorithm that is being run by science as an institution, science as a system."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "As you make more and more progress, despite having this recursive self improvement component, you are encountering exponential friction."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "The more researchers you have working on different ideas, the more overhead you have in terms of communication across researchers."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "If you look at, you were mentioning quantum mechanics, right?"}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Well, if you want to start making significant discoveries today, significant progress in quantum mechanics, there is an amount of knowledge you have to ingest, which is huge."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "So there's a very large overhead to even start to contribute."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "There's a large amount of overhead to synchronize across researchers and so on."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And of course, the significant practical experiments are going to require exponentially expensive equipment because the easier ones have already been run, right?"}, {"time": 1496, "text": "So in your senses, there's no way escaping, there's no way of escaping this kind of friction with artificial intelligence systems."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "Yeah, no, I think science is a very good way to model what would happen with a superhuman recursive research improving AI."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "That's your sense, I mean, the... That's my intuition."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "It's not like a mathematical proof of anything."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "That's not my point."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "Like, I'm not trying to prove anything."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "I'm just trying to make an argument to question the narrative of intelligence explosion, which is quite a dominant narrative."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "And you do get a lot of pushback if you go against it."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "Because, so for many people, right, AI is not just a subfield of computer science."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "It's more like a belief system."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "Like this belief that the world is headed towards an event, the singularity, past which, you know, AI will become... will go exponential very much, and the world will be transformed, and humans will become obsolete."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "And if you go against this narrative, because it is not really a scientific argument, but more of a belief system, it is part of the identity of many people."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "If you go against this narrative, it's like you're attacking the identity of people who believe in it."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "It's almost like saying God doesn't exist, or something."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "So you do get a lot of pushback if you try to question these ideas."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "First of all, I believe most people, they might not be as eloquent or explicit as you're being, but most people in computer science are most people who actually have built anything that you could call AI, quote, unquote, would agree with you."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "They might not be describing in the same kind of way."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "It's more, so the pushback you're getting is from people who get attached to the narrative from, not from a place of science, but from a place of imagination."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "That's correct, that's correct."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "So why do you think that's so appealing?"}, {"time": 1616, "text": "Because the usual dreams that people have when you create a superintelligence system past the singularity, that what people imagine is somehow always destructive."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "Do you have, if you were put on your psychology hat, what's, why is it so appealing to imagine the ways that all of human civilization will be destroyed?"}, {"time": 1640, "text": "I think it's a good story."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "You know, it's a good story."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "And very interestingly, it mirrors a religious stories, right, religious mythology."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "If you look at the mythology of most civilizations, it's about the world being headed towards some final events in which the world will be destroyed and some new world order will arise that will be mostly spiritual, like the apocalypse followed by a paradise probably, right?"}, {"time": 1669, "text": "It's a very appealing story on a fundamental level."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "And we all need stories."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "We all need stories to structure the way we see the world, especially at timescales that are beyond our ability to make predictions, right?"}, {"time": 1684, "text": "So on a more serious non exponential explosion, question, do you think there will be a time when we'll create something like human level intelligence or intelligent systems that will make you sit back and be just surprised at damn how smart this thing is?"}, {"time": 1708, "text": "That doesn't require exponential growth or an exponential improvement, but what's your sense of the timeline and so on that you'll be really surprised at certain capabilities?"}, {"time": 1721, "text": "And we'll talk about limitations and deep learning."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "So do you think in your lifetime, you'll be really damn surprised?"}, {"time": 1726, "text": "Around 2013, 2014, I was many times surprised by the capabilities of deep learning actually."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "That was before we had assessed exactly what deep learning could do and could not do."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And it felt like a time of immense potential."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And then we started narrowing it down, but I was very surprised."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "I would say it has already happened."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "Was there a moment, there must've been a day in there where your surprise was almost bordering on the belief of the narrative that we just discussed."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "Was there a moment, because you've written quite eloquently about the limits of deep learning, was there a moment that you thought that maybe deep learning is limitless?"}, {"time": 1770, "text": "No, I don't think I've ever believed this."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "What was really shocking is that it worked."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "It worked at all, yeah."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "But there's a big jump between being able to do really good computer vision and human level intelligence."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "So I don't think at any point I wasn't under the impression that the results we got in computer vision meant that we were very close to human level intelligence."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "I don't think we're very close to human level intelligence."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "I do believe that there's no reason why we won't achieve it at some point."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "I also believe that it's the problem with talking about human level intelligence that implicitly you're considering like an axis of intelligence with different levels, but that's not really how intelligence works."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "Intelligence is very multi dimensional."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "And so there's the question of capabilities, but there's also the question of being human like, and it's two very different things."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Like you can build potentially very advanced intelligent agents that are not human like at all."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "And you can also build very human like agents."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And these are two very different things, right?"}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Let's go from the philosophical to the practical."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "Can you give me a history of Keras and all the major deep learning frameworks that you kind of remember in relation to Keras and in general, TensorFlow, Theano, the old days."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "Can you give a brief overview Wikipedia style history and your role in it before we return to AGI discussions?"}, {"time": 1859, "text": "Yeah, that's a broad topic."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "So I started working on Keras."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "It was the name Keras at the time."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "I actually picked the name like just the day I was going to release it."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "So I started working on it in February, 2015."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "And so at the time there weren't too many people working on deep learning, maybe like fewer than 10,000."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "The software tooling was not really developed."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So the main deep learning library was Cafe, which was mostly C++."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "Why do you say Cafe was the main one?"}, {"time": 1892, "text": "Cafe was vastly more popular than Theano in late 2014, early 2015."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "Cafe was the one library that everyone was using for computer vision."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "And computer vision was the most popular problem in deep learning at the time."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "Like ConvNets was like the subfield of deep learning that everyone was working on."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "So myself, so in late 2014, I was actually interested in RNNs, in recurrent neural networks, which was a very niche topic at the time, right?"}, {"time": 1925, "text": "It really took off around 2016."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And so I was looking for good tools."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "I had used Torch 7, I had used Theano, used Theano a lot in Kaggle competitions."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "I had used Cafe."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And there was no like good solution for RNNs at the time."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "Like there was no reusable open source implementation of an LSTM, for instance."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "So I decided to build my own."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "And at first, the pitch for that was, it was gonna be mostly around LSTM recurrent neural networks."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "It was gonna be in Python."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "An important decision at the time that was kind of not obvious is that the models would be defined via Python code, which was kind of like going against the mainstream at the time because Cafe, Pylon 2, and so on, like all the big libraries were actually going with the approach of setting configuration files in YAML to define models."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "So some libraries were using code to define models, like Torch 7, obviously, but that was not Python."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "Lasagne was like a Theano based very early library that was, I think, developed, I don't remember exactly, probably late 2014."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "It's Python as well."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "It was like on top of Theano."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "And so I started working on something and the value proposition at the time was that not only what I think was the first reusable open source implementation of LSTM, you could combine RNNs and covenants with the same library, which is not really possible before, like Cafe was only doing covenants."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "And it was kind of easy to use because, so before I was using Theano, I was actually using scikitlin and I loved scikitlin for its usability."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "So I drew a lot of inspiration from scikitlin when I made Keras."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "It's almost like scikitlin for neural networks."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "The fit function."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "Exactly, the fit function, like reducing a complex string loop to a single function call, right?"}, {"time": 2052, "text": "And of course, some people will say, this is hiding a lot of details, but that's exactly the point, right?"}, {"time": 2058, "text": "The magic is the point."},

{"time": 2067, "text": "I didn't know that it was born out of desire to implement RNNs and LSTMs."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "So you were actually one of the first people to really try to attempt to get the major architectures together."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "And it's also interesting."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "You made me realize that that was a design decision at all is defining the model and code."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "Just, I'm putting myself in your shoes, whether the YAML, especially if cafe was the most popular."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "It was the most popular by far."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "If I was, if I were, yeah, I don't, I didn't like the YAML thing, but it makes more sense that you will put in a configuration file, the definition of a model."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "That's an interesting gutsy move to stick with defining it in code."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "Just if you look back."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "Other libraries were doing it as well, but it was definitely the more niche option."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "Okay, Keras and then."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "So I released Keras in March, 2015, and it got users pretty much from the start."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "So the deep learning community was very, very small at the time."}, {"time": 2127, "text": "Lots of people were starting to be interested in LSTM."}, {"time": 2130,

intrigued by the capabilities of RNN, RNNs for NLP."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "So it grew from there."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "Then I joined Google about six months later, and that was actually completely unrelated to Keras."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "So I actually joined a research team working on image classification, mostly like computer vision."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So I was doing computer vision research at Google initially."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "And immediately when I joined Google, I was exposed to the early internal version of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "And the way it appeared to me at the time, and it was definitely the way it was at the time is that this was an improved version of Theano."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "So I immediately knew I had to port Keras to this new TensorFlow thing."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "And I was actually very busy as a noobler, as a new Googler."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "So I had not time to work on that."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "But then in November, I think it was November, 2015, TensorFlow got released."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "And it was kind of like my wake up call that, hey, I had to actually go and make it happen."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "So in December, I ported Keras to run on top of TensorFlow, but it was not exactly a port."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "It was more like a refactoring where I was abstracting away all the backend functionality into one module so that the same code base could run on top of multiple backends."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "So on top of TensorFlow or Theano."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "And for the next year, Theano stayed as the default option."}, {"time": 2235, "text": "It was easier to use, somewhat less buggy."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "It was much faster, especially when it came to audience."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "But eventually, TensorFlow overtook it."}, {"time": 2247, "text": "And TensorFlow, the early TensorFlow, has similar architectural decisions as Theano, right?"}, {"time": 2253, "text": "So it was a natural transition."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "So what, I mean, that still Keras is a side, almost fun project, right?"}, {"time": 2265, "text": "Yeah, so it was not my job assignment."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "It was not."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "I was doing it on the side."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "And even though it grew to have a lot of users for a deep learning library at the time, like Stroud 2016, but I wasn't doing it as my main job."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "So things started changing in, I think it must have been maybe October, 2016."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "So one year later."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "So Rajat, who was the lead on TensorFlow, basically showed up one day in our building where I was doing like, so I was doing research and things like, so I did a lot of computer vision research, also collaborations with Christian Zighetti and deep learning for theorem proving."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "It was a really interesting research topic."}, {"time": 2314, "text": "And so Rajat was saying, hey, we saw Keras, we like it."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "We saw that you're at Google."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "Why don't you come over for like a quarter and work with us?"}, {"time": 2327, "text": "And I was like, yeah, that sounds like a great opportunity."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "And so I started working on integrating the Keras API into TensorFlow more tightly."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "So what followed up is a sort of like temporary TensorFlow only version of Keras that was in TensorFlow.com Trib for a while."}, {"time": 2349, "text": "And finally moved to TensorFlow Core."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "And I've never actually gotten back to my old team doing research."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "Well, it's kind of funny that somebody like you who dreams of, or at least sees the power of AI systems that reason and theorem proving we'll talk about has also created a system that makes the most basic kind of Lego building that is deep learning super accessible, super easy."}, {"time": 2382, "text": "So beautifully so."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "It's a funny irony that you're both, you're responsible for both things, but so TensorFlow 2.0 is kind of, there's a sprint."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "I don't know how long it'll take, but there's a sprint towards the finish."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "What do you look, what are you working on these days?"}, {"time": 2401, "text": "What are you excited about?"}, {"time": 2402, "text": "What are you excited about in 2.0?"}, {"time": 2404, "text": "I mean, eager execution."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "There's so many things that just make it a lot easier to work."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "What are you excited about and what's also really hard?"}, {"time": 2413, "text": "What are the problems you have to kind of solve?"}, {"time": 2415, "text": "So I've spent the past year and a half working on TensorFlow 2.0 and it's been a long journey."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "I'm actually extremely excited about it."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "I think it's a great product."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "It's a delightful product compared to TensorFlow 1.0."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "We've made huge progress."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "So on the Keras side, what I'm really excited about is that, so previously Keras has been this very easy to use high level interface to do deep learning."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "But if you wanted to, if you wanted a lot of flexibility, the Keras framework was probably not the optimal way to do things compared to just writing everything from scratch."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "So in some way, the framework was getting in the way."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "And in TensorFlow 2.0, you don't have this at all, actually."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "You have the usability of the high level interface, but you have the flexibility of this lower level interface."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "And you have this spectrum of workflows where you can get more or less usability and flexibility trade offs depending on your needs, right?"}, {"time": 2486, "text": "You can write everything from scratch and you get a lot of help doing so by subclassing models and writing some train loops using ego execution."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "It's very flexible, it's very easy to debug, it's very powerful."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "But all of this integrates seamlessly with higher level features up to the classic Keras workflows, which are very scikit learn like and are ideal for a data scientist, machine learning engineer type of profile."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "So now you can have the same framework offering the same set of APIs that enable a spectrum of workflows that are more or less low level, more or less high level that are suitable for profiles ranging from researchers to data scientists and everything in between."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "Yeah, so that's super exciting."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "I mean, it's not just that, it's connected to all kinds of tooling."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "You can go on mobile, you can go with TensorFlow Lite, you can go in the cloud or serving and so on."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "It all is connected together."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "Now some of the best software written ever is often done by one person, sometimes two."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "So with a Google, you're now seeing sort of Keras having to be integrated in TensorFlow, I'm sure has a ton of engineers working on."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "And there's, I'm sure a lot of tricky design decisions to be made."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "How does that process usually happen from at least your perspective?"}, {"time": 2576, "text": "What are the debates like?"}, {"time": 2580, "text": "Is there a lot of thinking, considering different options and so on?"}, {"time": 2588, "text": "So a lot of the time I spend at Google is actually discussing design discussions, right?"}, {"time": 2597, "text": "Writing design docs, participating in design review meetings and so on."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "This is as important as actually writing a code."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "So there's a lot of thought, there's a lot of thought and a lot of care that is taken in coming up with these decisions and taking into account all of our users because TensorFlow has this extremely diverse user base, right?"}, {"time": 2621, "text": "It's not like just one user segment where everyone has the same needs."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "We have small scale production users, large scale production users."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "We have startups, we have researchers, you know, it's all over the place."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "And we have to cater to all of their needs."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "If I just look at the standard debates of C++ or Python, there's some heated debates."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "Do you have those at Google?"}, {"time": 2646, "text": "I mean, they're not heated in terms of emotionally, but there's probably multiple ways to do it, right?"}, {"time": 2650, "text": "So how do you arrive through those design meetings at the best way to do it?"}, {"time": 2655, "text": "Especially in deep learning where the field is evolving as you're doing it."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "Is there some magic to it?"}, {"time": 2663, "text": "Is there some magic to the process?"}, {"time": 2666, "text": "I don't know if there's magic to the process, but there definitely is a process."}, {"time": 2670, "text": "So making design decisions is about satisfying a set of constraints, but also trying to do so in the simplest way possible, because this is what can be maintained, this is what can be expanded in the future."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "So you don't want to naively satisfy the constraints by just, you know, for each capability you need available, you're gonna come up with one argument in your API and so on."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "You want to design APIs that are modular and hierarchical so that they have an API surface that is as small as possible, right?"}, {"time": 2707, "text": "And you want this modular hierarchical architecture to reflect the way that domain experts think about the problem."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "Because as a domain expert, when you are reading about a new API, you're reading a tutorial or some docs pages, you already have a way that you're thinking about the problem."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "You already have like certain concepts in mind and you're thinking about how they relate together."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "And when you're reading docs, you're trying to build as quickly as possible a mapping between the concepts featured in your API and the concepts in your mind."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "So you're trying to map your mental model as a domain expert to the way things work in the API."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "So you need an API and an underlying implementation that are reflecting the way people think about these things."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "So in minimizing the time it takes to do the mapping."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "Yes, minimizing the time, the cognitive load there is in ingesting this new knowledge about your API."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "An API should not be self referential or referring to implementation details."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "It should only be referring to domain specific concepts that people already understand."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "So what's the future of Keras and TensorFlow look like?"}, {"time": 2787, "text": "What does TensorFlow 3.0 look like?"}, {"time": 2790, "text": "So that's kind of too far in the future for me to answer, especially since I'm not even the one making these decisions."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "But so from my perspective, which is just one perspective among many different perspectives on the TensorFlow team, I'm really excited by developing even higher level APIs, higher level than Keras."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "I'm really excited by hyperparameter tuning, by automated machine learning, AutoML."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "I think the future is not just, you know, defining a model like you were assembling Lego blocks and then collect fit on it."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "It's more like an automagical model that would just look at your data and optimize the objective you're after, right?"}, {"time": 2839, "text": "So that's what I'm looking into."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "Yeah, so you put the baby into a room with the problem and come back a few hours later with a fully solved problem."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "Exactly, it's not like a box of Legos."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "It's more like the combination of a kid that's really good at Legos and a box of Legos."}, {"time": 2858, "text": "It's just building the thing on its own."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "So that's an exciting future."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "I think there's a huge amount of applications and revolutions to be had under the constraints of the discussion we previously had."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "But what do you think of the current limits of deep learning?"}, {"time": 2877, "text": "If we look specifically at these function approximators that tries to generalize from data."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "You've talked about local versus extreme generalization."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "You mentioned that neural networks don't generalize well and humans do."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "So there's this gap."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "And you've also mentioned that extreme generalization requires something like reasoning to fill those gaps."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "So how can we start trying to build systems like that?"}, {"time": 2907, "text": "Right, yeah, so this is by design, right?"}, {"time": 2910, "text": "Deep learning models are like huge parametric models, differentiable, so continuous, that go from an input space to an output space."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And they're trained with gradient descent."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "So they're trained pretty much point by point."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "They are learning a continuous geometric morphing from an input vector space to an output vector space."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "And because this is done point by point, a deep neural network can only make sense of points in experience space that are very close to things that it has already seen in string data."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "At best, it can do interpolation across points."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "But that means in order to train your network, you need a dense sampling of the input cross output space, almost a point by point sampling, which can be very expensive if you're dealing with complex real world problems, like autonomous driving, for instance, or robotics."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "It's doable if you're looking at the subset of the visual space."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "But even then, it's still fairly expensive."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "You still need millions of examples."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "And it's only going to be able to make sense of things that are very close to what it has seen before."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "And in contrast to that, well, of course, you have human intelligence."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "But even if you're not looking at human intelligence, you can look at very simple rules, algorithms."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "If you have a symbolic rule, it can actually apply to a very, very large set of inputs because it is abstract."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "It is not obtained by doing a point by point mapping."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "For instance, if you try to learn a sorting algorithm using a deep neural network, well, you're very much limited to learning point by point what the sorted representation of this specific list is like."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "But instead, you could have a very, very simple sorting algorithm written in a few lines."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "Maybe it's just two nested loops."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "And it can process any list at all because it is abstract, because it is a set of rules."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "So deep learning is really like point by point geometric morphings, train with good and decent."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And meanwhile, abstract rules can generalize much better."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "And I think the future is we need to combine the two."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "So how do we, do you think, combine the two?"}, {"time": 3059, "text": "How do we combine good point by point functions with programs, which is what the symbolic AI type systems?"}, {"time": 3068, "text": "At which levels the combination happen?"}, {"time": 3071, "text": "I mean, obviously we're jumping into the realm of where there's no good answers."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "It's just kind of ideas and intuitions and so on."}, {"time": 3080, "text": "Well, if you look at the really successful AI systems today, I think they are already hybrid systems that are combining symbolic AI with deep learning."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "For instance, successful robotics systems are already mostly model based, rule based, things like planning algorithms and so on."}, {"time": 3099, "text": "At the same time, they're using deep learning as perception modules."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "Sometimes they're using deep learning as a way to inject fuzzy intuition into a rule based process."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "If you look at the system like in a self driving car, it's not just one big end to end neural network."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "You know, that wouldn't work at all."}, {"time": 3119, "text": "Precisely because in order to train that, you would need a dense sampling of experience base when it comes to driving, which is completely unrealistic, obviously."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "Instead, the self driving car is mostly symbolic, you know, it's software, it's programmed by hand."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "So it's mostly based on explicit models."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "In this case, mostly 3D models of the environment around the car, but it's interfacing with the real world using deep learning modules, right?"}, {"time": 3151, "text": "So the deep learning there serves as a way to convert the raw sensory information to something usable by symbolic systems."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "Okay, well, let's linger on that a little more."}, {"time": 3162, "text": "So dense sampling from input to output."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "You said it's obviously very difficult."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "Is it possible?"}, {"time": 3170, "text": "In the case of self driving, you mean?"}, {"time": 3171, "text": "Let's say self driving, right?"}, {"time": 3173, "text": "Self driving for many people, let's not even talk about self driving, let's talk about steering, so staying inside the lane."}, {"time": 3185, "text": "Lane following, yeah, it's definitely a problem you can solve with an end to end deep learning model, but that's like one small subset."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "Hold on a second."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "Yeah, I don't know why you're jumping from the extreme so easily, because I disagree with you on that."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "I think, well, it's not obvious to me that you can solve lane following."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "No, it's not obvious, I think it's doable."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "I think in general, there is no hard limitations to what you can learn with a deep neural network, as long as the search space is rich enough, is flexible enough, and as long as you have this dense sampling of the input cross output space."}, {"time": 3225, "text": "The problem is that this dense sampling could mean anything from 10,000 examples to like trillions and trillions."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "So that's my question."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "So what's your intuition?"}, {"time": 3236, "text": "And if you could just give it a chance and think what kind of problems can be solved by getting a huge amounts of data and thereby creating a dense mapping."}, {"time": 3248, "text": "So let's think about natural language dialogue, the Turing test."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "Do you think the Turing test can be solved with a neural network alone?"}, {"time": 3261, "text": "Well, the Turing test is all about tricking people into believing they're talking to a human."}, {"time": 3266, "text": "And I don't think that's actually very difficult because it's more about exploiting human perception and not so much about intelligence."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "There's a big difference between mimicking intelligent behavior and actual intelligent behavior."}, {"time": 3282, "text": "So, okay, let's look at maybe the Alexa prize and so on."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "The different formulations of the natural language conversation that are less about mimicking and more about maintaining a fun conversation that lasts for 20 minutes."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "That's a little less about mimicking and that's more about, I mean, it's still mimicking, but it's more about being able to carry forward a conversation with all the tangents that happen in dialogue and so on."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "Do you think that problem is learnable with a neural network that does the point to point mapping?"}, {"time": 3314, "text": "So I think it would be very, very challenging to do this with deep learning."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "I don't think it's out of the question either."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "I wouldn't rule it out."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "The space of problems that can be solved with a large neural network."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "What's your sense about the space of those problems?"}, {"time": 3330, "text": "So useful problems for us."}, {"time": 3332, "text": "In theory, it's infinite, right?"}, {"time": 3334, "text": "You can solve any problem."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "In practice, well, deep learning is a great fit for perception problems."}, {"time": 3341, "text": "In general, any problem which is naturally amenable to explicit handcrafted rules or rules that you can generate by exhaustive search over some program space."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "So perception, artificial intuition, as long as you have a sufficient training dataset."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "And that's the question, I mean, perception, there's interpretation and understanding of the scene, which seems to be outside the reach of current perception systems."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "So do you think larger networks will be able to start to understand the physics and the physics of the scene, the three dimensional structure and relationships of objects in the scene and so on?"}, {"time": 3385, "text": "Or really that's where symbolic AI has to step in?"}, {"time": 3388, "text": "Well, it's always possible to solve these problems with deep learning."}, {"time": 3396, "text": "It's just extremely inefficient."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "A model would be an explicit rule based abstract model would be a far better, more compressed representation of physics."}, {"time": 3406, "text": "Then learning just this mapping between in this situation, this thing happens."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "If you change the situation slightly, then this other thing happens and so on."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "Do you think it's possible to automatically generate the programs that would require that kind of reasoning?"}, {"time": 3422, "text": "Or does it have to, so the way the expert systems fail, there's so many facts about the world had to be hand coded in."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "Do you think it's possible to learn those logical statements that are true about the world and their relationships?"}, {"time": 3438, "text": "Do you think, I mean, that's kind of what theorem proving at a basic level is trying to do, right?"}, {"time": 3442, "text": "Yeah, except it's much harder to formulate statements about the world compared to formulating mathematical statements."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "Statements about the world tend to be subjective."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "So can you learn rule based models?"}, {"time": 3460, "text": "That's the field of program synthesis."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "However, today we just don't really know how to do it."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "So it's very much a grass search or tree search problem."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "And so we are limited to the sort of tree session grass search algorithms that we have today."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "Personally, I think genetic algorithms are very promising."}, {"time": 3482, "text": "So almost like genetic programming."}, {"time": 3484, "text": "Genetic programming, exactly."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "Can you discuss the field of program synthesis?"}, {"time": 3488, "text": "Like how many people are working and thinking about it?"}, {"time": 3494, "text": "Where we are in the history of program synthesis and what are your hopes for it?"}, {"time": 3500, "text": "Well, if it were deep learning, this is like the 90s."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "So meaning that we already have existing solutions."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "We are starting to have some basic understanding of what this is about."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "But it's still a field that is in its infancy."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "There are very few people working on it."}, {"time": 3520, "text": "There are very few real world applications."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "So the one real world application I'm aware of is Flash Fill in Excel."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "It's a way to automatically learn very simple programs to format cells in an Excel spreadsheet from a few examples."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "For instance, learning a way to format a date, things like that."}, {"time": 3542, "text": "Oh, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "You know, OK, that's a fascinating topic."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "I always wonder when I provide a few samples to Excel, what it's able to figure out."},

{"time": 3568, "text": "Are we completely in the dark?"}, {"time": 3569, "text": "So if you said the 90s."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "In terms of program synthesis?"}, {"time": 3572, "text": "So I would say, so maybe 90s is even too optimistic."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "Because by the 90s, we already understood back prop."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "We already understood the engine of deep learning, even though we couldn't really see its potential quite."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "Today, I don't think we have found the engine of program synthesis."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "So we're in the winter before back prop."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "In a way, yes."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "So I do believe program synthesis and general discrete search over rule based models is going to be a cornerstone of AI research in the next century."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "And that doesn't mean we are going to drop deep learning."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "Deep learning is immensely useful."},

3620, "text": "All it's doing is pattern cognition."}, {"time": 3623, "text": "But being good at pattern cognition, given lots of data, is just extremely powerful."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "So we are still going to be working on deep learning."}, {"time": 3630, "text": "We are going to be working on program synthesis."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "We are going to be combining the two in increasingly automated ways."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "So let's talk a little bit about data."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "You've tweeted, about 10,000 deep learning papers have been written about hard coding

architecture."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "But really, what they're doing is hard coding some priors that improve the performance of the system."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "But which gets straight to the point is probably true."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "So you say that you can always buy performance by, in quotes, performance by either training on more data, better data, or by injecting task

3701, "text": "So basically, I'm asking about something that hasn't, from my perspective, been researched too much is exponential improvement in annotation of data."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "Do you often think about?"}, {"time": 3718, "text": "I think it's actually been researched quite a bit."}, {"time": 3720, "text": "You just don't see publications about it."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "Because people who publish papers are going to publish about known benchmarks."}, {"time": 3727, "text": "Sometimes they're going to read a new benchmark."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "People who actually have real world large scale depending on problems, they're going to spend a lot of resources into data annotation and good data annotation pipelines, but you don't see any papers about it."}, {"time":

learning in general is the science of generalization."}, {"time": 3753, "text": "You want to generate knowledge that can be reused across different data sets, across different tasks."}, {"time": 3762,

oh, I found these weight values perform well."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "So David Ha, I don't know if you know David, he had a paper the other day about weight agnostic neural networks."}, {"time": 3790, "text": "And this is a very interesting paper because it really illustrates the fact that an architecture, even without weights, an architecture is knowledge about a task."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "It encodes knowledge."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "And when it comes to architectures that are uncrafted by researchers, in some cases, it is very, very clear that all they are doing is artificially reencoding the template that corresponds to the proper way to solve the task encoding a given data set."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "For instance, I know if you looked at the baby data set, which is about natural language question answering, it is generated by an algorithm."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "So this is a question answer pairs that are generated by an algorithm."}, {"time": 3839,

to linger on it, whether it's from the data side or from the size of the network."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "I don't know if you've read the blog post by Rich Sutton, The Bitter Lesson, where he says, the biggest lesson that we can read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "So as opposed to figuring out methods that can generalize effectively, do you think we can get pretty far by just having something that leverages computation and the improvement of computation?"}, {"time": 3891,

doesn't have to be deep learning architecture, but into some system."}, {"time": 3908, "text": "These papers are not actually making any impact."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "Instead, what's making really long term impact is very simple, very general systems that are really agnostic to all these tricks."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "Because these tricks do not generalize."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "And of course, the one general and simple thing that you should focus on is that which leverages computation."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "Because computation, the availability of large scale

data is the bottleneck."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "And I think we are already starting to be in a regime where our systems are so large in scale and so data ingrained that data today and the quality

symbolic AI."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "But to linger on the deep learning approaches, do you have hope for either unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning, which are ways of being more data

are not like any specific technique."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "So usually when people say reinforcement learning, what they really mean is deep reinforcement learning, which is like one approach

idea."}, {"time": 4108, "text": "So it would get us to solve some problems that?"}, {"time": 4111, "text": "It will get us to incremental improvements in labeled data efficiency."}, {"time": 4118,

what's the shape of those concerns?"}, {"time": 4132, "text": "This is actually something I've briefly written about."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "But the capabilities of deep learning technology can be used in many ways that are concerning from mass surveillance with things like facial recognition."}, {"time": 4151, "text": "In general, tracking lots of data about everyone and then being able to making sense of this data to do identification, to do prediction."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "That's concerning."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "That's something that's being very aggressively pursued by totalitarian states like China."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "One thing I am very much concerned about is that our lives are increasingly online, are increasingly digital, made of information, made of information consumption and information production, our digital footprint, I would say."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "And if you absorb all of this data and you are in control of where you consume

time t.

it at scale in terms of scaling this to many, many people, to entire populations."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "So potentially, artificial intelligence, even in its current state, if you combine it with the internet, with the fact that all of our lives are moving to digital devices and digital information consumption and creation, what you get is the possibility to achieve mass manipulation of behavior and mass psychological control."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "And this is a very real possibility."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "Yeah, so you're talking about any kind of recommender system."},

true."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "So the human mind is very, if you look at the human mind as a kind of computer program, it has a very large exploit surface."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "It has many, many vulnerabilities."}, {"time": 4329, "text": "Exploit surfaces, yeah."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "Ways you can control it."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "For instance, when it comes to your political beliefs, this is very much tied to your identity."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "So for instance, if I'm in control of your news feed on your favorite social media platforms, this is actually where you're getting your news from."}, {"time": 4349, "text": "And of course, I can choose to only show you news that will make you see the world in a specific way."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "But I can also

reinforce."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "I can just show it to people who will agree, and they will like it."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "And that will reinforce the statement in your mind."}, {"time":

pushback."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "So there are many ways in which social media platforms can potentially control your opinions."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "And today, so all of these things are

algorithms is to maximize engagement, which seems fairly innocuous at first."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "However, it is not because content that will maximally engage people, get people to react in an emotional way, get people to click on something."}, {"time": 4484, "text": "It is very often content that is not healthy to the public discourse."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "For instance, fake news are far more likely to get you to click on them than real news simply because they are not constrained to reality."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "So they can be as outrageous, as surprising, as good stories as you want because they're artificial."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "To me, that's an exciting world because so much good can come."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "So there's an opportunity to educate people."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "You can balance people's worldview with other ideas."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "So there's so many objective functions."}, {"time": 4533, "text": "The space of objective functions that create better civilizations is large, arguably infinite."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "But there's also a large space that creates division and destruction, civil war, a lot of bad stuff."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "And the worry is, naturally, probably that space is bigger, first of all."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "And if we don't explicitly think about what kind of effects are going to be observed from different objective functions, then we're going to get into trouble."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "But the question is, how do we get into rooms and have discussions, so

that kind of philosophical discussion?"}, {"time": 4591, "text": "I think you can definitely try."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "So from my perspective, I would feel rather uncomfortable with companies

totalitarian mindset."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "So instead, what I would like to see is probably never going to happen, because it's not super realistic, but that's actually something I really care about."}, {"time": 4622, "text": "I would like all these algorithms to present configuration settings to their users, so that the users can actually make the decision about how they want to be impacted by these information recommendation, content recommendation algorithms."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "For instance, as a user of something like YouTube or Twitter, maybe I want to maximize learning about a specific topic."}, {"time": 4650, "text": "So I want the algorithm to feed my curiosity, which is in itself a very interesting problem."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "So instead of maximizing my engagement, it will maximize how fast and how much I'm learning."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "And it will also take into account the accuracy, hopefully, of the information I'm learning."}, {"time": 4670, "text": "So yeah, the user should be able to determine exactly how these algorithms are affecting their lives."}, {"time": 4678, "text": "I don't want actually any entity making decisions about in which direction they're going to try to manipulate me."}, {"time": 4689, "text": "I want technology."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "So AI, these algorithms are increasingly going to be our interface to a world that is increasingly made of information."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "And I want everyone to be in control of this interface, to interface with the world on their own terms."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "So if someone wants these algorithms to serve their own personal growth goals, they should be able to configure these algorithms in such a way."}, {"time": 4721,

eye opening."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "And for others, it might not be."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "From others, they might just get turned off from that, same with Republican and Democrat."},

promoting, or Twitter wouldn't be."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "It's just a really difficult problem, how to give people control."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "Well, it's mostly an interface design problem."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "The way I see it, you want to create technology that's like a mentor, or a coach, or an assistant, so that it's not your boss."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "You are in control of it."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "You are telling it what to do for you."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "And if you feel like it's manipulating you, it's not actually doing what you want."},

the human collaboration."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "I mean, that's how I see autonomous vehicles too, is giving as much information as possible, and you learn that dance yourself."}, {"time": 4847,

you to show you all these videos, that everybody's confused about what to do with features."}, {"time": 4863, "text": "So basically teach people by linking to, in that way, it's an assistant that uses videos as a basic element of information."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "Okay, so what practically should people do to try to fight against abuses of these algorithms, or algorithms that manipulate us?"}, {"time": 4887, "text": "Honestly, it's a very, very difficult problem, because to start with, there is very little public awareness of these issues."}, {"time": 4895, "text": "Very few people would think there's anything wrong with the unused algorithm, even though there is actually something wrong already, which is that it's trying to maximize engagement most of the time, which has very negative side effects."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "So ideally, so the very first thing is to stop trying to purely maximize engagement, try to propagate content based on popularity, right?"}, {"time": 4926, "text": "Instead, take into account the goals and the profiles of each user."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "So you will be, one example is, for instance, when I look at topic recommendations on Twitter, it's like, you know, they have this news tab with switch recommendations."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "It's always the worst coverage, because it's content that appeals to the smallest common

optimize engagement."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "But that's not what I want."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "So they should put me in control of some setting so that I define what's the objective function that Twitter is going to be following to show me this content."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "And honestly, so this is all about interface design."}, {"time": 4977, "text": "And we are not, it's not realistic to give users control of a bunch of knobs that define algorithm."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "Instead, we should purely put them in charge of defining the objective function."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "Like, let the user tell us what they want to achieve, how they want this algorithm to impact their lives."}, {"time": 4995, "text": "So do you think it is that, or do they provide individual article by article reward structure where you give a signal, I'm glad I saw this, or I'm glad I didn't?"}, {"time": 5004, "text": "So like a Spotify type feedback mechanism, it works to some extent."}, {"time": 5010, "text": "I'm kind of skeptical about it because the only way the algorithm, the algorithm will attempt to relate your choices with the choices of everyone else, which might, you know, if you have an average profile that works fine, I'm sure Spotify accommodations work fine if you just like mainstream stuff."}, {"time": 5029, "text": "If you don't, it can be, it's not optimal at all actually."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "It'll be in an efficient search for the part of the Spotify world that represents you."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "So it's a tough problem, but do note that even a feedback system like what Spotify has does not give me control over what the algorithm is trying to optimize for."}, {"time": 5056, "text": "Well, public awareness, which is what we're doing now, is a good place to start."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "Do you have concerns about longterm existential threats of artificial intelligence?"}, {"time": 5068, "text": "Well, as I was

good progress."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "If you look at algorithmic bias, for instance, three years ago, even two years ago, very, very few people were talking about it."}, {"time": 5237, "text":

actually don't like the Turing test because it's very lazy."}, {"time": 5723, "text": "It's all about completely bypassing the problem of defining and measuring intelligence and instead delegating to a human judge or a panel of human judges."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "So it's a total copout, right?"}, {"time": 5738, "text": "If you want to measure how human like an agent is, I think you have to make it interact with other humans."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "Maybe it's not necessarily a good idea to have these other humans be the judges."}, {"time": 5753, "text": "Maybe you should just observe behavior and compare it to what a human would actually have done."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "When it comes to measuring how smart, how clever an agent is and comparing that to the degree of human intelligence."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "So we're already talking about two things, right?"}, {"time": 5773, "text": "The degree, kind of like the magnitude of an intelligence and its direction, right?"}, {"time": 5780, "text": "Like the norm of a vector and its direction."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "And the direction is like human likeness and the magnitude, the norm is intelligence."},

"text": "So the way you would measure the magnitude of intelligence in a system in a way that also enables you to compare it to that of a human."}, {"time": 5814, "text": "Well, if you look at different benchmarks for intelligence today, they're all too focused on skill at a given task."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "Like skill at playing chess, skill at playing Go, skill at playing Dota."},

or juggling or anything is impressive is because we are expressing this skill within a certain set of constraints."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "So if you want to measure intelligence, you need to rigorously define what intelligence is, which in itself, you know, it's a very challenging problem."}, {"time": 5882, "text": "And do you think that's possible?"}, {"time": 5884, "text": "To define intelligence?"}, {"time": 5886, "text": "I mean, you can provide, many people have provided, you know, some definition."}, {"time": 5890, "text": "I have my own definition."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "Where does your definition begin?"}, {"time": 5893, "text": "Where does your definition begin if it doesn't end?"}, {"time": 5896, "text": "Well, I think intelligence is essentially the efficiency with which you turn experience into generalizable programs."}, {"time": 5909, "text": "So what that means is it's the efficiency with which you turn a sampling of experience space into the ability to process a larger chunk of experience space."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "So measuring skill can be one proxy across many different tasks, can be one proxy for measuring intelligence."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "But if you want to only measure skill, you should control for two things."}, {"time": 5938, "text": "You should control for the amount of experience that your system has and the priors that your system has."}, {"time": 5948, "text": "But if you look at two agents and you give them the same priors and you give them the same amount of experience, there is one of the agents that is going to learn programs, representations, something, a model that will perform well on the larger chunk of experience space than the other."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "And that is the smaller agent."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "So if you fix the experience, which generate better programs, better meaning more generalizable."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "That's a very nice, clean definition of... Oh, by the way, in this definition, it is already very obvious that intelligence has to be specialized because you're talking about experience space and you're talking about segments of experience space."}, {"time": 5994, "text": "You're talking about priors and you're talking about experience."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "All of these things define the context in which intelligence emerges."}, {"time": 6004, "text": "And you can never look at the totality of experience space, right?"}, {"time": 6009, "text": "So intelligence has to be specialized."}, {"time": 6012, "text": "But it can be sufficiently large, the experience space, even though it's specialized."}, {"time": 6016, "text": "There's a certain point when the experience space is large enough to where it might as well be general."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "It feels general."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "It looks general."}, {"time": 6023, "text": "I mean, it's very relative."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "Like, for instance, many people would say human intelligence is general."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "In fact, it is quite specialized."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "We can definitely build systems that start from the same innate priors as what humans have at birth."}, {"time": 6039, "text": "Because we already understand fairly well what sort of priors we have as humans."}, {"time": 6044, "text": "Like many people have worked on this problem."}, {"time": 6046, "text": "Most notably, Elisabeth Spelke from Harvard."}, {"time": 6051, "text": "I don't know if you know her."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "She's worked a lot on what she calls core knowledge."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "And it is very much about trying to determine and describe what priors we are born with."}, {"time": 6062, "text": "Like language skills and so on, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "So we have some pretty good understanding of what priors we are born with."}, {"time": 6071, "text": "So we could..."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "So I've actually been working on a benchmark for the past couple years, you know, on and off."}, {"time": 6078, "text": "I hope to be able to release it at some point."}, {"time": 6081, "text": "The idea is to measure the intelligence of systems by countering for priors, countering for amount of experience, and by assuming the same priors as what humans are born with."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "So that you can actually compare these scores to human intelligence."}, {"time": 6099, "text": "You can actually have humans pass the same test in a way that's fair."}, {"time": 6103, "text": "And so importantly, such a benchmark should be such that any amount of practicing does not increase your score."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "So try to picture a game where no matter how much you play this game, that does not change your skill at the game."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "Can you picture that?"}, {"time": 6125, "text": "As a person who deeply appreciates practice, I cannot actually."}, {"time": 6131, "text": "There's actually a very simple trick."}, {"time": 6136, "text": "So in order to come up with a task, so the only thing you can measure is skill at the task."}, {"time": 6142, "text": "All tasks are going to involve priors."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "The trick is to know what they are and to describe that."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "And then you make sure that this is the same set of priors as what humans start with."}, {"time": 6153, "text": "So you create a task that assumes these priors, that exactly documents these priors, so that the priors are made explicit and there are no other priors involved."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "And then you generate a certain number of samples in experience space for this task, right?"}, {"time": 6169, "text": "And this, for one task, assuming that the task is new for the agent passing it, that's one test of this definition of intelligence that we set up."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "And now you can scale that to many different tasks, that each task should be new to the agent passing it, right?"}, {"time": 6191, "text": "And also it should be human interpretable and understandable so that you can actually have a human pass the same test."}, {"time": 6196, "text": "And then you can compare the score of your machine and the score of your human."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "Which could be a lot of stuff."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "You could even start a task like MNIST."}, {"time": 6203, "text": "Just as long as you start with the same set of priors."}, {"time": 6208, "text": "So the problem with MNIST, humans are already trying to recognize digits, right?"}, {"time": 6215, "text": "But let's say we're considering objects that are not digits, some completely arbitrary patterns."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "Well, humans already come with visual priors about how to process that."}, {"time": 6228, "text": "So in order to make the game fair, you would have to isolate these priors and describe them and then express them as computational rules."}, {"time": 6237, "text": "Having worked a lot with vision science people, that's exceptionally difficult."}, {"time": 6241, "text": "A lot of progress has been made."}, {"time": 6243, "text": "There's been a lot of good tests and basically reducing all of human vision into some good priors."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "We're still probably far away from that perfectly, but as a start for a benchmark, that's an exciting possibility."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "Yeah, so Elisabeth Spelke actually lists objectness as one of the core knowledge priors."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "Objectness, cool."}, {"time": 6265, "text": "Objectness, yeah."}, {"time": 6267, "text": "So we have priors about objectness, like about the visual space, about time, about agents, about goal oriented behavior."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "We have many different priors, but what's interesting is that, sure, we have this pretty diverse and rich set of priors, but it's also not that diverse, right?"}, {"time": 6286, "text": "We are not born into this world with a ton of knowledge about the world, with only a small set of core knowledge."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "Yeah, sorry, do you have a sense of how it feels to us humans that that set is not that large?"}, {"time": 6305, "text": "But just even the nature of time that we kind of integrate pretty effectively through all of our perception, all of our reasoning, maybe how, you know, do you have a sense of how easy it is to encode those priors?"}, {"time": 6317, "text": "Maybe it requires building a universe and then the human brain in order to encode those priors."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "Or do you have a hope that it can be listed like an axiomatic?"}, {"time": 6329, "text": "So you have to keep in mind that any knowledge about the world that we are born with is something that has to have been encoded into our DNA by evolution at some point."}, {"time": 6341, "text": "And DNA is a very, very low bandwidth medium."}, {"time": 6346, "text": "Like it's extremely long and expensive to encode anything into DNA because first of all, you need some sort of evolutionary pressure to guide this writing process."}, {"time": 6357, "text": "And then, you know, the higher level of information you're trying to write, the longer it's going to take."}, {"time": 6364, "text": "And the thing in the environment that you're trying to encode knowledge about has to be stable over this duration."}, {"time": 6375, "text": "So you can only encode into DNA things that constitute an evolutionary advantage."}, {"time": 6380, "text": "So this is actually a very small subset of all possible knowledge about the world."}, {"time": 6385, "text": "You can only encode things that are stable, that are true, over very, very long periods of time, typically millions of years."}, {"time": 6393, "text": "For instance, we might have some visual prior about the shape of snakes, right?"}, {"time": 6398, "text": "But what makes a face, what's the difference between a face and an art face?"}, {"time": 6404, "text": "But consider this interesting question."}, {"time": 6408, "text": "Do we have any innate sense of the visual difference between a male face and a female face?"}, {"time": 6418, "text": "For a human, I mean."}, {"time": 6419, "text": "I would have to look back into evolutionary history when the genders emerged."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "But yeah, most..."}, {"time": 6426, "text": "I mean, the faces of humans are quite different from the faces of great apes."}, {"time": 6430, "text": "Great apes, right?"}, {"time": 6434, "text": "Yeah, you couldn't tell the face of a female chimpanzee from the face of a male chimpanzee, probably."}, {"time": 6443, "text": "Yeah, and I don't think most humans have all that ability."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "So we do have innate knowledge of what makes a face, but it's actually impossible for us to have any DNA encoded knowledge of the difference between a female human face and a male human face because that knowledge, that information came up into the world actually very recently."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "If you look at the slowness of the process of encoding knowledge into DNA."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "Yeah, so that's interesting."}, {"time": 6477, "text": "That's a really powerful argument that DNA is a low bandwidth and it takes a long time to encode."}, {"time": 6482, "text": "That naturally creates a very efficient encoding."}, {"time": 6485, "text": "But one important consequence of this is that, so yes, we are born into this world with a bunch of knowledge, sometimes high level knowledge about the world, like the shape, the rough shape of a snake, of the rough shape of a face."}, {"time": 6500, "text": "But importantly, because this knowledge takes so long to write, almost all of this innate knowledge is shared with our cousins, with great apes, right?"}, {"time": 6512, "text": "So it is not actually this innate knowledge that makes us special."}, {"time": 6516, "text": "But to throw it right back at you from the earlier on in our discussion, it's that encoding might also include the entirety of the environment of Earth."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "To some extent."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "So it can include things that are important to survival and production, so for which there is some evolutionary pressure, and things that are stable, constant over very, very, very long time periods."}, {"time": 6544, "text": "And honestly, it's not that much information."}, {"time": 6546, "text": "There's also, besides the bandwidths constraint and the constraints of the writing process, there's also memory constraints, like DNA, the part of DNA that deals with the human brain, it's actually fairly small."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "It's like, you know, on the order of megabytes, right?"}, {"time": 6565, "text": "There's not that much high level knowledge about the world you can encode."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "That's quite brilliant and hopeful for a benchmark that you're referring to of encoding priors."}, {"time": 6579, "text": "I actually look forward to, I'm skeptical whether you can do it in the next couple of years, but hopefully."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "I've been working."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "So honestly, it's a very simple benchmark, and it's not like a big breakthrough or anything."}, {"time": 6589, "text": "It's more like a fun side project, right?"}, {"time": 6593, "text": "But these fun, so is ImageNet."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "These fun side projects could launch entire groups of efforts towards creating reasoning systems and so on."}, {"time": 6604, "text": "And I think... Yeah, that's the goal."}, {"time": 6606, "text": "It's trying to measure strong generalization, to measure the strength of abstraction in our minds, well, in our minds and in artificial intelligence agencies."}, {"time": 6616, "text": "And if there's anything true about this science organism is its individual cells love competition."}, {"time": 6624, "text": "So and benchmarks encourage competition."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "So that's an exciting possibility."}, {"time": 6629, "text": "If you, do you think an AI winter is coming?"}, {"time": 6633, "text": "And how do we prevent it?"}, {"time": 6636, "text": "So an AI winter is something that would occur when there's a big mismatch between how we are selling the capabilities of AI and the actual capabilities of AI."},

field."}, {"time": 6774, "text": "So that's the concern is that that debt, that's what happens with the other AI winters is the concern is you actually tweeted about this with autonomous vehicles,

will definitely be no."}, {"time": 6815, "text": "And second will be, wait a minute, we've invested one, two, three, four billion dollars into this and we made no profit."}, {"time": 6823, "text":

the government."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "Well, a lot of money has been spent on making people hate the government."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "But the reality is government does some things pretty well."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "I mean, government does health insurance pretty well."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "So much so, I mean, given our anti government bias, it really is true that there are people out there saying, don't let the government get its hands on Medicare."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "So people actually love the government health insurance program far more than they love private health insurance."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "Basic education."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "It turns out that your local public high school is the right place to have students trained and private for,

do these things on a priori grounds."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "You can talk about the logic of why healthcare is not going to be handled well by the market, but partly it's just experience."},

jobs?"}, {"time": 1405, "text": "There may be some things."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "I mean, actually, you know, translators, there's really reduced demand for translators because machine translation

stuff with many fewer workers than before, and that's not happening."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "There are a few isolated sectors."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "There are some kinds of jobs that are going away, but that keeps on happening."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "I mean, New York City used to have thousands and thousands of longshoremen taking stuff off ships and putting them on ships."}, {"time":

robots."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "It doesn't sound high tech, but it actually pretty much destroyed an occupation."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Well, you know, it wasn't fun for the longshoremen, to say the least."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "But it's not, we coped, we moved on, and that sort of thing happens all the time."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "You mean farmers."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "We used to be a nation which was mostly farmers."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "There are now very few farmers left."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And the reason is not that we've stopped eating, it's that farming has become so efficient that we don't need a lot of farmers, and we coped with that too."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "So the idea that there's something qualitatively different about what's happening now so far isn't true."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So your intuition is there is going to be lots of jobs, but it's just the thing that just continues."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "There's nothing qualitatively different about this moment."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "Some jobs will be lost, others will be created, as has always been the case so far."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "I mean, maybe there's a singularity."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "Maybe there's a moment when the machines get smarter than we are, and sky tech kills us all or something, right?"}, {"time": 1542, "text": "But that's not visible in anything we're seeing now."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "You mentioned the metric of productivity."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "Could you explain that a little bit?"}, {"time": 1553, "text": "Because it's a really interesting one."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "I've heard you mention that before in connection with automation."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "So what is that metric?"},

all, production."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "We do have a measure of the economy's total production, you know, real GDP, which is itself, it's a little bit of a construct because it's quite literally, it's adding apples and oranges."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "So we have to add together various things, which we basically do by using market prices, but we try to adjust for inflation."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "But it's kind of, it's a reasonable measure of how much the economy is producing."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "Sorry to interrupt."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "Is it goods and services?"}, {"time": 1592, "text": "It's goods and services."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "Productivity is, you divide that total output by the number of hours worked."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "So we're basically asking how much stuff does the average worker produce in an hour of work."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "And if you're seeing really rapid technological progress, then you'd expect to see productivity rising at a rapid clip, which we did, you know, for the generation after World War II, productivity rose, you know, 2% a year on a sustained basis."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "Then it dropped down for a while."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "Then there was a kind of a decade of fairly rapid growth from the mid nineties to the mid two thousands."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "And then it's, it dropped off again and it's not, it's not impressive right now."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "So you're just not seeing an epical shift in, in, in the economy."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "So let me then ask you about the psychology of blaming automation."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "A few months ago, you wrote in the New York Times, quote, the other day I found myself, as I often do at a conference, discussing lagging wages and soaring inequality."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "There was a lot of interesting discussion, but one thing that struck me was how many of the participants just assumed that robots are a big part of the problem, that machines are taking away the good jobs or even jobs in general."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "For the most part, this wasn't even presented as a hypothesis, just as part of what everyone knows."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "So why is, maybe can you psychoanalyze our, the public intellectuals or economists or us actually in the general public, why this is happening?"}, {"time": 1692, "text": "Why this assumption has just infiltrated public discourse?"}, {"time": 1692, "text": "There's a couple of things."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "One is that the particular technologies that are advancing now are ones that are a lot more visible to the chattering class."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "When containerization did away with the jobs of longshoremen, well, not a whole lot of college professors are close friends with longshoremen."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "And so we see this one."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "Then there's a second thing, which is, we just went through a severe financial crisis and a period of very high unemployment."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "It's finally come down."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "There's really no question that that high unemployment was about macroeconomics."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "It was about a failure of demand."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "But macroeconomics is really not intuitive."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "I mean, people just have a hard time wrapping their minds around it."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "And among other things, people have a hard time believing that something as trivial as, well, people who just aren't spending enough can lead to the kind of mass misery that we saw in the 1930s or the not quite so severe, but still serious misery that we saw after 2008."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "And there's always a tendency to say it must be something big."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "It must be technological change."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "That means we don't need workers anymore."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "There was a lot of that in the 30s."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "And that same thing happened after 2008, the assumption that it has to be some deep cause, not something as trivial as a failure of investor confidence and inadequate monetary and fiscal response."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "And the last thing on wages."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "A lot of what's happened on wages is at some level political."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "It's the collapse of the union movement."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "It's policies that have squeezed workers bargaining power."}, {"time": 1802,

political decisions that we made that have caused this income stagnation."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "And so they're a receptive audience for technological determinism."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "So what comes first in your view, the economy or politics in terms of what has impact on the other?"}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Oh, look, everything interacts."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "That's one of the rules that I was taught in economics."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "Everything affects everything else in at least two ways."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "I mean, clearly the economy drives a lot of political stuff."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "But also clearly politics has a huge impact on the economy."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "We look at the decline of unions in America and say, well, the world has changed and unions don't have a role."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "But two thirds of workers in Denmark are unionized."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "And Denmark has the same technology and faces the same global economy that we do."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "It's just a difference in political choices that leads to that difference."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "So I actually teach a course here at CUNY called Economics of the Welfare State, which is about things like healthcare and retirement and to some extent wage policy and so on."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "And the message I keep on trying

{"time": 464, "text": "So this is really how we think nature is, which is surprising, but also I think kind of magic."}, {"time": 471, "text": "So, you know, we are, our bodies are basically made up of like little knots of energy in these invisible objects that are all around us."}, {"time": 480, "text": "And what is the story of the vacuum when it comes to LHC?"}, {"time": 487, "text": "So why did you mention the word vacuum?"}, {"time": 489, "text": "Okay, so if we just, if we go back to like the physics, we do know."}, {"time": 493, "text": "So atoms are made of electrons, which were discovered a hundred or so years ago."}, {"time": 498, "text": "And then in the nucleus of the atom, you have two other types of particles."}, {"time": 501, "text": "There's an up, something called an up quark and a down quark."}, {"time": 504, "text": "And those three particles make up every atom in the universe."}, {"time": 507, "text": "So we think of these as ripples in fields."}, {"time": 510, "text": "So there is something called the electron field and every electron in the universe is a ripple moving about in this electron field."}, {"time": 519, "text": "So the electron field is all around us, we can't see it, but every electron in our body is a little ripple in this thing that's there all the time."}, {"time": 525, "text": "And the quark fields are the same."}, {"time": 526, "text": "So there's an up quark field and an up quark is a little ripple in the up quark field."}, {"time": 530, "text": "And the down quark is a little ripple in something else called the down quark field."}, {"time": 533, "text": "So these fields are always there."}, {"time": 535, "text": "Now there are potentially, we know about a certain number of fields in what we call the standard model of particle physics."}, {"time": 541, "text": "And the most recent one we discovered was the Higgs field."}, {"time": 544, "text": "And the way we discovered the Higgs field was to make a little ripple in it."}, {"time": 548, "text": "So what the LHC did, it fired two protons into each other, very, very hard with enough energy that you could create a disturbance in this Higgs field."}, {"time": 558, "text": "And that's what shows up as what we call the Higgs boson."}, {"time": 560, "text": "So this particle that everyone was going on about eight or so years ago is proof really, the particle in itself is, I mean, it's interesting, but the thing that's really interesting is the field."}, {"time": 570, "text": "Because it's the Higgs field that we believe is the reason that electrons and quarks have mass."}, {"time": 578, "text": "And it's that invisible field that's always there that gives mass to the particles."}, {"time": 582, "text": "The Higgs boson is just our way of checking it's there basically."}, {"time": 586, "text": "And so the Large Hadron Collider, in order to get that ripple in the Higgs field, it requires a huge amount of energy."}, {"time": 594, "text": "Yeah, I suppose."}, {"time": 595, "text": "And so that's why you need this huge, that's why size matters here."}, {"time": 598, "text": "So maybe there's a million questions here, but let's backtrack."}, {"time": 602, "text": "Why does size matter in the context of a particle collider?"}, {"time": 609, "text": "So why does bigger allow you for higher energy collisions?"}, {"time": 615, "text": "Right, so the reason, well, it's kind of simple really, which is that there are two types of particle accelerator that you can build."}, {"time": 621, "text": "One is circular, which is like the LHC, the other is a great long line."}, {"time": 625, "text": "So the advantage of a circular machine is that you can send particles around a ring and you can give them a kick every time they go around."}, {"time": 632, "text": "So imagine you have a, there's actually a bit of the LHC, that's about only 30 meters long, where you have a bunch of metal boxes, which have oscillating 2 million volt electric fields inside them, which are timed so that when a proton goes through one of these boxes, the field it sees as it approaches is attractive."}, {"time": 648, "text": "And then as it leaves the box, it flips and becomes repulsive and the proton gets attracted and kicked out the other side, so it gets a bit faster."}, {"time": 655, "text": "So you send it, and then you send it back round again."}, {"time": 657, "text": "And it's incredible, like the timing of that, the synchronization, wait, really?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "I think there's going to be a multiplicative effect on the questions I have."}, {"time": 666, "text": "Is, okay, let me just take that attention for a second."}, {"time": 672, "text": "The orchestration of that, is that fundamentally a hardware problem or a software problem?"}, {"time": 677, "text": "Like what, how do you get that?"}, {"time": 680, "text": "I mean, I should first of all say, I'm not an engineer."}, {"time": 682, "text": "So the guys, I did not build the LHC, so they're people much, much better at this stuff than I."}, {"time": 686, "text": "For sure, but maybe."}, {"time": 690, "text": "But from your sort of intuition, from the echoes of what you understand, what you heard of how it's designed, what's your sense?"}, {"time": 700, "text": "What's the engineering aspects of it?"}, {"time": 703, "text": "The acceleration bit is not challenging."}, {"time": 705, "text": "Okay, I mean, okay, there's always challenges with everything, but basically you have these, the beams that go around the LHC, the beams of particles are divided into little bunches."}, {"time": 715, "text": "So they're called, they're a bit like swarms of bees, if you like, and there are around, I think it's something of the order 2000 bunches spaced around the ring."}, {"time": 725, "text": "And they, if you're at a given point on the ring, counting bunches, you get 40 million bunches passing you every second."}, {"time": 731, "text": "So they come in like cars going past on a very fast motorway."}, {"time": 736, "text": "So you need to have, if you're an electric field that you're using to accelerate the particles, that needs to be timed so that as a bunch of protons arrives, it's got the right sign to attract them and then flips at the right moment."}, {"time": 747, "text": "But I think the voltage in those boxes oscillates at hundreds of megahertz."}, {"time": 751, "text": "So the beams are like 40 megahertz, but it's oscillating much more quickly than the beam."}, {"time": 755, "text": "So I think it's difficult engineering, but in principle, it's not a really serious challenge."}, {"time": 761, "text": "The bigger problem."}, {"time": 762, "text": "There's probably engineers like screaming at you right now."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Probably, but I mean, okay."}, {"time": 766, "text": "So in terms of coming back to this thing, why is it so big?"}, {"time": 768, "text": "Well, the reason is you wanna get the particles through that accelerating element over and over again."}, {"time": 774, "text": "So you wanna bring them back round."}, {"time": 775, "text": "So that's why it's round."}, {"time": 776, "text": "The question is why couldn't you make it smaller?"}, {"time": 778, "text": "Well, the basic answer is that these particles are going unbelievably quickly."}, {"time": 783, "text": "So they travel at 99.9999991% of the speed of light in the LHC."}, {"time": 791, "text": "And if you think about, say, driving your car around a corner at high speed, if you go fast, you need a lot of friction in the tires to make sure you don't slide off the road."}, {"time": 801, "text": "So the limiting factor is how powerful a magnet can you make because what we do is magnets are used to bend the particles around the ring."}, {"time": 810, "text": "And essentially the LHC, when it was designed, was designed with the most powerful magnets that could conceivably be built at the time."}, {"time": 817, "text": "And so that's your kind of limiting factor."}, {"time": 820, "text": "So if you wanted to make the machine smaller, that means a tighter bend, you need to have a more powerful magnet."}, {"time": 824, "text": "So it's this toss up between how strong are your magnets versus how big a tunnel can you afford."}, {"time": 829, "text": "The bigger the tunnel, the weaker the magnets can be."}, {"time": 831, "text": "The smaller the tunnel, the stronger they've gotta be."}, {"time": 834, "text": "Okay, so maybe can we backtrack to the Standard Model and say what kind of particles there are, period, and maybe the history of kind of assembling that the Standard Model of physics and then how that leads up to the hopes and dreams and the accomplishments of the Large Hadron Collider."}, {"time": 852, "text": "Yeah, sure, okay."}, {"time": 854, "text": "So all of 20th century physics in like five minutes."}, {"time": 857, "text": "Okay, so, okay, the story really begins properly."}, {"time": 861, "text": "End of the 19th century, the basic view of matter is that matter is made of atoms and the atoms are indestructible, immutable little spheres like the things we were talking about that don't really exist."}, {"time": 872, "text": "And there's one atom for every chemical element."}, {"time": 875, "text": "So there's an atom for hydrogen, for helium, for carbon, for iron, et cetera, and they're all different."}, {"time": 879, "text": "Then in 1897, experiments done at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, which is where I'm still, where I'm based, showed that there are actually smaller particles inside the atom, which eventually became known as electrons."}, {"time": 891, "text": "So these are these negatively charged things that go around the outside."}, {"time": 894, "text": "A few years later, Ernest Rutherford, very famous nuclear physicist, one of the pioneers of nuclear physics shows that the atom has a tiny nugget in the center, which we call the nucleus, which is a positively charged object."}, {"time": 905, "text": "So then by like 1910, 11, we have this model of the atom that we learn in school, which is you've got a nucleus, electrons go around it."}, {"time": 913, "text": "Fast forward a few years, the nucleus, people start doing experiments with radioactivity where they use alpha particles that are spat out of radioactive elements as bullets, and they fire them at other atoms."}, {"time": 926, "text": "And by banging things into each other, they see that they can knock bits out of the nucleus."}, {"time": 931, "text": "So these things come out called protons, first of all, which are positively charged particles about 2000 times heavier than the electron."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And then 10 years later, more or less, a neutral particle is discovered called the neutron."}, {"time": 943, "text": "So those are the three basic building blocks of atoms."}, {"time": 947, "text": "You have protons and neutrons in the nucleus that are stuck together by something called the strong force, the strong nuclear force, and you have electrons in orbit around that, held in by the electromagnetic force, which is one of the forces of nature."}, {"time": 960, "text": "That's sort of where we get to by like 1932, more or less."}, {"time": 964, "text": "Then what happens is physics is nice and neat."}, {"time": 967, "text": "In 1932, everything looks great, got three particles and all the atoms are made of, that's fine."}, {"time": 971, "text": "But then cloud chamber experiments."}, {"time": 973, "text": "These are devices that can be used to, the first device is capable of imaging subatomic particles so you can see their tracks."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And they're used to study cosmic rays, particles that come from outer space and bang into the atmosphere."}, {"time": 985, "text": "And in these experiments, people start to see a whole load of new particles."}, {"time": 989, "text": "So they discover for one thing antimatter, which is the sort of a mirror image of the particles."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So we discovered that there's also, as well as a negatively charged electron, there's something called a positron, which is a positively charged version of the electron."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "And there's an antiproton, which is negatively charged."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And then a whole load of other weird particles start to get discovered."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "And no one really knows what they are."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "This is known as the zoo of particles."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "Are these discoveries from the first theoretical discoveries or are they discoveries in an experiment?"}, {"time": 1018, "text": "So like, yeah, what's the process of discovery for these early sets of particles?"}, {"time": 1023, "text": "It's a mixture."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "The early stuff around the atom is really experimentally driven."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "It's not based on some theory."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "It's exploration in the lab using equipment."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "So it's really people just figuring out, getting hands on with the phenomena, figuring out what these things are."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "And the theory comes a bit later."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "That's not always the case."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "So in the discovery of the anti electron, the positron, that was predicted from quantum mechanics and relativity by a very clever theoretical physicist called Paul Dirac, who was probably the second brightest physicist of the 20th century, apart from Einstein, but isn't anywhere near as well known."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "So he predicted the existence of the anti electron from basically a combination of the theories of quantum mechanics and relativity."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "And it was discovered about a year after he made the prediction."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "What happens when an electron meets a positron?"}, {"time": 1069, "text": "They annihilate each other."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "So when you bring a particle and its antiparticle together, they react, well, they don't react, they just wipe each other out and they turn, their mass is turned into energy, usually in the form of photons, so you get light produced."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "So when you have that kind of situation, why does the universe exist at all if there's matter in any matter?"}, {"time": 1090, "text": "Oh God, now we're getting into the really big questions."},

{"time": 1100, "text": "Yeah, let's take it slow with the standard model."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "So, okay, so there's matter and antimatter in the 30s."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "So what else?"}, {"time": 1109, "text": "So matter and antimatter, and then a load of new particles start turning up in these cosmic ray experiments, first of all."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "And they don't seem to be particles that make up atoms."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "They're something else."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "They all mostly interact with a strong nuclear force."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So they're a bit like protons and neutrons."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "And by, in the 1960s in America, particularly, but also in Europe and Russia, scientists started to build particle accelerators."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "So these are the forerunners of the LHC."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "So big ring shaped machines that were, you know, hundreds of meters long, which in those days was enormous."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "You never, you know, most physics up until that point had been done in labs, in universities, you know, with small bits of kit."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "So this is a big change."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "And when these accelerators are built, they start to find they can produce even more of these particles."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "So I don't know the exact numbers, but by around 1960, there are of order a hundred of these things that have been discovered."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "And physicists are kind of tearing their hair out because physics is all about simplification."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And suddenly what was simple has become messy and complicated and everyone sort of wants to understand what's going on."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "As a quick kind of aside and probably really dumb question, but how is it possible to take something like a, like a photon or electron and be able to control it enough, like to be able to do a controlled experiment where you collide it against something else?"}, {"time": 1192, "text": "Is that, is that, that seems like an exceptionally difficult engineering challenge because you mentioned vacuum too."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "So you basically want to remove every other distraction and really focus on this collision."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "How difficult of an engineering challenge is that?"}, {"time": 1206, "text": "Just to get a sense."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "And it is very hard."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "I mean, in the early days, particularly when the first accelerators are being built in like 1932, Ernest Lawrence builds the first, what we call a cyclotron, which is like a little accelerator, this big or so."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "There's another one."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Is it really that big?"}, {"time": 1223, "text": "There's a tiny little thing."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "So most of the first accelerators were what we call fixed target experiments."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "So you had a ring, you accelerate particles around the ring and then you fire them out the side into some target."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So that makes the kind of, the colliding bit is relatively straightforward because you just fire it, whatever it is you want to fire it at."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "The hard bit is the steering the beams with the magnetic fields, getting, you know, strong enough electric fields to accelerate them, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "The first colliders where you have two beams colliding head on, that comes later."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "And I don't think it's done until maybe the 1980s."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "I'm not entirely sure, but it's a much harder problem."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "Cause you have to like perfectly get them to hit each other."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "I mean, we're talking about, I mean, what scale it takes, what's the, I mean, the temporal thing is a giant mess, but the spatially, like the size is tiny."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "Well, to give you a sense of the LHC beams, the cross sectional diameter is I think around a dozen or so microns."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "So, you know, 10 millionths of a meter."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "And a beam, sorry, just to clarify, a beam contains how many, is it the bunches that you mentioned?"},

is, it's not really bunch shaped."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "They're actually quite long."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "They're like 30 centimeters long, but thinner than a human hair."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "So like very, very narrow, long sort of objects."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Those are the things."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So what happens in the LHC is you steer the beams so that they cross in the middle of the detector."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "So they basically have these swarms of protons that are flying through each other."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "And most of the, you have to have a hundred billion coming one way, a hundred billion another way, maybe 10 of them will hit each other."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "So this, okay, that makes a lot more sense."}, {"time": 1339,

you're basically, right."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "You're relying on probability to be that some fraction of them are gonna collide."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "And then you know which, because it's a swarm of the same kind of particle."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "So it doesn't matter which ones hit each other exactly."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "I mean, that's not to say it's not hard."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "You've got to, one of the challenges to make the collisions work is you have to squash these beams to very, very, basically the narrower they are the better cause the higher chances of them colliding."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "If you think about two flocks of birds flying through each other, the birds are all far apart in the flocks."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "There's not much

of problem."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And it's tuning those magnetic fields, getting the magnetic fields powerful enough that you squash the beams and focus them so that you get enough collisions."},

there's no evidence."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "No one's ever seen a quark in any experiment."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And lots of experiments are done to try to find quarks, to try to knock a quark out of a..."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "So the idea, if protons and neutrons are made of quarks, you should be able to knock a quark out and see the quark."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "That never happens."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "And we still have never actually managed to do that."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "So the way that it's done in the end is this machine that's built in California at the Stanford Lab, Stanford Linear Accelerator, which is essentially a gigantic, three kilometer long electron gun."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "It fires electrons, almost the speed of light, at protons."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "And when you do these experiments, what you find is at very high energy, the electrons bounce off small, hard objects inside the proton."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "So it's a bit like taking an X ray of the proton."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "You're firing these very light, high energy particles, and they're pinging off little things inside the proton that are like ball bearings, if you like."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "So you actually, that way, they resolve that there are three things inside the proton, which are quarks, the quarks that Gellman and Zweig had predicted."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "So that's really the evidence that convinces people that these things are real."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "The fact that we've never seen one in an experiment directly, they're always stuck inside other particles."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "And the reason for that is essentially to do with a strong force."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "The strong force is the force that holds quarks together."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "And it's so strong that it's impossible to actually liberate a quark."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "So if you try and pull a quark out of a proton, what actually ends up happening is that you kind of create this spring like bond in the strong force."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "You imagine two quarks that are held together by a very powerful spring."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "You pull and pull and pull, more and more energy gets stored in that bond, like stretching a spring, and eventually the tension gets so great, the spring snaps, and the energy in that bond gets turned into two new quarks that go on the broken ends."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "So you started with two quarks, you end up with four quarks."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "So you never actually get to take a quark out."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "You just end up making loads more quarks in the process."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "So how do we, again, forgive the dumb question, how do we know quarks are real then?"}, {"time": 1724, "text": "Well, A, from these experiments where we can scatter, you fire electrons into the protons."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "They can burrow into the proton and knock off, and they can bounce off these quarks."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "So you can see from the angles, the electrons come out."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "I see, you can infer."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "You can infer that these things are there."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "The quark model can also be used."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "It has a lot of successes that you can use it to predict the existence of new particles that hadn't been seen."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "So, and it basically, there's lots of data basically showing from, you know, when we fire protons at each other at the LHC, a lot of quarks get knocked all over the place."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And every time they try and escape from, say, one of their protons, they make a whole jet of quarks that go flying off, bound up in other sorts of particles made of quarks."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "So all the sort of the theoretical predictions from the basic theory of the strong force and the quarks all agrees with what we are seeing in experiments."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "We've just never seen an actual quark on its own because unfortunately it's impossible to get them out on their own."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "So quarks, these crazy smaller things that are hard to imagine are real."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "What else is part of the story here?"}, {"time": 1789, "text": "So the other thing that's going on at the time, around the 60s, is an attempt to understand the forces that make these particles interact with each other."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "So you have the electromagnetic force, which is the force that was sort of discovered to some extent in this room, or at least in this building."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "So the first, what we call quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force is developed in the 1940s and 50s by Feynman, Richard Feynman amongst other people, Julian Schrodinger, Tom Onaga, who come up with the first, what we call a quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "And this is where this description of, which I gave you at the beginning, that particles are ripples in fields."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "Well, in this theory, the photon, the particle of light is described as a ripple in this quantum field called the electromagnetic field."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "And the attempt then is made to try, well, can we come up with a quantum field theory of the other forces, of the strong force and the weak, the third force, which we haven't discussed, which is the weak force, which is a nuclear force."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "We don't really experience it in our everyday lives, but it's responsible for radioactive decay."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "It's the force that allows, you know, on a radioactive atom to turn into a different element, for example."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And I don't know if you've explicitly mentioned, but so there's technically four forces."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "I guess three of them would be in the standard model, like the weak, the strong, and the electromagnetic, and then there's gravity."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "And there's gravity, which we don't worry about that, because it's too hard."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "It's too hard."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "Well, no, maybe we bring that up at the end, but yeah."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "Gravity, so far, we don't have a quantum theory of, and if you can solve that problem, you'll win a Nobel Prize."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "Well, we're gonna have to bring up the graviton at some point, I'm gonna ask you, but let's leave that to the side for now."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "So those three, okay, Feynman, electromagnetic force, the quantum field, and where does the weak force come in?"}, {"time": 1901, "text": "So yeah, well, first of all, I mean, the strong force is the easiest."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "The strong force is a little bit like the electromagnetic force."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "It's a force that binds things together."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "So that's the force that holds quarks together inside the proton, for example."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "So a quantum field theory of that force is discovered in the, I think it's in the 60s, and it predicts the existence of new force particles called gluons."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "So gluons are a bit like the photon."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "The photon is the particle of electromagnetism."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "Gluons are the particles of the strong force."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "So just like there's an electromagnetic field, there's something called a gluon field, which is also all around us."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "So some of these particles, I guess, are the force carriers or whatever."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "They carry the force."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "It depends how you want to think about it."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "I mean, really the field, the strong force field, the gluon field is the thing that binds the quarks together."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "The gluons are the little ripples in that field."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So that like, in the same way that the photon is a ripple in the electromagnetic field."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "But the thing that really does the binding is the field."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "I mean, you may have heard people talk about things like you've heard the phrase virtual particle."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "So sometimes in some, if you hear people describing how forces are exchanged between particles, they quite often talk about the idea that if you have an electron and another electron, say, and they're repelling each other through the electromagnetic force, you can think of that as if they're exchanging photons."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "So they're kind of firing photons backwards and forwards between each other."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "And that causes them to repel."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "That photon is then a virtual particle."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "Yes, that's what we call a virtual particle."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "In other words, it's not a real thing, it doesn't actually exist."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "So it's an artifact of the way theorists do calculations."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "So when they do calculations in quantum field theory, rather than, no one's discovered a way of just treating the whole field."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "You have to break the field down into simpler things."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "So you can basically treat the field as if it's made up of lots of these virtual photons, but there's no experiment that you can do that can detect these particles being exchanged."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "What's really happening in reality is that the electromagnetic field is warped by the charge of the electron and that causes the force."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "But the way we do calculations involves particles."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "So it's a bit confusing, but it's really a mathematical technique."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "It's not something that corresponds to reality."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "I mean, that's part, I guess, of the Feynman diagrams."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "Is this these virtual particles, okay."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "Some of these have mass, some of them don't."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "What does that even mean, not to have mass?"}, {"time": 2049, "text": "And maybe you can say which one of them have mass and which don't."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "And why is mass important or relevant in this field view of the universe?"}, {"time": 2062, "text": "Well, there are actually only two particles in the standard model that don't have mass, which are the photon and the gluons."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "So they are massless particles, but the electron, the quarks, and there are a bunch of other particles I haven't discussed."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "There's something called a muon and a tau, which are basically heavy versions of the electron that are unstable."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "You can make them in accelerators, but they don't form atoms or anything."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "They don't exist for long enough."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "But all the matter particles, there are 12 of them, six quarks and six, what we call leptons, which includes the electron and its two heavy versions and three neutrinos, all of them have mass."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "And so do, this is the critical bit."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So the weak force, which is the third of these quantum forces, which is one of the hardest to understand, the force particles of that force have very large masses."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "And there are three of them."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "They're called the W plus, the W minus, and the Z boson."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "And they have masses of between 80 and 90 times that of the protons."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "They're very heavy."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "They're very heavy things."}, {"time": 2127, "text": "So they're what, the heaviest, I guess?"}, {"time": 2129, "text": "They're not the heaviest."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "The heaviest particle is the top quark, which has a mass of about 175 ish protons."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "So that's really massive."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "And we don't know why it's so massive, but coming back to the weak force, so the problem in the 60s and 70s was that the reason that the electromagnetic force is a force that we can experience in our everyday lives."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "So if we have a magnet and a piece of metal, you can hold it, you know, a meter apart if it's powerful enough and you'll feel a force."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "Whereas the weak force only becomes apparent when you basically have two particles touching at the scale of a nucleus."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "So we just get to very short distances before this force becomes manifest."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "It's not, we don't get weak forces going on in this room."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "We don't notice them."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And the reason for that is that the particle, well, the field that transmits the weak force, the particle that's associated with that field has a very large mass, which means that the field dies off very quickly."}, {"time": 2186, "text": "So as you, whereas an electric charge, if you were to look at the shape of the electromagnetic field, it would fall off with this, you have this thing called the inverse square law, which is the idea that the force halves every time you double the distance."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "No, sorry, it doesn't half."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "It quarters every time you double the distance between say the two particles."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "Whereas the weak force kind of, you move a little bit away from the nucleus and just disappears."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "The reason for that is because these fields, the particles that go with them have a very large mass."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "But the problem that theorists faced in the 60s was that if you tried to introduce massive force fields, the theory gave you nonsensical answers."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "So you'd end up with infinite results for a lot of the calculations you tried to do."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "So the basically, it seemed that quantum field theory was incompatible with having massive particles, not just the force particles actually, but even the electron was a problem."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "So this is where the Higgs that we sort of alluded to comes in."}, {"time": 2245, "text": "And the solution was to say, okay, well, actually all the particles in the Standard Model are mass."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "They have no mass."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "So the quarks, the electron, they don't have a mass."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "Neither do these weak particles."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "They don't have mass either."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "What happens is they actually acquire mass through another process."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "They get it from somewhere else."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "They don't actually have it intrinsically."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "So this idea that was introduced by, well, Peter Higgs is the most famous, but actually there are about six people that came up with the idea more or less at the same time, is that you introduce a new quantum field, which is another one of these invisible things that's everywhere."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "And it's through the interaction with this field that particles get mass."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "So you can think of say an electron in the Higgs field, the Higgs field kind of bunches around the electron."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "It's sort of drawn towards the electron."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And that energy that's stored in that field around the electron is what we see as the mass of the electron."}, {"time": 2299, "text": "But if you could somehow turn off the Higgs field, then all the particles in nature would become massless and fly around at the speed of light."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So this idea of the Higgs field allowed other people, other theorists to come up with a, well, it was another, basically a unified theory of the electromagnetic force and the weak force."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "So once you bring in the Higgs field, you can combine two of the forces into one."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "So it turns out the electromagnetic force and the weak force are just two aspects of the same fundamental force."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And at the LHC, we go to high enough energies that you see these two forces unifying effectively."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "So first of all, it started as a theoretical notion, like this is some, and then, I mean, wasn't the Higgs called the God particle at some point?"}, {"time": 2350, "text": "It was by a guy trying to sell popular science books, yeah."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "Yeah, but I mean, I remember because when I was hearing it, I thought it would, I mean, that would solve a lot of, that unify a lot of our ideas of physics was my notion."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "But maybe you can speak to that."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "Is it as big of a leap as a God particle or is it a Jesus particle, which, you know, what's the big contribution of Higgs in terms of this unification power?"}, {"time": 2380, "text": "Yeah, I mean, to understand that, it maybe helps know the history a little bit."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "So when the, what we call electroweak theory was put together, which is where you unify electromagnetism with the weak force and Higgs is involved in all of that."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "So that theory, which was written in the mid 70s, predicted the existence of four new particles, the W plus boson, the W minus boson, the Z boson and the Higgs boson."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "So there were these four particles that came with the theory, that were predicted by the theory."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "In 1983, 84, the W's and the Z particles were discovered at an accelerator at CERN called the super proton synchrotron, which was a seven kilometer particle collider."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "So three of the bits of this theory had already been found."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "So people were pretty confident from the 80s that the Higgs must exist because it was a part of this family of particles that this theoretical structure only works if the Higgs is there."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "So what then happens, and so you've got this question about why is the LHC the size it is?"}, {"time": 2439, "text": "Well, actually the tunnel that the LHC is in was not built for the LHC."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "It was built for a previous accelerator called the large electron positron collider."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "So that began operation in the late 80s, early 90s."}, {"time": 2453, "text": "They basically, that's when they dug the 27 kilometer tunnel."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "They put this accelerator into it, the collider that fires electrons and anti electrons at each other, electrons and positrons."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "So the purpose of that machine was, well, it was actually to look for the Higgs."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "That was one of the things it was trying to do."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "It didn't have enough energy to do it in the end."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "But the main thing it achieved was it studied the W and the Z particles at very high precision."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "So it made loads of these things."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "Previously, you can only make a few of them at the previous accelerator."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "So you could study these really, really precisely."}, {"time": 2484, "text": "And by studying their properties, you could really test this electroweak theory that had been invented in the 70s and really make sure that it worked."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "So actually by 1999, when this machine turned off, people knew, well, okay, you never know until you find the thing."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "But people were really confident this electroweak theory was right."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "And that the Higgs almost, the Higgs or something very like the Higgs had to exist because otherwise the whole thing doesn't work."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "It'd be really weird if you could discover and these particles, they all behave exactly as your theory tells you they should."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "But somehow this key piece of the picture is not there."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "So in a way, it depends how you look at it."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "The discovery of the Higgs on its own is obviously a huge achievement in many, both experimentally and theoretically."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "On the other hand, it's like having a jigsaw puzzle where every piece has been filled in."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "You have this beautiful image, there's one gap and you kind of know that piece must be there somewhere."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "So the discovery in itself, although it's important, is not so interesting."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "It's like a confirmation of the obvious at that point."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "But what makes it interesting is not that it just completes the standard model, which is a theory that we've known had the basic layout offs for 40 years or more now."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "It's that the Higgs actually is a unique particle."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "It's very different to any of the other particles in the standard model."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "And it's a theoretically very troublesome particle."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "There are a lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs, but also opportunities."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "So that we basically, we don't really understand how such an object can exist in the form that it does."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "So there are lots of reasons for thinking that the Higgs must come with a bunch of other particles or that it's perhaps made of other things."}, {"time": 2595, "text": "So it's not a fundamental particle, that it's made of smaller things."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "I can talk about that if you like a bit."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "That's still a notion, so the Higgs might not be a fundamental particle, that there might be some, it might, oh man."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "So that is an idea, it's not been demonstrated to be true."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "But I mean, all of these ideas basically come from the fact that this is a problem that motivated a lot of development in physics in the last 30 years or so."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "And it's this basic fact that the Higgs field, which is this field that's everywhere in the universe, this is the thing that gives mass to the particles."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "And the Higgs field is different from all the other fields in that, let's say you take the electromagnetic field, which is, if we actually were to measure the electromagnetic field in this room, we would measure all kinds of stuff going on because there's light, there's gonna be microwaves and radio waves and stuff."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "But let's say we could go to a really, really remote part of empty space and shield it and put a big box around it and then measure the electromagnetic field in that box."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "The field would be almost zero, apart from some little quantum fluctuations, but basically it goes to naught."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "The Higgs field has a value everywhere."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "So it's a bit like the whole, it's like the entire space has got this energy stored in the Higgs field, which is not zero, it's finite, it's a bit like having the temperature of space raised to some background temperature."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "And it's that energy that gives mass to the particles."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "So the reason that electrons and quarks have mass is through the interaction with this energy that's stored in the Higgs field."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "Now, it turns out that the precise value this energy has has to be very carefully tuned if you want a universe where interesting stuff can happen."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "And at that point, if the Higgs field was that strong, even an electron would become so massive that it would collapse into a black hole."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "And then you have a universe made of black holes and nothing like us."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So it seems that the strength of the Higgs field is to achieve the value that we see requires what we call fine tuning of the laws of physics."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "You have to fiddle around with the other fields in the Standard Model and their properties to just get it to this right sort of Goldilocks value that allows atoms to exist."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "This is deeply fishy."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "People really dislike this."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "Well, yeah, I guess, so what would be, so two explanations."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "One, there's a god that designed this perfectly, and two is there's an infinite number of alternate universes, and we just happen to be in the one in which life is possible, complexity."}, {"time": 2772,

mean, yeah, so you laid out two of the possible explanations."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "Some, well, yeah, I mean, well, someone, some cosmic creator went, yeah, let's fix that to be at the right level."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "That's one possibility, I guess."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "It's not a scientifically testable one, but theoretically, I guess, it's possible."}, {"time": 2808,

in nature, which is a symmetry between force particles and matter particles."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "So what we call fermions, which are the matter particles and bosons, which are force particles."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "And if you have supersymmetry, then there is a super partner for every particle in the standard model."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "And without going into the

sensible value."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "So in supersymmetry, you naturally, without any tinkering about with the constants of nature or anything, you get a Higgs field with a nice value, which is the one we see."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "So this is one of the, and supersymmetry's also got lots of other things going for it."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "It predicts the existence of a dark matter

of mixtures of these composite particles."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Is it possible that the deeper order includes like almost a single entity, so like something that I guess like string theory dreams

a hunter and you're kind of like, let's say there's the relevance, very rare."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "You don't know where in the jungle, the jungle's big."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "So there's two

the difference between the different, the four experiments, for example, that you mentioned, is it the kind of particles that are being collided?"}, {"time": 3744, "text": "Is it the energies which they're collided?"}, {"time": 3747, "text": "What's the fundamental difference between the different experiments?"}, {"time": 3750, "text": "The collisions are the same."}, {"time": 3752, "text":

are basically barrel shaped machines and the collisions happen in the middle of the barrel and the barrel captures all the particles that go flying out in every direction."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "So in a sphere effectively that can fly out and it can record all of those particles."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "And what's the, sorry to be interrupting, but what's the mechanism of the recording?"}, {"time": 3777, "text": "Oh, so these detectors, if you've seen pictures of them, they're huge, like Atlas is 25 meters high and 45 meters long, they're vast machines, instruments, I guess you should call them really."}, {"time": 3789, "text": "They are, they're kind of like onions."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "So they have layers, concentric layers of detectors, different sorts of detectors."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "So close into the beam pipe, you have what are called usually made of silicon, they're tracking detectors."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "So they're little made of strips of silicon or pixels of silicon."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "And when a particle goes through the silicon, it gives a little electrical signal and you get these dots, electrical dots through your detector, which allows you to reconstruct the trajectory of the particle."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "So that's the middle and then the outsides of these detectors, you have things called calorimeters, which measure the energies of the particles and the very edge you have things called muon chambers, which basically these muon particles, which are the heavy version of the electron, they're like high velocity bullets and they can get right to the edge of the detectors."}, {"time": 3830, "text": "If you see something at the edge, that's a muon."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "So that's broadly how they work."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "And all of that is being recorded."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "That's all being fed out to, you know, computers."}, {"time": 3838, "text": "Data must be awesome, okay."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "So LHCb is different."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "So we, because we're looking for these be quarks, be quarks tend to be produced along the beam line."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "So in a collision, the be quark tend to fly sort of close to the beam pipe."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "So we built a detector that sort of pyramid cone shaped basically, that just looks in one direction."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "So we ignore, if you have your collision, stuff goes everywhere."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "We ignore all the stuff over here and going off sideways."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "We're just looking in this little region close to the beam pipe where most of these be quarks are made."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "So is there a different aspect of the sensors involved in the collection of the be quark trajectories?"}, {"time": 3877, "text": "There are some differences."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "So one of the differences is that, one of the ways you know you've seen a be quark is that be quarks are actually quite long lived by particle standards."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "So they live for 1.5 trillionths of a second, which is if you're a fundamental particle is a very long time."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "Cause the Higgs boson, I think lives for about a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, or maybe even less than that."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "So these are quite long lived things and they will actually fly a little distance before they decay."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "So they will fly a few centimeters maybe if you're lucky, then they'll decay into other stuff."}, {"time": 3907, "text": "So what we need to do in the middle of the detector, you wanna be able to see, you have your place where the protons crash into each other and that produces loads of particles that come flying out."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "So you have loads of lines, loads of tracks that point back to that proton collision."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "And then you're looking for a couple of other tracks, maybe two or three that point back to a different place that's maybe a few centimeters away from the proton collision."}, {"time": 3928, "text": "And that's the sign that a little B particle has flown a few centimeters and decayed somewhere else."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "So we need to be able to very accurately resolve the proton collision from the B particle decay."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "So the middle of our detector is very sensitive and it gets very close to the collision."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "So you have this really beautiful delicate silicon detector that sits, I think it's seven millimeters from the beam."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "And the LHC beam has as much energy as a jumbo jet at takeoff."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "So it's enough to melt a ton of copper."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "So you have this furiously powerful thing sitting next to this tiny delicate silicon sensor."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "So those aspects of our detector that are specialized to measure these particular B quarks that we're interested in."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "And is there, I mean, I remember seeing somewhere that there's some mention of matter and antimatter connected to the B, these beautiful quarks."}, {"time": 3978, "text": "Is that, what's the connection?"}, {"time": 3983, "text": "Yeah, what's the connection there?"}, {"time": 3985, "text": "Yeah, so there is a connection, which is that when you produce these B particles, these particles, because you don't see the B quark, you see the thing that B quark is inside."}, {"time": 3995, "text": "So they're bound up inside what we call beauty particles, where the B quark is joined together with another quark or two, maybe two other quarks, depending on what it is."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "They're a particular set of these B particles that exhibit this property called oscillation."}, {"time": 4009, "text": "So if you make a, for the sake of argument, a matter version of one of these B particles, as it travels, because of the magic of quantum mechanics, it oscillates backwards and forwards between its matter and antimatter versions."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "So it does this weird flipping about backwards and forwards."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "And what we can use this for is a laboratory for testing the symmetry between matter and antimatter."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "So if the symmetry between antimatter is precise, it's exact, then we should see these B particles decaying as often as matter, as they do as antimatter, because this oscillation should be even."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "It should spend as much time in each state."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "But what we actually see is that one of the states, it spends more time and it's more likely to decay in one state than the other."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "So this gives us a way of testing this fundamental symmetry between matter and antimatter."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "So what can you, sort of returning to the question before about this fundamental symmetry, it seems like if there's perfect symmetry between matter and antimatter, if we have the equal amount of each in our universe, it would just destroy itself."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "And just like you mentioned, we seem to live in a very unlikely universe where it doesn't destroy itself."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "So do you have some intuition about why that is?"}, {"time": 4087, "text": "I mean, well, I'm not a theorist."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "I don't have any particular ideas myself."}, {"time": 4108, "text": "They always come together."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "They always annihilate together."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "So there's no way of making more matter than antimatter that we've discovered so far."}, {"time": 4115, "text": "So that means in the Big Bang, you get equal amounts of matter and antimatter."}, {"time": 4118, "text": "As the universe expands and cools down during the Big Bang, not very long after the Big Bang, I think a few seconds after the Big Bang, you have this event called the Great Annihilation, which is where all the particles and antiparticles smack into each other, annihilate, turn into light mostly, and you end up with a universe later on."}, {"time": 4135, "text": "If that was what happened, then the universe we live in today would be black and empty, apart from some photons, that would be it."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "So there is stuff in the universe."}, {"time": 4143, "text": "It appears to be just made of matter."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "So there's this big mystery as to how did this happen?"}, {"time": 4148, "text": "And there are various ideas, which all involve sort of physics going on in the first trillionth of a second or so of the Big Bang."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "So it could be that one possibility is that the Higgs field is somehow implicated in this, that there was this event that took place in the early universe where the Higgs field basically switched on, it acquired its modern value."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "And when that happened, this caused all the particles to acquire mass and the universe basically went through a phase transition where you had a hot plasma of massless particles."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "And then in that plasma, it's almost like a gas turning into droplets of water."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "You get kind of these little bubbles forming in the universe where the Higgs field has acquired its modern value, the particles have got mass."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "And this phase transition in some models can cause more matter than antimatter to be produced, depending on how matter bounces off these bubbles in the early universe."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "So that's one idea."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "There's other ideas to do with neutrinos, that there are exotic types of neutrinos that can decay in a biased way to just matter and not to antimatter."}, {"time": 4210, "text": "So, and people are trying to test these ideas."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "That's what we're trying to do at LHCb."}, {"time": 4214,

of these ideas might be right."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "So we're talking about some incredible ideas."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "By the way, never heard anyone be so eloquent about describing even just the standard model."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "So I'm in awe just listening."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "Oh, thank you."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "Yeah, just having fun enjoying it."}, {"time":

side of it."}, {"time": 4247, "text": "That a bunch of sort of brilliant people that probably have egos got together and were collaborate together and countries, I guess, collaborate together for the funds and everything's just collaboration everywhere."}, {"time": 4263, "text": "Cause you may be, I don't know what the right question here to ask, but almost what's your intuition about how it was possible to make this happen and what are the lessons we should learn for the future of human civilization in terms of our scientific progress?"}, {"time": 4277, "text": "Cause it seems like this is a great, great illustration of us working together to do something big."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "Yeah, I think it's possibly the best example."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "Maybe I can think of international collaboration that isn't for some unpleasant purpose, basically."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "You know, I mean, so when I started out in the field in 2008 as a new PhD student, the LHC was basically finished."}, {"time": 4301, "text": "So I didn't have to go around asking for money for it or trying to make the case."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "So I have huge admiration for the people who managed that."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "Cause this was a project that was first imagined in the 1970s, in the late 70s was when the first conversations about the LHC were mooted and it took two and a half decades of campaigning and fundraising and persuasion until they started breaking ground and building the thing in the early noughties in 2000."}, {"time": 4328, "text": "So, I mean, I think the reason just from a sort of, from the point of view of the sort of science, the scientists there, I think the reason it works ultimately is that everywhere, everyone there is there for the same reason, which is, well, in principle, at least they're there because they're interested in the world."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "They want to find out, you know, what are the basic ingredients of our universe?"}, {"time": 4349, "text": "What are the laws of nature?"}, {"time": 4351, "text": "And so everyone is pulling in the same direction."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "Now, of course, everyone has their own things they're interested in."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "Everyone has their own careers to consider."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "And, you know, I wouldn't pretend that there isn't also a lot of competition."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "So there's this funny thing in these experiments where your collaborators, your 800 collaborators in LHCb, but you're also competitors because your academics in your various universities and you want to be the one that gets the paper out on the most exciting, you know, new measurements."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "So there's this funny thing where you're kind of trying to stake out your territory while also collaborating and having to work together to make the experiments work."}, {"time": 4380, "text": "And it does work amazingly well, actually considering all of that."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "And I think there was actually, I think McKinsey or one of these big management consultancy firms went into CERN maybe a decade or so ago to try to understand how these organizations function."}, {"time": 4395, "text": "Did they figure it out?"}, {"time": 4396, "text": "I don't think they could."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "I mean, I think one of the things that's interesting, one of the other interesting things about these experiments is, you know, they're big operations like say Atlas has 3000 people."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "Now there was a person nominally who was the head of Atlas, they're called the spokesperson."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "And the spokesperson is elected by, usually by the collaboration, but they have no actual power really."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "I mean, they can't fire anyone."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "They're not anyone's boss."}, {"time": 4419, "text": "So, you know, my boss is a professor at Cambridge, not the head of my experiments."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "The head of my experiment can't tell me what to do really."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "And there's all these independent academics who are their own bosses who, you know, so that somehow it, nonetheless, by kind of consensus and discussion and lots of meetings, these things do happen and it does get done, but."}, {"time": 4441, "text": "It's like the queen here in the UK is the spokesperson."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "I guess so."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "No actual power."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "Except we don't elect her, no."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "No, we don't elect her."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "But everybody seems to love her."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "I don't know, from my outside perspective."},

said just there, just the brilliant people thing."}, {"time": 4465, "text": "Cause I'm not saying that people aren't great."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "But I think there is this sort of impression that physicists all have to be brilliant or geniuses, which is not true actually."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "And you know, you have to be relatively bright for sure."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "But you know, a lot of people, a lot of the most successful experimental physicists are not necessarily the people with the biggest brains."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "They're the people who, you know, particularly one of the skills that's most important in particle physics is the ability to work with others and to collaborate and exchange ideas and also to work hard."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And it's a sort of, often it's more a determination or a sort of other set of skills."}, {"time": 4497, "text": "It's not just being, you know, kind of some great brain."}, {"time": 4502, "text": "So, I mean, there's parallels to that in the machine learning world."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "If you wanna solve any real world problems, which I see as the particle accelerators, essentially a real world instantiation of theoretical physics."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "And for that, you have to not necessarily be brilliant, but be sort of obsessed, systematic, rigorous, sort of unborable, stubborn, all those kind of qualities that make for a great engineer."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "So, scientists purely speaking, that practitioner of the scientific method."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "But nevertheless, to me that's brilliant."}, {"time": 4541, "text": "I argue with him all the time."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "To me, engineering is the highest form of science."}, {"time": 4546, "text": "And he thinks that's all nonsense, that the real work is done by the theoretician."}, {"time": 4550, "text": "So, in fact, we have arguments about like people like Elon Musk, for example, because I think his work is quite brilliant, but he's fundamentally not coming up with any serious breakthroughs."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "He's just creating in this world, implementing, like making ideas happen that have a huge impact."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "To me, that's the Edison."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "That to me is a brilliant work, but to him, it's messy details that somebody will figure out anyway."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "I mean, I don't know whether you think there is a actual difference in temperament between say a physicist and an engineer, whether it's just what you got interested in."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "I mean, a lot of what experimental physicists do is to some extent engineering."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "I mean, it's not what I do."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "I mostly do data stuff, but a lot of people would be called electrical engineers, but they trained as physicists, but they learned electrical engineering, for example, because they were building detectors."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "So, there's not such a clear divide, I think."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "I mean, but there does seem to be, like you work with data."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "There does seem to be a certain, like I love data collection."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "There might be an OCD element or something that you're more naturally predisposed to as opposed to theory."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "Like I'm not afraid of data."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "I love data."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "And there's a lot of people in machine learning who are more like, they're basically afraid of data collection, afraid of data sets, afraid of all of that."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "They just want to stay in more than theoretical and they're really good at it, space."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "So, I don't know if that's the genetic, that's your upbringing, the way you go to school, but looking into the future of LHC and other colliders."}, {"time": 4653,

superconducting."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "The desertron, yeah."}, {"time": 4661, "text": "Desertron, yeah."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "So, that was canceled, the construction of that."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "Which is a sad thing, but what do you think is the future of these efforts?"}, {"time": 4674, "text": "Will a bigger collider be built?"}, {"time": 4676, "text": "Will LHC be expanded?"}, {"time": 4679, "text": "Well, in the near future, the LHC is gonna get an upgrade."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "So, that's pretty much confirmed."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "I think it is confirmed, which is, it's not an energy upgrade."}, {"time": 4688, "text": "It's what we call a luminosity upgrade."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "So, it basically means increasing the data collection rates."}, {"time": 4693, "text": "So, more collisions per second, basically, because after a few years of data taking, you get this law of diminishing returns where each year's worth of data is a smaller and smaller fraction of the lot you've already got."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "So, to get a real improvement in sensitivity, you need to increase the data rate by an order of magnitude."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "So, that's what this upgrade is gonna do."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "LHCb, at the moment, the whole detector is basically being rebuilt to allow it to record data at a much larger rate than we could before."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "So, that will make us sensitive to whole loads of new processes that we weren't able to study before."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "And I mentioned briefly these anomalies that we've seen."}, {"time": 4725, "text": "So, we've seen a bunch of very intriguing anomalies in these b quark decays, which may be hinting at the first signs of this kind of the elephant, the signs of some new quantum field or fields maybe beyond the standard model."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "It's not yet at the statistical threshold where you can say that you've observed something, but there's lots of anomalies in many measurements that all seem to be consistent with each other."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "So, it's quite interesting."}, {"time": 4752, "text": "So, the upgrade will allow us to really home in on these things and see whether these anomalies are real, because if they are real, and this kind of connects to your point about the next generation of machines, what we would have seen then is, we would have seen the tail end of some quantum field in influencing these b quarks."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "What we then need to do is to build a bigger collider to actually make the particle of that field."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "So, if these things really do exist."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "So, that would be one argument."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "I mean, so at the moment, Europe is going through this process of thinking about the strategy for the future."}, {"time": 4787, "text": "So, there are a number of different proposals on the table."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "One is for a sort of higher energy upgrade of the LHC, where you just build more powerful magnets and put them in the same tunnel."}, {"time": 4796, "text": "That's a sort of cheaper, less ambitious possibility."}, {"time": 4799, "text": "Most people don't really like it because it's sort of a bit of a dead end, because once you've done that, there's nowhere to go."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "There's a machine called Click, which is a compact linear collider, which is a electron positron collider that uses a novel type of acceleration technology to accelerate at shorter distances."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "We're still talking kilometers long, but not like 100 kilometers long."}, {"time": 4819, "text": "And then probably the project that is, I think getting the most support, it'd be interesting to see what happens, something called the Future Circular Collider, which is a really ambitious longterm multi decade project to build a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel under the Geneva region."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "The LHC would become a kind of feeding machine."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "It would just feed."}, {"time": 4841, "text": "So the same area, so it would be a feeder for the."}, {"time": 4844, "text": "So it would kind of, the edge of this machine would be where the LHC is, but it would sort of go under Lake Geneva and round to the Alps, basically, up to the edge of the Geneva basin."}, {"time": 4852, "text": "So it's basically the biggest tunnel you can fit in the region based on the geology."}, {"time": 4857, "text": "100 kilometers."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "Yeah, so it's big."}, {"time": 4858, "text": "It'd be a long drive if your experiment's on one side."}, {"time": 4861, "text": "You've got to go back to CERN for lunch, so that would be a pain."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "But you know, so this project is, in principle, it's actually two accelerators."}, {"time": 4869, "text": "The first thing you would do is put an electron positron machine in the 100 kilometer tunnel to study the Higgs."}, {"time": 4874, "text": "So you'd make lots of Higgs bows and study it really precisely in the hope that you see it misbehaving and doing something it's not supposed to."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "And then in the much longer term, 100, that machine gets taken out, you put in a proton proton machine."}, {"time": 4886, "text": "So it's like the LHC, but much bigger."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "And that's the way you start going and looking for dark matter, or you're trying to recreate this phase transition that I talked about in the early universe, where you can see matter anti matter being made, for example."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "There's lots of things you can do with these machines."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "The problem is that they will take, you know, the most optimistic, you're not gonna have any data from any of these machines until 2040, or, you know, because they take such a long time to build and they're so expensive."}, {"time": 4912, "text": "So you have, there'll be a process of R&D design, but also the political case being made."}, {"time": 4917, "text": "So LHC, what costs a few billion?"}, {"time": 4921, "text": "Depends how you count it."}, {"time": 4923, "text": "I think most of the sort of more reasonable estimates that take everything into account properly, it's around the sort of 10, 11, 12 billion euro mark."}, {"time": 4930, "text": "What would be the future, sorry, I forgot the name already."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "Future Circular Collider."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "Presumably they won't call it that when it's built, cause it won't be the future anymore."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "But I don't know, I don't know what they'll call it then."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "The very big Hadron Collider, I don't know."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "But that will, now I should know the numbers, but I think the whole project is estimated at about 30 billion euros, but that's money spent over between now and 2070 probably, which is when the last bit of it would be sort of finishing up, I guess."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "So you're talking a half a century of science coming out of this thing, shared by many countries."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "So the actual cost, the arguments that are made is that you could make this project fit within the existing budget of CERN, if you didn't do anything else."}, {"time": 4977, "text": "And CERN, by the way, we didn't mention, what is CERN?"}, {"time": 4980, "text": "CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "It's an international organization that was established in the 1950s in the wake of the second world war as a kind of, it was sort of like a scientific Marshall plan for Europe."}, {"time": 4992, "text": "The idea was that you bring European science back together for peaceful purposes, because what happened in the forties was, a lot of particular Jewish scientists, but a lot of scientists from central Europe had fled to the United States and Europe had sort of seen this brain drain."}, {"time": 5007, "text": "So there was a desire to bring the community back together for a project that wasn't building nasty bombs, but was doing something that was curiosity driven."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "So, and that has continued since then."}, {"time": 5017, "text": "So it's kind of a unique organization."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "It's you, to be a member as a country, you sort of sign up as a member and then you have to pay a fraction of your GDP each year as a subscription."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "I mean, it's a very small fraction, relatively speaking."}, {"time": 5029, "text": "I think it's like, I think the UK's contribution is a hundred or 200 million quid or something like that."}, {"time": 5034, "text": "Yeah, which is quite a lot, but not so."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "I mean, just the whole thing that is possible, it's beautiful."}, {"time": 5041, "text": "It's a beautiful idea, especially when there's no wars on the line, it's not like we're freaking out, as we're actually legitimately collaborating to do good science."}, {"time": 5049, "text": "One of the things I don't think we really mentioned is on the final side, that sort of the data analysis side, is there breakthroughs possible there and the machine learning side, like is there a lot more signal to be mined in more effective ways from the actual raw data?"}, {"time": 5065, "text": "Yeah, a lot of people are looking into that."}, {"time": 5067, "text": "I mean, so I use machine learning in my data analysis, but pretty naughty, basic stuff, cause I'm not a machine learning expert."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "I'm just a physicist who had to learn to do this stuff for my day job."}, {"time": 5078, "text": "So what a lot of people do is they use kind of off the shelf packages that you can train to do signal noise."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "Just clean up all the data."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "But one of the big challenges, the big challenge of the data is A, it's volume, there's huge amounts of data."}, {"time": 5093, "text": "So the LHC generates, now, okay, I try to remember what the actual numbers are, but if you, we don't record all our data, we record a tiny fraction of the data."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "It's like of order one 10,000th or something, I think."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "Is that right?"}, {"time": 5105, "text": "Around that."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "So most of it gets thrown away."}, {"time": 5108, "text": "You couldn't record all the LHC data cause it would fill up every computer in the world in a matter of days, basically."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "So there's this process that happens on live, on the detector, something called a trigger, which in real time, 40 million times every second has to make a decision about whether this collision is likely to contain an interesting object, like a Higgs boson or a dark matter particle."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "And it has to do that very fast."}, {"time": 5129, "text": "And the software algorithms in the past were quite relatively basic."}, {"time": 5136, "text": "They did things like measure mementos and energies of particles and put some requirements."}, {"time": 5140, "text": "So you would say, if there's a particle with an energy above some threshold, then record this collision."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "But if there isn't, don't."}, {"time": 5146, "text": "Whereas now the attempt is get more and more machine learning in at the earliest possible stage."}, {"time": 5151, "text": "That's cool, at the stage of deciding whether we want to keep this data or not."}, {"time": 5155, "text": "But also maybe even lower down than that, which is the point where there's this, so generally how the data is reconstructed is you start off with a set of digital hits in your detector."}, {"time": 5167, "text": "So channels saying, did you see something?"}, {"time": 5168, "text": "Did you not see something?"}, {"time": 5170, "text": "That has to be then turned into tracks, particles going in different directions."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And that's done by using fits that fit through the data points."}, {"time": 5177, "text": "And then that's passed to the algorithms that then go, is this interesting or not?"}, {"time": 5180, "text": "What'd be better is you could train machine learning to just look at the raw hits, the basic real base level information, not have any of the reconstruction done."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "And it just goes, and it can learn to do pattern recognition on this strange three dimensional image that you get."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "And potentially that's where you could get really big gains because our triggers tend to be quite inefficient because they don't have time to do the full whiz bang processing to get all the information out that we would like, because you have to do the decision very quickly."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "So if you can come up with some clever machine learning technique, then potentially you can massively increase the amount of useful data you record and get rid of more of the background earlier in the process."}, {"time": 5219, "text": "Yeah, to me, that's an exciting possibility because then you don't have to build a sort of, you can get a gain without having to."}, {"time": 5228, "text": "Without having to build any hardware, I suppose."}, {"time": 5230, "text": "Hardware, yeah."}, {"time": 5231, "text": "Although you need lots of new GPU farms, I guess."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "So hardware still helps."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "But I got to talk to you, sort of I'm not sure how to ask, but you're clearly an incredible science communicator."}, {"time": 5247, "text": "I don't know if that's the right term, but you're basically a younger Neil deGrasse

London, which is a very old organization."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "It's been around for about 200 years now, I think."}, {"time": 5267, "text": "Maybe even I should know when it was founded."},

scientists would come and give talks."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "So very famously Humphrey Davy, who you may know of, who was the person who discovered nitrous oxide."}, {"time": 5287, "text": "He was a very famous chemist and scientist."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "Also discovered electrolysis."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "So he used to do these fantastic, he was a very charismatic speaker."},

London back in the early 19th century."}, {"time": 5303, "text": "And Michael Faraday, who I talked about, who is the person who did so much work on electromagnetism, he used, he lectured here."},

research."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "So you gave a few lectures here."}, {"time": 5318, "text": "How many, two?"}, {"time": 5319, "text": "I've given, yeah, I've given a couple of lectures in this theater before, so."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "I mean, that's, so people should definitely go watch online."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "It's just the explanation of particle physics."}, {"time": 5328,

it was awesome."}, {"time": 5335, "text": "But maybe can you say, what did that feel like?"}, {"time": 5340, "text": "What does it feel like to lecture here, to talk about that?"}, {"time": 5343,

check out."}, {"time": 5388, "text": "I mean, and their channel's got loads of great talks with loads of great people as well."}, {"time": 5392, "text": "I mean, that one, I'd sort of given a version of it many times, so part of it is just practice, right?"}, {"time": 5397, "text": "And actually, I don't have some great theory of how to communicate with people."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "It's more just that I'm really interested and excited by those ideas and I like talking about them."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "And through the process of doing that, I guess I figured out stories that work and

not an area where you're gonna out technique him."}, {"time": 5859, "text": "And so we've gotta now channel some of that grit that we know you have."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "This is an opportunity to showcase it."}, {"time": 5864, "text": "And I don't know how long I did it for, because Kyle's much shorter than Zabit."}, {"time": 5869, "text": "So for a good long while, while we were training for Zabit, I didn't even say anything."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "And I just had clips of Mike Tyson training on the TV in the gym and the head movement."}, {"time": 5878, "text": "And I didn't even mention it."}, {"time": 5879, "text": "And then we started to like get into it and talk about getting inside the length of the longer fighter and things like that."}, {"time": 5886, "text": "And we kind of, which when some people train MMA, they say, okay, this guy's a really good wrestler."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "Let's think about avoiding the wrestling or being a better wrestler."},

down and you don't have a lot of wrestling experience, he's probably gonna get you down if he's got a good coach, right?"}, {"time": 5910, "text": "So you have to deal with that."}, {"time": 5912, "text": "To then say, I'm gonna then learn in eight weeks how to wrestle better than a guy who's been wrestling since he was eight years old is also a bad idea."}, {"time": 5919, "text": "So what we

"text": "So I don't remember exactly the techniques we worked on, but we concentrated on defend the first takedown and stay out of the chain."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "Don't get chained into a bunch of wrestling techniques cause you will be out wrestled."}, {"time": 5954, "text": "And that was really successful."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "And then in the third round, Zabit was tired."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "He was tired."}, {"time": 5960, "text": "He's Zabit got tired."}, {"time": 5961, "text": "He cuts a tremendous amount of weight."}, {"time": 5963, "text": "Like I can't see him staying at 145 forever when they start giving him five round fights."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "I don't even know if he's had a five round fight and he may have, but I can't see him staying down there."},

was no power left in Zabit's hands."}, {"time": 5983, "text": "And so he felt fine."}, {"time": 5984, "text": "And I think part of it was he fed off the crowd as he moved forward and, you know, saw that he wasn't taking a lot of damage."}, {"time": 5994, "text": "Like the punches weren't staying him."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "He started walking right through him."}, {"time": 5998, "text": "It goes to your question of what makes a fighter."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "Was the, him walking forward like that, something that you're born with or is that something you were training?"}, {"time":

lot."}, {"time": 6016, "text": "Was he in Boston?"}, {"time": 6017, "text": "No, he was in New York."}, {"time": 6018, "text": "He was in Brooklyn."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "I've been in a lot of arenas for a lot of different sporting events."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "That's one of the loudest things I've ever heard when he did that."}, {"time": 6024, "text": "I was going crazy."}, {"time": 6026, "text": "And you ask about that being like taught or not."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "Kyle is so much like that, that I have to try and tease some of that out of him, pull it back."}, {"time": 6034, "text": "Because he's also so very technical when he wants to be that the emotion and the fun of it gets in the way of his technique."}, {"time": 6043, "text": "And probably has cost him a couple of wins."}, {"time": 6047, "text": "And so that's one of the things we work on with him right now."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "It's like staying within yourself, being a professional, taking your time to download the information in round one and then starting your fight in round two."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "But the tension between those two things, what makes, what on that day created one of the, in my opinion, one of the greatest fights I've ever seen."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "Joe Rogan agrees."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "Yeah, it's one of the greatest fights I've certainly ever seen."}, {"time": 6070, "text": "So like, it's funny that you as a coach, I can see the frustration of like, like throwing away some of the strategy kind of thing."}, {"time": 6080, "text": "Like you seeing like being not happy that there could be things that he could have done to win the fight."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "It's in retrospect."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "I think that at that time, we were playing with incredible house money."}, {"time": 6090, "text": "Like Kyle was a gigantic underdog in that fight."}, {"time": 6093, "text": "Zabit was unstoppable."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "I think people were probably picking him to finish the fight in round one."}, {"time": 6097, "text": "I think at that point, no one had ever gone the distance with Zabit."}, {"time": 6100, "text": "And no one certainly had, you know, put that kind of performance together."}, {"time": 6103, "text": "And I think Kyle put the blueprint out there."}, {"time": 6107, "text": "And in retrospect, when I look at the last round, yeah, there were things that could have been done differently, but we're playing with house money at that point."}, {"time": 6115, "text": "Like, I mean, let it fly."},

table and, you know, see what happens."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "Do you remember what Joe Rogan said about it?"}, {"time": 6127, "text": "I remember like he got won over."}, {"time": 6129, "text": "I think I have trouble remembering because offline we talked about that fight and he's exceptionally impressed by, I mean, Joe's from Boston, so it's like, I mean, there's a story there."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "Okay, it sucks not, you naturally want to romanticize, like there's a Rocky versus like, there's a Rocky IV, a Draga."}, {"time": 6150, "text": "I mean, similar, I suppose, kind of chemistry."}, {"time": 6155, "text": "Kyle's style represents the American."}, {"time": 6159, "text": "Ideal, right?"}, {"time": 6160, "text": "The spirit."}, {"time": 6161, "text": "Yeah, I mean, he's from Gloucester."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "It's like, you could have dragged him off the docks three hours before the fight and said, hey, you want to go fight?"}, {"time": 6168, "text": "And he would have said yes."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "Oh man, that was a special fight."}, {"time": 6171, "text": "But that's, as per a discussion of like greatest fighters of all time, I tend to believe that that fight is more special than the championship belt defenses by George St. Pierre."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "Like, you know, there's something to that."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "It's like Rocky, Rocky I is more special than like Rocky III, right?"}, {"time": 6195, "text": "So like, it's the underdog or it's whatever, like the dance partner is like going to war and like that moment, I mean, it's bigger."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "It's bigger than any individual fighter."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "They create that and that, I know it's not perhaps good for a career."}, {"time": 6212, "text": "It's not good for like in terms of money, in terms of longevity, in terms of all those kinds of things, but that's a special moment in the history of fighting that you both created."},

was so excited at the end of it that I had forgotten what happened in the other two rounds."}, {"time": 6233, "text": "I didn't even know."}, {"time": 6233, "text": "And I looked to Sean, one of the other corner men, and I think I said to him, did we win?"}, {"time": 6238, "text": "When you rewatch the fight, clearly we didn't win the fight."}, {"time": 6241, "text": "I mean, we lost the other rounds, but I got so caught up in that moment and I just remember like, I was so in awe of his performance that like I forgot what was going on."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "And it's so hard to not be a fan at that moment and to stay within yourself and try and like coach, but then what the fuck you even coaching at that point?"}, {"time": 6260, "text": "It's like, we're rumbling."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "We got 30 seconds."}, {"time": 6262, "text": "We're trying to win here."}, {"time": 6263, "text": "And I remember like the performance itself, I'm not a fan of moral victories, but if ever there was gonna be one, that was one."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "And when the fight was over and I grabbed Kyle, like they hadn't even been to the center of the cage yet."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "And I just hugged him and I said, you're my fucking hero."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "And I remember being very emotional about that, that I was able to be a part of that."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "It feels wrong to say, but I was, I kind of avoided saying it, but I think if I'm being honest with my feelings, this is a safe space for feelings."}, {"time": 6292, "text": "Is I think it was the greatest mixed martial arts fight I've ever seen."}, {"time": 6299, "text": "And I don't think I'm being biased."}, {"time": 6300, "text": "I was honestly thinking like, am I being biased?"}, {"time": 6302, "text": "I honestly don't think so."}, {"time": 6305, "text": "I think that was the greatest fight."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "Like if you wanna rank fights I've ever seen, I think to me that was the greatest fight I've ever seen."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "It certainly was one of the greatest displays of like just dogged effort from an underdog who was out experienced and probably outsized."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "But I mean, like you just, Kyle's one of those kids, you're never gonna tell him he's out of a fight."}, {"time": 6327, "text": "He has something you can't teach."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "And I've seen tons of people with more physical attributes and they're just mental midgets and they got a million dollar body and a 50 cent heart."}, {"time": 6339,

6358, "text": "She's a fickle mistress."}, {"time": 6361, "text": "Yeah, I mean, the tragic aspect of that is like, I guess Kyle lost, right?"}, {"time": 6370, "text": "So like if you look at the record and all the kind of things, perhaps like you look at the career, maybe like as a financial, from a financial perspective that perhaps is not the greatest thing for Kyle's career or that or in the history of the UFC, perhaps it's not like maybe many people didn't even watch that fight, but it was a special moment that stands in the history."}, {"time": 6400, "text": "There's not many of

near term?"}, {"time": 6422, "text": "Sure, but when you look back on your life, you're not gonna look back on that loss as something that derailed my life financially and I never recovered from it."}, {"time": 6428, "text": "That's not gonna happen."}, {"time": 6430, "text": "Like the sad thing is, is unless you were a champion and most people are gonna be forgotten right after they're gone."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "Most people will be forgotten."}, {"time": 6438, "text": "And if you're not forgotten, certainly your accolades are gonna be misrepresented."}, {"time": 6442, "text":

experience."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "And when you're in that moment and you're one of the people intimately involved in it, the value of that experience supersedes any financial gain."}, {"time":

worldviews."}, {"time": 9618, "text": "Like he kind of, so that he doesn't feel like it, like it constantly shakes him."}, {"time": 9625, "text": "It's more about him, like constantly pulls him in multiple directions about like how he sees the world, and that keeps him balanced."}, {"time": 9632, "text": "That keeps the conversation kind of exciting."}, {"time": 9635, "text": "I did it in a way

pharmaceutical company, that was very timely because he was able to speak to vaccines."}, {"time": 9650, "text": "And that was kind of scientific flavored."}, {"time": 9653, "text": "And what I learned listening back on that is like I learned for myself about, I wasn't asking the next level questions to really draw out great answers."}, {"time": 9664, "text": "And part of it is you're simultaneously hanging out with a bro, but also I was trying to learn something and I didn't learn what I wanted to learn."}, {"time": 9672, "text": "And that's my fault because I didn't ask the questions."}, {"time": 9675, "text": "He's an expert in that field."}, {"time": 9677, "text": "He doesn't know that I'm an absolute dipshit when it comes to that stuff."}, {"time": 9680, "text": "And

more wild."}, {"time": 9711, "text": "Like being in touch with nature."}, {"time": 9712, "text": "Nature, that kind of wild."}, {"time": 9715, "text": "And then my buddy Dave, he came on because I love music."}, {"time": 9721, "text": "And I wanted to talk a lot about music."}, {"time": 9723, "text": "And he's one of the most knowledgeable people about music that I know."}, {"time": 9726,

things existed that this fucking kid did."}, {"time": 9736, "text": "He's out of his mind."}, {"time": 9737, "text": "And I think Sean and I will have probably the most intellectual conversation that I'll have had on my podcast to date."}, {"time": 9744, "text": "And so there's a little bit of alternating there, but I did it that way so that."}, {"time": 9752, "text": "There's a gut feeling behind, oh, so that what?"}, {"time": 9754, "text": "Is there, where are you going?"}, {"time": 9756, "text": "Do you know where you're going?"}, {"time": 9759, "text": "I don't have a destination,

where it needs to go."}, {"time": 9777, "text": "I think the advice I have for both of us is, I think I need to, no, I don't think so."}, {"time": 9789, "text": "I think for you, I see an inner turmoil."}, {"time": 9792, "text": "I see a storm that bruising you because I feel like there's a concern for what you're saying."}, {"time": 9798, "text": "And is it gonna lead to negative feelings towards you or the thing that you're doing?"}, {"time": 9809, "text": "And I feel like we're different people and I have such an easier time saying fuck off to everybody."}, {"time": 9817, "text": "And that's a liberating thing, but it also can keep me from achieving the thing that I want to achieve, because I'm so flippant with opinions that I don't listen to them and let them direct me when they should."}, {"time": 9834, "text": "Please do."}, {"time": 9835, "text": "I think you believe that about yourself and nevertheless, your social media presence indicates otherwise."}, {"time": 9841, "text": "If I were to be very harsh, you're like one of the mentally strongest character wise people I know."}, {"time": 9847, "text": "And yet on social media, you don't put your face to the world."}, {"time": 9851, "text": "So one of the reasons you sense the fear in me, which exists, I of course want to let go of it, is because I put my face and my name on things."}, {"time": 9863, "text": "And so when I say something stupid, it hurts when people say like, look, that guy said something stupid."}, {"time": 9872, "text": "And so there's a fear of saying something stupid in all of his different forms, like of being my lesser self."}, {"time": 9878, "text": "It's the same feeling I have in competition of losing, not just losing."}, {"time": 9882, "text": "Losing doesn't matter."}, {"time": 9883, "text": "It's embarrassing myself."}, {"time": 9885, "text": "I like losing, being the lesser version of myself."}, {"time": 9888, "text": "And when you put yourself out there in a full way, I think you, I would venture to say you're also, because you said you wouldn't give yourself that advice."}, {"time": 9898, "text": "I feel like you're also afraid of standing behind some of the ideas, because right now you're doing guerrilla warfare."}, {"time": 9903, "text": "You're free to be, to say things, to speak your mind from the sidelines."}, {"time": 9911,

online curriculum."}, {"time": 9932, "text": "That was a big thing for me, because for several reasons, like in the climate of everyone under the sun having a Jiu Jitsu tutorial online and social media, not social media necessarily, but forums specifically that critique and shit the bed."}, {"time": 9949, "text": "One thing I have not done that I've thought about doing, and probably you're right in your analysis of it, is I've not gone the way that I do see you on things like Reddit and say, hey, Reddit, I'm doing this."}, {"time": 9960, "text": "Like I could easily go to Reddit and say, hey, Reddit, I got this website up."}, {"time": 9964, "text": "Here's a sample video, whatever the fuck people do on there."}, {"time": 9967, "text": "But yeah, you're right, I haven't done that."}, {"time": 9968, "text": "And part of it might be because I know also, if I get suckered in for one second into the negativity, I'm gonna become an online warrior, and I don't wanna be that person."}, {"time": 9982, "text": "So yeah, you're probably right."}, {"time": 9983, "text": "So you're self aware about that."}, {"time": 9985, "text": "I mean, one of the things I've early on decided is like, I'm just gonna be, I've always really enjoyed being positive."}, {"time": 9992, "text": "So I'm going to make sure I stay that way."}, {"time": 9995, "text": "And when there's negativity, it's like, I'm not just ignoring it."}, {"time": 10000, "text": "I'm literally just returning it with positivity."}, {"time": 10003, "text": "I probably am the same way as you, most people

you kind of have to read the book to understand what that means."}, {"time": 344, "text": "So the worms are involved, the worms are involved."}, {"time": 347, "text": "You probably saw the worms in the trailer, right."}, {"time": 349, "text": "And in the video, you kind of like merges with the swarm, um, and becomes this tyrant of the world and like oppresses the people for a long time."}, {"time": 356, "text": "But he has a purpose and the purpose is to kind of, uh, break through kind of a stagnation period in civilization."}, {"time": 364, "text": "Um, but people have gotten too comfortable, right."}, {"time": 366, "text": "And so you kind of oppresses them so that they explode and like go on to colonize new worlds and kind of renew the forward momentum of humanity."}, {"time": 376, "text": "And so to me, that's kind of fascinating, right."}, {"time": 378, "text": "You need a little bit of pressure and suffering, right."}, {"time": 381, "text": "To kind of like make progress, not, not, not get too comfortable."}, {"time": 388, "text": "Maybe that's a bit of a cruel philosophy to take away, but that seems to be the case, unfortunately, obviously, I'm a huge fan of, uh, suffering."}, {"time": 399, "text": "So one of the reasons we're talking today is that a bunch of people requested that I do transcripts for this podcast and do captioning."}, {"time": 411, "text": "I used to make all kinds of YouTube videos and I would go on up work, I think, and I would hire folks to do transcription and it was always a pain in the ass, if I'm being honest, and then I don't know how I discovered Rev."}, {"time": 427, "text": "But when I did, it was this feeling of like, Holy shit, somebody figured out how to do it just really easily."}, {"time": 436, "text": "I I'm, I'm such a fan of just when people take a problem and they just make it easy."}, {"time": 446, "text": "You know, like just, uh, there's so many, uh, there's so many, it's like, there's so many things in life that you might not even be aware of that are painful."}, {"time": 457, "text": "Then Rev, you just like give the audio, give the video, you can actually give a YouTube link."}, {"time": 465, "text": "And then it comes back like a day later or, uh, two days later, whatever the hell it is with the captions, you know, all in a standardized format."}, {"time": 477, "text": "It was, I dunno, it was, it was, it was, it was truly a joy."}, {"time": 480, "text": "So I thought I had, you know, just for the hell of it, uh, talk to you that one other product just made my soul feel good."}, {"time": 488, "text": "One other product that I've used like that is, uh, for people who might be familiar is called isotope RX."}, {"time": 495, "text": "It's for audio editing and like, and that's another one where it was like, you just drop it."}, {"time": 504, "text": "I dropped into the audio and it just cleans everything up really nicely."}, {"time": 508, "text": "All the stupid, like the mouth sounds and sometimes there's a background like sounds due to the malfunction of the equipment."}, {"time": 519, "text": "It can clean that stuff up."}, {"time": 520, "text": "It can, it has a general voice denoising."}, {"time": 523, "text": "It has like automation capabilities where you can do batch processing and you can put a bunch of effects."}, {"time": 529, "text": "I mean, it just, I dunno, everything else sucked for like voice based cleanup that I've ever used."}, {"time": 537, "text": "They've used audition, Adobe audition, and he's all kinds of other things with plugins and you have to kind of figure it all out."}, {"time": 544, "text": "You have to do it manually here."}, {"time": 545, "text": "It's just, it just worked."}, {"time": 547, "text": "So that's another one in this whole pipeline."}, {"time": 549, "text": "It just brought joy to my, to my heart."}, {"time": 552, "text": "Anyway, all that to say is, uh, uh, Rev put a smile to my face."}, {"time": 558, "text": "So can you maybe take a step back and say, what is Rev and how does it work?"}, {"time": 564, "text": "And Rev or Rev.com?"}, {"time": 566, "text": "Rev, Rev.com, the same thing, I guess, uh, that way we do have Rev.ai now as well, which we can talk about later."}, {"time": 573, "text": "Like, do you have the actual domain or is it just, uh, the actual domain, but we also use it kind of as a, as a sub brand."}, {"time": 581, "text": "Oh, so we've, so we use Rev.ai to denote our ASR services, right?"}, {"time": 586, "text": "And Rev.com is kind of our more human and to the end user services."}, {"time": 589, "text": "So it's like wordpress.com and wordpress.org, they actually have separate brands that like, I don't know if you're familiar with what those are."}, {"time": 596, "text": "Yeah, they provide almost like a separate branch of a little bit."}, {"time": 600, "text": "I think with that, it's like wordpress.org is kind of their open source, right?"}, {"time": 604, "text": "And, uh, wordpress.com is sort of their hosted commercial offering."}, {"time": 608, "text": "Um, and with us, the differential is a little bit different, but maybe a similar idea."}, {"time": 612, "text": "So what is Rev?"}, {"time": 613, "text": "Before I launch into, uh, what is Rev?"}, {"time": 616, "text": "I was going to say, you know, like you, you were talking about like Rev was music to your ears, your, your, your field was music to my ears."}, {"time": 621, "text": "To us, the founders of Rev, because, um, Rev was kind of founded to improve on the model of Upwork that was kind of the original, um, or part of their original impetus, like our CEO, Jason, was a early employee of Upwork."}, {"time": 638, "text": "So he was very familiar with their work, the company Upwork company."}, {"time": 641, "text": "Um, and so he was very familiar with that model and he wanted to make the whole experience better because he knew like, when you go at that time, Upwork was primarily programmers, so the main thing they offered us, if you want to hire, you know, someone to help you code a little site, right."}, {"time": 656, "text": "Um, you could go on Upwork, um, you could like browse through a list of freelancers, pick a programmer, you know, have a contract with them and have them do some work, but it was kind of a difficult experience because, uh, for the, for you, you would kind of have to browse through all these people, right."}, {"time": 673, "text": "And you have to decide, okay, like, well, is this guy good as, um, or somebody else better and naturally, you know, you're going to Upwork because you're not an expert, right?"}, {"time": 682, "text": "If you're an expert, you probably wouldn't be like getting a programmer from Upwork, uh, so, so how can you really tell?"}, {"time": 687, "text": "So there's a kind of like a lot of potential regret, right?"}, {"time": 691, "text": "What if I choose a bad person, they're like, going to be late on the work."}, {"time": 694, "text": "It's going to be a painful experience."}, {"time": 696, "text": "And for the freelancer, it was also painful because, you know, half the time they spent not on actually doing the work, but kind of figuring out how can I make my profile most attractive to the buyer, right?"}, {"time": 707, "text": "And they're not an expert on that either."}, {"time": 709, "text": "So like Grav's idea was let's remove the barrier, right?"}, {"time": 712, "text": "Like, let's make it simple where we'll pick a few, uh, verticals that are fairly standardizable."}, {"time": 718, "text": "Now we actually started with translation, um, and then we added audio transcription a bit later and we'll just make it a website."}, {"time": 725, "text": "You go give us your files."}, {"time": 726, "text": "We'll give you back, uh, the results, you know, as soon as possible."}, {"time": 731, "text": "You know, originally maybe it was 48 hours."}, {"time": 733, "text": "Then we made it shorter and shorter and shorter."}, {"time": 735, "text": "Um, yeah, there's a rush processing too."}, {"time": 737, "text": "There's a rush processing now, uh, and, uh, we'll hide all the details from you."}, {"time": 744, "text": "And like, that's kind of exactly what you're experiencing, right?"}, {"time": 747, "text": "You don't, you don't need to worry about the details of how the sausage is made."}, {"time": 750, "text": "The, so you picked like a vertical by vertically, you mean basically a service, a service category."}, {"time": 756, "text": "Why translation is Rev thinking of potentially going into other verticals in the future, or is this like the focus now is a translation transcription, like language, the focus now is, is language or, uh, speech services, generally speech to text language services, you can kind of group them however you want."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Um, so, but we, uh, originally the categorization was work from home."}, {"time": 781, "text": "So when, uh, work that was done by people on a computer, you know, we weren't trying to get into, you know, uh, task rabbit type of things and something that could be relatively standard, not a lot of options."}, {"time": 794, "text": "So we could kind of present the simplified interface, right?"}, {"time": 796, "text": "So programming wasn't like a good fit because each programming project is kind of unique, right?"}, {"time": 801, "text": "We're looking for something that, uh, Transcription is, you know, you have five hours of idea, it's five hours of audio, right?"}, {"time": 807, "text": "Translation is somewhat similar."}, {"time": 809, "text": "In that, you know, you can have a five page document, you know, and then you just can price it by that and then you pick the language you want and that that's mostly all that is to it."}, {"time": 819, "text": "So those were a few criteria."}, {"time": 820, "text": "We started with translation because we saw the need, um, and, uh, we picked up kind of a specialty of translation, um, where we would translate things like board certificates, uh, uh, immigration documents, things like that."}, {"time": 838, "text": "And so they were fairly, um, even more well defined and easy to kind of tell if we did a good job."}, {"time": 845, "text": "So you can literally charge per type of document."}, {"time": 847, "text": "Was that, was, was that the, so what, what is it now?"}, {"time": 850, "text": "Is it per word or something like that?"}, {"time": 852, "text": "Like, how do you, like, how do you measure the effort involved in a particular thing?"}, {"time": 858, "text": "So now it looks like for audio translation, it's like, so now it looks a for audio transcription, right?"}, {"time": 863, "text": "It's a per audio minute."}, {"time": 864, "text": "Well, that, that yes, for, for, for our translation, we don't really, uh, actually focus it on anymore."}, {"time": 870, "text": "Uh, but you know, back when it was still a main business of Revit was per page, right."}, {"time": 875, "text": "Or per word, depending on the kind of, uh, cause you can also do translation now on the audio, right?"}, {"time": 880, "text": "So like subtitles."}, {"time": 881, "text": "So it would be both, uh, transcription and translation."}, {"time": 885, "text": "I wanted to test the system to see how good it is to see like how, how, uh, well, is Russian supported?"}, {"time": 894, "text": "And it'd be interesting to try it out."}, {"time": 895, "text": "I mean, one of the, now it's only in like the one direction, right?"}, {"time": 898, "text": "So you start with English and then you can have subtitles in Russian."}, {"time": 900, "text": "Not really, not really the other way."}, {"time": 903, "text": "Because it's, um, I'm deeply curious about this."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Um, when COVID opens up a little bit, when the economy, when the world opens up a little bit, you want to build your brand in Russia?"}, {"time": 913, "text": "First of all, I'm allergic to the word brand."}, {"time": 915, "text": "All right, I'm definitely not building, uh, any brands in Russia, but I'm going to Paris to talk to the translators of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, there's this famous couple that does translation."}, {"time": 929, "text": "And, you know, I'm more and more thinking of how is it possible to have a conversation with a Russian speaker?"}, {"time": 937, "text": "Cause I have just some number of famous Russian speakers that I'm interested in talking to, and my Russian is not strong enough to be witty and funny."}, {"time": 949, "text": "I'm already an idiot in English."}, {"time": 951, "text": "I'm an extra level of like awkward idiot in Russian, but I can understand it."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And I also like wonder how can I create a compelling English Russian experience for an English speaker?"}, {"time": 966, "text": "Like if I, there's a guy named Grigori Perlman, who's a mathematician who, uh, obviously doesn't speak any English."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So I would probably incorporate like a Russian translator into the picture."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And then it would be like a, not to use a weird term, but like a three, like a three, three person thing where it's like a dance of, like, I understand it one way."}, {"time": 992, "text": "They don't understand the other way, but I'll be asking questions in English."}, {"time": 998, "text": "I don't know the right way."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "It's complicated, but I feel like it's worth the effort for certain kinds of people, one of whom I'm confident of Vladimir Putin, I'm for sure talking to."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "I really want to make it happen."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "Cause I think I could do a good job with, but the, the right, you know, understanding the fundamentals of translation is something I'm really interested in."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "So that's why I'm starting with, um, the actual translators of like Russian literature, because they understand the nuance and the beauty of the language and how it goes back and forth."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "But I also want to see, like in speech, how can we do it in real time?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "So that's, that's like a little bit of a baby project that I hope to push forward."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "But anyway, it's a challenging thing."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "So just to share, uh, my dad, um, actually does translation, um, not, not professional, he's a, uh, he writes poetry."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "That was kind of always his, uh, not a hobby, but he's, uh, he, you know, he had a job, like a day job, but his passion was always writing poetry."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Uh, and then when I got to America, like he started also translating, um, first he was translating English poetry to Russia."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "Now he also like goes the other, uh, the other way, you kind of gain some small fame in that world anyways, because, uh, recently this poet like Lewis clock, I don't know if you know of, uh, some American poet, um, she was awarded the Nobel prize for literature."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "Uh, and so my dad had translated, uh, one of her books of poetry in to Russian, and he was like one of the few."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "So he kind of like, they asked him and gave an interview to Radiosvoboda, if you know what that is."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "And he kind of talked about some of the intricacies of translating poetry."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "So that's like an extra level of difficulty, right?"}, {"time": 1098, "text": "Because translating poetry is even more challenging than translating just, you know, interviews."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Do you remember any, any experiences and challenges to having to do the translation that, that's the God to you, like something he's talked about?"}, {"time": 1112, "text": "I mean, a lot of it, I think is word choice, right?"}, {"time": 1115, "text": "It's the way Russian is structured is first of all, quite different than, um, the way English is structured, right?"}, {"time": 1120, "text": "Just there is inflections in Russian and genders, and they don't exist in English."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "That's just one of the reasons actually why, um, machine translation is quite difficult for English to Russian and Russian to English, because there's such different languages, but then English has like a huge number of words."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "Um, many more than Russian, actually, I think."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "So it's often difficult to find the right word to convey the same emotional meaning, yeah, Russian language."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "They play with words much more."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "So you, you're mentioning that, uh, Rev was kind of born out of, um, trying to take a vertical on the upwork and then standardize it."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "So we're just trying to make the, the freelancer marketplace idea better, right?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Um, better for both customers and better for the freelancers themselves."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Is there something else to the story of Rev finding the right word?"}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Rev, finding Rev, like what, what did it take to bring it to actually to life?"}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Was there any pain points?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "Um, plenty of, plenty of pain points."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "I mean, uh, as, as often the case it's with scaling it up, right?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Um, and in this case, you know, the scaling is kind of scaling the, the marketplace, so to speak, right?"}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Rev is essentially a two sided marketplace, right?"}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Because, you know, there's the customers and then there's the reverse."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "Um, if there's not enough Revers, Revers are world color freelancers."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "So if there's not enough Revers, then customers have a bad experience, right?"}, {"time": 1203, "text": "You know, it takes longer to get your work done."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "Um, things like that, you know, if there's too many done, the Revers have a bad experience because they might log on to see like what work is available and there's not very much work, right?"}, {"time": 1215, "text": "Uh, so kind of keeping that balance, um, is, is, is a quite challenging problem."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "And, you know, that's, that's like a problem we've been working on for many years and we're still like refining our methods, right?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "If you can kind of talk to this gig economy idea, I did a bunch of different psychology experiments on mechanical Turk, for example, I've asked to do different kinds of very tricky computer vision annotation on mechanical Turk."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And it's connecting, connecting people in a more systematized way."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "I would say, you know, between task and, and, uh, what would you call that worker is what mechanical Turk calls it."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "What do you think about this world of gig economies, of there being a service that connects customers to workers in a way that's like massively distributed, like potentially scaling to, it could be, it could be scaled to like tens of thousands of people, right?"}, {"time": 1271, "text": "Is there something interesting about that world that you can speak to?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "Well, we don't think of it as kind of gig economy, like to some degree, I don't like the word gig that much, right?"}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Because to some degree it diminishes the words being done, right?"}, {"time": 1285, "text": "It sounds kind of like almost amateurish."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Well, maybe in like music industry, like gig is a standard term, but in work, it kind of sounds like, oh, it's, it's, it's frivolous, um, to us it's, um, improving the nature of working from home on your own time and on your own terms, right?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "And kind of taking away geographical limitations and time limitations, right?"}, {"time": 1311, "text": "Uh, so, you know, many of our freelancers are maybe work from home moms, right?"}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And, you know, they don't want the traditional nine to five job, but they want to make some income and rough kind of like allows them to do that and decide like exactly how much to work and when to work or by the same token, maybe someone is, you know, someone wants to live the mountain top, you know, life, right?"}, {"time": 1337, "text": "You know, cabin in the woods, but they still want to make some money."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "Um, and like generally that wouldn't be compatible before, before this new world, you kind of had to choose, uh, but like with Rev, like, if you like, you don't have to choose, can you speak to like, what's the demographics like distribution?"}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Like where do rivers live?"}, {"time": 1385, "text": "Like you, you may be Oh, like you know, one day you might go to the For some years now, we've been doing these little meetings where the management team will go to some place and we'll try to meet Revers."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "And pretty much wherever we go, it's pretty easy to find a large number of Revers."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "The most recent one we did is in Utah."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "But anyway, really."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "Are they from all walks of life?"}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Are these young folks, older folks?"}, {"time": 1408, "text": "Yeah, all walks of life, really."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "Like I said, one category is the work from home."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Students who want to make some extra income."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "There are some people who maybe have some social anxiety, so they don't want to be in the office."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "And this is one way for them to make a living."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "So it's really pretty wide variety."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "But on the flip side, for example, one Rever we were talking to was a person who had a fairly high powered career before and was kind of like taking a break."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "And she was almost doing this just to explore and learn about the gig economy, quote unquote."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "So it really is a pretty wide variety of folks."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "Yeah, it's kind of interesting through the captioning process for me to learn about the Revers because like some are clearly like weirdly knowledgeable about technical concepts."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "Like you can tell by how good they are at like capitalizing stuff, like technical terms, like a machine learning or deep learning."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "Like I've used Rev to annotate, to caption the deep learning lectures or machine learning lectures I did at MIT."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And it's funny, like a large number of them were like, I don't know if they looked it up or were already knowledgeable, but they do a really good job at like, I don't know."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "They invest time into these things."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "They will like do research, they will Google things, you know, to kind of make sure that they got it right."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "But to some of them, it's like, it's actually part of the enjoyment of the work."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "Like they'll tell us, you know, I love doing this because I get paid to watch a documentary on something, right?"}, {"time": 1507, "text": "And I learn something while I'm transcribing, right?"}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Pretty cool."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Yeah, so what's that captioning transcription process look like for the Revers?"}, {"time": 1516, "text": "Can you maybe speak to that to give people a sense, like how much is automated, how much is manual?"}, {"time": 1523, "text": "What's the actual interface look like?"}, {"time": 1525, "text": "All that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "Yeah, so, you know, we've invested a pretty good amount of time to give like our Revers the best tools possible."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "So typical day of forever, they might log into their workspace, they'll see a list of audios that need to be transcribed."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "And we try to give them tools to pick specifically the ones they want to do, you know?"}, {"time": 1544, "text": "So maybe some people like to do longer audios or shorter audios, people have their preferences."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "Some people like to do audios in a particular subject or from a particular country."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "So we try to give people the tools to control, things like that."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And then when they pick what they want to do, we'll launch a specialized editor that we've built to make transcription as efficient as possible."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "They'll start with a speech drag draft."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "So, you know, we have our machine learning model for automated speech recognition, they'll start with that."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And then our tools are optimized to help them correct that."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So it's basically a process of correction."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "Yeah, it depends on, you know, I would say the audio."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "If the audio itself is pretty good, like probably like our podcast right now would be quite good."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "So the ASR would do a fairly good job."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "But if you imagine someone recorded a lecture, you know, in the back of a auditorium, right?"}, {"time": 1605, "text": "Where like the speaker is really far away and there's maybe a lot of cross talk and things like that, then maybe the ASR wouldn't do a good job."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "So the person might say like, you know what, I'm just gonna do it from scratch."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "Do it from scratch, yeah."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "So it kind of really depends."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "What would you say is the speed that you can possibly get?"}, {"time": 1620, "text": "Like, what's the fastest?"}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Can you get, is it possible to get real time or no?"}, {"time": 1625, "text": "As you're like listening, can you write as fast as?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "Real time would be pretty difficult."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "It's actually a pretty, it's not an easy job, you know."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "We actually encourage everyone at the company to try to be a transcriber for a day, transcriptionist for a day."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "And it's way harder than you might think it is, right?"}, {"time": 1644, "text": "Because people talk fast and people have accents and all this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "So real time is pretty difficult."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "Like there's somebody, we're probably gonna use Rev to caption this, they're listening to this right now."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "What do you think is the fastest you could possibly get on this right now?"}, {"time": 1664, "text": "I think on a good audio, maybe two to three X, I would say, real time."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "Meaning it takes two to three times longer than the actual audio of the podcast."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "This is so meta, I could just imagine the Revvers working on this right now."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "You're like, you're way wrong."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "You're way wrong, this takes way longer."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "But yeah, it definitely works."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "Or you doubted me, I could do real time."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "Okay, so you mentioned ASR."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "Can you speak to what is ASR, automatic speech recognition?"}, {"time": 1695, "text": "How much, like what is the gap between perfect human performance and perfect or pretty damn good ASR?"}, {"time": 1706, "text": "Yeah, so ASR, automatic speech recognition, it's a class of machine learning problem, right?"}, {"time": 1711, "text": "So take speech like we're talking and transform it into a sequence of words, essentially."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "Audio of people talking."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "Audio, audio to words."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "And there's a variety of different approaches and techniques, which we could talk about later if you want."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "So, we think we have pretty much the world's best ASR for this kind of speech, right?"}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So there's different kinds of domains, right, for ASR."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "Like one domain might be voice assistance, right?"}, {"time": 1738, "text": "So Siri, very different than what we're doing, right?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "Because Siri, there's fairly limited vocabulary."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "You might ask Siri to play a song or order a pizza or whatever."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And it's very good at doing that."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "Very different from when we start talking in a very unstructured way."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "And Siri will also generally adapt to your voice and stuff like this."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "So for this kind of audio, we think we have the best."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "And our accuracy, right now I think it's maybe 14% word error rate on our test suite that we generally use to measure."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "So word error rate is like one way to measure accuracy for ASR, right?"}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So what's 14% word error rate?"}, {"time": 1779, "text": "So 14% means across this test suite, of a variety of different audios, it would be, it would get in some way 14% of the words wrong."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "14% of the words wrong."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "So the way you kind of calculate it is, you might add up insertions, deletions, and substitutions, right?"}, {"time": 1803, "text": "So insertions is like extra words."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "Deletions are words that we said, but weren't in the transcript, right?"}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Substitutions is, you said Apple, but I said, but the ASR thought it was able, something like this."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "Human accuracy, most people think realistically, it's like 3%, 2%, word error rate would be like the max achievable."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "So there's still quite a gap, right?"}, {"time": 1829, "text": "Would you say that, so YouTube, when I upload videos, often generates automatic captions."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "Are you sort of from a company perspective, from a company perspective, from a tech perspective, are you trying to beat YouTube, Google?"}, {"time": 1844, "text": "It's a hell of a, Google, I mean, I don't know how seriously they take this task, but I imagine it's quite serious."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "And they, you know, Google is probably up there in terms of their teams on, on ASR or just NLP, natural language processing, different technologies."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "So do you think you can beat Google?"}, {"time": 1866, "text": "On this kind of stuff, yeah, we think so."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "Google just woke up on my phone."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "This is hilarious, okay."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "Now Google is listening, sending it back to headquarters."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "Who are these rough people?"}, {"time": 1879, "text": "But that's the goal?"}, {"time": 1880, "text": "Yeah, I mean, we measure ourselves against like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, you know, some of the, some smaller competitors."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "And we use like our internal tests with it, we try to compose it of a pretty representative set of ideas, maybe it's some podcasts, some videos, some interviews, some lectures, things like that, right?"}, {"time": 1899, "text": "And we beat them in our own testing."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "And actually Rev offers automated, like you can actually just do the automated captioning."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "So like, I guess it's like way cheaper, whatever it is, whatever the rates are."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "So it's a, by the way, it used to be a dollar per minute for captioning and transcription, I think it's like $1.15 or something like that."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "$1.25."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "$1.25, yeah."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "It's pretty cool."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "That was the other thing that was surprising to me, it was actually like the cheapest thing you could, one of the, I mean, I don't remember it being cheaper."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "You could on Upwork get cheaper, but it was clear to me that this, that's gonna be really shitty."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "So like, you're also competing on price."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "I think there were services that you can get, like similar to Rev kind of feel to it, but it wasn't as automated."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "Like the drag and drop, the entirety of the interface, it's like the thing we're talking about."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "I'm such a huge fan of like frictionless, like Amazon's single buy button, whatever."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "That one click."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "The one click, that's genius right there."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "Like that is so important for services."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "And simplicity and I mean, Rev is almost there."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "I mean, there's like some, I'm trying to think."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "So I think I've, I stopped using this pipeline, but Rev offers it and I like it, but it was causing me some issues on my side, which is you can connect it to like Dropbox and it generates the files in Dropbox."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "So like it closes the loop to where I don't have to go to Rev at all and I can download it."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "Sorry, I don't have to go to Rev at all and to download the files."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "It could just like automatically copy them."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "Right, you're putting your Dropbox in a day later or maybe a few hours later."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Yeah, it just shows up."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "Just shows up, yeah."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "Yeah, I was trying to do it programmatically too."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "Is there an API interface you can, I was trying to through like through Python to download stuff automatically, but then I realized this is the programmer in me."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "Like, dude, you don't need to automate everything like in life, like flawlessly, because I wasn't doing enough captions to justify to myself the time investment into automating everything perfectly."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Yeah, I would say if you're doing so many interviews that your biggest roadblock is clicking on the Rev download, but now you're talking about Elon Musk levels of business."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "But for sure, we have like a variety of ways to make it easy."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "You know, there's the integration."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "You mentioned, I think it's through a company called Zapier, which kind of can connect Dropbox to Rev and vice versa."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "We have an API if you want to really like customize it, you know, if you want to create the Lex Friedman, you know, CMS or whatever."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "For this whole thing."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "So can you speak to the ASR a little bit more?"}, {"time": 2086, "text": "Like, what does it take?"}, {"time": 2091, "text": "Like approach wise, machine learning wise, how hard is this problem?"}, {"time": 2095, "text": "How do you get to the 3% error rate?"}, {"time": 2097, "text": "Like, what's your vision of all of this?"}, {"time": 2099, "text": "Yeah, well, the 3% error rate is definitely, that's the grand vision."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "We'll see what it takes to get there."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "But we believe, you know, in ASR, the biggest thing is the data, right?"}, {"time": 2115, "text": "Like, that's true of like a lot of machine learning problems today, right?"}, {"time": 2118, "text": "The more data you have and high quality of the data, the better label the data."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "Yeah, that's how you get good results."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "And we at Rev have kind of like the best data."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "Like we have."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "Like you're literally, your business model is annotating the data."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "Our business model is being paid to annotate the data."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "Being paid to annotate the data."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "So it's kind of like a pretty magical flywheel."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "And so we've kind of like written this flywheel to this point."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And we think we're still kind of in the early stages of figuring out all the parts of the flywheel to use, you know, because we have the final transcripts and we have the audios and we train on that."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "But we in principle also have all the edits that the Revvers make, right?"}, {"time": 2167, "text": "Oh, that's interesting."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "How can you use that as data?"}, {"time": 2170, "text": "Yeah, that's something for us to figure out in the future."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "But, you know, we feel like we're only in the early stages, right?"}, {"time": 2176, "text": "So the data is there."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "That'd be interesting."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "Like almost like a recurrent neural net for fixing transcripts."}, {"time": 2183, "text": "I always remember we did a segmentation annotation for driving data."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "So segmenting the scene, like visual data."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "And you can get all, so it was drawing, people were drawing polygons around different objects and so on."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "And it feels like it always felt like there was a lot of information in the clicking, the sequence of clicking that people do, the kind of fixing of the polygons that they do."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "Now there's a few papers written about how to draw polygons like with a recurrent neural nets to try to learn from the human clicking."}, {"time": 2220, "text": "But it was just like experimental, you know, it was one of those like CVPR type papers that people do like a really tiny data set."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "It didn't feel like people really tried to do it seriously."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "Yeah, I wonder if there's information in the fixing that provides deeper set of signal than just like the raw data."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "The intuition is for sure there must be, right?"}, {"time": 2246, "text": "And in all kinds of signals and how long you took to make that edit and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "It's gonna be like up to us."}, {"time": 2254, "text": "That's why like the next couple of years is like super exciting for us, right?"}, {"time": 2258, "text": "So that's what like the focus is now."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "You mentioned rev.ai, that's where you want to."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "Yeah, so rev.ai is kind of our way of bringing this ASR to the rest of the world, right?"}, {"time": 2271, "text": "So when we started, we were human only."}, {"time": 2275, "text": "Then we kind of created this Temi service."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "I think you might've used it, which was kind of ASR for the consumer, right?"}, {"time": 2282, "text": "So if you don't wanna pay $1.25, but you wanna pay, now it's 25 cents a minute, I think."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "And you get the transcript, the machine generated transcript and you get an editor and you can kind of fix it up yourself, right?"}, {"time": 2297, "text": "Then we started using ASR for our own human transcriptionists."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "And then the kind of rev.ai is the final step of the journey, which is, you know, we have this amazing engine."}, {"time": 2307, "text": "What can people build with it, right?"}, {"time": 2308, "text": "What kind of new applications could be enabled if you have SpeedTrack that's that accurate?"}, {"time": 2316, "text": "Do you have ideas for this or is it just providing it as a service and seeing what people come up with?"}, {"time": 2320, "text": "It's providing it as a service and seeing what people come up with and kind of learning from what people do with it."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "And we have ideas of our own as well, of course, but it's a little bit like, you know, when AWS provided the building blocks, right?"}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And they saw what people built with it and they try to make it easier to build those things, right?"}, {"time": 2336, "text": "And we kind of hope to do the same thing."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "Although AWS kind of does a shitty job of like, I'm continually surprised, like Mechanical Turk, for example, how shitty the interface is."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "We're talking about like Rev making me feel good."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "Like when I first discovered Mechanical Turk, the initial idea of it was like, it made me feel like Rev does, but then the interface is like, come on."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "Yeah, it's horrible."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "Why is it so painful?"}, {"time": 2367, "text": "Does nobody at Amazon want to like seriously invest in it?"}, {"time": 2372, "text": "It felt like you can make so much money if you took this effort seriously."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "And it feels like they have a committee of like two people just sitting back, like a meeting, they meet once a month, like what are we going to do with Mechanical Turk?"}, {"time": 2386, "text": "It's like two websites making me feel like this, that and craiglist.org, whatever the hell it is."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "It feels like it's designed in the 90s."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "Well, Craigslist basically hasn't been updated pretty much since the guy originally built."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "Do you seriously think there's a team, like how big is the team working on Mechanical Turk?"}, {"time": 2405, "text": "There's some team, right?"}, {"time": 2406, "text": "I feel like there isn't."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "I'm skeptical."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "Well, if nothing else, they benefit from the other teams like moving things forward in a small way."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "But I know what you mean."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "We use Mechanical Turk for a couple of things as well."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "And yeah, it's painful UI."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "It's painful, but yeah, it works."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "I think most people, the thing is most people don't really use the UI, right?"}, {"time": 2429, "text": "Like we, for example, we use it through the API, right?"}, {"time": 2433, "text": "But even the API documentation and so on, like it's super outdated."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "Like I don't even know what to..."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "I mean, the same criticism, as long as we're ranting, my same criticism goes to the APIs of most of these companies."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "Like Google, for example, the API for the different services is just the documentation is so shitty."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "Like it's not so shitty."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "I should actually be..."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "I should exhibit some gratitude."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "Okay, let's practice some gratitude."}, {"time": 2470, "text": "The documentation is pretty good."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "Like most of the things that the API makes available is pretty good."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "It's just that in the sense that it's accurate, sometimes outdated, but like the degree of explanations with examples is only covering, I would say, like 50% of what's possible."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "And it just feels a little bit, like there's a lot of natural questions that people would wanna ask that doesn't get covered."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "And it feels like it's almost there."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "Like it's such a magical thing."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "Like the Maps API, YouTube API, there's a bunch of stuff."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "I gotta imagine it's like, there's probably some team at Google responsible for writing this documentation that's probably not the engineers, right?"}, {"time": 2520, "text": "And probably this team is not where you wanna be."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Well, it's a weird thing."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "I sometimes think about this for somebody who wants to also build a company."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "I think about this a lot."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "YouTube, the service is one of the most magical, like I'm so grateful that YouTube exists."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "And yet they seem to be quite clueless on so many things like that everybody's screaming them at."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "Like it feels like whatever the mechanism that you use to listen to your quote unquote customers, which is like the creators, is not very good."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "Like there's literally people that are like screaming why, like their new YouTube studio, for example."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "There's like features that were like begged for for a really long time."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Like being able to upload multiple videos at the same time."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "That wasn't missing for a really, really long time."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "Now, like there's probably things that I don't know, which is maybe for that kind of huge infrastructure, it's actually very difficult to build some of these features."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "But the fact that that wasn't communicated and it felt like you're not being heard."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "Like I remember this experience for me and it's not a pleasant experience."}, {"time": 2603, "text": "And it feels like the company doesn't give a damn about you."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "And that's something to think about."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "I'm not sure what that is."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "That might have to do with just like small groups working on these small features and these specific features."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "And there's no overarching like dictator type of human that says like, why the hell are we neglecting like Steve Jobs type of characters?"}, {"time": 2623, "text": "Like there's people that we need to speak to the people that like wanna love our product and they don't."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "Let's fix this shit."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "Maybe at some point you just get so fixated on the numbers, right?"}, {"time": 2635, "text": "And it's like, well, the numbers are pretty great, right?"}, {"time": 2637, "text": "Like people are watching, doesn't seem to be a problem, right?"}, {"time": 2641, "text": "And you're not like the person that like build this thing, right?"}, {"time": 2644, "text": "So you really care about it."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "You're just there, you came in as a product manager, right?"}, {"time": 2649, "text": "You got hired sometime later, your mandate is like increase this number, like 10%, right?"}, {"time": 2655, "text": "And you just."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "That's brilliantly put."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "Like if you, this is, okay, if there's a lesson in this is don't reduce your company into a metric of like how much, like you said, how much people watching the videos and so on and like convince yourself that everything is working just because the numbers are going up."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "There's something, you have to have a vision."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "You have to want people to love your stuff because love is ultimately the beginning of like a successful longterm company is that they always should love your product."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "You have to be like a creator and have that like creator's love for your own thing, right?"}, {"time": 2695, "text": "Like, and you're pained by these comments, right?"}, {"time": 2699, "text": "And probably like Apple, I think did this generally like really well."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "They're well known for kind of keeping teams small even when they were big, right?"}, {"time": 2708, "text": "And, you know, he was an engineer, like there's a book, a creative selection."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "I don't know if you read it by a Apple engineer named Ken Koscienda."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "It's kind of a great book actually because unlike most of these business books where it's, you know, here's how Steve Jobs ran the company."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "It's more like here's how life was like for me, you know, an engineer here, the projects I worked on and here what it was like to pitch Steve Jobs, you know, on like, you know, I think it was in charge of like the keyboard and the auto correction, right?"}, {"time": 2736, "text": "And at Apple, like Steve Jobs reviewed everything."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "And so he was like, this is what it was like to show my demos to Steve Jobs and, you know, to change them because like Steve Jobs didn't like how, you know, the shape of the little key was off because the rounding of the corner was like not quite right or something like this, right?"}, {"time": 2751, "text": "He was famously a stickler for this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "But because the teams were small, he really owned this stuff, right?"}, {"time": 2756, "text": "So he really cared."}, {"time": 2758, "text": "Yeah, Elon Musk does that similar kind of thing with Tesla, which is really interesting."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "There's another lesson in leadership in that is to be obsessed with the details."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And like, he talks to like the lowest level engineers."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "Okay, so we're talking about ASR and so this is basically where I was saying we're gonna take this like ultra seriously."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "And then what's the mission?"}, {"time": 2782, "text": "To try to keep pushing towards the 3%."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Yeah, and kind of try to build this platform where all of your, you know, all of your meetings, you know, they're as easily accessible as your notes, right?"}, {"time": 2798, "text": "Like, so, like, imagine all the meetings a company might have, right?"}, {"time": 2803, "text": "You know, now that I'm like no longer a programmer, right?"}, {"time": 2806, "text": "Then I'm a quote unquote manager."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "That's less like my day as in meetings, right?"}, {"time": 2811, "text": "And, you

not really something that you can easily retrieve, right?"}, {"time": 2820, "text": "Like imagine if all of those meetings were indexed, archived, you know, you could go back, you could share a clip like really easily, right?"}, {"time": 2828, "text": "So that might change completely."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "It's like everything that's said, converted to text might change completely the dynamics of what we do in this world, especially now with remote work, right?"}, {"time": 2839, "text": "With Zoom and so on."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "That's fascinating to think about."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "I mean, for me, I care about podcasts, right?"}, {"time": 2845, "text": "And one of the things that was, you know, I'm torn."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "I know a lot of the engineers at Spotify."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "So I love them very much because they dream big in terms of like, they wanna empower creators."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "So one of my hopes was with Spotify that they would use a technology like Rev or something like that to start converting everything into text and make it indexable."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "Like one of the things that sucks with podcasts is like, it's hard to find stuff."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "Like the model is basically subscription."}, {"time": 2884, "text": "Like you find, it's similar to what YouTube used to be like, which is you basically find a creator that you enjoy and you subscribe to them."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "And like, you just kind of follow what they're doing, but the search and discovery wasn't a big part of YouTube like in the early days, but that's what currently with podcasts, like is the search and discovery is like non existent."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "You're basically searching for like the dumbest possible thing, which is like keywords in the titles of episodes."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "Even aside from a search and discovery, like all the time."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "So I listened to like a number of podcasts and there's something said, and I wanna like go back to that later because I was trying to, I'm trying to remember, what do you say?"}, {"time": 2930, "text": "Like maybe like recommended some cool product that I wanna try out."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "And like, it's basically impossible."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "Maybe like some people have pretty good show notes."}, {"time": 2936, "text": "So maybe you'll get lucky and you can find it, right?"}, {"time": 2939, "text": "But I mean, if everyone had transcripts and it was all searchable, it would be so much better."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "I mean, that's one of the things that I wanted to, I mean, one of the reasons we're talking today is I wanted to take this quite seriously."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "The rough thing, I just been lazy."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "So, because I'm very fortunate that a lot of people support this podcast, that there's enough money now to do a transcription and so on."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "And it seemed clear to me, especially like CEOs and sort of like PhDs, like people write to me who are like graduate students in computer science or graduate students in whatever the heck field, it's clear that their mind, like they enjoy podcasts when they're doing laundry or whatever, but they wanna revisit the conversation in a much more rigorous way."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "And they really wanna transcript."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "Like it's clear that they want to analyze conversations."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "Like so many people wrote to me about a transcript for Yosha Bach conversation."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "I had just a bunch of conversations."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "And then on the Elon Musk side, like reporters, they wanna write a blog post about your conversation."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "So they wanna be able to pull stuff."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "And it's like, they're essentially doing on your conversation transcription privately."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "They're doing it for themselves and then starting to pick, but it's so much easier when you can actually do it as a reporter, just look at the transcript."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Yeah, and you can like embed a little thing, like into your article, right?"}, {"time": 3029, "text": "Here's what they said, you can go listen to like this clip from the section."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "I'm actually trying to figure out, I'll probably on the website create like a place where the transcript goes, like as a webpage so that people can reference it, like reporters can reference it and so on."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "I mean, most of the reporters probably want to write clickbait articles that are complete falsifying, which I'm fine with."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "It's the way of journalism, I don't care."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "Like I've had this conversation with a friend of mine, a mixed martial artist, the Ryan Hall."},

blah, blah, it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "It was very eloquent, very powerful words."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "I think people should go back and listen to it."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "It's powerful."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "And then all these journalists, all these articles written about like MMA fight, UFC fight."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "MMA fighter loves Hitler."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "No, like, well, no, they didn't."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "They were somewhat accurate."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "They didn't say like loves Hitler."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "They said, thinks that if Hitler came back to life, we should forgive him."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "Like they kind of, it's kind of accurate ish, but the headline made it sound a lot worse than it was, but I'm fine with it."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "That's the way the world, I wanna almost make it easier for those journalists and make it easier for people who actually care about the conversation to go and look and see."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Right, they can see it for themselves."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "For themselves."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "There's the headline, but now you can go."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "There's something about podcasts, like the audio that makes it difficult to jump to a spot and to look for that particular information."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "I think some of it, I'm interested in creating, like myself experimenting with stuff."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "So like taking rev and creating a transcript and then people can go to it."}, {"time": 3185, "text": "I do dream that like, I'm not in the loop anymore, that like, Spotify does it, right?"}, {"time": 3193, "text": "Like automatically for everybody, because ultimately that one click purchase needs to be there, like, you know."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "Like you kind of want support from the entire ecosystem."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "Like from the tool makers and the podcast creators, even clients, right?"}, {"time": 3208, "text": "I mean, imagine if like most podcast apps, you know, if it was a standard, right?"}, {"time": 3215, "text": "Here's how you include a transcript into a podcast, right?"}, {"time": 3218, "text": "Like it's just an RSS feed ultimately."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "And actually just yesterday I saw this company called Buzzsprout, I think they're called."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "So they're trying to do this."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "They proposed a spec, an extension to their RSS format to reference transcripts in a standard way."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "And they're talking about like, there's one client dimension that will support it, but imagine like more clients support it, right?"}, {"time": 3244, "text": "So any podcast, you could go and see the transcripts right in your like normal podcast app."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "I mean, somebody, so I have somebody who works with me, works with helps with advertising, Matt, this awesome guy."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "He mentioned Buzzsprout to me, but he says, it's really annoying because they want exclusive, they want to host the podcast."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "This is the problem with Spotify too."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "This is where I'd like to say, like F Spotify, there's a magic to RSS with podcasts."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "It can be made available to everyone."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "And then there's all, there's this ecosystem of different podcast players that emerge and they compete freely."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "And that's a beautiful thing, that that's why I go on exclusive, like Joe Rogan went exclusive."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "I'm not sure if you're familiar with, he went to Spotify as a huge fan of Joe Rogan."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "I've been kind of nervous about the whole thing, but let's see, I hope that Spotify steps up."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "They've added video, which was very surprising that they were able to put on."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "Exclusive meaning you can't subscribe to the RSS feed anymore."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "It's only in Spotify."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "For now you can until December 1st."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And December 1st, it's all, everything disappears and it's Spotify only."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "I, you know, and Spotify gave him a hundred million dollars for that."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "So it's an interesting deal, but I, you know, I did some soul searching and I'm glad he's doing it."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "But if Spotify came to me with a hundred million dollars, I wouldn't do it."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "I wouldn't do, well, I have a very different relationship with money."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "I hate money, but I just think I believe in the pirate radio aspect of podcasting, the freedom."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "And that there's something about."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "The open source spirit."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "The open source spirit, it just doesn't seem right."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "It doesn't feel right."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "That said, you know, because so many people care about Joe Rogan's program, they're gonna hold Spotify's feet to the fire."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "Like one of the cool things with what Joe told me is the reason he likes working with Spotify is that they, they're like ride or die together, right?"}, {"time": 3376, "text": "So they, they want him to succeed."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "So that's why they're not actually telling him what to do despite what people think."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "They, they don't tell them, they don't give them any notes on anything."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "They want him to succeed."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "And that's the cool thing about exclusivity with a platform is like, you're kind of wanting each other to succeed."}, {"time": 3396, "text": "And that process can actually be very fruitful."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "Like YouTube, it goes back to my criticism."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "YouTube generally, no matter how big the creator, maybe for PewDiePie, something like that, they want you to succeed."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "But for the most part, from all the big creators I've spoken with, Veritasium, all of those folks, you know, they get some basic assistance, but it's not like, YouTube doesn't care if you succeed or not."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "They have so many creators."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "Yeah, like a hundred other."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "So, and especially with, with somebody like Joe Rogan, who YouTube sees Joe Rogan, not as a person who might revolutionize the nature of news and idea space and nuanced conversations."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "They see him as a potential person who has racist guests on, or like, you know, they see him as like a headache, potentially."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "So, you know, a lot of people talk about this."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "It's a hard place to be for YouTube, actually, is figuring out with the search and discovery process of how do you filter out conspiracy theories and which conspiracy theories represent dangerous untruths and which conspiracy theories are like vanilla untruths."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "And then even when you start having meetings and discussions about what is true or not, it starts getting weird."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "Yeah, it's difficult these days, right?"}, {"time": 3487, "text": "I worry more about the other side, right?"}, {"time": 3489, "text": "Of too much, you know, too much censorship."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "Well, maybe censorship is the right word."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "I mean, censorship is usually government censorship, but still, yeah, putting yourself in the position of arbiter for these kinds of things."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "It's very difficult and people think it's so easy, right?"}, {"time": 3505, "text": "Like, cause like, well, you know, like no Nazis, right?"}, {"time": 3507, "text": "What a simple principle."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "But you know, yes, I mean, no one likes Nazis, but there's like many shades of gray, like very soon after that."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "Yeah, and then, you know, of course everybody, you know, there's some people that call our current president a Nazi and then there's like, so you start getting a Sam Harris."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "I don't know if you know that is wasted, in my opinion, his conversation with Jack Dorsey."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "Now I'll also, I spoke with Jack before in this podcast and we'll talk again, but Sam brought up, Sam Harris does not like Donald Trump."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "I do listen to his podcast."}, {"time": 3543, "text": "I'm familiar with his views on the matter."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "And he asked Jack Dorsey, he's like, how can you not ban Donald Trump from Twitter?"}, {"time": 3552, "text": "And so, you know, there's a set, you have that conversation."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "You have a conversation where some number, some significant number of people think that the current president of the United States should not be on your platform."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And it's like, okay."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "So if that's even on the table as a conversation, then everything's on the table for conversation."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "And yeah, it's tough."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "I'm not sure where I land on it."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "I'm with you, I think that censorship is bad, but I also think the show..."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "Ultimately, I just also think, you know, if you're the kind of person that's gonna be convinced, you know, by some YouTube video, you know, that, I don't know, our government's been taken over by aliens, it's unlikely that like, you know, you'll be returned to sanity simply because, you know, that video is not available on YouTube, right?"}, {"time": 3602, "text": "I tend to believe in the intelligence of people and we should trust them."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "But I also do think it's the responsibility of platforms to encourage more love in the world, more kindness to each other."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "And I don't always think that they're great at doing that particular thing."}, {"time": 3619, "text": "So that, there's a nice balance there."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "And I think philosophically, I think about that a lot."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "Where's the balance between free speech and like encouraging people, even though they have the freedom of speech to not be an asshole."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "That's not a constitutional, like..."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "So you have the right for free speech, but like, just don't be an asshole."}, {"time": 3650, "text": "Like you can't really put that in the constitution that the Supreme Court can't be like, eh, just don't be a dick."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "But I feel like platforms have a role to be like, just be nicer."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "Maybe do the carrot, like encourage people to be nicer as opposed to the stake of censorship."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "But I think it's an interesting machine learning problem."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "Just be nicer."}, {"time": 3672, "text": "Machine, yeah, machine learning for niceness."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "It is, I mean, that's..."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "Responsible, yeah, I mean, it is."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "It is a thing, for sure."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "Jack Dorsey kind of talks about it as a vision for Twitter is, how do we increase the health of conversations?"}, {"time": 3686, "text": "I don't know how seriously they're actually trying to do that though."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "Which is one of the reasons that I'm in part considering entering that space a little bit."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "It's difficult for them, right?"}, {"time": 3698, "text": "Because, you know, it's kind of like well known that people are kind of driven by rage and you know, outrage maybe is a better word, right?"}, {"time": 3709, "text": "Outrage drives engagement."}, {"time": 3711, "text": "And well, these companies are judged by engagement, right?"}, {"time": 3716, "text": "In the short term, but this goes to the metrics thing that we were talking about earlier."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "I do believe, I have a fundamental belief that if you have a metric of long term happiness of your users, like not short term engagement, but long term happiness and growth and both like intellectual, emotional health of your users, you're going to make a lot more money."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "You're going to have long... Like you should be able to optimize for that."}, {"time": 3741, "text": "You don't need to necessarily optimize for engagement."}, {"time": 3744, "text": "And that'll be good for society too."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "Yeah, no, I mean, I generally agree with you, but it requires a patient person with, you know, trust from Wall Street to be able to carry out such a strategy."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "This is what I believe the Steve Jobs character and Elon Musk character is like, you basically have to be so good at your job."}, {"time": 3765, "text": "Right, you got to pass for anything."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "That you can hold the board and all the investors hostage by saying like, either we do it my way or I leave."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "And everyone is too afraid of you to leave because they believe in your vision."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "But that requires being really good at what you do."}, {"time": 3784, "text": "It requires being Steve Jobs and Elon Musk."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "There's kind of a reason why like a third name doesn't come immediately to mind, right?"}, {"time": 3790, "text": "Like there's maybe a handful of other people, but it's not that many."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "It's not many."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "I mean, people say like, why are you...

years and like we did it, right?"}, {"time": 3826, "text": "Especially in this time of so much kind of existential dread that people are going through because of COVID, like having rockets that just keep going out there now with humans."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "I don't know that it, just like you said, I mean, it gives you a reason to wake up in the morning and dream, for us engineers too."},

engineer, but now you made the unfortunate choice or maybe that's the way life goes of basically moving away from the low level work and becoming a manager, becoming an executive, having meetings, what's that transition been like?"}, {"time": 3883, "text": "It's been interesting."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "It's been a journey."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "Maybe a couple of things to say about that."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "I mean, I got into this, right?"}, {"time": 3889, "text": "Because as a kid, I just remember this like incredible amazement at being able to write a program, right?"},

other kinds of engineering, but you're maybe a little bit more limited with what you can do, right?"}, {"time": 3910, "text": "But with a computer, you can literally imagine any kind of program, right?"}, {"time": 3914, "text": "So it's a little bit godlike what you do like when you create it."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "And so, I mean, that's why I got into it."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "Do you remember like first program you wrote or maybe the first program that like made you fall in love with computer science?"}, {"time": 3928, "text": "I don't know what was the first program."},

doing the creating."}, {"time": 3947, "text": "And, you know, another aspect to it I would say is, you know, when you're a programmer, when you're a individual contributor, it's kind of very easy to know when you're doing a good job, when you're not doing a good job, when you're being productive, when you're not being productive, right?"}, {"time": 3960, "text": "You can kind of see like you

you hope, you know, you're motivating your team and making them more productive and inspiring them, right?"}, {"time": 3975, "text": "But it's not like you get some kind of like dopamine signal

my streak with Lex that we chatted every day going."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "And so they had this like addictive nature to it."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "And that's why Clubhouse was able to garner

money that is coming in that only cares about you going 100X."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "It's a whole different ball game."}, {"time": 5717, "text": "Whereas if you build off revenue, you don't have to do that."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "And if you look at a company like com.com, we invested at 5 million, the next round they did was 250."}, {"time": 5723, "text": "They were so capital efficient

was unbelievable."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "And I've only seen this happen three or four times."}, {"time": 5737, "text": "So it doesn't happen all this capital efficient meaning based on customer

million up in smoke."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "So this is called the J curve where your performance goes down."}, {"time": 5834, "text": "And then it's only in years four or five and six it starts

of, I think, that danger of psychic numbing, which can happen when you think about suffering on such a large scale, as a filmmaker, as a human being, I have to focus in on the individuals, on those human beings in front of me."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "And I think that's exactly what Dr. Al Sadiq and Makiya do to keep going each day."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "And one of the amazing things

about when I'm filming is how do we distill down to universals through imagery, through the vocabulary of cinema?"}, {"time": 1914, "text": "Because I believe so deeply that that vocabulary should be visual."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "So the words, what's the most powerful way to express the universal?"}, {"time": 1923, "text": "Is it visual or is it language words?"}, {"time": 1927, "text": "I

permission."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "She's literally the gatekeeper at the door."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "So no one comes in unless Salha allows them to come in."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "But

the grandmothers, for example, who are admitted and who are living there on the ward."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "And she does it through hugging, right?"}, {"time": 1983, "text": "She does it through bringing them food, right?"}, {"time": 1987, "text": "And she forms these really rather quickly deep relationships of compassion with the families."}, {"time": 1995, "text": "And so it's amazing to watch and no language is needed, right, to bear witness to this."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "And she also suffers because of that, right?"}, {"time": 2006, "text": "And so near the end of the film, if you recall, when another child dies and the mother is wailing, we actually cut away to Salha, who's in the hallway, who walks into another room and begins sobbing."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "She's not a family member, but she has a deep relationship with that family that she forged as soon as they stepped into the ward."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "So that's universal, right?"}, {"time": 2033,

what I mean by visual vocabulary."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "And it's especially powerful because she has seen much of this kind of suffering and she's still, maybe she has built up some callous to be

have to exist."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "And most of them, or at least a good number of them are manufactured by the leaders that choose to use famine as a weapon, right?"}, {"time": 2144, "text":

there to prevent what's been happening in Yemen for seven years."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "And yet there hasn't been any teeth behind it."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "And that's what disturbs me is that we can see how these famines are being used as weapons in war."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "And yet we aren't sort of using the levers of power that exist in order to, I think, to call out in important and powerful ways those who are causing them and to make sure that we hold them accountable on the global stage."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "Now, to some extent, that seems to be happening in

the creative questions that I was really concerned about because starvation, you know, it's not a quick action, right?"}, {"time": 2261, "text": "It's a long, slow, insidious process, right?"},

you know, that's a pretty static scene, right?"}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And what we found was that because of the volume of cases and because of the nature of sort of how quickly how quickly people were coming and going is that it was more dynamic than we anticipated."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "And there's something also about starvation."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "You get tired."}, {"time":

film."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "So we can tuck into a corner sometimes, right?"}, {"time": 3656, "text": "And so just what's long mean?"}, {"time": 3658, "text": "That means they're standing farther away and they can look."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "Zoom lens, it's not a prime lens."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "So it's not a fixed focal length, right?"}, {"time": 3664, "text": "Because a fixed

access, I don't often think about this, but that's probably true for me as well."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "Part of the storytelling is to be in the room."}, {"time": 3712, "text": "And that's the

it's the kind of people you talk to."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "It's like how you live your life."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "Like the kind of people I talk to right now, they steer the direction of my life and steer the direction of things I'll film."}, {"time": 3745, "text": "So it's not just like you're trying to get access."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "It's like, it's everything."}, {"time": 3750,

about some of these leaders and conversations with them, it's almost like steering your life into the direction of the difficult, of like taking the leap."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "And if you're a good human being and a lot of people know who you are as a human, like not as a name, but as really who you are, that like putting that attention out there, it's somehow the world opens doors where the access becomes, the access that once seemed impossible becomes possible."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "And then all of that is a creative journey to be in the room."}, {"time": 3802, "text": "I think that probably is, I mean, it's true even for fiction films probably, is like everything that led to that, like to be in the room, the journey to be in the room and to shoot the scene is maybe more important than the scene itself."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "And like really focus on the creative act of that."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "Yeah, that's really fascinating."}, {"time": 3823, "text":

them, right?"}, {"time": 4649, "text": "So it's instances like that."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "Or if we do do an interview, which we don't do very often, but if we do, just so we have a key light on

vision of what a film's gonna be."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "And sometimes it can be pretty specific."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "Like I'll think through the scenes if I know the locations and

something altogether different than what I thought it would be."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "But it's still good to have the original idea."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "Yeah, yeah, but if I tried to hold to that original vision, right, and to create a film out of that idea, they'd be crap, all the films would be crap."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "So I have to adapt, I have to evolve my approach and then embrace what is actually occurring with the people actually doing it and then reenvision."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "So that reenvision is very active during the entire filming process."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "And so that's the second creation, that's the rethinking and revisualizing based on what we're actually experiencing and seeing what this film is going to be."}, {"time": 4808, "text": "And then I finished filming, right?"}, {"time": 4811, "text": "And we bring the hard drives back and we plug in the hard drives in the edit bay."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "And oftentimes, because it's two of us filming most of the time, I haven't seen all the footage."}, {"time": 4823, "text": "Because in the field, it's all about just filming, right?"}, {"time": 4826, "text": "And then just transferring the footage and getting on safely, you know, clone to multiple drives."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "I don't have a chance to review everything."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "I can't do rushes like you do on a large feature."}, {"time": 4836, "text": "So because I'm filming half of it, I know what I've filmed, right?"}, {"time": 4840, "text": "But I haven't seen everything the director of photography has filmed, right?"}, {"time": 4845, "text": "So the next stage for me is reviewing every single frame of what's been filmed."}, {"time": 4851, "text": "And that's where discovery happens the third time, right?"}, {"time": 4856, "text": "Or the second time rather is, wow, now I thought we'd filmed this, but actually there's this over here."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "And then I have to open up this second vision and turn it and transform it into a third vision for the film based on what's actually on the hard drive."}, {"time": 4872, "text": "So is this like a daily process?"}, {"time": 4875, "text": "So what I do, my process is that if it's a really difficult project, I'll take a break before I go through this just for healing, you know, and some space away and fresh eyes."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "And usually that's about a month."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "And then once I reengage, I reengage whole hog, I reengage fully and I review every single frame."}, {"time": 4897, "text": "And as I do that, I create a spreadsheet."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "And for Hunger War, that spreadsheet was, I don't know, 1500 lines long or something where it's basically log notes."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "And I watch every scene and I take notes and I know really what we have."}, {"time": 4914, "text": "And once I've gone through that process that takes about a month and I really know what we came back with, I create an outline for the film from that."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "And that's the third visioning, right?"}, {"time": 4925, "text": "That's usually completely different than my original vision for the film to some extent, right?"}, {"time": 4930, "text": "But I have to stay open to that entire process or I'd be trying to create something that I can't really create."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "So I think those are the three creations for me."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "That's so cool to know what we have, just to lay it all out and to load it in into your mind."}, {"time": 4951, "text": "Cause like, this is the capture of reality we have."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "It's a very kind of scientific process too."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "Cause you know, in science, you collect a bunch of data about a phenomena and now you have to like analyze that data, but now your phenomena is long gone."}, {"time": 4966, "text": "Now you just have the data."}, {"time": 4967, "text": "Just the data and you have to write a paper about it, like analyze the data, it's similar things."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "You have to like load it all in."}, {"time": 4975, "text": "Where's the story?"}, {"time": 4976, "text": "How do you, that last probably profound piece of doing the editing, like in your mind, like how to lay those things out?"}, {"time": 4990, "text": "Well, it's almost like the scientific process, right?"}, {"time": 4992, "text": "I have a hypothesis, a creative hypothesis, right?"}, {"time": 4995, "text": "Not a scientific one."}, {"time": 4997, "text": "But then I'm testing the hypothesis during the course of filming, right?"}, {"time": 5000, "text": "And I have to stay true to what the data tells me in the end creatively."}, {"time": 5005, "text": "So it's very similar to the scientific processes."}, {"time": 5007, "text": "I don't know what we should, we should probably coin that."}, {"time": 5010, "text": "Yeah, that's pretty good."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "Creative scientific process or something like that."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "But then you actually do the edit and then you watch, that's also iterative in a sense, because maybe when you have a film, that's 20, 30, 40 minutes, or if it's feature length, like do you ever have it where it sucks?"}, {"time": 5034, "text": "Like it's not at all."}, {"time": 5035, "text": "Is there a stage where it sucks?"}, {"time": 5036, "text": "Like a stage where, right, right."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "Like it's where it's like, no, this is not, this is not what I was, like when it's all put together in this way, this doesn't, this is not working right."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "This is not right."}, {"time": 5048, "text": "Or do you, is it

always some moment in the editing process where there's a breakthrough, where suddenly I understand how it fits together more fully."}, {"time": 5064, "text": "And you have to be, like you said, resilient."}, {"time": 5066, "text": "You have to be patient that that moment will come."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "Are you ultra self critical or are you generally optimistic and patient?"}, {"time": 5075, "text": "I don't think those are mutually exclusive."}, {"time": 5078, "text": "Right, so you just oscillate or are they like dance partners or something?"}, {"time": 5082, "text": "They're dance partners, yeah."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "Definitely dancing all the way through the process."}, {"time": 5087, "text": "By way of advice, you know, to young filmmakers, how to film something that is recognized by the world in some way."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "I would say, you know, first off, learn your craft, right?"}, {"time": 5105, "text": "Because I think craft is incredibly foundational, right?"}, {"time": 5111, "text": "To creating a powerful story."}, {"time": 5114, "text": "And sorry to interrupt, but when you say craft, do you mean just the raw technical, the

5218, "text": "I think, I definitely knew right away that it was more my wheelhouse, right?"}, {"time": 5225, "text": "And I think part of that was because I grew up in sort of a world of

{"time": 5319, "text": "And that's a forcing function to, I mean, I personally love having my back to the wall or financially you're screwed if you don't succeed."}, {"time": 5330, "text": "I mean, I lived out of the trunk of my car for a couple of years after grad school, just freelancing, just like, but that couple of years really helped me learn fast because I had to learn fast."}, {"time": 5342, "text": "So I did a couple of voyages around the world for this group called Semester at Sea, that is a floating university that where they go out three and a half months at a time with about 500 college level students and about 35 professors."}, {"time": 5356, "text": "And so you're shooting every day for three and a half months in like nine different countries."}, {"time": 5360, "text":

level and the sophistication that you're doing, but more."}, {"time": 5391, "text": "I think you have to allow the story to dictate what the size of the film should be."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "For these small human rights docs I do, I think two or three, it means you work your butt off, because you're doing everything, right?"}, {"time": 5401, "text": "But it allows you to tell intimate stories

people filming, it allows us to double our footage first off, right?"}, {"time": 5470, "text": "So we have twice as much footage in the time we're filming to come back with as opposed to one person filming."}, {"time": 5475, "text": "So you're each manning a camera?"}, {"time": 5479, "text": "And how much, sorry to keep interrupting, how much interaction and interplay there is?"}, {"time": 5485,

that's, you know, given how access is sometimes shaped by the events so that we can only, something, you know, in Lifeboat, for example, you know, a rescue operation may only happen three days, right?"}, {"time": 5512, "text": "So you want as much footage of that as you can."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "But the other piece of it that's really critical for me, I found is that by having another human being I'm filming with, who I'm co shooting with, it frees me up as a director to not always have to be shooting either."}, {"time": 5527, "text": "I can do all the other work to build relationships, right?"}, {"time": 5531, "text": "To have side conversations with people, to sort out the right way to tell a story, right?"}, {"time": 5538, "text": "Or to transfer footage, knowing that the director of photography is still filming during all that."}, {"time": 5543, "text": "So it frees me up to think of as a director rather than just an image acquirer."}, {"time": 5549, "text": "Yeah, cause there's also, I don't know how distracting it is."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "You've obviously done it for years, but setting stuff up, it preoccupies your mind."}, {"time": 5560, "text":

of my favorite documentaries of all time is a documentary called A Woman Captured, shot in Hungary, by a single filmmaker with a single camera with a single lens, right?"}, {"time": 5589, "text": "And

5657, "text": "There are surgical moments where the moment is so pressing, you really have to be that task driven, right?"}, {"time": 5665, "text": "To capture as thoroughly as possible whatever's unfolding, right?"}, {"time": 5669, "text": "But I think there's other times where you do improvise like jazz, right?"}, {"time": 5672, "text": "And where you have a lot of choices ahead of you, and you're doing maybe a dance with the other camera person, right?"}, {"time": 5681, "text": "In order to capture a scene as creatively and fully as possible during a fixed duration."}, {"time": 5687,

up."}, {"time": 5722, "text": "I mean, that's really the, I think what you're asking about is really the ethos of documentary filmmaking, right?"}, {"time": 5729, "text": "I allow a lot of things to guide my choices."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "One of them being, am I being fair, right?"}, {"time": 5738, "text": "Not balanced, but am I being fair to what I'm witnessing?"}, {"time": 5743, "text":

of paper."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "I always find some way to document it, whether it's just direct address to camera or a translated release."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "So there's, actually that's an interesting little, so they say something to the camera that they consent or they sign the thing."}, {"time": 5772, "text": "Yeah, so for example, the large broadcast companies have this formalized process where they present a piece of paper, right?"}, {"time": 5781, "text": "And the subject reads it and they sign it and then you have permission and that's irrevocable, right?"}, {"time": 5788, "text": "So it'll hold up in court."}, {"time": 5790, "text": "That's not how I operate, right?"}, {"time": 5792, "text": "And so it's just, for example, that doesn't work if someone's illiterate and can't read that piece of paper, right?"}, {"time": 5802, "text": "What if they don't know how to sign their name, right?"}, {"time": 5804, "text": "So instead you have to have a conversation, ask questions, have them ask questions, come to a complete understanding before you even know whether they understand what you're asking, right?"}, {"time": 5814, "text": "And then in that case, if someone's illiterate, then you have that conversation, you just sit down and it takes a long time sometimes, but you have to do it."}, {"time": 5821, "text": "And then if they still wanna participate and they give you their consent, they can't sign a piece of paper, right?"}, {"time": 5828, "text": "So then you just do in their native language, right?"}, {"time": 5831, "text": "Direct consent to camera in their language."}, {"time": 5834, "text": "Interesting, but also you're speaking to the consent that's just a human placing trust in you."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "You make a connection like this."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "That's the most important consent, yeah."}, {"time": 5843, "text": "I hate papers, I hate papers and lawyers because they, exactly for that reason, yeah, okay, great, but you should be focusing on the human connection that leads to the trust, like real consent and consent day to day, minute to minute, because that can change."}, {"time": 5863, "text":

there's any way to say that they're objectively the best three documentaries of all time, but for me, and you may find this interesting given your background, is that I think my top three are all from the Eastern Bloc, actually."}, {"time": 5975, "text": "So Aquarella by Viktor Kosokovsky is one of my favorite, and it's a couple years old now, which is sort of a meditation on the place water has on

different because of your presence?"}, {"time": 6066, "text": "Like you changed the tide of history."}, {"time": 6070, "text": "Yeah, well, back to just like one person at a time that we keep talking, we keep coming back to that theme on some level."}, {"time": 6076, "text": "So this could tie in interesting to one of my favorite films actually."}, {"time": 6081, "text": "So the last two films that I would mention for my top four list would be, the third Eastern Bloc one would be a film called Immortal in 2019, which was shot in Russia by a Russian woman that sort of examines the place of the state in shaping individuals to be vehicles for the state."}, {"time": 6106, "text": "I mean, that's my own synopsis, but that's one of my takeaways from the brilliant 60 minute doc or so."}, {"time": 6112, "text": "Again, Russian filmmaking is really quite good and powerful."}, {"time": 6117, "text": "The fourth one would be a Frederick Wiseman film, Titicate Follies, which was filmed in the US decades ago, inside basically the bowels of an insane asylum or a mental health institution."}, {"time": 6131, "text": "And I bring up Wiseman because he is really the godfather, so to speak, of direct cinema or cinema verite."}, {"time": 6141, "text": "And when early in my career, I really believed in what he expressed as the place of the verite filmmaker, which is simply fly on the wall, which is only observational in nature, right?"}, {"time": 6161, "text": "And I believe that that's how I should be as a nonfiction filmmaker, that I was there only to bear witness, to observe, and not to intervene in any way, shape, or form."}, {"time": 6172, "text": "And that was the sort of foundation for how I operated for many, many years."}, {"time": 6180, "text": "And then some things happened."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "So one of those things that happened was I filmed Lifeboat."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "And during the course of filming Lifeboat, which covered rescue operations in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya, in the first three days of that rescue mission, we came upon over 3,000 people, asylum seekers, floating in flimsy rafts in the water."}, {"time": 6210, "text": "And we were on the Zodiacs and we were filming."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "And within the first couple hours, we would come up to these rafts and these boats that were in really dire shape, and people would be pushed off, and people would jump off, and people would fall into the water, and some of them couldn't swim."}, {"time": 6237, "text": "And so we found ourselves in this moment where we had a choice."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "We could film someone drown in front of us, or we could put our cameras down and pull them out of the water."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "And so that's what we did."}, {"time": 6250, "text": "We put our cameras in the bottom of the water, bottom of the Zodiac, and just started pulling people out of the water."}, {"time": 6257, "text": "And if I was Wiseman, according to his paradigm, then we should have just filmed."}, {"time": 6265, "text": "And I didn't anticipate that moment beforehand."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "I had no sort of foreknowledge that I was gonna find myself faced with that dilemma of the moment as a documentarian."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "But there was no question in my mind that I had to put my camera down and pull that fellow human being out of the water."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "And I don't regret it at all."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "So I've come to a different place."}, {"time": 6286, "text": "I've evolved to what I believe for the kind of film that I do is more appropriate."}, {"time": 6292, "text": "I can go to sleep at night knowing that, regardless of how the film would have been different if I hadn't made that choice, I made the right choice as a human being."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "So I think of it as being a human being first and a filmmaker second in moments like that."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "That's beautifully put, but I also think you could be a human being in small ways too, like silly ways, and put a little bit of yourself in documentaries."}, {"time": 6320, "text": "I tend to see that as really beautiful."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "Like the meta piece of it?"}, {"time": 6326, "text": "Yeah, just put yourself into the movie a little bit."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "Because break that third, fourth, whatever the wall is, is realize that there's a human behind the camera too."}, {"time": 6338, "text": "For some reason, me as a fan, as a viewer, that's enjoyable too."}, {"time": 6342, "text": "I think there's a real authenticity there behind the story, especially with these hard stories that you're doing that there's a human being struggling to."}, {"time": 6353, "text": "Like observing the suffering and having to bear the burden that this kind of suffering exists in the world and you're behind that camera living that struggle."},

subtle moments where I allow that presence to live just for a second."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "Like I hate belly button docs, that's what I call them."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "What's a belly button doc?"}, {"time": 6388, "text": "A belly button doc is navel gazing, right?"}, {"time": 6390, "text": "Where it's sort of a narcissistic filmmaking where someone just studies their own place in the world."}, {"time": 6398, "text": "Right, I think."}, {"time": 6400, "text": "I think my, I'm more concerned with how I can intervene, right?"}, {"time": 6408, "text": "Yeah, well, you're trying to really deeply empathize."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "So like, if you do empathize, who am I?"}, {"time": 6415, "text": "I don't wanna center myself in these stories."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "It's not about me, right?"}, {"time": 6419, "text": "I am so unimportant."}, {"time": 6422, "text": "What is important is what's happening, what's unfolding in the world that we need to act upon."}, {"time": 6426, "text": "And I think it's selfish and narcissistic to push myself into these stories unnecessarily."}, {"time": 6433, "text": "Now that said, I think there is some small value in what you're saying just to remind viewers that there's obviously a filmmaker at play."}, {"time": 6441, "text": "So sometimes the way that I do that is just like through a question on camera."}, {"time": 6445, "text": "I'd allow the audio to live of a question or during a conversation I'm having with someone so they can just hear how it's posed, for example, right?"}, {"time": 6454, "text": "And to me, that's enough."}, {"time": 6458, "text": "I do like moments when people recognize that you exist."}, {"time": 6463, "text": "They look at the filmmaker past the camera and yes, you ask the question in an interview or something like that and they respond to that."}, {"time": 6473, "text": "Like they respond to this like new perturbation into their reality that was created by this other human."}, {"time": 6480, "text": "I especially like when those questions or those perturbations are like a little bit absurd and like add something very novel to their situation and that novelty reveals something about them."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "So as opposed to capturing the day to day reality of their life, you do that plus the perturbations of like something novel."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "But of course, there's all kinds of ways to do this."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "Let me, what was number five, by the way?"}, {"time": 6509, "text": "I only gave you four."}, {"time": 6511, "text":

it sounds like."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "Yeah, yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like, but really brilliantly executed."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "Well, let me ask you about Lifeboat because it's extremely, I don't."}, {"time": 6544, "text": "It's a really moving idea."}, {"time": 6547, "text": "Just the fact that this exists in the world, that there's, as a metaphor, as a reality, that there is a set of people trying to flee desperately."}, {"time": 6558, "text": "It's the desperation of it."}, {"time": 6561, "text": "And now with these refugees, the desperation of that, of trying to escape towards a world that's full of mystery, uncertainty, doubt, could be hopeless at times, and you're willing to do a lot for your own survival and for the survival of your family and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 6580, "text": "That's kind of the human spirit, and you just capture it in Lifeboat."}, {"time": 6587, "text": "Can you tell me the story behind this film as you started to already tell?"}, {"time": 6592, "text": "Can you tell me what is it about?"}, {"time": 6596, "text": "So Lifeboat really seeks to sort of lift up and showcase the asylum seeker crisis in the Mediterranean when it was at its height in 2016."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "And it came to be for many reasons, but one of those reasons is colleagues in the NGO community really shared with me that when the borders between Greece and Turkey were shut down, that the flow of Syrian asylum seekers that was initially going across from Turkey to Greece was going to shift westward across the Mediterranean."}, {"time": 6642, "text": "So I started to research that and discovered that was exactly the case, and then further stumbled upon the fact that nation states hadn't really stepped up to address it and that there were hundreds of asylum seekers often drowning in these flimsy crafts that were pushed off from the shores of Libya because the EU wasn't doing its duty to patrol those waters from a humanitarian standpoint."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "And so the net result of that was that this whole sort of like humanitarian community sprung up and it was civil society based that tried to meet the needs of those asylum seekers to just ensure that fellow human beings weren't drowning, simply put."}, {"time": 6687, "text": "And one of those was the small little NGO called Sea Watch, which when they discovered what was happening, just cobbled together a coalition of volunteers, bought a research vessel, retrofitted it, and motored down off the coast of Libya to start pulling people out of the water."}, {"time": 6705, "text": "And again, I found that inspiring, right?"}, {"time": 6708, "text": "I found that inspiring that this group of volunteers was doing something that our leaders wouldn't, right?"}, {"time": 6716, "text": "And it was something as basic and simple as saving human beings."}, {"time": 6723, "text": "And I thought there was an inspiring

water who couldn't swim, I did that."}, {"time": 6753, "text": "And that's again, speaking to the basic humanity, put down the camera and help, yeah."}, {"time": 6760, "text": "So this is people coming from Libya, trying to make it across the Mediterranean Sea on a crappy, tiny boat."}, {"time": 6768, "text": "From a filmmaker perspective, how do you film that?"}, {"time": 6771, "text": "Was there decisions to capture the desperation?"}, {"time": 6775, "text": "Well, we were going back to this idea of access and how that's so fundamental to my approach."}, {"time": 6783, "text": "And we were bound by the strictures of the rescue operation on this Sea Watch vessel, which was 30 meters long."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "And we were two of a crew of 15, right?"}, {"time": 6796, "text":

to live that duality, right?"}, {"time": 6833, "text": "Of being a humanitarian and a filmmaker simultaneously."}, {"time": 6836, "text": "And the greatest example I can share of that was, or with my director of photography in that project, Kenny Allen, Kenny's a big guy."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "It's like, he's got like arms like tree trunks."}, {"time": 6851, "text": "And he, because he was so physically able and strong, the head of mission really tasked him to be on the Zodiacs to pull people out of the water because he could literally with one arm reach down and just oftentimes pull someone out, right?"}, {"time": 6870, "text": "Whereas usually it would take two or three people, right?"}, {"time": 6873, "text": "And so when we were at the height of triage and there were people in the water all over and rafts were sinking, Kenny was out pulling people out of the water."}, {"time": 6883, "text": "And this went on for like 24 hours, right?"}, {"time": 6886, "text": "And at the end of that first day, I remember like looking over on the deck and seeing Kenny like help people up from the ladders to walk them back, right?"}, {"time": 6896, "text": "And his camera was nowhere to be seen, right?"}, {"time": 6899, "text": "And so I walked over to him and I just grabbed him by the shoulders and said, Kenny, where's your camera?"}, {"time": 6907, "text": "And he didn't know."},

again, but that gives you a sense of sort of this world that we had to live in in order to get the story done."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "But I think to be a great director of photography, to be a great director, you have to lose yourself like that in the story too."}, {"time": 6953, "text": "But usually with a camera in your hand, right?"}, {"time": 6955, "text": "But sometimes you forget the camera."}, {"time": 6958, "text": "I mean, there's a, I feel like if you're obsessed with the camera too much, you can lose the humanity of it."}, {"time": 6968, "text": "You get obsessed with the

the rules just, and why are they in place, right?"}, {"time": 7085, "text": "So, for example, coming into the airport in southern Yemen, right?"}, {"time": 7090, "text": "If I just tried to walk through the airport with all my equipment, even with all the permissions beforehand, like we had, without having a fixer at the airport beforehand to make sure we didn't go through the standard line,

our time and paying a series of bribes, right?"}, {"time": 7134, "text": "Instead, we're going to get it fixed beforehand so that we can walk through a different line and have no one look at any of our equipment."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "That's a pretty good trade off in my mind."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "What about security when you're traveling in these places?"}, {"time": 7149, "text": "Do you ever have bodyguards?"}, {"time": 7152, "text": "Well, several questions around that."}, {"time": 7154, "text": "Are you ever afraid for your life when you're filming in a war zone?"}, {"time":

can."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "But one of the ways I can't do it in a conflict zone is by having armed security with me."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "And the reason for that is because, especially in a place like Yemen, right?"}, {"time": 7181, "text": "If you have armed security, you become a target in a way that if you're operating under sort of the auspices of international humanitarian law, I actually have more protection."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "So I don't bring security."}, {"time": 7195, "text": "If you're working in Northern Yemen, for example, you're going to have someone from the

course."}, {"time": 7217, "text": "I mean, fear is a natural human emotion, right?"}, {"time": 7220, "text": "And I think we have a weird mindset, this sort of heroic mindset surrounding fear in the

than pretending to be brave, I think you have to just acknowledge that fear has a place to keep you alive."}, {"time": 7254, "text": "And I think it's a matter of not letting the fear arrest you and allowing the fear to live and then acting anyway."}, {"time": 7264, "text": "Don't you think as a documentary filmmaker, the fear is a really good signal for potentially a good thing to do because there's a story there?"}, {"time": 7274, "text": "So is fear is an indicator that you shouldn't do it or is it an indicator that you should do it?"}, {"time": 7279, "text": "It's probably an indication you should do it, right?"}, {"time": 7282, "text": "And strangely, I think that's why, I think that if there's something unusual about the work I do in some part, it's because of these

early in the Syrian uprising, and we returned to the Syrian Turkish border with a Syrian American orthopedic surgeon who was volunteering, operating on refugees as they float across the border from Syria into Turkey."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "And it was an attempt at the time, before a lot of films had come out about the conflict, to really show again the effects of the war on civilians."},

visited?"}, {"time": 7475, "text": "So in that instance, you know, I thought of him as the Turkish Schindler, right?"}, {"time": 7481, "text": "Because he was a human being who of his own volition, no one was paying him to do this, but he was spending much of his time."}, {"time": 7493, "text": "He was just a local businessman who really saw the need in the camps right across the border 10 K away."}, {"time": 7500, "text": "And he saw the medical need in particular and how hard it was to get people in desperate medical conditions across the border where there was a clinic just right across the border."}, {"time": 7513, "text": "But because of the security and the layers of security, they couldn't get out by themselves."}, {"time": 7520, "text": "So he took it upon himself as a Turkish person to build relationships with the Turkish guards, which was relatively easy."}, {"time": 7528, "text": "And then he built relationships with sort of the guards in the no man's land between the Syrian guards and sort of those who lived in the middle area."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "And then also with the Syrian guards at the camp."}, {"time": 7541, "text": "And he would drive out there daily and bring them food, right?"}, {"time": 7545, "text": "Talk them up and build relationships."}, {"time": 7547, "text": "And so every day he would bring these guards food and build relationships with them."}, {"time": 7551, "text": "And what that meant was eventually, right?"}, {"time": 7554, "text": "He had this avenue of access to and from the camps."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "And so he started using it and he would drive this avenue of access through the three layers of guards each day."}, {"time": 7568, "text": "And then they would open the gates for him because he had made himself trustworthy in their eyes."}, {"time": 7573, "text": "And he would receive the most desperate medical cases that were coming from all over Northern Syria, right?"}, {"time": 7581, "text": "To receive medical treatment."}, {"time": 7583, "text": "And he would, as you see in the film, he would ferry them into the back of his car, right?"}, {"time": 7588, "text": "And then drive them to the hospital where they would receive operations."}, {"time": 7593, "text": "And then he would bring them back if they wanted after they'd healed and recovered back to Syria, if they wanted to return out post recovery."}, {"time": 7601, "text": "And he didn't get paid for that."}, {"time": 7604, "text": "He was spending his own money to do it because he saw other human beings in need."}, {"time":

kind of torn by this whole thing."}, {"time": 7744, "text": "Anyway, that's a discussion for perhaps another time."}, {"time": 7747, "text": "But the short question is why is it so hard to watch your documentaries and other films, other incredible films on the internet?"}, {"time": 7760, "text": "If I want to pay unlimited amount of money, I want to pay a lot of money to watch it."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "Well, Lifeboat is streaming free on the New Yorker."}, {"time": 7772, "text": "Yes, I saw that, which is interesting."}, {"time": 7777, "text": "And then also Hunger Ward is on

those platforms are, I mean, they're not as easily accessible because you have to like, you have to use, you have to think and you have to chase a particular."}, {"time": 7813, "text": "You have to chase it, yeah, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "I guess from an economic standpoint, the answer to that is pretty clear, right?"}, {"time": 7819, "text": "It may not be what people want to watch."}, {"time": 7822, "text": "Maybe people want to watch reality."}, {"time": 7825, "text": "Maybe people want to watch animal rescue shows here in the US, which is exactly why in part, I think

version I can give you?"}, {"time": 715, "text": "So we'll basically check the order book, give you a quote."}, {"time": 719, "text": "It's good for some period of time or for some amount of slippage."}, {"time": 722, "text": "And then what's happening is we're initiating a debit to your payment method, whether that's a credit card or a bank account, or you're storing dollars or euros or something on our platform, there's various payment methods."}, {"time": 733, "text": "So we're basically debiting that."}, {"time": 735, "text": "And then we're crediting you the crypto and we're taking a fee for it too."}, {"time": 739, "text": "So that's fundamentally what's happening underneath."}, {"time": 744, "text": "And then there's just some interesting slippage."}, {"time": 746,

this and like high frequency traders and arbitrage and all kinds of interesting topics."}, {"time": 768, "text": "Flash Boys was like an interesting book on this whole thing."}, {"time": 770, "text": "You want like access to information the fastest, sometimes even putting your thing in the data center right next to the thing."}, {"time": 778, "text": "We don't allow that colo stuff cause we want it to be more democratized."}, {"time": 783, "text": "But basically you give a, let's say we wanted to just keep it math simple."}, {"time": 787, "text": "We want to charge a 1% fee."}, {"time": 788, "text": "So if you're buying $100 of Bitcoin and we'll charge you $101, we've presented you the amount of Bitcoin you're going to get for the $100."}, {"time": 796, "text": "Now let's say 10 seconds later you hit accept."}, {"time": 798, "text": "We go to fill the order."}, {"time": 801, "text": "So it's going to be some error bound around that 1% fee, right?"}, {"time": 805, "text": "And if we think we're actually losing money on the trade, I think we'll often reject it."}, {"time": 809, "text": "So some part of the fee, the slippage is incorporated into that, averaged over a large number of people."}, {"time": 818, "text": "Just, it's fascinating."}, {"time": 819, "text": "Cause like even just like that little detail probably requires a lot of experimentation."}, {"time": 825, "text": "And it's kind of like a giant bug bounty out there because if you get it wrong, there's people who are going to arbitrage that."}, {"time": 830, "text": "And we've had people sort of pen test our systems in a really creative ways where like, they'll just fire like programmatically with APIs, they'll fire off like a million different quotes and look for one of them that's out of bounds and then actually take that money right there."}, {"time": 847, "text": "And we get people doing all kinds of crazy stuff."}, {"time": 850, "text": "So how do you protect against that?"}, {"time": 852, "text": "How do you protect?"}, {"time": 853, "text": "So we'll talk about cybersecurity in interesting ways, but there's a lot of clever people trying to do clever things to earn, not even just to break into the system, but to earn an edge of some kind in the system."}, {"time": 866, "text": "How do you stay one step ahead?"}, {"time": 868, "text": "There's no silver bullet, it's a bunch of lead bullets, right?"}, {"time": 870, "text": "So it's like, you know, one thing we do is we just have good test suites, right?"}, {"time": 876, "text": "So you're testing every piece of code that goes out, that's like just common good best practice, but it's particularly important in financial services."}, {"time": 883, "text": "Another thing we do is we hire third party firms to try to audit this stuff and break in."}, {"time": 888, "text": "Another one we do is we have a bug bounty program."}, {"time": 891, "text": "So we basically pay white hat hackers to find this stuff before the black hats do."}, {"time": 896, "text": "And we've paid out lots of good bug bounties."}, {"time": 899, "text": "So, you know, try all the above."}, {"time": 902, "text": "And occasionally you don't get it right and you lose some money and then you fix it and you keep going, so yeah."}, {"time": 907, "text": "Let's talk about cybersecurity a little bit more."}, {"time": 910, "text": "You mentioned using stolen bank accounts."}, {"time": 913, "text": "So that's another one, that's another interesting one."}, {"time": 915, "text": "How do you protect against that?"}, {"time": 917, "text": "Okay, so fraud prevention, yeah, is a big topic."}, {"time": 920, "text": "So one of the, there's a lot of things people do, but one of the things they do is that you use machine learning, right?"}, {"time": 928, "text": "So you look at hundreds."}, {"time": 929, "text": "To protect or to attack?"}, {"time": 930, "text": "To protect against it."}, {"time": 932, "text": "So what you want to do is kind of build up a labeled data set of all the different people who have turned out to be fraudulent and good actors, and hopefully collect as much data as you can."}, {"time": 944, "text": "And then, you know, you might feed hundreds or thousands of these factors into your machine learning model and it'll come back with a risk score."}, {"time": 951, "text": "So, you know, an example of like the kinds of factors people create or put in there, you know, obviously I don't want to disclose too many of them because it's a cat and mouse game, but just kind of, I don't know, relatively well known stuff might be."}, {"time": 963, "text": "You know, you have device fingerprints, right?"}, {"time": 966, "text": "So like, what kind of device are you on and what fonts do you have installed?"}, {"time": 970, "text": "A lot of people who are farming lots of these accounts, they're using emulators and like virtual machines and stuff."}, {"time": 975, "text": "They're not like, you know, an average person on that device."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And then you'll see sometimes like, one of my favorite metrics we track for this was called like improbable travel velocity."}, {"time": 986, "text": "So we would, we're tracking people's IPS, right?"}, {"time": 988, "text": "And you might see someone who was one day in Austin, Texas and then like an hour later they were in London or something."}, {"time": 996, "text": "It's like, well, that's very improbable."}, {"time": 997, "text": "I mean, sometimes people are using VPNs."}, {"time": 999, "text": "So you gotta be careful with that because like there's legitimate people who use VPNs too."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "But if it's not possible for them to have gotten on a plane and gotten there that quickly, then that's usually they're like spoofing a device or IP."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "Sometimes those are interesting factors."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "But yeah, if you feed enough of these in, you will, oh, another fun one is like, you know, real users will type their credit card like one number at a time."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Scammers have a list of them and they'll just paste in a whole number."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "So you can look at like the number of milliseconds between keystrokes."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "Like there's all kinds of stuff people have come up with."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "And even for travel velocity, you could probably incorporate VPNs too because there's probably a travel velocity for VPN switching too that's human like."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "Like if you're using legitimately VPN for something else, that might be, there's like legitimate uses too."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "Actually, you know, I feel embarrassed that I don't know this, probably should."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "But the, I'm not a robot."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "So that probably works in the same way."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Like how do you move your mouse maybe or how the dynamics of the clicking."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "But how does that even work that well then?"}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And why can't it be fake?"}, {"time": 1073, "text": "Cause it's such a trivial capture."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "It feels like it should be very crackable."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "And yet a lot of high security places use that."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "It's another cat and mouse game."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "So I think they've, yeah, but it's using a lot of similar signals like mouse movements, keystrokes."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "And then obviously all the stuff that comes over the wire with your browser."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "So like what operating system, what fonts, what headers are being sent over."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "And there's actually, there's an old website."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "I can't remember what it's called."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "It was kind of like Panoptik Click or Panopticon or something."}, {"time":

"I mean, it was kind of, I felt like I was just following my gut."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "So, I mean, I was working at Airbnb."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "I was a software engineer there, project manager."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "I was working on some fraud prevention stuff, for instance."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And I read the Bitcoin white paper in kind of December of 2010."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "I started going to some Bitcoin meetups in the Bay Area, met lots of interesting people there, like crazy people, anarchists, really brilliant people, all the above."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "And so I started nights and weekends trying to put together a prototype."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "And my initial thought was, well, SMTP is a protocol that runs email."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And Git is a protocol for version control that people made like Gmail and GitHub."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "Most people don't wanna run their own email server or even their own Git server."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "They just wanna like use a hosted thing that will do all the security and backups for them."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "So the thought in my head at that time was Bitcoin's this new protocol."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "There's probably gonna be somebody who makes a hosted service that does all the security and backups for you, makes Bitcoin as a protocol easy to use."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "So maybe I should make like a hosted Bitcoin wallet or something, that was my, it was gonna make Gmail for Bitcoin or something."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And a bunch of people told me that was a bad idea."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "Like most of my smart friends who I told about it, they were like, well, first of all, I don't really get what you're doing at all."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "Like Bitcoin sounds like a scam or something you've gotten involved in."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "But then other people who understood what Bitcoin was told me they thought it was a dumb idea because they're like, dude, if you store all this Bitcoin, you're just gonna get hacked."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "Like nobody, you know, why would you do that?"}, {"time": 1274, "text": "And so I kind of had this thought like, you know what?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "I'm not gonna go all in and like make a store everyone's Bitcoin, that would be too much right now."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "I have a job, I have a day job, you know?"}, {"time": 1285, "text": "But let me just make a prototype and I'll tell people this is like a beta thing."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Like don't put any real money in it and just see if there's interest."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And if I feel like I'm onto something, maybe I'll go do this as a company."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "Cause I did, I really wanted to be an entrepreneur at that time."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "I was like, I was 29, I was almost turning 30."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "And I was, I always wanted to like start a company, but I was, you know, I wasn't yet."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "I was an employee at a company that was great."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "But so anyway, I had this prototype."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "I was hacking together nights and weekends."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "I actually wrote a whole Bitcoin node in Ruby, which turned out to be a, maybe a weird decision in hindsight, cause Ruby wasn't the most performant language."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "We've subsequently had to rebuild that many times."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "But yeah, I had this hosted Bitcoin wallet and the thing that I didn't have any users for it, by the way, I applied to Y Combinator cause I was like, maybe if somebody there writes me a check, this will like make it feel like a real company."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "And I was trying to find a co founder at that time unsuccessfully."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "So I was basically just wandering in the desert."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "I had a lot of self doubt about this cause I was like, I don't know, all my friends don't think this is kind of dumb and maybe Bitcoin is just gonna get shut down and like, this is all be some stupid thing."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "So there was definitely a feeling of just wandering lost in the desert, lots of self doubt."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "Paul Graham and the Y Combinator group kind of wrote me the first check after I went and interviewed and stuff."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "And they wrote me a check for like 150K."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "And that was the first time somebody who I really looked up to kind of said, this is worth pursuing."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "Like maybe you're onto something, maybe you're not, but like, let's at least try it."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And so that was kind of what gave me the confidence to quit my job and try it."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "And I'll wrap the story here by saying that like we, I found the right co founder after Y Combinator."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "We still didn't have any customers."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "The thing that, I basically launched the hosted Bitcoin wallet."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "There were people signing up."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "I just posted on Reddit and places like that."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "And maybe like a hundred people would sign up and then nobody would come back."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "And so I was like, I just in Y Combinator, they often tell you like, talk to your customers and improve your product."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "Talk to your customers, improve your product."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "That's all you're supposed to be doing."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "Try to find product market fit."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "So I emailed like five of the users that had signed up and I was like, hey, I worked on this app."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "I saw you signed up."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "Can I get on the phone with you?"}, {"time": 1412, "text": "I get on the phone with like five of these folks."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "And I was like, why didn't you come back?"}, {"time": 1416, "text": "And the guy was like, well, the app was okay for a beta, but like, I don't have any Bitcoins."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "So I didn't really know what to do with it."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "And I remember this light bulb kind of went off in my head."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "I was like, well, if I put a buy Bitcoin button in there, would you have used it?"}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And he was like, yeah, maybe."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "So then I had this, we went about the process."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "My co founder at that time, we like got basically had to get like a bank partnership, payment rails, you know, an exchange, basic exchange functionality, all that stuff I was mentioning earlier in place."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "And the minute we launched that feature where you could just click buy, put in your bank counter credit card, buy Bitcoin, it showed up in your account."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "From that day forward, like the number of users started to go up like this."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And so we finally had found product market fit after two years of wandering in the desert."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "So you weren't even thinking about to buy the on ramps."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "You would think it would be just the wallet, a place to store Bitcoin that you've already gotten."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "This is, I mean, cause that's such a pain to do, to have to work with others to convert dollars and fiat currency into Bitcoin."}, {"time": 1478, "text": "So did you, I mean, were you overwhelmed by the immensity of the task here or were you just sort of not allowing yourself to think too deeply through this whole thing and just letting the optimism take over here?"}, {"time": 1499, "text": "You know, I was really looking forward to like doing something crazy and like a big challenge."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "And I wanted to, I love kind of crisis moments like that where, you know, I'm very determined, right?"}, {"time": 1512, "text": "And especially when I get like very set on something and I'm just like, you know what?"}, {"time": 1515, "text": "I'm gonna figure out a way to make this fucking thing work, like no matter what."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "And so I reveled in that."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "I was sort of, I had read all these books about startups and like every startup has these like, you know, major setbacks and just like nothing works."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "And so that was a sign that you're doing something right."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "I had no idea if I was doing anything right at all, but I was like, I was kind of loving the experience of it in a weird way."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "It felt, it felt stressful at the time."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Like, you know, nothing was working and, but I was just, I felt like I was on the right path somehow."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And so I just kept going, I don't know."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "What was the darkest moment that you've gone to in your mind during that time?"}, {"time": 1556, "text": "What was, what were some of the tougher moments?"}, {"time": 1558, "text": "You said self doubt."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "Have you, yeah, where'd you go?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "Where'd you go in your mind?"}, {"time": 1566, "text": "Is there a moment where you're just like laying there?"}, {"time": 1570, "text": "This is, this is hopeless."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "Well, there's a couple of moments I'm remembering."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "I mean, so for whatever reason, I had this like big chip on my shoulder at that time."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "And I was like, I really want to do something important in the world."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "Like, you know, I could have a good life and like work for some good companies and write some software."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "And I'm, for some reason, I never wanted that for myself."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "That probably would have been healthier, honestly, just to like, as an expected value outcome, that's probably a better thing in life."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "But I was like, I was like, man, I really want to do something important and have a bigger impact."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "And I was like, I was willing to sacrifice a lot for that."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "I was like sleep and not going out with friends and stuff."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "I remember one of the, just for like years working on this stuff, I remember one of the darker moments was, we probably had like maybe five employees at that time."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "And I remember like a bunch of bad things happened like all at once."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "And it was, so first of all, you have to remember at this time, we were all very sleep deprived, which kind of exacerbates everything."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "If you look at like the Exxon Valdez spill and all these like natural disasters, like sleep deprivation is often involved."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "So, because the reason why we were so sleep deprived is not just because we were working so much, but like the site would go offline in the middle of the night and we'd get, I'd get paged."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "I was like on pager duty."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "So I'd get woken up sometimes like two or three times a night, like have to try to fix something, go back to sleep."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "So in that environment, you can kind of get, you can get discouraged."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "So one bad thing that happened was, we had a bug on the website and there was thousands of people on Reddit and Twitter who were all like pissed at Coinbase because like the balances were showing wrong."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "And they were just like, fuck this company, it's over."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "Like, I hate these guys."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "And so that was, I'd never had this feeling of a thousand people mad at me at the same time."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "You know, I feel like I'm a pretty chill guy."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "Like most of the time people don't get mad at me."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "So that was one."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "Another one was that."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "Can we pause on that?"}, {"time": 1685, "text": "So you were saying like, here's a dream."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "I'm trying to create something."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "And now forever, the reputation of this dream is ruined."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "It will never, it's irrecoverable."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "It's over, that kind of feeling."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "Yeah, well, I didn't, you're right."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "I didn't know at that time."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "I was like, is this, is this the end?"}, {"time": 1701, "text": "Like everybody, we're so, we're so tiny."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "Now everybody hates us."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "So is it over?"}, {"time": 1708, "text": "Nobody told me this before starting a company that like, you're a bunch of people will hate you for this, which is like a very counterintuitive thing."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "Cause you know, most companies I think are doing good things in the world, at least you're trying, right?"}, {"time": 1719, "text": "And so even if someone's like trying, but they're not, they're failing, I'm generally rooting for them."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "At least you're trying, right?"}, {"time": 1725, "text": "But that's not the case at all."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "And most founders I've known have gone through this too, where they're very surprised at the amount of hate that they get."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "And if it's, I think it's actually like a muscle you can build your tolerance to it."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "Like, because you know, you go talk to somebody who's like, for you, it feels terrible cause you're at the center of this storm and like, but if you go, then you go talk to like, you know, your family or some other person like, dude, I didn't even hear about that."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "Like my, they're just busy in their own life."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And so they, they have no idea that you had all this negative press or like whatever it was."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "Can I put once again, put a link on that?"}, {"time": 1760, "text": "There's an interesting person I'd like to bring up just as an example, Bill Gates."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "So he gets a very large amount of hate on the internet."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "And there's something about him, this is me talking that you, that he seems out of touch about that hate."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "I believe at least in my understanding that with the resources he has, he's trying and is actually doing a lot of good."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "And yet there's a gigantic amount of hate, conspiracy theories and stuff like that."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "And it feels like that's the case because he's somehow out of touch with people."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "So I wonder how you stay in touch with the voice of the people without being destroyed by the outrage."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "Is there any wisdom you have to that or?"}, {"time": 1811, "text": "I don't know about wisdom, but I've thought about this too, because yeah, you wanna always be open to feedback, especially from people who have like your best interests at heart, right?"}, {"time": 1822, "text": "And if you can become isolated from it and just like, you know, surrounded by yes people."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "And I mean, who knows, maybe like she and Putin and people like that are in situations I have no idea."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "But if you listen to too much of it and you just try to please everyone, you'll never get anything done."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "And I mean, most of the best leaders are people who they can act when they believe that they're doing something net positive for the world and humanity."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "And they actually don't really care if they piss off some portion of the people."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Almost anything you're gonna do of significance in the world today is gonna piss off 5% of people, maybe 49% of people or whatever, maybe 60%, I don't know."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "So you never wanna become so surrounded by people who just work for you and will say yes."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "And then you think like, well, I'm a genius and I'm like, that's how you become a dictator or whatever."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "But you also can't care so much about what people think because then you'll never do anything that's truly authentic to yourself."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "One other thought on that, by the way, I think it's a really good question."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So I've thought about this a lot."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Like why, you know, people generally kind of hate on Zuck and they hate on Bill Gates and they hate on, they don't really hate on Elon."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "Well, actually Elon has a lot of haters too, but it's a different thing."}, {"time": 1897, "text": "This is measured, this is measured, I was looking at some surveys, so I think Zuck is the most, so loved and hated, right?"}, {"time": 1906, "text": "Zuckerberg is the most, both loved and hated."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "He's the most hated."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "And then I think it's Bill Gates and Elon is down there."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "I think it's like 40% hate Zuck, people asked."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "And then Elon is in the double digits, but low double digits."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "And so it's interesting, you just look at this data, ask yourself why."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "Right, so I ask myself this sometimes too, because I don't claim to know any of these people well, but like I've met them briefly."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "And my impression is that they're actually all smart people trying to do good things in the world."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So there's not too much difference there, despite public perception."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So why is it that some are really hated and some aren't?"}, {"time": 1945, "text": "I mean, it's a complicated question."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "Obviously Zuck in his Facebook got blamed for the whole election thing and all that didn't help."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "Social media has gotten a lot of pressure just from like, hey, why aren't you solving all of society's tough problems?"}, {"time": 1960, "text": "It's like, well, they're just one company."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "But one thing I've noticed is that a lot of these people, they have like Asperger's, right, a little bit."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "And sometimes people with Asperger's don't really emote in the same way."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "And so I think it's almost a form of like bias against their cognitive type or something, which is like that person doesn't emote right."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "I don't trust their intentions."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "And the other thing I've thought about too is that sometimes I think some leaders, like maybe Zuck or Bill Gates, they can come across as like a little bit PR rehearsed."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "Like they're basically, they're giving the PR approved answers where Elon just says whatever he thinks like to a fault."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "So even if people hate what he says or like, at least I believe it's authentic."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "So I've always thought about that too for myself."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "I'm like, how do I, cause you can fuck it up on both sides, right?"}, {"time": 2018, "text": "Like if you just come out and you're like saying whatever stream of consciousness, you'll often end up like pissing off people on your team or like saying tripping over some like regulation that you've, there's all kinds of things about running a public company, you can't say certain stuff."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "But if you're too PR approved and your answer is like, nobody trusts you what you're saying."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And so anyway, this is something I think about a lot."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "I don't think I have the right answer, but I'm trying to find that balance."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "And more and more with the internet, there's a premium on authenticity, just like you're saying."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "People really, really appreciate that."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "So for leaders, it's a challenge to be, how do I make sure I'm authentic, but also don't say stupid shit."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "And so that's an interesting thing."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "I've noticed that just having interacted with a bunch of leaders that you have to be careful how much you surround yourself with PR folks."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "Because the best, I would say, let me just say a nice thing about marketing and PR folks, the best marketing folks are extremely good."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "So they understand exactly what great marketing is and great PR, it's authenticity."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "It's showing, revealing the beauty."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "As opposed to PR and marketing out of fear."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "Oh, don't say that, don't say this, don't that."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "Because then you start living in this kind of, that pushes you towards a bubble where you can't express the, your beautiful quirks and weirdness and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "And also the cool, the beautiful things about what you're doing."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "I find like, especially with tech things, like even like Coinbase, the way to reveal the beauty of it is not only by showing all the things you could do with it, but showing that there's great engineering going on underneath."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "So letting the nerds shine too."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "It doesn't have to be like these kind of commercials where it's like a happy family using Coinbase to send a transaction about flowers for mom or something like that."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "Like it could be also like gritty stuff and real stuff."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "So that's a general just observation I made."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "But you said you were talking about dark moments and that there's people on the internet that were pissed off that the site was down."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "And you said there might be something else."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "Yeah, so sleep deprived, like a bunch of people on the internet were pissed at me."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "The balances were fucked up."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "Like people were tweeting the company's over, just give the money back, whatever."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "And then, oh yeah, somebody posted."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "So we had all this, we didn't, we started to get all these customer support inquiries and like, we only had like a few people at the company."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And so we were backed up maybe like 20,000 support requests."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "So people couldn't get ahold of us."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "So somebody posted my cell phone number on Reddit and they were like, they were like, if you need to get ahold of the CEO, whatever, cause everyone's upset about where their money is."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "So I remember we're in the office, it's like late at night."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "We've been working like 12 hours, we're all sleep deprived."}, {"time": 2193, "text": "I'm trying to hack and like get this bug fixed."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "And we all need like food at the office."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "And so my phone has been blowing up all day cause someone posted my phone number on the internet."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "And there's like a guy, there was a guy like trying to deliver food and I needed to answer my phone to like get the food from downstairs."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "So I was like, shit, I gotta just see who, if that's him."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "So I started answering the call and it's like, is this Brian?"}, {"time": 2216, "text": "I'm like, nope, wrong number, click."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "And I pick up the next call."}, {"time": 2220, "text": "It's like every, when I finished the call, another call is like coming in."}, {"time": 2223, "text": "So I was like, I'm a reporter from Japan, like asking about a security, nope, wrong number, click."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "And then I like, finally I get the delivery guy downstairs, bring the food up."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "We were all like surviving to like fix this bug."}, {"time": 2237, "text": "I remember there was just basically a point that night where I was like, fuck, I need to just, I basically just curled up on like a ball on the floor."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "And I just like cried for a little bit."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "I think I let myself just kind of wallow in self pity, kind of took a nap for about five minutes."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "And I was like, let's fucking solve this."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "And I like, you know, stop being like a little whatever and like got back up."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "Sleep deprivation combined with just the stress and the pressure of the site going down and everybody wants the site to be up."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "Just the pressure from people and the number of users is growing and growing and growing."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "So that pressure is just mentally, mentally tough."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "What was your source of strength during that time?"}, {"time": 2278, "text": "Like what, like somebody that patted you on the back and said, we got this."}, {"time": 2284, "text": "Yeah, well, it definitely helped to have a co founder."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "So, you know, there's like that old saying about it's better to be in a great relationship than to be single, but it's better to be single than in a bad relationship."}, {"time": 2294, "text": "So co founders actually blow up a lot of companies too."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "But when you find the right co founder, which I was lucky to find with, with Fred or some, that was very important."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "There was definitely moments where, you know, I was like kind of, you know, at the width end or whatever."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "And he was like, it's like, dude, let's rally."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "Like, and he basically carried the team, you know, a couple of times, like in really key moments."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "What advice would you give to startup founders about this particular stage about surviving it to the five and through the five employees stage where you were?"}, {"time": 2327, "text": "Yeah, well, if your pre product market fit, the best advice that I have from that period is action produces information."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "So just like keep doing stuff, you know, I remember like Paul Graham, Paul Graham had this great line like that."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "I think that's his line."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "And he was like, startups are like sharks."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "If they stop swimming, they die."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "You know, so even if you're like, not sure what to do, like just do anything because when you do it, it'll like, it'll produce some information."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "Like people liked it."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "They didn't, this was very true for me."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "There was times where I just did something instead of debating it endlessly and like, just try it."}, {"time": 2364, "text": "You know, like, all right."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "So we shipped it."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "And like, there was a couple of times where like the minute I shipped it and I was like, I knew, I know we built this wrong, but now I have an idea of what to do next."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "And it wasn't, I only would have had the idea if we'd actually gone through the exercise of going to build it."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "It's like my other favorite analogy for this is that you're like at the base of a mountain that's shrouded in fog and you're looking up at the mountain and you're trying to think like, okay, how do I get up there?"}, {"time": 2389, "text": "But you can only see like three or four steps ahead cause the fog is so thick."}, {"time": 2392, "text": "So you have to just take steps into the unknown."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "And when you take three steps, another three steps will be revealed ahead of you."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "And sometimes you'll end up on some local maximum."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "You'll have to retrace your steps or whatever, but, or come up to a cliff, you know, but most people in life don't take the steps into the fog, into the unknown because it's scary."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "Or they're like, I don't know, what if I fail?"}, {"time": 2415, "text": "Or like, I don't know how that's going to work or I might run out of money or I won't be able to get a job after, or I don't know, whatever reason."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "But that is like one of the things that separates, I think entrepreneurial people with that kind of inclination is that they have sort of a comfort with this risk tolerance but it's actually not really risky if you think about it."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "It's not like, you know, at least in most places, like, you know, if you go to a startup and it fails, like you're going to, you're even more valuable to your next employer, right?"}, {"time": 2444, "text": "Or you can go raise a seed round, pay yourself a salary, try it for like two years or three years."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "If it doesn't work, go get another job."}, {"time": 2450, "text": "It's not like you're, you weren't paying yourself a salary during that time."}, {"time": 2453, "text": "So I think, I think people overestimate the risk of doing a startup and they just never, they never start because it seems crazy and all your friends think it's silly."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "Like that's sort of the default nature of every big startup idea."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "It's just basic fear."}, {"time": 2466, "text": "It's the same kind of fear that if you see a, if you're a guy, see a cute girl at a bar, it's the fear associated with coming up to her, you like her, asking her."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "It's like, what's the actual risk exactly?"}, {"time": 2479, "text": "She'll say, no thanks, I'm not interested."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "No thanks."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "I guess the risk is like, that's going to be mentally difficult to deal with rejection."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "So just like it's mentally difficult to deal with failure."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "If you had a bunch of ideas and you were excited about them and you implement them and you realize they're not good, that could be difficult to keep pushing through that."}, {"time": 2500, "text": "But I suppose that's life."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "You're supposed to, you know, perseverance through the failures and then the risk is low."}, {"time": 2508, "text": "So that's, and then the whole time through the fog up the mountain, you're looking for product market fit."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "So you know, you have it when the usage of your product keeps growing without any marketing dollars or anything like that."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "It's just like more people keep coming back every week or month."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "So you're kind of keep, you're basically watching your stats."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "Nothing is working."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "You see these little wiggles of false hope in your metrics and you basically just keep talking to customers, fixing the, improving the product, talk to customers, improve the product, talk to customers, improve product, you know, and try not to run out of money."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "So be really scrappy."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "And then if you're lucky, you hit some kind of threshold where like, okay, the thing is good enough now, or we hit on some use case and then it'll organically start to grow a bit."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "And then you have a whole different set of problems once you hit product market fit, which is how do we scale this thing?"}, {"time": 2554, "text": "How do we hire people?"}, {"time": 2555, "text": "How do we, you know, hire an executive team or raise more money?"}, {"time": 2559, "text": "And like, so the problems totally change, but yeah."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "Well, you were there through the whole thing."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "So that's the other question that's fascinating."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "Again, back to the girl at the bar, how do you hire people?"}, {"time": 2572, "text": "It's like, how do you find good friends?"}, {"time": 2575, "text": "How do you find good relationships?"}, {"time": 2577, "text": "And in this specific case, how do you hire good people?"}, {"time": 2581, "text": "Engineers, executive, all of it."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "One thing is I've done a lot of reps on hiring at this point."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "So Coinbase has about 5,000 people, probably the first 500 people or something, maybe in that range."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "You know, I interviewed every single one of those, but you have to remember there's probably like, I don't know, on average, maybe 10 people that we went in the process for every one we hired or something."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "So it was like, by the time that we had 500 employees, I had done like 5,000 interviews or something."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "I was like very burned out on interviews."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "I had been doing, some days I did like seven interviews in a day or maybe, you know, you've been doing lots of interviews, maybe you wouldn't get burned out, but different kind of interviews."}, {"time": 2622, "text": "Very different, very different, very different, because you're, so first of all, most of your interviews lead to rejection."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "Which is also exhausting."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "Yeah, and there's a whole part of the interview which is about candidate experience, right?"}, {"time": 2639, "text": "Sometimes you know it's not the right person, but you wanna make sure they have a good experience."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "Like, if you're just exhausted and you're on your sixth interview and you're like, well, thanks for coming in and you wrap and you just, and then like, you're gonna create a detractor."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "Someone who's out there like, fuck that company or Brian was rude to me or whatever."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "So I had to, honestly, I had to work on that a little bit in the early days because I was doing so many interviews."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "Like I needed to make sure that when people came in, I was like, you know, made them feel comfortable, asked them a couple of like warmup questions, just like, oh, how was it getting in the office?"}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Like, did you find it okay?"}, {"time": 2667, "text": "And like, what have you been up to this week?"}, {"time": 2669, "text": "And not just like, you know, like a factory assembly line like boom, boom, boom, like, yeah."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "But also there's a moment, cause I've interviewed a bunch of people for like teams and stuff."}, {"time": 2678, "text": "There's also a moment when you, early on, know it's not gonna be a good fit and you still have to land that plane and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "And that could get really, really, really exhausting."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "So yeah, anyway, sorry."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "Yeah, so basically we tried all, we've tried so many things over the years to make interviews more efficient cause it's a huge time sink for the team."}, {"time": 2698, "text": "So, you know, we basically, we'll usually get them down to like 25 minutes."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "I've seen, if you're trying to hire like a big team, let's say, you know, of people who are like contractors or something, not necessarily full time employees."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "I've seen people actually do 10 minute interviews."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "You can even interview like a thousand people almost like in a week or something."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "I'm not sure if that quite works out, but let me a little less than that."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "But you can basically get six and six done in an hour."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "If you're just, I need to get a team of 30 contractors for whatever purpose."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "But if you're talking about full time employees, I usually do like 25 minute."}, {"time": 2730, "text": "You know, you're oftentimes like, one thing we've done is we'll put like a Google form online and it's like, put some basic hurdles in there."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "Like, you know, ask them to put in an answer, which you can check in a spreadsheet if it was correct or not."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "And like, there was some funny examples in the early days of Coinbase where we'd put in like brain teasers and stuff, but we don't do that anymore."}, {"time": 2750, "text": "We do like normal interviews, we do references."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "The kinds of things I ask in interviews, you know, it's usually like, I like to think about what do we need this person to accomplish in this role, right?"}, {"time": 2763, "text": "And get really specific about that."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "It's like usually something pretty hard."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And then I'll ask them a question."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "It's like, tell me about a time you did X and, or tell me about the hardest, the hardest kind of problem you've had to solve in Y and what did you do specifically to overcome it, right?"}, {"time": 2780, "text": "So I'm asking to see if they can actually do the stuff we need to get done."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "But then I'm also kind of asking like culture questions if I'm interviewing for that."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "And so I'm trying to see like, are they concise communicators?"}, {"time": 2790, "text": "Can they just give me a clear answer and stop talking?"}, {"time": 2794, "text": "Some people like ramble on for like five, 10 minutes if you ask the first question."}, {"time": 2798, "text": "Some people are, you know, they're interrupters like church of interruption."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "So like they won't stop talking until you interrupt them, which for me, I'm always patient and I wait."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "So that's weird."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "I'm looking to see for humility too."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "Like, you know, I'll tell us people, I'll tell you about a time something went really wrong."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "Like you had conflict with someone on a team or what I'm kind of looking for is, were they part of the solution or are they still holding onto like blame and criticism about that and be like, well, I told them they shouldn't do that way, but they didn't listen to me."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "And you know, these are all like bad signs."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "So I'm looking for, yeah, can they get the job done?"}, {"time": 2831, "text": "Will they work together on a team?"}, {"time": 2833, "text": "Can they communicate effectively?"}, {"time": 2835, "text": "Do they fit into our cultural values and you know, those kinds of things."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there's a, cause I've even for help with this podcast here, but also at MIT and so on, I've done a bunch of hiring and I was always looking for, you said, brain teasers, all kinds of simple questions that can, they can reveal a lot of information and it's always been challenging."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "I used to, I still ask this question, but do you think it's better to work hard or work smart?"}, {"time": 2865, "text": "And you know, I had this idea that I've, that I think I've matured about, which is I kind of believe that people who say work smart on that question don't actually work smart."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "So the right textbook answer is it's better to work smart."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "But the reality is it's people that haven't actually ever done anything that say work smart."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "They're like, they haven't really struggled because my general belief at the time was in order to discover what it means to work smart, to be efficient, to, you have to work your ass off."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "So you have to really fail a lot and failure feels like hard work."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "And so I was always suspicious of people that would say work smart."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "I would want to interrogate that question."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "But then I also, you know, have learned that there is people that are just exceptionally, exceptionally efficient."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "They really do know what it means to work smart, even at a young age."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "And so like, you can't just disqualify based on that."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "You have to dig in deeper."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "But some of the most interesting people I've ever worked with would say work hard unapologetically."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "And they're usually the ones that know how to be efficient, which is, it's just an interesting thing like that."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "And I've always searched for questions of that nature to see can I get a person to reveal something profound about them in as brief of a question as possible?"}, {"time": 2966, "text": "And I, you know, and then of course, there's basic attention to detail and brain teasers and stuff like that, depending on the role, programming and so on to see can they solve a tricky puzzle and do so, like one that doesn't require a lot of effort, but requires a certain nonlinear way of thinking."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "Is there some, I mean, maybe you don't want to reveal, but is there some questions that you sometimes find yourself leaning on?"}, {"time": 2995, "text": "You said like, how did you solve a hard problem in your past and have them talk through it?"}, {"time": 3002, "text": "You know, we started with brain teasers periodically at Coinbase and we got away from that relatively quickly."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "So yeah, I'm a little skeptical now of the brain teaser thing."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "There is a whole, yeah, there is a whole question about, like a lot of universities are getting rid of, you know, entrance exams."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "So if you're hiring right out of universities, sometimes it's becoming a less reliable indicator of like, are they in that university?"}, {"time": 3056, "text": "And I've heard some companies, we haven't done this yet, but I've heard some companies are actually creating their own like for college grads, like their own basically exams, like standardized testing almost to get people in the door because the degree almost like doesn't mean what it used to, which is the whole topic, but."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "Yeah, that's fascinating because it's fascinating both for that, because it's not just about you trying to hire a great team, it's also to help them find the right place to work at."}, {"time": 3084, "text": "It's like a two way street."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "All right, so once you found the product market fit, how did Coinbase become what it is today?"}, {"time": 3099, "text": "So let me ask an engineering question actually."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "Sort of from the Ruby wallet days, what are some of the interesting challenges there?"}, {"time": 3110, "text": "Or are they not engineering?"}, {"time": 3112, "text": "Just the things that had to be solved, what were they?"}, {"time": 3116, "text": "Engineering, regulation, financial hiring, lawyers, what was it?"}, {"time": 3127, "text": "So post product market fit, yeah, a lot of it's scaling and you got to build out an actual company."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "So I remember I was still writing a lot of code there for a while and we were hiring in, we had like maybe 25 people or something."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "I remember one of our investors came by one day and he was like, Brian, how much of your time are you spending writing code?"}, {"time": 3144, "text": "And I was like, maybe 50% or something."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "And he was like, how much time are you spending hiring people?"}, {"time": 3149, "text": "I was like, probably 20%."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "And he was like, I think you need to flip those numbers."}, {"time": 3155, "text": "Like this company is not going to scale."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "You're the CEO, you don't need to be writing code every day."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "You're going to have to transition that stuff."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "Like even if people can't, all that stuff's locked in your head."}, {"time": 3163, "text": "So maybe they're not going to do it as well as you for the first six months or something."}, {"time": 3166, "text": "But like, if you don't start to transition it, you're never going to build a real company."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "It's just going to be, you're going to be the bottleneck."}, {"time": 3172, "text": "So, you know, like a lot of founders that took me a while to like really internalize that lesson."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "I'd always heard people say that and, you know, but I still was holding on too much to decision making."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "And I probably still am, by the way, like even to this day at Coinbase, where we continually have to push down decision making in the org, like even with 5,000 people, like who are the owners of each of these things?"}, {"time": 3192, "text": "And so the temptation is people to push it up and you become a bottleneck."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "And anyway, so yeah, you basically need to make sure you have enough money where you don't die if there's some kind of a downturn or hit break even profitability."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "We were in a position where we were periodically profitable during up periods, but then crypto would go down and we were unprofitable."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "And so we had to kind of manage our own psychology and the balance sheet to make sure we didn't like die in the downturn, which a lot of crypto companies did."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "We had to basically professionalize a whole bunch of services that had been just very quickly thrown together by like 20 year olds, right?"}, {"time": 3226, "text": "Whether that was cybersecurity, it's like, okay, how do you get like a really senior experienced cybersecurity person, but not someone who's so senior that they can't get their hands dirty and they can come into a company with 25, 50 people."}, {"time": 3236, "text": "How do you get a finance person to come in and do that?"}, {"time": 3238, "text": "Our finances were a mess."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "Like we didn't even really know how much money we had at certain times and stuff."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "I mean, this was, it's embarrassing to say, but it was true."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "Like I remember there was a point where we had raised, I think like our series C or something like that."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "And I think we had our bank accounts."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "I just put like $25 million, like in a different bank account that none of this stuff was touched to the actual operations of business."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "Cause I was like, our operations were so messy and we needed to hire a new finance person."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "And I was like, I'd heard horror stories of actually startups where they thought they had X amount of money."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And then it turned out they had way less."}, {"time": 3273, "text": "And then the whole thing was insolvent in like three weeks."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "So you wanted to have some padding to at least like, all right, I can at least count on this to save us if we go to like super negative."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "Right, I mean, it was like a cheap hack, but that was like the only I could come up with."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "And until we could hire like a real CFO and finance team who like, okay, now we got our arms around how much cash we have."}, {"time": 3292, "text": "It sounds silly, but we had such high volume of money coming in and out."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "What was the ordering of hiring by the way?"}, {"time": 3299, "text": "Like how many engineers was it early on?"}, {"time": 3303, "text": "You said CFO was not, you didn't even have a CFO for a bit."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "Like what was the landscape of hiring as you building up this company?"}, {"time": 3313, "text": "Was it engineering focused?"}, {"time": 3316, "text": "I mean, so the first person we hired was just like, we need to solve customer support."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "So we brought someone to do that because we were all staying up till midnight every night trying to do customer support."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "And then we got more engineers."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "And then I think maybe the sixth hire or something like that was a recruiter."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "Cause that turned out to be, you need to build, hire the person who can hire more people."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "That turned out to be a great force multiplier."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "And then you're going down the list."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "Eventually you want to hire some more senior people."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "We needed legal and compliance."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "We needed that really badly."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "Cause we, it was all kinds of questions about what the legality of it was."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "Was it hard to find legal people that work with crypto, like serious adults?"}, {"time": 3354, "text": "Cause it's such a cutting edge new world."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there was nobody who had like more than, nobody had three years of experience with it cause it had only been around a few years."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "So yeah, we were finding people from adjacent fields."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "There's a certain personality type of people who are willing to join early companies because they have no structure."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "You can't really commit to them about you're going to have this team or this boss or whatever."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "Like everything's in chaos and flux."}, {"time": 3378, "text": "So it takes, yeah, hiring is one of the hardest things in the early stage for sure."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "You got to find people crazy enough to join you on this journey."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "So one of the interesting things about Coinbase and you've written, we've talked, we'll talk about it a bit."}, {"time": 3391, "text": "You're very focused on the mission."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "You're very kind of, I think that simplifies things that makes hiring easier, that makes working at Coinbase easier, that makes, I mean, it's similar."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "So Elon has the same thing."}, {"time": 3406, "text": "It's pretty clear."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "It's pretty clear what we're here to do."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "So I suppose what's the mission of Coinbase?"}, {"time": 3415, "text": "Well, it's to increase economic freedom in the world."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "And what is economic freedom?"}, {"time": 3419, "text": "Yeah, so economic freedom is this term kind of like GDP that economists use."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "And it's basically a measure of different countries around the world."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "It looks at things like, are there property rights enforced?"}, {"time": 3429, "text": "Is there free trade?"}, {"time": 3430, "text": "Is the currency stable?"}, {"time": 3432, "text": "Can you start companies that you wanna start?"}, {"time": 3434, "text": "And can you join the ones you wanna join?"}, {"time": 3435, "text": "And is there corruption and bribery prevalent or is it relatively free of that?"}, {"time": 3440, "text": "And so there's several different organizations that basically score countries by economic freedom."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "And the really cool thing about economic freedom is that basically it positively correlates with things that we all want in society, like not only higher growth of the economy, but also things like higher self reported happiness of citizens, better treatment of the environment, better income for the poorest 10% of people."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "And it negatively correlates with things we don't want in society, like corruption and bribery and war, even in things like that."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "And so it's this pretty crazy provocative idea, which is that if you give people good property rights and rule of law and allow them to trade, it basically encourages them to do more good stuff and the whole society benefits."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "Like one of the things, you may have noticed this growing up in various places you did, or I spent a year living in Buenos Aires, Argentina that went through hyperinflation."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "And there's a certain like pessimism that can creep into countries when they don't have economic freedom, which it's basically like everyone has this bit of this vibe, which is like, don't stick your head up, don't try too hard because it could all be gone tomorrow."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "Like the things that really are valuable in life are just family and friends and the past was better than the future will be."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "And so you don't really, people don't try as many, they don't try hard because you're not really sure you can actually keep the upside of your labor if you try hard, so you just don't try as hard."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Whereas in America, historically, or high economic freedom countries, people basically like they just try more stuff because they're like, if I do good for other people, I'll get to keep part of it for myself and I can improve my lot in life and for my children and my community, whatever."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "So I realized when I read the Bitcoin white paper a long time ago, that at least I had a hunch."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "At the time I was like, this might be a really powerful piece of technology that can inject good financial infrastructure into all these countries around the world that don't have it."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "Basically good economic freedom principles in like property rights and things like that into these countries all over the world, which just as long as you had a smartphone and now crypto got invented, everybody could have economic freedom."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "And it's crypto is kind of really well suited for economic freedom, because if you want property rights, it's based like crypto is, if you can remember a 12 word phrase or have an app on your phone, you can store as much wealth as you want."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "And it can't be taken away from you."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "You can even, there's like refugees who need to flee and they wanna take their wealth with them and they can't do it often in the traditional financial system."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "And so crypto lets them do that, right?"}, {"time": 3589, "text": "Crypto is inherently global."}, {"time": 3591, "text": "So it allows free trade and cross border payments."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "It makes it easy to accept payments from people globally."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "It provides a stable currency to everyone, not only with Bitcoin, which is kind of like this new reserve currency, but also with stable coins, right?"}, {"time": 3605, "text": "Which are new inventions there."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "So yeah, I basically feel like crypto is this secret hiding in plain sight that can create economic freedom for people all over the world and a more fair and free and global economy."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "Well, so the limit, and by the way, I didn't know about Argentina."}, {"time": 3622, "text": "Why'd you end up in Argentina?"}, {"time": 3625, "text": "Okay, so I was basically, I was living in Houston, Texas after college where I went to school."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "And I had never studied abroad."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "I kind of like, I don't know, I felt like I needed some adventure or something in my life."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "And I was like, I was running this other startup that I was trying at the time, a tutoring company, and I could work from anywhere."}, {"time": 3643, "text": "So my plan was, you know what, I'm just gonna go do like a month in every city around South America, just like almost like to force myself out of my comfort zone because I had never traveled by myself to a foreign country or whatever, and where I didn't really speak the language."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "And anyway, I landed in Buenos Aires thinking I'd go all around South America where I had never been there."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "But I basically, once I was set up in Buenos Aires with an apartment and a cell phone and stuff, then I was like, I don't wanna do that all again next month."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "So I just stayed there for most of the time and took some day trips."}, {"time": 3672, "text": "But yeah, it was kind of a formative experience in that regard."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "You got a chance sort of unexpectedly to experience the social effects of hyperinflation, which is interesting."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "But I also, I've never been, I really, really wanna go as a person who likes tangos, a person who likes the Argentinian national team and soccer and steak."}, {"time": 3694, "text": "All right, and all the other things that Argentina is known for."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "Okay, so economic freedom."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "One of the limits on economic freedom comes from government and government regulations and all those kinds of things throughout the world."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "So how does cryptocurrency help resist that?"}, {"time": 3712, "text": "So can you sort of elaborate a little bit further?"}, {"time": 3715, "text": "What are the things that limit economic freedom and how does crypto help ease that?"}, {"time": 3723, "text": "Today the world, like the traditional financial system is basically every country of the world for the most part has their own currency."}, {"time": 3730, "text": "And so there's a group of people or institutions in each of those countries that's controlling that economic policy or that money supply."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "And it can be manipulated, right?"}, {"time": 3742, "text": "So it's not like many of these currencies are not linked to gold standard."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "The U.S. kind of famously came off that in 1970s, for instance, but if you read Ray Dalio and all this stuff like he talks about, there's thousands of fiat currencies that have been in existence over time."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And basically all of them eventually get disconnected from backing of like hard commodities and then they get overinflated and printed."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "And so in times of stress, with Nixon, I guess it was like in the U.S. it was the Vietnam War or something like that."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "It kind of drove government spending."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "And so under times of stress, they say, hey, it's a temporary measure."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "We need to break the peg."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "Temporary was like famous words that he used and they go print."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "And so the bad thing about that, of course, is that it sort of erodes people's like wealth if they can only hold their assets in cash, which basically like poor people tend to do that."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "If you're wealthy, you can hold stocks or like real estate and things like that."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "But it's really a tax on the poorest people in society, inflation."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "So anyway, crypto in a way is a little bit of like a return to the gold standard in this digital era, right?"}, {"time": 3811, "text": "Bitcoin, there's guaranteed scarcity of it."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "It's deflationary."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "There's never gonna be more than 21 million Bitcoin."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "And so that's a really important principle."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "I also think not just Bitcoin, but like cryptocurrency generally, it's really important in terms of this, you asked about regulation, right?"}, {"time": 3830, "text": "So think about like, if you wanted to make a global borrowing and lending marketplace or a global exchange, you would have to go to all 200 countries in the world, sometimes like maybe 50 states in the US and get lending licenses or an operating exchange or whatever."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "And that's just an incredible amount of work."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "And you can't even do business in many of these countries because like you have to bribe somebody or it's corrupt or whatever."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "And so, but with DeFi, with decentralized finance, people have published like Uniswap as a decentralized exchange."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "Everybody in the world, no matter what country you're in, what jurisdiction can interface with that decentralized exchange and there's no central company operating it."}, {"time": 3875, "text": "It's a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, which is globally decentralized."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "So there's no throat to choke."}, {"time": 3881, "text": "There's no one person or a company you can go to to like, hey, shut this thing down."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "Even if everybody who's working on Uniswap today stopped, the Uniswap smart contract would continue to operate on the Ethereum blockchain."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "Similarly for like a borrowing and lending marketplace, like somebody in India wants to borrow from somebody in the US or whatever, there's very difficult to do that in the traditional financial world, but in a smart contract that's decentralized, you can enable anybody to access it."}, {"time": 3910, "text": "So it's really kind of this great democratizing force that is creating a new financial system that is more fair and more free."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "Yeah, and in some ways it's a clever way that's enabling people to do that in a novel way."}, {"time": 3928, "text": "So is Uniswap in some sense a competitive Coinbase?"}, {"time": 3932, "text": "In which way is it and which way is it not?"}, {"time": 3934, "text": "So because for people who don't know, Coinbase is centralized."}, {"time": 3940, "text": "So let me ask, doesn't that go against the spirit of crypto since crypto is decentralized?"}, {"time": 3949, "text": "What are the pros and cons of being centralized as an exchange?"}, {"time": 3953, "text": "So I don't think Coinbase is fully centralized."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "We have many different products."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "And the way that I think about it is that our exchange or our brokerage is a centralized, regulated financial service business."}, {"time": 3966, "text": "And it's actually important for the crypto ecosystem to have that because you wanna allow a lot of the fiat money in the world to flow into the crypto economy."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "So we're very proud of that."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "And I think we've helped a lot of that money flow in."}, {"time": 3978, "text": "Now, once people have money in crypto, they can choose to hold it in a variety of ways."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "And they can choose to hold it in a self custodial wallet, which is more decentralized."}, {"time": 3986, "text": "They can choose to use decentralized exchanges, which we love and Uniswap is not really, I don't think of them as like a direct competitor to us."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "We basically have integrated Uniswap into a number of our products."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "We love DeFi, decentralized exchanges, the whole thing."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "So Coinbase wallet, which is a self custodial wallet, is more decentralized and it allows people to hold their own crypto."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "They don't have to trust us."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "Can you explain what a self custodial wallet is?"}, {"time": 4015, "text": "What is a wallet and what is a self custodial wallet?"}, {"time": 4018, "text": "Yeah, so it's confusing."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "So a custodial wallet means you're trusting Coinbase to store your crypto, the private keys themselves."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "And for some people and institutions and everything, just meeting them where they are today, that's nice because it's simpler."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "They're not afraid of losing their crypto if they make some accidental mistake."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "Or so custodial crypto products are important to help get a bunch of people into the ecosystem."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "But I'm very supportive of self custodial wallets."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "And I think in some ways they are the future because more and more people are gonna want to store their own crypto, not trust a third party institution to do it."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "And in some ways that is much more authentic to the ethos of crypto."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "So Coinbase will help you convert the fiat into crypto."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "And frankly, that's a more centralized thing."}, {"time": 4066, "text": "But once you have crypto, you can then go to the self custodial world, store it yourself."}, {"time": 4070, "text": "And to get into the technical details just for a second, it's basically saying you're gonna store the keys on your own device."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "And so even if Coinbase gets some court order to seize it, we actually can't."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "From an architecture point of view, we can't do it."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "Or if Coinbase gets hacked or something, we can't lose your funds."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "Now the thing is you have to take the responsibility because we're not taking it."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "So the individual person could get hacked."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "And there's a whole bunch of really cool research happening to make self custodial wallets more resilient to accidental loss, hacks, and just user error."}, {"time": 4108, "text": "I don't know how much you've looked at various cryptography things, but basically, you can have multiple signatures from different keys on different devices where you need two of the three or three of the five."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "There's a whole technology called multi party computation or threshold signing signatures, which is really cool."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "But those are the things you would run locally?"}, {"time": 4129, "text": "These are all security measures, cryptography measures to protect you without a centralized component?"}, {"time": 4137, "text": "So a simple example would be, let's say you had a two of three key signature."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "And one key might be stored at Coinbase, but that's not a quorum."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "So we couldn't unilaterally move your funds."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "But another key is on your device, on your phone, let's say."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "So in a normal situation, you have a key on your phone."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "And so two out of three, it can all get signed very quickly for day to day use."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "But let's say you lose your phone or something."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "Now, there has to be a third key."}, {"time": 4165, "text": "And that's where you could store it in a backup somewhere, like in Google Drive or iCloud."}, {"time": 4171, "text": "You could trust a third party that's not Coinbase to also have that one key."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And they can't do anything unilaterally with that one key."}, {"time": 4179, "text": "So that's a simple example."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "You can get way more complicated."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "Yeah, that's an awesome idea."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "So if your funds get seized, Coinbase can't do anything."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "But you better not lose your phone, maybe, in that case."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "But it provides a, there is, so even if you lose your phone, then there is a recovery mechanism."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "Because you can get the one key from Coinbase, the one from your backup provider, and recover a new one back on your phone."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "I know, yeah."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "But what if Coinbase is no longer, but because of government, because of, say, it's in North Korea, government says you're no longer, like Coinbase is shut down in that country or something like that."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "Then you can get it, even if you have access to those two."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "So again, perhaps a silly question, but isn't a self custodial wallet a competitor as a notion to Coinbase?"}, {"time": 4229, "text": "No, I mean, so we offer a self custodial wallet."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "We've built one, and it's like one."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "But doesn't it bleed the, like I guess I'm asking a sort of a financial question, is like how does Coinbase make money on transactions?"}, {"time": 4243, "text": "So does this not, it does not decrease the number, or does not significantly negatively affect transactions?"}, {"time": 4250, "text": "Or are you more focused on growing the number of the pie of the number of people that are using cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 4256, "text": "Yeah, like a traditional financial service firm would probably say, well, we should be storing, let's keep more of the custody with us, because that's how we prove to the world that we're valuable or whatever."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "Like I think that actually we kind of want to encourage our users to move to self custody over time for those who are ready and willing."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "And that technology needs to mature."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "I'm not trying to like force anybody to do it who doesn't want to do it."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "But to me, that's like the future of how we get billions of people using crypto."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "But doesn't that mean they can go somewhere else easier?"}, {"time": 4287, "text": "Yeah, that's sort of the point is like, we're all using the same protocol."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "So there's low switching costs, which keeps all the companies accountable, right?"}, {"time": 4294, "text": "Like if you want to access the visa network, there's only one company in the world you can go through to do that, like visa."}, {"time": 4301, "text": "But if you want to access the Bitcoin network, there's dozens or hundreds of companies out there who can do that."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "So it's arguably, you could argue it's worse for us as a company, but I think it's better for, it's what makes Bitcoin interesting and cryptocurrency interesting is that nobody controls it."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "There is low switching costs for customers."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "It's better for customers."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "And that means that all the companies in the space are going to be held to a high standard because the minute you lose someone's trust, they're just going to move their Bitcoin to some other service and that's good for the world."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "Do you think of Coinbase as, so there's these ideas of layer one, layer two, layer three technologies."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "Do you think of Coinbase as layer one, layer two, layer three?"}, {"time": 4341, "text": "Now that said, there's so many products that are under the Coinbase umbrella that it's hard to answer that question, but what do you think?"}, {"time": 4351, "text": "Do you acknowledge the existence of layer three?"}, {"time": 4354, "text": "So, you know, usually when people are using those terms, layer one, layer two, so they're referring to like, layer one would be the blockchain, layer one blockchain itself, like a Bitcoin or Ethereum or something, not like a centralized service like Coinbase or even our decentralized self custodial wallet."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "So yeah, I wouldn't consider us to be like a layer one."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "These are the decentralized protocols that we're integrating, but Coinbase itself is not those."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "Yes, but layer two is the thing that was basically doing transactions without the settlement on the blockchain."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "And so you get to have some of the benefits of faster transactions without the security associated with the blockchain."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "And layer three is, I suppose, sort of apps built on top of that."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "So, you know, at least I think talking to Michael Saylor, he considers Coinbase a layer three technology."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "I'm not really particularly familiar with this kind of distinction of layer three and two."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "I don't see them as fundamentally different."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "But some of the, okay, I mean, one way of asking that, is there some layer two like of magic happening in order to make transactions associated with the blockchain happen instant, so that they're quick?"}, {"time": 4435, "text": "So that."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "On Coinbase?"}, {"time": 4437, "text": "On Coinbase, yeah."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "Is there some magic going on?"}, {"time": 4440, "text": "Because you're, okay, we should say, how many cryptocurrencies are currently on Coinbase?"}, {"time": 4444, "text": "So it's more than two."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "It's a lot more than two."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "So you have to understand, they have to incorporate all these technologies."}, {"time": 4453, "text": "So how do you make that magic of sort of universal transactions happen across all of these different cryptocurrencies?"}, {"time": 4463, "text": "There's our centralized products and decentralized products, right?"}, {"time": 4465, "text": "The centralized products, we are storing that crypto for you."}, {"time": 4471, "text": "And so if you're moving from one of your accounts to another account, like an ETH1 account to ETH2 account, or from my ETH Coinbase centralized account to your ETH centralized."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "So we can do that transaction off chain to make it faster."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "And it saves the customer fees and it just confirms instantly."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "But it's not truly using the decentralized blockchain, right?"}, {"time": 4490, "text": "So you can also send any Bitcoin address or Ethereum address, for instance."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "And that is putting the transaction on chain."}, {"time": 4496, "text": "Now our decentralized products like Coinbase wallet, the self custodial wallet, every transaction is happening on chain with that."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "And so basically it just shows a little bit of the evolution of Coinbase and the blockchains themselves."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "Like in the early days, these networks were not scalable."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "And so there were no L2 solutions, for instance."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "And so we had to do sort of these hacks, like moving the crypto off chain, if you were moving between your own accounts and stuff like that."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "Otherwise the minor fees would have just eaten us alive as a company, right?"}, {"time": 4526, "text": "But now the blockchains are starting to scale."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "There's a whole bunch of more work that needs to be done on that."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "And we're getting L2 solutions."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "So I think more and more of the transactions are going on chain, whether it's L2, L1."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "And ideally we shouldn't be doing that many transactions off chain, just internal Coinbase ledger or something."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "That's not really in the spirit of crypto."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "So when you say on chain, that includes layer two technology that the blockchain proposes."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "I guess I was asking how much fun magic is happening off chain within Coinbase."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "And you're saying in the early days you had to, but you're trying to do less and less."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "So look, there's a bunch of high frequency traders that use the centralized products and even just regular retail people, they don't want to pay the gas fees and stuff."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "And they're trying to, it actually, we back at the envelope, calculated this out at one point and just like, it would be completely infeasible for like high frequency traders to put everything on chain at this point."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "That's basically what DEXs are doing."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "And so both are important."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "I think more and more is going to move decentralized over time, which is great."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "And we're, and we're basically."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "DEXs are decentralized exchanges by the way."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "So anyway, we want to encourage more and more of it to move decentralized over time, but I don't, the centralized things aren't going away for like a long time."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "It's a decade from now, there's going to be some big institution or pension fund or central bank."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "That's like, all right, we got to hold crypto."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "Let's set up the account in a centralized way."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "So that's, that's fine."}, {"time": 4622, "text": "Both, both are important."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "Do you know the number of cryptocurrencies currently on Coinbase?"}, {"time": 4627, "text": "Do you know that number?"}, {"time": 4628, "text": "It's over a hundred, but it depends."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "It depends what jurisdiction you're in."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "And, you know, are you in institution versus retail?"}, {"time": 4636, "text": "There's like, there's so many different categories now."}, {"time": 4639, "text": "But over a hundred."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "So what does it take to become, to, to, to become an asset, to become a cryptocurrency on Coinbase, to add your technology to Coinbase?"}, {"time": 4653, "text": "Well, so we're trying to get away from this idea of being listed on Coinbase as being seen as like an endorsement or something, because I actually think it's very important that we are not considered judge and jury about, you know, like imagine it was the early days of the internet and you were like, what's a good webpage and what's a bad webpage."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "Like you would have been totally wrong or anytime big tech companies try to make these review, review boards of like, you know, Apple famously gets in trouble for this a lot with their app store review process."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "And so something that you think like a committee of people somewhere thinks looks silly may turn out to be the next big thing."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "We basically have a test of legality, right?"}, {"time": 4695, "text": "We check, you know, do we believe this is a security?"}, {"time": 4699, "text": "If so, it can't be listed on Coinbase and there's a very rigorous process we go through for that."}, {"time": 4705, "text": "Just currently the way the laws are in the US, you can't do that."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "And we've been, we acquired a broker duo license from the SEC."}, {"time": 4711, "text": "We're trying to work with them to get that operational and hopefully someday we can trade real crypto securities."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "But today that's not possible in the US at least."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "Then we look at sort of the cybersecurity of the crypto asset."}, {"time": 4722, "text": "Does it, do we see that there's some flaw in the smart contract or, you know, a way that somebody could manipulate it without the customer's permission?"}, {"time": 4732, "text": "We look at some compliance pieces to it as well, like the actors behind it and like, you know, there any kind of criminal history, anything like that."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "But if we believe it meets our listing standards, basically this test of legality and everything for customer protection, then we want to list it because we want the market to at that point decide."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "And it's kind of like Amazon or something like that where, you know, a product might have three stars or it might have five stars, but if it starts to get one star consistently, like it's probably a fraudulent or it's defective or something like maybe Amazon will remove it."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "But otherwise you want to let the market decide what these things are."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "So that's generally how we do it."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "And by the way, more and more of these assets, I think especially like low market cap assets are going to be traded on DEXs through Coinbase."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "It's not that we, we don't need to list every asset on a centralized exchange."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "I think DEXs are really good for the long tail."}, {"time": 4787, "text": "And then it becomes an even, it's even more clear to people, like this is not some endorsement by a Coinbase of like, this asset's good and this one's bad."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "Like, you know, my belief is there's going to be millions of these assets over time."}, {"time": 4799, "text": "And so I hope it doesn't like make news every time we add one in the future, basically."}, {"time": 4803, "text": "Yeah, I wonder how you get there because I, even I look to Coinbase for, for example, you know, people, as you can imagine, sort of tag me on Twitter or something like that and all that, like you should interview our sort of this, the founder of this particular coin, right?"}, {"time": 4823, "text": "And I, it's so hard for me to know what's, first of all, what's interesting technology?"}, {"time": 4830, "text": "What's, who's a scammer or not?"}, {"time": 4834, "text": "Who's actually legitimately representing an ambitious new thing versus a scam?"}, {"time": 4843, "text": "And I, you know, there's very few sources of like a verification signal."}, {"time": 4850, "text": "And unfortunately Coinbase in part has become a little bit of that too."}, {"time": 4855, "text": "And you're trying to get away from that because you're trying to get as many, sort of let the people decide."}, {"time": 4860, "text": "So you're thinking of like Amazon star type system where the people could rate."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "Yeah, so I think we'll actually probably add like user ratings and reviews."}, {"time": 4869, "text": "So, and we'll be very cautious about like, you know, these are real people."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "There's a bunch of stuff we have to do for that already."}, {"time": 4877, "text": "So I think wisdom of the crowds is good in terms of getting feedback on items, but we also, we're gonna do our own review, which I mentioned earlier, right?"}, {"time": 4885, "text": "Which is like, okay, it meets this minimum bar to be listed on our site."}, {"time": 4890, "text": "I think, yeah, both are important."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "How do you know if a coin is a scam or not?"}, {"time": 4896, "text": "Well, you can see a few things."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "So, you know, I hate to use the word scam because a lot of these are judgment calls."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "You gotta, I kind of, a court may or a jury may land either way, but things that would be red flags to look at would be, you know, is a bunch of the asset owned by an insider or insiders with short vesting periods."}, {"time": 4916, "text": "You know, does the background of the founders, like they may have criminal records or if they've perpetrated other frauds in the past, right?"}, {"time": 4928, "text": "There's a difference between something which is just a me too product."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "It's like, it doesn't have anything interesting about it and something that's an actual fraud or outright scam."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "And you have to, a lot of this data, what's cool about it is that it's now available on chain."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "You can look at like the tokenomics behind it and see who owns it."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "And are they selling it, you know, in like inappropriately or are they pumping it on like YouTube and Twitter and making promises about, hey, the value of this thing may be a higher in the future."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "And like, all those are just big, big no, no's that we would, you know, we just don't wanna go there."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "So our whole thing is like, we want to enable innovation in this space, but not allow anybody to curtail the advancement of this industry by like doing some kind of fraudulent thing or get rich quick thing."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "It's a tricky industry because I'm trying to figure out who to, you know, what's interesting to understand, to research."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "And it's hard to know."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "Let me ask you about a tricky one to add to a centralized exchange, which is privacy preserving cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 4996, "text": "So like Monero."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "Is that technically difficult or is that why, why is like Monero, for example, forget that specific one, but like privacy preserving cryptocurrency blockchains, why is that, is that ever possible to add?"}, {"time": 5015, "text": "So the answer is maybe."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "So here's the reason why."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "So because we're a regulated financial service business, we have various licenses to do that."}, {"time": 5026, "text": "We are regulated by various regulators."}, {"time": 5028, "text": "Part of those licenses requires us to have a quote, reasonable program to monitor for suspicious activity, you know, an AML program, anti money laundering, right?"}, {"time": 5039, "text": "And so if it, if a coin is a hundred percent anonymous and we can't really do blockchain analytics to track source of funds and where these things might be going, it makes it harder to have a reasonable program around that that's defensible."}, {"time": 5056, "text": "Now there are privacy preserving coins like Zcash, which have something called a view key."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "And a view key is basically another key which allows you to deanonymize the transactions in specific situations where you want that."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "So for instance, you know, we do support Zcash."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "And one of the ways we got comfortable with that is that when you're buying it on Coinbase, you know, you can basically have a view key."}, {"time": 5078, "text": "The transactions are not anonymous while you're buying it."}, {"time": 5081, "text": "And we can see where it goes afterwards and do our whole standard program."}, {"time": 5085, "text": "Now, if it gets a few hops away down the road, I mean, people could eventually turn on privacy preserving aspects."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "So, you know, these are tough judgment calls, but at least in terms of our interaction with the customer and everything, we feel comfortable at that."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "I think there's a broader point here, which is that I actually think privacy coins are a good thing for the world and they should be allowed."}, {"time": 5132, "text": "And now the whole internet has basically moved to HTTPS with a little lock icon in your browser, which is better."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "Like, and financial information is like the most important information to keep private, right?"}, {"time": 5142, "text": "So there's times where like, let's say you're running a charity or something and you want to have total auditability, transparency for the whole world, who donated and where did the money go?"}, {"time": 5151, "text": "That's great, you want it to be public."}, {"time": 5153, "text": "But if it's like your personal money or something like that, you don't want to be broadcasting that to the whole world."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "And in some ways that's what blockchains are doing, you know, pseudonymously, because like, but it is a public ledger."}, {"time": 5163, "text": "And so if you can know who owns each address, you can basically deanonymize it."}, {"time": 5167, "text": "I, you know, I think basically people should fight for privacy and freedoms of all kinds, but privacy of money is a good thing."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "So I would like to see more of that in the future."}, {"time": 5177, "text": "You chosen with Coinbase to have a seat at the table with the regulators."}, {"time": 5185, "text": "So what kind of conversations are there at that table?"}, {"time": 5191, "text": "What are the regulations like?"}, {"time": 5193, "text": "What is the level of understanding with regulators?"}, {"time": 5196, "text": "What are they worried about?"}, {"time": 5198, "text": "What are they thinking about?"}, {"time": 5199, "text": "What are the positive and what are the negative regulations that you're facing?"}, {"time": 5204, "text": "That you're educating, struggling with, pushing back on, supporting, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "Oh man, there's so many."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "Cause we're, I mean, we're live in like, you know, maybe a hundred countries or more at this point."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "So the conversations are all over the map."}, {"time": 5219, "text": "I'm trying to think what broad strokes I could paint for you."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "So I'd say one trend that's positive is that basically regulators around the world are more and more, over the last five years, I would say, it's more and more common to find a regulator today asking, how can we preserve the innovation potential of this technology while keeping the bad actors out than it was five years ago, where they were saying, this is all bad activity."}, {"time": 5244, "text": "How do we prevent it?"}, {"time": 5245, "text": "And so maybe this is."}, {"time": 5248, "text": "When you say more and more, what fraction?"}, {"time": 5254, "text": "I'll give you like a US specific example, although we operate in many countries."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "So when I go to DC now, I would say, you know, 50, 60% of the people who I meet with are basically, you know, they're in the camp of crypto, has a lot of potential."}, {"time": 5270, "text": "We should regulate it to make sure the bad people don't do something bad with it."}, {"time": 5273, "text": "But this is here to stay and it has a lot of upside."}, {"time": 5276, "text": "We should basically create the awful regulation and celebrate it and actually encourage this innovation to happen in the US."}, {"time": 5283, "text": "That's a huge change from just three years ago where it was probably 30% of people saying that."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "Now it's like 60, it's like almost double."}, {"time": 5290, "text": "It's getting harder to find like true crypto skeptics in DC."}, {"time": 5295, "text": "I'd say that, you know, maybe only like 20 or 30% of people are like willing to say something negative."}, {"time": 5301, "text": "Like they actually think it's net negative."}, {"time": 5303, "text": "It's like, it's really hard to defend that position at this point, because almost like one in five Americans have used or tried crypto at this point."}, {"time": 5310, "text": "So you're kind of condemning 20% of your fellow citizens if you say that at this point, you know, especially with NFTs and all these things, like a huge segment of people who don't even care about investing or whatever came into the space."}, {"time": 5321, "text": "So, and then basically that's that same conversation is happening, but, you know, delayed by a few years in like India and Europe and in some Asian countries."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "And some countries have really embraced crypto and they're like trying to really, they're ahead of where the US is because they're trying to actually attract the best startups and entrepreneurs like, you know, like Dubai and UK and Australia and all are kind of pushing good regulation, El Salvador actually, I guess, adopted it as like Bitcoin as a legal tender."}, {"time": 5353, "text": "There was another country, Central African Republic, I think that is supposedly did that as well."}, {"time": 5358, "text": "But, you know, there's countries like China that are more autocratic that are saying, hey, this is a threat to our power and like, we're gonna try to really curtail it."}, {"time": 5366, "text": "So what kind of regulations are there that you feel the most that are limiting or that are empowering?"}, {"time": 5373, "text": "Like, is there specific examples?"}, {"time": 5376, "text": "So, I mean, basically I think the securities laws in the US need to be clarified about what, crypto is many different things."}, {"time": 5386, "text": "So like some crypto, like Bitcoin, Ethereum and many others are probably more like commodities."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "They're not controlled by any one person, you know, like anyway, there's people who wanna raise money for a company that's sounds more like a security that should be regulated by the SEC."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "Commodities are regulated by the CFTC."}, {"time": 5404, "text": "Then there's some cryptocurrencies which are more like currencies, like stable coins and central bank digital currencies."}, {"time": 5410, "text": "And those are probably, you know, should be regulated by the treasury or someone like that."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "And then there's a whole another category of cryptocurrencies, which are none of those things."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "They're NFTs like artwork or they're metaverse items or decentralized identity and voting."}, {"time": 5423, "text": "And so I think that there's a very unhelpful point of view out there by some folks, which is, hey, this is all, most of this is like bad activity."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "We need to shut it down."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "So we're just gonna pursue enforcement actions or something like that."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "Most people in DC don't feel that way anymore."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "And I think the people of the US don't feel that way anymore because a lot of them are using this stuff."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "And their general view is, there's a lot of upside potential here."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "We can all agree, let's get rid of the fraud and the scams."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "We all wanna get rid of that."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "So let's create a relatively simple test, which says, if it's like nobody controls more than 20% of it or some threshold, it probably is more like a commodity."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "If someone's raising money for, they're selling this thing for a business, then it's probably a security."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "And then if it's more like a medium of exchange, it's a currency."}, {"time": 5475, "text": "And if it's none of those things, maybe it's artwork or whatever, a legal test like that would help clarify who, which regulator is regulating what."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "And then we also wanna have probably like a sandbox for innovation where if you're a startup and you're doing less than, I don't know, some number, less than some amount of payment volume or customer funds you're storing, it's like just let those things get off the ground without a soul crushing amount of legal bills and uncertainty."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "So if the US can get there, that would be great."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "I think a bunch of other countries now are rushing around the world to sort of create that regulation that does attract innovation."}, {"time": 5512, "text": "And so in the international bodies like IMF and G20 and stuff, they're starting to look at proposed regulation."}, {"time": 5520, "text": "I hope that Coinbase and a bunch of other crypto companies can help in that conversation too."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "We have a whole policy effort."}, {"time": 5524, "text": "I think actually crypto policy efforts are like probably one of the biggest things in DC right now."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "So it moves slow at the speed of government, but yeah, and in the meantime, we're just trying to help more and more people use crypto because ultimately that's what, in the democracies, that's what they care about."}, {"time": 5542, "text": "Like they'll do what the people of the country want."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "So you want governments to start understanding differences between, in the crypto space, commodities, securities, currencies, NFTs."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "I still don't understand."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "What are they supposed to make sense of NFTs?"}, {"time": 5557, "text": "What is NFTs exactly from a perspective of a regulator?"}, {"time": 5562, "text": "Is it the other categories?"}, {"time": 5564, "text": "Yeah, most NFTs you could think of as like artwork, although it's, who knows where it's gonna go."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "You mentioned Metaverse, right?"}, {"time": 5570, "text": "You mentioned some kind of unique identity of a thing."}, {"time": 5574, "text": "Yeah, like there's people selling virtual land in NFTs."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "I actually, I bought this NFT that's like, it's like citizenship in this like city, Dow in Wyoming."}, {"time": 5585, "text": "Like I've never been there, but it's almost like a badge or an attestation like to get access to this location."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "There's like people doing like tickets to events."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "Like, you know, they're called a POAPs."}, {"time": 5599, "text": "Like proof of attendance and things like that."}, {"time": 5603, "text": "So it'll be very interesting to see where NFTs go over time."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "It could get, and that's the danger."}, {"time": 5609, "text": "You don't wanna try to like define the regulation if you don't even know where this thing's gonna go, so."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "And so your efforts in the policy arm is education?"}, {"time": 5617, "text": "Yeah, education, advocacy."}, {"time": 5619, "text": "We're just trying to be like a helpful educational resource essentially, and then if they give us feedback and they're like, hey, don't do this or don't, or do this, like we're more than happy to do anything that's requested."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "We generally go get licenses and we've just tried to do the right thing in the absence of clarity, because if it's not clear what the law says, then you should just basically do good things that you think may be required in the future to show good faith effort towards the right thing."}, {"time": 5645, "text": "And that's part of like innovating in a regulated field, which is, you know, a whole topic in itself."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "So if you are at the table, let me, this is less the case in the United States, but can government agencies seize a person's cryptocurrency by forcing Coinbase to hand it over?"}, {"time": 5664, "text": "So when you're centralized, they have a phone number to call."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "Okay, so this is a complicated topic."}, {"time": 5671, "text": "Like if you really wanna be sure that, this is why people wanna store their own crypto, right?"}, {"time": 5676, "text": "Like with self custodial wallets, like with Coinbase wallet embracing decentralization, they wanna avoid that."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "Now in the US, there is rule of law, right?"}, {"time": 5684, "text": "So we have reasonable protections in place around like search and seizure and things like that."}, {"time": 5691, "text": "You know, Coinbase does, we publish transparency reports on this."}, {"time": 5694, "text": "We get subpoenas, court orders, things like that from various countries around the world."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "And there are situations where we have been ordered to freeze accounts, things like that."}, {"time": 5708, "text": "You know, we have to follow the law, is another way to put it."}, {"time": 5711, "text": "We're a regulated financial service business and so."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "If the money is used as part of breaking the law, that's what that, in a particular jurisdiction, in a particular."}, {"time": 5722, "text": "Right, and then the other thing, sometimes we will actually get court orders or subpoenas that are overly broad."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "We've seen, so they need to follow due process, right?"}, {"time": 5730, "text": "And so we've seen some in the past that were like, well, we need you to freeze this huge number of accounts."}, {"time": 5736, "text": "And it's like, well, we'll actually have gone to court and like pushed back on some of these and said like, what is your probable cause?"}, {"time": 5742, "text": "And has the threshold been met?"}, {"time": 5744, "text": "And like, we've won some of those cases on behalf of our customers."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "So yeah, it's actually really, it's kind of unfortunate and frustrating."}, {"time": 5751, "text": "As a large business, you spend a lot of resources basically interacting with inbound requests by all kinds of lawyers and people and requesting things."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "And some of them are silly and ridiculous and you have to push back and say no."}, {"time": 5767, "text": "And so it's kind of a tax on every company at a certain size which ultimately gets passed on to the customer in higher fees."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "So you have to employ armies of lawyers to deal with this stuff."}, {"time": 5778, "text": "Can you educate me on something?"}, {"time": 5779, "text": "How much innovation is there in the legal space?"}, {"time": 5783, "text": "So for lawyers working with Coinbase because it's such a new cutting edge thing."}, {"time": 5790, "text": "So you're, there's a lot of gray area you're supposed to be operating under."}, {"time": 5796, "text": "Like how hard is it being a lawyer at Coinbase?"}, {"time": 5801, "text": "Like how much precedence is there?"}, {"time": 5803, "text": "I guess is what I'm asking."}, {"time": 5804, "text": "I mean, just like you said, three years."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "It's kind of a new space."}, {"time": 5809, "text": "Yeah, well, it's probably very hard to be a lawyer at Coinbase and very fun because whenever you're in a new field that's growing fast, there isn't a lot of case law and just precedent set."}, {"time": 5822, "text": "So that's also an opportunity for you to go create that stuff."}, {"time": 5825, "text": "And that's what a lot of legal careers are made out of is like take a complex situation where you have to balance difficult things."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "Like how do we prevent bad activity but still enable an innovation?"}, {"time":

business in an environment where the law is just unclear, right?"}, {"time": 5847, "text": "It's like try to do the right thing, but like strike the right balance."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "So yeah, a lot of our lawyers have to come up with that."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "Very creative stuff."}, {"time": 5857, "text": "You mentioned one of the things you're focused on is expanding the number of people, maybe a billion people on Coinbase or using cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 5866, "text": "Where are we at now?"}, {"time": 5867, "text": "How do we get to a billion?"}, {"time": 5869, "text": "As of Q4 last year, we had 89 million verified accounts on Coinbase, but in any given quarter, only maybe like 10 or a little more million of those are like really active."}, {"time": 5882, "text": "So, and then if you look at globally, I think some of the estimates I've seen is maybe there's like 200 million people or something like that who have ever used or tried crypto."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "So we're a long, you know, we're ways from a billion, but it's not like that far off."}, {"time": 5899, "text": "How do you get to a billion?"}, {"time": 5902, "text": "One is the blockchains have got to become way more scalable."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "It's kind of like we're all running dial up modems and we need broadband."}, {"time": 5909, "text": "And so it's just like too expensive, too slow to do all these transactions."}, {"time": 5913, "text": "And I think if we just get L2s working and scalability, you know, we'll see another order of magnitude kind of come out just from that."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "I think the second one would be more clear regulation."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "That would help a lot."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "I do talk to, you know, pension funds and you know, various asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and stuff."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "And a lot of them tell me, we've got 1% of our portfolio in crypto today, but we really would rather have like 20% in there."}, {"time": 5942, "text": "But what we're waiting for is more clear regulation coming out and saying that clear test that I was saying, these assets are commodities regulated by SCPC, these are by SCC, these are by treasury, whatever."}, {"time": 5953, "text": "So that would be a big unlock."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "Do transactions."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "So one of the things that you mentioned, payments, sorry."}, {"time": 5961, "text": "Well, does that unlock a lot of users?"}, {"time": 5966, "text": "I mean, remittance is like a huge thing."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "People sending money home to their families in other countries where the fees are super high."}, {"time": 5972, "text": "So yeah, if we get blockchains to be more scalable and there's more global adoption, like I think we'll see remittance quarters move over to crypto a lot."}, {"time": 5982, "text": "There's also just, the other thing that's driving a lot of crypto adoption is basically the creation of more and more third party apps."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "So, or dApps they're sometimes called decentralized dApps."}, {"time": 5992, "text": "So a lot of startups now, you know, how like you used to use in the early 2000s, they called them.com startups, but now you don't need to say.com cause everybody's using the internet."}, {"time": 6001, "text":

like governments and stuff that they're not, this is not really on their radar today."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "But I think there's basically a group of younger people in that kind of 25, 35 year old

like, especially if China does continue to rise and it has a more authoritarian view, it'll be kind of this very centralized East versus a decentralized West where people are in the West, in the free world, really kind of embracing crypto and a more open, fair, free global financial system, which I think will be enormously beneficial for humanity."}, {"time": 6211, "text": "And I do think basically Bitcoin is the reserve currency, the gold standard of the crypto economy."}, {"time": 6217, "text": "So that's pretty crazy."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "Yeah, the gold standard."}, {"time":

not the case, because if for any innovation we have to wait, sorry to say, for the older folk to pass away, that's not an efficient way to make change."}, {"time": 6294, "text": "Yeah, that's a super

companies take on these issues publicly from a CEO position or anywhere else, that it does seem to optimize for virtue signaling versus solving a particular problem."}, {"time": 6613, "text": "Because to solve a particular problem, you really have to really put in a huge, you have to hire a huge number of, you basically have to create a company with a company to take on a particular thing."},

best, what would make the company look the best in this particular aspect."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "And it just seems very shallow."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "And it's optimizing for the wrong thing, not for the solving of the problems, but for the making yourself look like the good guy and trying to then leverage that to say, I'm the good guy in all situations."}, {"time": 6667, "text": "And it just, it's the wrong thing."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "And perhaps from your perspective as a CEO, as a leader, it's also creating division, unnecessary division within people."}, {"time": 6679, "text": "Like they get, yeah, there's something about us who gets extremely argumentative about certain topics."}, {"time": 6685, "text": "They really bring out the emotion."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "And I think that probably, as you were saying, that emotion is even probably okay, maybe productive when that emotion has to do with the mission of the company."}, {"time": 6697, "text": "Like you really care about those disagreements versus like something that has nothing to do with increasing economic freedom using crypto."}, {"time": 6712, "text": "But it was so refreshing because it's rare."}, {"time": 6715, "text": "Why do you think that's a rare?"}, {"time": 6717, "text": "So the city you're mentioning, I mean, there's a bunch of cities, but San Francisco is one such city when that culture."}, {"time": 6727, "text": "And it's sad because San Francisco is also, the Bay Area is also the hub historically of some of the greatest innovation in human history."}, {"time": 6740, "text": "So there's that tension."}, {"time": 6742, "text": "How did that culture emerge there?"}, {"time": 6744, "text": "Where like the innovation was done by people that are very mission driven."}, {"time": 6749, "text": "You get a bunch of smart people together to solve a difficult problem."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "They get maybe sometimes too much blinders on, but they try to balance that."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "Because it requires that focus to solve an actual problem."}, {"time": 6761, "text": "And yet that's also the place where this culture emerged."}, {"time":

there."}, {"time": 6776, "text": "Anyway, why do you think that's so rare?"}, {"time": 6779, "text": "Well, because people don't wanna get attacked."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "It's like super, you don't wanna get canceled, right?"}, {"time": 6784, "text": "It's super uncomfortable."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "Nobody wants to be called a racist or whatever people wanna say on Twitter."}, {"time":

like went and started writing hit pieces on the company shortly thereafter."}, {"time": 6849, "text": "And they basically just call people who've left the company and can get quotes on whatever they want and then they'll write a story."}, {"time": 6856, "text": "So mainstream media, I lost a lot of trust in mainstream media, frankly, after that."}, {"time": 6860, "text": "And of course, it's kind of become obvious since then that most mainstream media is like hyper politicized at this point."}, {"time": 6866, "text": "It's basically either super left or super right."}, {"time": 6868, "text":

help that statement, the 95 people that remained, is this still something you struggle with?"}, {"time": 6892, "text": "Because it's also a culture of the broader tech space."}, {"time": 6896, "text": "Okay, so that was an interesting thing, which was that, so the 95% of people stayed."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "I got a huge outpouring of support from people who said, thank God you finally spoke up

of the company that basically doesn't agree or just wants to get their work done without all this drama or distraction."}, {"time": 6952, "text": "And they're afraid to speak up because if they speak up, they're afraid of being, again, called a racist, like fired, ostracized amongst their peers."}, {"time": 6961, "text": "And so it did require it to get to a bad enough place for me to finally say, you know what?"}, {"time": 6967, "text": "I just, I feel like I have to do this."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "Live through the short term attacks of the press, which ultimately was very freeing for me

cool was a lot of really great people reached out to the Coinbase too after that."}, {"time": 6985, "text": "And were like, I'm an early engineer at Google or wherever."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "And this culture has gotten kind of messed up and I want to work at a company that's willing to stand for that."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "And so we've gotten a lot of good people come over."}, {"time":

more."}, {"time": 7073, "text": "And hopefully we can get from 89 million verified users to a billion or whatever."}, {"time": 7078, "text": "And then I just think that's how we'll have the biggest

{"time": 7099, "text": "The way for Coinbase to add value to the world is to maximize the mission that it's on, not other stuff."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "And when you get wealthier and more successful, it becomes more and more tempting to just help out in some other shallow ways."}, {"time": 7116, "text": "And you just kind of brought that to light."}, {"time": 7117, "text": "So it was very refreshing."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "And it shouldn't be controversial to sort of focus on just getting stuff done."}, {"time": 7123, "text": "Well, let me ask you, I mean, do you think that this, it's all these things tie together."}, {"time": 7127, "text": "There's like a general trend of like more censorship."}, {"time": 7130, "text": "There's like more cancel culture."}, {"time": 7132, "text": "There's some of these like freedom values are kind of, even like freezing people's accounts, like the trucker thing that happened."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "And this seems like there's a general trend of more authoritarian policies there."}, {"time": 7150, "text": "But do you feel like the tide is turning on that?"}, {"time": 7153, "text": "Like there's counter examples to it we've seen recently."}, {"time": 7157, "text": "I think it's the last gasp of old way of doing things."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "And so there's desperation and so on."}, {"time": 7162, "text": "Because to be fair, it's kind of the internet, which is where's the source of a lot of this, where people have a voice, is making the power centers of the world really nervous."}, {"time": 7174, "text": "And so that's where that's coming from, I think."}, {"time": 7176, "text": "And the internet is tricky."}, {"time": 7179, "text": "It's full of bots."}, {"time": 7181, "text": "It's full of like misinformation of all kinds, full of large groups with conspiracy theories and so on."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "And I mean misinformation broadly."}, {"time": 7191, "text": "People are misusing the word misinformation."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "They're just, governments are just labeling random things with misinformation just to censor them."}, {"time": 7199, "text": "But I just think it's just like a new world where the internet is really finally taking hold, where there's billions of devices and everybody has a voice."}, {"time": 7209, "text": "It's almost, basically governments and powerful people are slightly losing hold of power."}, {"time": 7218, "text": "And they're starting to freak out a little bit."}, {"time": 7221, "text": "And once you have young people that are coming up now, gain power, I think we'll rebalance everything."}, {"time": 7228, "text": "And then there's, like you said, promising signs that it's obvious that the majority of people want freedom."}, {"time": 7238, "text": "And that means a lot of things."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "That means economic freedom."}, {"time": 7240, "text": "That means freedom to have a voice, freedom to move around, freedom to act in the way they, without reasonable sort of limitations by people that don't have their best interests."}, {"time": 7255, "text": "And I gain more hope from just regular people that are fighting and like demanding being able to have freedom of speech, or more specifically sort of resisting crude overreach of government in the acts of censorship, at least in the United States."}, {"time": 7279, "text": "And hopefully that percolates out to the rest of the world that's struggling on a much more basic level where people are being put in prison for the words they say, not just banned from Twitter."}, {"time": 7290, "text": "Right, it could be worse."}, {"time": 7291, "text": "What are some lessons from your failures and your successes about what it takes to run a company?"}, {"time": 7300, "text": "I think one of the things that I learned about leadership is that I never really thought of myself as a very natural leader, to be honest."}, {"time": 7308, "text": "I don't think I was a natural leader."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "But so I always envisioned good leaders as like these military generals, like they seem so confident and they're just like bark orders, charge that hill and do this."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "And I was actually like more introverted and kind of, I wasn't really confident in the way I communicated."}, {"time": 7329, "text":

a product, technical focus CEO."}, {"time": 7338, "text": "And I preferred to sort of hear everyone's opinion."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "And it wasn't just gonna like render a decision in the room in

tomorrow or whatever."}, {"time": 7352, "text": "And so I found ways to kind of make it work for me where I could basically, I always tried to avoid like, when people getting like super emotional about something and like, I think they're thinking, their judgment goes down, right?"}, {"time": 7366, "text": "And just like never make a decision when you're angry, right?"}, {"time": 7368, "text": "And so I would always sort of try to get a sense of, are these people like trying to be right or are they trying to seek the truth?"}, {"time": 7374, "text": "And you can do these little tricks like, okay, you argue that person's position and you argue the other one and like see if you can genuinely represent it."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "Now I know you're listening and these kinds of things."}, {"time": 7386, "text": "But I guess, sorry, getting back to your question about leadership, I think I basically just kept doing things that were a little outside my comfort zone."}, {"time": 7395, "text": "And then my comfort zone kept getting bigger and bigger."}, {"time": 7398, "text": "And so I think that's how you build confidence is you do the thing that's scary and it's like a little outside."}, {"time": 7406, "text": "And like when I first started Coinbase, I had never managed anybody."}, {"time": 7410, "text": "I would have been scared to death to have put out like a very controversial opinion like that and sort of, all right, 5% of people will go, we didn't know what percent it was gonna be by the way."}, {"time": 7419, "text": "It could have been 1%, it could have been 50%."}, {"time": 7421, "text": "Like, but we went into it scary because it was a scary thing."}, {"time": 7425, "text": "I was like, I don't know, I think this is right."}, {"time": 7427, "text": "I'm just gonna do it."}, {"time": 7429, "text": "So if you do enough scary things, like you'll build the confidence."}, {"time": 7432, "text": "And I feel like I'm still on that journey."}, {"time": 7434, "text": "Every year or two at Coinbase, there's some big thing that comes out as like, oh my God, like I didn't sleep well for a week and like, this is the next level, right?"}, {"time": 7443, "text": "But that's how you learn and grow."}, {"time": 7445, "text": "So you're still going up that mountain through the fog one step at a time."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "Can I just quickly ask you about a couple of other efforts that are super interesting that you're involved with?"}, {"time": 7455, "text": "So first of all, a little bit more old school, fascinating effort of research hub."}, {"time": 7462, "text": "So what's that about the GitHub for open science?"}, {"time": 7466, "text": "Yeah, okay, so basically I've had a chance to try to help a couple other companies get off the ground too, cause I wanna see various efforts out there succeed."}, {"time": 7474, "text": "And one of them I've always thought about like why is scientific research not more like open source software or why couldn't it be much faster, right?"}, {"time": 7482, "text": "And there's, you've probably have seen this like in an academic setting, right?"}, {"time": 7512, "text": "So, and the preprint servers like bioarchive and archive.org have really helped this but those websites are, they look like they're kind of from like 15 years ago or something."}, {"time": 7520, "text": "Yeah, it's like Craigslist or something."}, {"time": 7521, "text": "Yeah, so anyway, one of the things I, once Coinbase went public last year, I had a little bit of liquidity and I was like, all right, let me fund a small team and let's see if we can, if they can like go off and make something better here."}, {"time": 7532, "text": "So we have a prototype out there, it's at researchhub.com, people can check it out."}, {"time": 7537, "text": "And it's basically, you know, the first version is kind of like Reddit for science."}, {"time": 7541, "text": "There's like various hubs, which are like journals, but you know, you can publish papers there, you can use an electronic lab notebook to sort of have a modern day paper, which is not just a PDF that's static, but it's a living document."}, {"time": 7553, "text": "Ideally in the future, you know, you can get comments and feedback from people in there, you can update it over time."}, {"time": 7557, "text": "We want people to be able to share the code and the data sets associated with their paper, research paper is not just a PDF."}, {"time": 7565, "text": "And in the future, we want to make it even where like, you know, people can get funding for science through that site and even license out innovations that they've made."}, {"time": 7574, "text": "Because the other thing I've noticed in life is that there's kind of like, there's a bunch of people working on science and there's a bunch of people building companies and they very rarely intersect, but when they do, you get the best things like SpaceX and Genentech and even Google and like even Coinbase was based on a research paper, the Bitcoin white paper."}, {"time": 7592, "text": "And so most business people are like creating companies that don't have any scientific innovation, they're just like marketing based on, you know, whatever."}, {"time": 7600, "text": "And then a lot of scientists are making things which never actually benefit humanity because they're not commercialized and turned into products."}, {"time": 7607, "text": "And so if we can somehow create a translation layer between those two groups and help them, you know, helps align the market forces, align scientific research to market forces so that they're more incentivized."}, {"time": 7619, "text": "Like if you discover CRISPR or something like that, like you should be a billionaire, you know, and like all the downstream implications of that, not going through some antiquated tech transfer office or whatever."}, {"time": 7628, "text": "And if you're an entrepreneur, you should be looking to commercialize the latest scientific innovations."}, {"time": 7634, "text": "And so that's kind of like the longterm vision for that site."}, {"time": 7638, "text": "I think it's just an early step today, but we've got like a really passionate community on there that are jumping into like, you know, computer science or longevity or various bio hubs or whatever and like beginning to source the best innovations, but also discuss them, improve them and publish through the site."}, {"time": 7656, "text": "So I have a question about incentives, but first let me say for people listening who are outside of academia might not be familiar with an absurd situation."}, {"time": 7664, "text": "So there's journals, like you mentioned, and scientists publishing those journals and the journals provide very little value except matching you with reviewers that are unpaid."}, {"time": 7680, "text": "And so in the digital world, they're providing basically almost no value except hosting your paper."}, {"time": 7690, "text": "And they put up a paywall and charge people to access that."}, {"time": 7695, "text": "And that charge is not like even Netflix fees, you're talking about a lot of money."}, {"time": 7700, "text": "So they're basically blocking your research that should be wide open from the world and creating a paywall."}, {"time": 7708, "text": "It's a fascinating like scam that's actually holding back."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "I don't, it's a shitty scam because you're not making that much money."}, {"time": 7717, "text": "I feel like a definition of a scam, you should at least be making money."}, {"time": 7720, "text": "So like significant amount of money, you're basically making shady money and holding back all of human knowledge, okay."}, {"time": 7726, "text": "So that put aside and people get a little confused because the journals aren't the ones paying the scientists."}, {"time": 7733, "text": "People think like the journals are somehow funding the scientists, therefore they have the right to put up a paywall."}, {"time": 7741, "text": "No, no, no, the funding is coming from elsewhere."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "Journals are the middleman that nobody asks for, especially in the digital world."}, {"time": 7748, "text": "Anyway, that said, there is a interesting kind of incentives for scientists, which is prestige and so on."}, {"time": 7756, "text": "So there's a thing with journals, if there's a prestigious journal and you pass the review process, you get into that journal or a prestigious conference in computer science, then that's seen as a good thing in your resume."}, {"time": 7773, "text": "And, oh, not just your resume, within your community, that's a respected thing."}, {"time": 7777, "text": "Is there some way to achieve that same kind of incentive in the open setting of research hub?"}, {"time": 7784, "text": "So like where I could say, I got X, Y and Z, like, look, I'm impressive because this happened on research hub."}, {"time": 7793, "text": "Like the whole academia, like progress track is about like where you got published and how many citations."}, {"time": 7799, "text": "And it's kind of like a false economy of reputation because like, there's not real money backing it."}, {"time": 7806, "text": "And so I think we've thought about this a little bit."}, {"time": 7810, "text": "And I think the research hub team has an opportunity to do something here that basically says like, okay, I had the top paper for 2022 in biology on in here."}, {"time": 7821, "text": "And you basically publish a list, a leaderboards of these like top for the month, the year in all these different categories."}, {"time": 7829, "text": "Then actually, we should probably give out grants and awards in addition to that, fund those people almost like fellows or even give out like, you know how like the Nobel prize, there should be like a research hub prize or something and like ship people, maybe even ship like a print version of a journal that is the top papers in each category in each month or whatever."}, {"time": 7851, "text": "And then like people want to put that in their wall and in the lab."}, {"time": 7853, "text": "And like, so I do think we need to sort of change, I don't know, like the traditional folks in academia or science would probably think this is like crazy idea."}, {"time": 7862, "text": "But I think we need to change the culture to not celebrate getting published in paywall journals, almost like friends don't let friends publish in like paywall journals."}, {"time": 7874, "text": "Like, cause that's, it's just not helping humanity."}, {"time": 7876, "text": "So like, you know, it should be more prestigious to publish in an open science way and get the top spot."}, {"time": 7883, "text": "That should be celebrated above being published in whatever, I don't even want to name one of them, you know?"}, {"time": 7888, "text": "Well, there's currently, the culture has already shifted to where almost everybody publishes on archive and by archive and so on."}, {"time": 7896, "text": "But, so that the culture is there on that scene, friends don't let friends not publish open, but then the prestige thing is missing, which is like anyone can publish an archive."}, {"time": 7908, "text": "So how do you know it's actually a strong paper?"}, {"time": 7910, "text": "Now, funny enough, even with the crappy systems we have now, word of mouth is powerful."}, {"time": 7916, "text": "Like you have a, like citation system is pretty powerful."}, {"time": 7920, "text": "So like you say, okay, this is a strong paper."}, {"time": 7922, "text": "We don't need reviewers, our human eyes are the reviewers, like the community is the reviewers."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "So it's already, like that part is there, but it would be nice to have like, you know, nature level, like this is respect, this is a respectful accomplishment."}, {"time": 7941, "text": "And something like a leaderboard, but a stable kind of system."}, {"time": 7946, "text": "And I should mention too, so there's a crypto angle to this too, which is, so research hub has a coin associated with research coin."}, {"time": 7952, "text": "And it's basically, if people, you know, upvote your paper or like support it, you'll accumulate more research coin, which is basically like rep or like a reward token."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "And so that is a way to, I guess, measure the community's collective view of that paper, a form of peer review."}, {"time": 7971, "text": "And it can even be weighted by like the reputation of the people voting on it and that sort of thing over time."}, {"time": 7977, "text": "Yeah, I think the last thing I'll just say is that, so I think from a rep, like a prestige point of view, it won't start off that way."}, {"time": 7985, "text": "It'll probably start off like being a little more quirky, like, you know, like remember when YouTube first started, it was like people posting weird cat videos and stuff."}, {"time": 7993, "text": "And, but now like, you know, if you have a million subscribers on YouTube, that's probably better than getting like a TV show on NBC or whoever the traditional gatekeeper was."}, {"time": 8001, "text": "So my hope, it might take 10 years, 20 years, whatever, but I'm hoping that this can sort of be the new prestigious way that young people publish in science and it'll come to be viewed as more prestigious."}, {"time": 8012, "text": "The journals, the traditional journals will be viewed as old fashioned."}, {"time": 8016, "text": "Well, it's definitely a system that could do a lot better."}, {"time": 8021, "text": "And there's a lot of incredible, brilliant people doing science, they deserve better, the better platforms."}, {"time": 8027, "text": "So another thing you're taking on and helping out with is this new limit, which is looking at longevity."}, {"time": 8035, "text": "Yeah, okay, so as you can see, I'm excited about science."}, {"time": 8038, "text": "Like I think, you know, science is sort of the, basically if you get scientific innovation, then you get better products and you get better economic growth and then you get all kinds of like surplus in society that can go to arts and philosophy and like all kinds of stuff."}, {"time": 8053, "text": "But with new limits, so yeah, I kind of got, I started hosting some dinners with scientists last year and I was learning about all kinds of the latest stuff happening in bio and there's a lot of really cool stuff happening with like CAR T cells and CRISPR and all these things."}, {"time": 8069, "text": "And anyway, one of the topics I started to learn more about was something called cell reprogramming."}, {"time": 8075, "text": "And, you know, people maybe have heard of this induced pluripotent stem cells where you could take like a skin cell and turn it back into a stem cell."}, {"time": 8083, "text": "And Shinya Yamanaka won the Nobel prize for this work that was done in 2006."}, {"time": 8089, "text": "And, you know, it's kind of a crazy thing."}, {"time": 8091, "text": "You can turn one cell into another type of cell."}, {"time": 8094, "text": "Well, people recently have been experimenting with different types of transcription factors that would either not, you don't want the cell to go all the way back to being a stem cell."}, {"time": 8105, "text": "You can end up getting like cancerous cells and things like that."}, {"time": 8108, "text": "But you want it basically the cell to revert a little bit earlier in its, you know, it would call it the Waddington landscape, but it's basically like go, become act, start to act like a bit of a younger cell, but not to de differentiate and become more like a stem cell."}, {"time": 8123, "text": "And so I decided this might be an interesting area to go fund."}, {"time": 8127, "text": "I think that that team has come together."}, {"time": 8128, "text": "There's like some really talented people who've come together to help get that off the ground."}, {"time": 8132, "text": "And they're basically building a platform that can test a lot of different transcription factors on different cell types and hopefully find ways to rejuvenate different types of cells and tissues to extend human health span."}, {"time": 8170, "text": "To me, this is just, I always think about, you know, it's actually a little inspired by Elon, right?"}, {"time": 8175, "text": "Is like, what are some of the biggest things in the world like that are probably high technology risk, but if they did work, maybe they're kind of low chance of working, but if they did work would have enormous impact."}, {"time": 8218, "text": "Yeah, so he's also doing bio with Neuralink and I feel like bio is tough because it's messy."}, {"time": 8227, "text": "We don't understand it as well."}, {"time": 8229, "text": "The risk is higher in terms of, not the risk is higher, but like you have to deal with the actual sort of, to get to human, to get to stuff where it could be therapies for actual human bodies is tricky because you have to prove that it's safe, it's effective, all those kinds of things with FDA."}, {"time": 8253, "text": "I mean, it's just, it's tricky."}, {"time": 8259, "text": "If I can give a quick plug."}, {"time": 8261, "text": "So yeah, I'm on the board at New Limit."}, {"time": 8263, "text": "We're hiring talented scientists that are interested in the cellular programming space."}, {"time": 8267, "text": "They don't necessarily have to be coming from like an aging background or anything like that."}, {"time": 8270, "text": "There's sort of a small group of people doing even."}, {"time": 8273, "text": "So this is a new thing?"}, {"time": 8274, "text": "This is a, is New Limit relatively new?"}, {"time": 8276, "text": "Yeah, it's very new."}, {"time": 8277, "text": "There's a small team today, just a handful of people."}, {"time": 8280, "text": "And so we're hiring more there."}, {"time": 8283, "text": "If people are excited about that space, reach out."}, {"time": 8285, "text": "And same thing for Research Hub."}, {"time": 8287, "text": "There's a small team there that's really awesome."}, {"time": 8290, "text": "That's doing more like software engineering, design, product, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 8296, "text": "If you put on your old, wise, sage hat, what advice would you give to young people today?"}, {"time": 8304, "text": "High school, maybe undergrad and college about life."}, {"time": 8309, "text": "So like career, having a career they can be proud of, or maybe a life they can be proud of."}, {"time": 8317, "text": "So people can do whatever they want to be happy, right?"}, {"time": 8320, "text": "So there's not one way to do it."}, {"time": 8322, "text": "I do think that some people, a particular type of people out there, a lot of people actually, they want to have an impact on the world."}, {"time": 8328, "text": "That's how they get a sense of fulfillment, right?"}, {"time": 8330, "text": "So I mean, you need to have like health, physical health."}, {"time": 8333, "text": "You need to have good relationships, like there's lots of things."}, {"time": 8336, "text": "But most people want to do something important."}, {"time": 8338, "text": "They want to have fulfilling work, a way that they can feel like they're contributing."}, {"time": 8342, "text": "I think a lot of people, young people today are thinking like I should be an activist or something like that."}, {"time": 8349, "text": "And there's people in the world who have power and a lot of people who don't, I don't have power."}, {"time": 8353, "text": "And so the way to change the world is to speak truth to power or like criticize power and try to pressure them to change."}, {"time": 8365, "text": "To me, I don't think that's the right way to actually have an impact on the world because everybody has probably, I think people have more power than they realize."}, {"time": 8376, "text": "And by the way, it's easy to be a critic."}, {"time": 8379, "text": "It's hard to actually change these things and fix it."}, {"time": 8382, "text": "And so you'll get a lot of accolades from friends and things like that if you kind of go around criticizing, it's easy to do."}, {"time": 8388, "text": "Like everything is broken and could be better, including stuff I'm working on."}, {"time": 8393, "text": "I find like so frustrating."}, {"time": 8396, "text": "There's a million things I want to be better about like what we're doing in Coinbase."}, {"time": 8401, "text": "So be the person in the arena, like that Theodore Roosevelt quote, I think he said it right."}, {"time": 8406, "text": "Like go chew glass and stare into the abyss."}, {"time": 8410, "text": "Like if you really want to have an impact, either join a company that has a mission that is trying to fix the thing you're passionate about or start that company if it doesn't exist or start a charity if it's not suitable to be a company or whatever it is, but go try to be a part of the solution."}, {"time": 8425, "text": "Don't just criticize or be a part of the problem."}, {"time": 8430, "text": "My hope is that more people can realize that they actually can have a meaningful impact that way."}, {"time": 8439, "text": "And I think that to me, technology is actually one of the most important ways to improve the world."}, {"time": 8445, "text": "Like if you look at climate change, like a lot of the best ideas like carbon sequestration, all these things, it's a technology thing, right?"}, {"time": 8453, "text": "If you want to try to fix education, it's like look at like Khan Academy and all this stuff going online, right?"}, {"time": 8459, "text": "If you want to fix, you know, whatever transportation and like the financial system and global freedom and like equality of all these things, like there's typically the way to get something changed in the world today is with technology."}, {"time": 8473, "text": "And so I do think people, it's very bizarre to me that there's this kind of like anti tech thing going on."}, {"time": 8479, "text": "Look, nothing is perfect."}, {"time": 8480, "text": "Like if you create something new and like tens of millions of people use it or billions of people use it, it's like there's going to be some bad people who use it too, okay?"}, {"time": 8487, "text": "And there's, you know, society is complicated, but like I think most of these things have been net positive because most people in the world are good is at least my view."}, {"time": 8496, "text": "So yes, we can mitigate like the 1% of bad people trying to abuse something, but 99% of people in the world are good."}, {"time": 8502, "text": "And the way you can improve the world is with technology, joining companies, starting companies that are working on the right stuff."}, {"time": 8508, "text": "So I hope more young people do that."}, {"time": 8510, "text": "And just, if you're not sure what to do, like just get started with anything."}, {"time": 8515, "text": "And basically have the optimism that you have the power to do the change."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "So it's easy to distract yourself by being the critic."}, {"time": 8526, "text": "That's almost like acknowledging to yourself that that's all you can be, but basically everybody has the power to be the fixer."}, {"time": 8536, "text": "I like, chew glass and look into the abyss."},

really think there is any point to life."}, {"time": 8566, "text": "You know, somebody once told me, you know, if you go into these like, kind of really big existential questions, it can get a little scary because like you stare off the cliff and there's like, there's nothing there."}, {"time": 8579, "text": "You know, this one person told me one time they were like, you know, Brian, you should probably snorkel, don't scuba."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "I guess, and I think they were trying to say like, I, some of my friends have done this, right?"}, {"time": 8593, "text": "They'll go to like, you know, epic meditation retreats and like, they'll kind of come back with all this existential dread of like, what's the meaning of it all."}, {"time": 8602, "text": "And then like, as far as I can tell, we are just some organic molecules in the ocean started like dividing and replicating and the selfish gene and all this stuff, like basically ended up here."}, {"time": 8614, "text": "And our only, it's some kind of like really naive algorithm that's just kind of trying to get us to survive and replicate."}, {"time": 8620, "text": "And we have DNA just like every other animal."}, {"time": 8623, "text": "And so we happened to develop these like really cool neocortexes."}, {"time": 8626, "text": "And so now we're sort of self aware and we have all these big questions and maybe we'll create another, you know, as computers get better, we'll create the simulation inside our thing."}, {"time": 8637, "text": "And I think it's cool."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "Like we should basically, I just want to keep watching the movie, you know, unfold."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "That's part of why I want to work on, like New Limit is really cool."}, {"time": 8645, "text": "Cause it's helped, if people can live longer, whether that's uploading their brain to the cloud or, you know, basically through we get biology to work or the strong AI to work or whatever."}, {"time": 8657, "text": "One of those two hopefully works out."}, {"time": 8658, "text": "And then we get to keep watching the movie and see how it all unfolds."}, {"time": 8662, "text": "I think that's fun."}, {"time": 8663, "text": "And so I don't know if that's like an answer, but I guess I don't think there's any real purpose."}, {"time": 8667, "text": "So just try to have fun."}, {"time": 8668, "text": "Well, the cool thing is that we get to write the movie as we watch it."}, {"time": 8676, "text": "I mean, that's like the Steve Jobs quote and all that, where he's like, everything around you was invented by somebody who just was like, this was a crazy idea they thought up."}, {"time": 8683, "text": "So once you realize you can kind of do anything you want, then that's what you start to go, you start to go try crazier stuff."}, {"time": 8695, "text": "I mean, this is another one of those areas where, not to get too out there, but like, you know, when you're, I think you can build your comfort zone around like people being upset with you."}, {"time": 8703, "text": "You can also build your range of what you think is possible, right?"}, {"time": 8708, "text": "Like when I was in my 20s, I was like reading all these books about like self improvement and goal, how to write down your goals and stuff."}, {"time": 8715, "text": "And my goals were like, someday I wanna make $100,000 a year or something like, and that was, and you know, and it seemed like a little outlandish or what, I wrote down these goals, like I wanna own rental property or something anyway."}, {"time": 8731, "text":
