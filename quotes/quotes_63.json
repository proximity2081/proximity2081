work, Steve Rappert and others, but Mike Roshbosh and other people worked out these mechanisms in flies and bacteria and mammals."}, {"time": 334, "text": "There are these genes that create 24 hour oscillations in gene expression, et cetera, in every cell of our body."}, {"time": 340, "text": "But what aligns those is a signal from the master circadian clock, which sits right above the roof of the mouth, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus."}, {"time": 348, "text": "And that clock synchronizes all the clocks of the body to this general temperature rhythm by way of controlling systemic temperature, which makes perfect sense."}, {"time": 360, "text": "If you want to create a general oscillation in all the tissues and organs of the body, use temperature."}, {"time": 365, "text": "And so that work on temperature, if people want to explore it further, was Joe Takahashi, who was at Northwestern, now at UT Southwestern in Dallas."}, {"time": 374, "text": "And it is absolutely clear that humans do better on a diurnal schedule, sorry, Lex, than a nocturnal schedule, because you could say, well, provided I sleep and push adenosine back downhill, which is what happens when we sleep, adenosine is then reduced."}, {"time": 390, "text": "And provided I am on more or less a 24 hour schedule, why should it matter that I'm awake when the sun's out and I'm asleep when the sun is down?"}, {"time": 398, "text": "But it turns out that if you look at health metrics, people that are strictly nocturnal do far worse on immune function, on metabolic function, et cetera, than people who are diurnal, who are awake during the daytime."}, {"time": 411, "text": "And animals that are nocturnal, it's the opposite."}, {"time": 414, "text": "And animals that are so called crepuscular, which tend to be active at dawn and at dusk, this is a beautiful system, I won't go down that rabbit hole, but these are animals whose visual systems operate best."}, {"time": 425, "text": "They tend to be predators like mountain lions."}, {"time": 427, "text": "They have optimized their waking times for the times when the animals they eat can't see well in those light conditions."}, {"time": 435, "text": "But given the rod cone ratios in their eyes, that the mountain lion is picking off."}, {"time": 440, "text": "It's like when you see a special forces and they are looking through night vision goggles and they have a clear advantage, right?"}, {"time": 446, "text": "They are seeing in the dark."}, {"time": 448, "text": "That's basically what it's like to be a mountain lion as opposed to a bunny rabbit."}, {"time": 452, "text": "Would you say that a lot of these cycles evolved in the predator prey relationships of the different throughout the food chain?"}, {"time": 459, "text": "So it's basically all somehow has to do with survival in this complicated web of predators and prey."}, {"time": 466, "text": "Almost certainly, there had to have been a time in which humans being awake and active at night, as opposed to during the day, led to higher levels of lethality."}, {"time": 478, "text": "And probably particular in kids, you imagine kids running around in the dark and getting that where there are a lot of animals that can see really well under those conditions and humans can't."}, {"time": 486, "text": "And this would be all preelectricity."}, {"time": 488, "text": "Even if you're carrying a torch, I mean, the range of illumination on a torch is nothing compared to what a nighttime predator, like a large cat or something can do."}, {"time": 499, "text": "I mean, they basically, they can see everything they need to in order to eat us and not the other way around."}, {"time": 504, "text": "So one fascinating thing you said is that blew my mind and we went right past it, which is the temperature is a really powerful, like if you were to think about the ways that different parts of the body, different systems in the body would communicate with each other, temperature would be a really good one."}, {"time": 526, "text": "And that just, I mean, maybe it's obvious, but it kind of blew my mind just now that yeah, these systems are all distributed."}, {"time": 535, "text": "And they have to kind of, they're not actually sending signals, but they're coordinating."}, {"time": 540, "text": "They need some sort of universal thing to look at in order to coordinate."}, {"time": 546, "text": "And temperature is a nice one to build around."}, {"time": 551, "text": "And that way you could control the behavior of all these different systems by controlling the temperature."}, {"time": 557, "text": "Right, it's attractive to think of a mechanism where this master circadian clock secretes a peptide or something that goes and locks to receptors in all the cells and gets it just right."}, {"time": 567, "text": "But that leaves far too much room for variability, binding affinities, cells in a lot of parts of our body are at different stages of maturation."}, {"time": 575, "text": "They're turning over liver cells and so forth."}, {"time": 577, "text": "And for instance, we have a clock in our gut and in our liver such that if we were just take out your liver and put it on a table and just look at the expression of these genes, it would be in a 24 hour oscillation on its own."}, {"time": 589, "text": "It's independent, but something has to entrain them and keep them all synchronized."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And so it's not obvious that it would be temperature."}, {"time": 595, "text": "Takahashi's great gift to biology was to show that all the stuff coming out of this master circadian clock at the end of the day, that's a weird statement, no pun intended, at the end of the day and the night, at the end of the story, it all boils down to making sure that the temperature of tissues oscillates in the same fashion."}, {"time": 616, "text": "That's blowing my mind and thinking like what other mechanism could possibly exist to create that kind of oscillation."}, {"time": 623, "text": "Well, you're Russian, it's cold in Russia for a lot of the year."}, {"time": 627, "text": "The hibernation signal in certain animals is a remarkable signal."}, {"time": 630, "text": "There are peptides secreted from this very same clock that in animals like ground squirrels or bears, they go into a kind of a torpor where everything, reproduction, metabolism, everything is reduced while they're in their cave."}, {"time": 644, "text": "They don't actually stay asleep all of winter."}, {"time": 646, "text": "That's a myth."}, {"time": 647, "text": "And they actually do these very dramatic and periodic arousals from hibernation where they just shake and shake and shake."}, {"time": 654, "text": "It looks like a seizure."}, {"time": 655, "text": "And then they go back under into the torpor."}, {"time": 657, "text": "That's from a peptide that's released."}, {"time": 660, "text": "But that's different because that's about shutting down the whole system."}, {"time": 663, "text": "It's clear that having these very regular oscillations every 24 hours is essential for everything from metabolism to reproduction."}, {"time": 673, "text": "Is there an optimal temperature for sleep that I should mention?"}, {"time": 679, "text": "I think your latest episode, you and people should go check out helixsleep.com slash Huberman to support Andrew."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Thanks for the plug."}, {"time": 690, "text": "I mean, the amazing thing about this stuff that you're creating, oh, and yes, you have a new podcast."}, {"time": 697, "text": "In this past month, you did a whole series on sleep, which people should definitely check out."}, {"time": 704, "text": "There's some podcasts that come out that just make me want to be a better human being by just the quality."}, {"time": 713, "text": "Three Blue One Brown, Grant Sanderson is like that for me."}, {"time": 717, "text": "Just like, wow, this is education is best."}, {"time": 720, "text": "So Andrew symbolizes that, captures that brilliantly."}, {"time": 725, "text": "So go support the sponsor so he doesn't stop doing the thing."}, {"time": 729, "text": "So I think they have a cooling pad too."}, {"time": 731, "text": "So the 8 Sleep Mattress sponsors me."}, {"time": 737, "text": "They sent me a mattress and it's been, I've never, listen, I used to sleep on the floor."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Sleep where you fall."}, {"time": 744, "text": "Sleep where I fall."}, {"time": 745, "text": "I don't give a shit."}, {"time": 747, "text": "But so like, I would have never bought a nice mattress because it's like, why?"}, {"time": 753, "text": "I'm fine."}, {"time": 753, "text": "This is a floor, it's fine."}, {"time": 755, "text": "But it was a game changer to be able to control temperature."}, {"time": 760, "text": "Like for me, it's cooling."}, {"time": 763, "text": "I don't know what the hell it is."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Well, you want the brain and nervous system and rest of the body needs to drop by about anywhere from two to three degrees in order to get into your deepest sleep and transition to sleep."}, {"time": 774, "text": "That's really going to help."}, {"time": 775, "text": "You don't want to be cold that you're bothered and can't fall asleep."}, {"time": 778, "text": "But that's why some people like it really cold in the room and under a warm blanket or with socks on, for some people that can be good because this temperature oscillation is such that as your temperature is dropping, that correlates generally with the most sleepy phase of your circadian cycle."}, {"time": 796, "text": "So cool is better for falling and staying asleep and sleeping deeply."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And then I guess like that's what 8 Sleep showed."}, {"time": 802, "text": "They have like an app is it warms back up to wake you up."}, {"time": 807, "text": "The idea that I haven't actually used it."}, {"time": 809, "text": "I'm like, this is stupid."}, {"time": 812, "text": "People say it works, but I just keep it the same temperature throughout the night but warming it up, I guess wakes you up, which is fascinating."}, {"time": 822, "text": "Yeah, because the wake up signal is, it's interesting to think about it's not just correlated with an increase in body temperature."}, {"time": 829, "text": "The increase in body temperature is triggering the release of cortisol from your adrenals."}, {"time": 833, "text": "And that's the wake up signal."}, {"time": 835, "text": "Do you think it's absolute temperatures we're talking about or is it just even relative?"}, {"time": 839, "text": "Just even just the decrease."}, {"time": 840, "text": "Well, everyone's gonna have slightly different basal temperature."}, {"time": 843, "text": "The idea that everybody should be 98.6."}, {"time": 845, "text": "I mean, that's a myth."}, {"time": 847, "text": "And there are theories that body temperature overall has been dropping in the last 50 years or so."}, {"time": 852, "text": "I doubt that's true for somebody who is athletic like you and is young and healthy."}, {"time": 857, "text": "But basically the coldest period of that 24 hour cycle is when you are going to be sleepiest."}, {"time": 864, "text": "There's actually a period within that 24 hour cycle, it's a time point called your temperature minimum."}, {"time": 869, "text": "And your temperature minimum tends to be about two hours before your typical wake up time."}, {"time": 876, "text": "I'm not talking about the wake up time in the middle of the night where you go use the bathroom or where you set an alarm to go catch a flight."}, {"time": 880, "text": "I mean, if you were to just allow yourself to sleep without a clock for a few days, measure when you typically wake up, two hours before then is your temperature minimum."}, {"time": 888, "text": "And that temperature minimum turns out to be a very important landmark in your circadian cycle because it turns out that if you get bright light in your eyes in the hours immediately before your temperature minimum, so two to four hours or anytime within the two or four hour window before that temperature minimum, you are going to what's called delay your circadian clock."}, {"time": 914, "text": "The next day, that whole oscillation is going to move forward."}, {"time": 918, "text": "It'll make you want to go to sleep later and wake up later."}, {"time": 921, "text": "Whereas if you get bright light in your eyes in the hours after that temperature minimum, so let's say for me, typical wake up time is 6 a.m., my temperature minimum somewhere around 4 a.m."}, {"time": 930, "text": "If I get bright light in my eyes, 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 7 a.m., it's going to advance that oscillation so that I'll want to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier the subsequent nights."}, {"time": 941, "text": "So you might say, wait, but most nights I go to sleep and wake up at more or less the same time."}, {"time": 947, "text": "And that's because the same thing is happening on both sides."}, {"time": 949, "text": "You are both advancing your clock a little bit and assuming that you're looking at light in the evening, you're also delaying your clock a little bit."}, {"time": 957, "text": "So you get kind of captured in between and then your rhythm more or less oscillates at the same period, as we say, as the spin of the earth."}, {"time": 965, "text": "Unless you're like you where you're, I get text messages from you sometimes at odd hours and if you're on the East Coast, then I know that you had to have been pulling basically an all nighter."}, {"time": 975, "text": "Yeah, yeah, that's the interesting point about the messiness of sleep."}, {"time": 981, "text": "So most people seem to perform the best when they have like a regular sleep schedule."}, {"time": 988, "text": "I perhaps am the same, but I don't know that."}, {"time": 992, "text": "And I tend to believe that you can also perform relatively optimally with chaos of sleep, of like a weird soup of like power naps and all nighters and all of that, as long as you're like happy doing what you love."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "And maybe you can tell me what you think about this."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "So I tend to, for myself, try to minimize stress in life."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "So what I found for myself with diet, with sleep is that if I obsess about it being perfect, then I'll actually stress quite a bit when it's not."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "Like I'll feel shitty when I don't get enough sleep because I know I should be getting more sleep as opposed to the actual physiological effects of not getting enough sleep."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "I find if I just accept whatever the hell happens, happens and smile and just take it all in, like David Goggins style, like if it sucks, it's even better or what is it, Jocko's like good or whatever he says."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "I think there are several things that you said that are important, but I agree that one can have a dysregulated sleep schedule and still be a happy person and productive."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "Much of my life, I've pulled all nighters and slept weird schedules."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "I think many people can probably relate to going to sleep, waking up four hours later, being up for an hour or two on your computer, then going back to sleep and getting amazing sleep the next day functioning."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "I think it's important that people have highlighted the importance of sleep and getting enough rest."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "I do think it's gone too far and now I'm editorializing a little bit, but I think that we've created this anxiety about sleep that if we don't sleep enough, we're going to get dementia."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "If we don't get sleep, then the reproductive access is going to completely crash."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "There's a lot of evidence to the contrary and as well, just based on personal experience and based on the fact that sure, it may be that a solid eight hours with no interruptions in there or nine or 10 could do great benefit, but you can do really well if you do what you say, which is you wake up, you don't want to start stressing about it, creating this meta stress about sleep."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "Being happy is actually one of the most powerful things that you can do, allowing yourself to go down that rabbit hole of stress for the following reason."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "A lot of our fatigue is not due just to the buildup of adenosine or time of day, the circadian thing we were talking about earlier."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "An additional factor is that effort is related to the release of epinephrine, of adrenaline in our brain and body."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "At some point, those levels get so high that we get stressed mentally, we get stressed physically and we want to give up."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "There are good data published in Cell showing that that signal, the epinephrine signal, eventually accumulates and there's a quit point."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "Dopamine, the molecule of pursuit and reward and feeling good, resets our ability to be in effort."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "In fact, a lot of people don't know this, but dopamine is actually what epinephrine is made from."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "If you look at the biochemical cascade, it starts with tyrosine, which is found in red meats and things of that sort."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "And tyrosine is eventually converted through things like L dopa into dopamine."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "Dopamine is made into epinephrine."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "So, I mean, this sounds kind of new agey, but happiness, joy and pleasure in what you're doing creates a chemical milieu that provides more of the chemicals that allow for effort."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "And there's nothing new agey about that."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "It's in every biochemistry textbook."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "It's in every decent neuroscience textbook."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "They just don't talk about the happiness part."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "They just talk about the dopamine part."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "So, I think that limiting your stress and at least recognizing, okay, if you're pulling an all nighter or you're somehow on messed up sleep, that there is going to be a point in that 24 hour cycle where your brain is not trustworthy, where your mental state is not worth placing too much weight on because you are near that temperature minimum."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And near that temperature minimum, which is correlates to that two hour, about two hours before you would normally wake up, the brain is hobbling along."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "And anything you feel or think at that time should not be given too much value."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "But if you can trick yourself into thinking that's the pleasure point, you afford yourself a huge advantage."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "There's a study done by a colleague of mine at Stanford that showed that positive anticipation about the next day events actually is a powerful metric for creating quality sleep, even if the sleep is very reduced."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And you'll love this one."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "And a lot of people are going to, might be critical of this."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "So, I just want to make sure that, so this is work done out of Harvard Medical."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "It was Bob Stickgold's lab and Emily Hoagland did this study that showed looking at Ochem, performance on Ochem scores."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "Okay, so organic chemistry at Harvard is pretty tough subject, highly motivated, a number of very good control groups in this study."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "What she showed was that consistency of total sleep duration was far more important for performance on these exams than total sleep duration itself."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "So it's not that just getting more sleep allows you to perform better."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Consistently getting about the same amount of sleep is better for performance, at least on Ochem, than just getting more."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So that's referring to more that there should be a consistent habit versus the total amount."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "To me, like the entirety of the picture of sleep is similar to nutrition in that it feels like it's, there's so many variables involved and it's so person specific."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "So, you know, a lot of studies, I mean, this is the way of science, has to look in aggregate the effects on sleep."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "It doesn't focus on high performers which are individuals ultimately."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Like the question isn't, so it's a very important question, is like what kind of diet fights obesity, reduces obesity?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "It's another question, what kind of diet allows David Goggins to be the best version of himself?"}, {"time": 1389, "text": "So these high performers in different avenues."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "And the same thing with sleep, like people that tell me that I should get eight hours of sleep, it's like, it's, I mean, I get it and there may be right, but they may be very wrong."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "There's no evidence that eight is better than six, that you could very well do better on six than on eight."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "There are a few other things that turn out to be strong parameters for success in this domain."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "For instance, your entire life, waking or asleep is broken up into these 90 minute ultradian cycles."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "If you look at ability to attend or do math problems or do anything, you know, drive, performance tends to ramp up slowly within a 90 minute cycle peak and then come down at the end of that 90 minute cycle."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And in sleep, we go through these stage one, two, three, four REM, et cetera, we'll talk more about that if you like, those on 90 minute ultradian cycles as well."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "Ending your sleep after a 90 minute cycle at the near the end of a 90 minute cycle, say at the end of six hours, in many cases is better for you than sleeping an additional hour, seven hours and waking up in the middle of an ultradian cycle."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "And there are a few apps that can measure this based on body movements and things like that, that have your alarm go off at the end of an ultradian cycle."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "And if you wake up in the middle of an ultradian cycle, sometimes not always you can be very groggy for a long period of time."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "I certainly do better on six hours than I do on seven."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "I happen to like an eight hour sleep, it feels great, but I haven't slept an entire eight hours without waking up in the middle of the night at some point in, I don't know, forever."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "I can't remember, it's probably some point in infancy."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "And I function well during the day."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "I think that that's an important parameter is how do you feel during the day?"}, {"time": 1498, "text": "Almost everybody experiences some sort of dip in energy in the late afternoon or what would correlate to their temperature peak."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And that's a good time of day to get either a 90 minute or less nap, or if you're not a napper or you can't nap, feet elevated has been shown to be good for clear out of some of this, the glymphatic system is this kind of like sewer system of the brain that you can clear stuff out."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "So legs elevated, or one thing that I'm a big proponent of and that my lab has been studying is what I now call NSDR, non sleep deep rest."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And this is just lying down."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "There are some scripts that we're gonna put out there soon as a free resource."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "There's some hypnosis scripts that my colleague David Spiegel has put out there as a free resource, but non sleep deep rest is allowing your system to drop into states of a real calm that allow you to get better at falling asleep later."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "And they can be very restorative for cognitive and motor function."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "There's at least one study out of Denmark that shows that the basal ganglia, which is an area of the brain that's involved in motor planning and action, one of these 20 minute non sleep deep rest protocols resets levels of neuromodulators like dopamine and the basal ganglia to the same levels that they were right after a long night's sleep."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "So I also respectfully or semi respectfully disagree with the idea that you can't recover lost sleep."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "I mean, there's no IRS for sleep."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "So what does it mean to be in debt for sleep?"}, {"time": 1589, "text": "If you're falling asleep during the day and you're sleepy, like you're falling asleep, that's a good sign of insomnia."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "It means you're not sleeping enough at night."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "If you're fatigued during the day, but you're not falling asleep, so you're just exhausted, but you're not finding yourself falling asleep in meetings and in conversation, then chances are you're fatiguing your system through something else, like a long run in the middle of the night in Austin or whatever it is that you're up to lately at 3 a.m."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "Yes, there is a magic to the nap."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "And maybe you could speak to the, because you mentioned these protocols that don't necessarily, so they're non sleep."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "But to me, the nap one or two a day can almost irrespective of how much sleep I get the night before, have a fundamental change in my mood, in my performance."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "For the better or for the worse?"}, {"time": 1643, "text": "For the better, for the better."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "Yeah, likewise."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "So I do tend to kind of experiment with durations."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "It's consistently surprising to me how like a nap of like 10 minutes, I don't know, maybe you can speak to the perfect duration of a nap, but I find that it's like magic that a short nap does as much good and often better than a longer one, for me, for me, subjectively speaking."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "What would be a longer one?"}, {"time": 1671, "text": "Longer than 90 minutes?"}, {"time": 1673, "text": "No, no, like 90 minutes, or a bit longer than 90 minutes, like two hours."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "Yeah, that's starting to drop you into REM sleep."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "And even if it's a tiny amount of REM sleep, people can come out of those naps kind of disoriented."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "I mean, remember, in sleep, space and time are totally uncoupled."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "And so that's an odd state to reenter the world in if you're not gonna stay there for a while, like for a good night's sleep."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "I think a 20 minute nap is pretty fantastic."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Would you say

inhale, this isn't breath work."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "We're not going to do breath work."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "But when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "The

problem."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "I think the major issues right now around the psychedelic conversation is that it's clear that they can unveil certain elements of neuroplasticity."}, {"time":

clear that happens."}, {"time": 5803, "text": "But there's two major issues."}, {"time": 5805, "text": "One is that people talk about plasticity as if plasticity is the goal, but plasticity is a state within which you can direct neurology."}, {"time": 5813, "text": "And the question is what changes are you trying to get to?"}, {"time": 5816, "text": "So people are just taking psychedelics to unveil plasticity without thinking about what circuits they want to modify and how."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "I think that's a problem."}, {"time": 5826, "text": "I think there's great potential, however, for people opening up these states of plasticity with psychedelics or otherwise, and directing the plastic changes toward a particular end point."}, {"time": 5837, "text": "And there's an absolutely spectacular paper out of UC Davis published as a full article in Nature just a couple of months ago, showing that there are psychedelics that are now can be modified."}, {"time": 5850, "text": "So

it'd be like, oh, that's no fun."}, {"time": 5860, "text": "That's not giving you the wild experience."}, {"time": 5863, "text": "But I do think that that holds great potential for people that wouldn't otherwise orient towards some of these drugs."}, {"time": 5868, "text": "So I think it's really marvelous what's happening and what's about to happen."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And I think there is one drug in that kit of drugs that's very unusual, like psilocybin, LSD, those promote heavy, heavy serotonin release and lateralized connections ramp up, et cetera."}, {"time": 5886, "text": "Matt talked about all that."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "But MDMA, ecstasy, is a very unusual situation where dopamine is very, very high because of the way the drug is designed."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "Dopamine release, it goes through the roof."}, {"time": 5901, "text": "So people feel great and they want to move and they have a lot of energy."}, {"time": 5905, "text": "But serotonin levels are also high and that's a very unnatural state."}, {"time": 5910, "text": "And why MDMA may, and I want to highlight may, have particularly high potential for the treatment of certain forms of depression is an interesting question."}, {"time": 5923, "text": "Because never before, as far as we know in human history, has there been a possibility of opening up dopaminergic and serotonergic states at the same time, dopamine being the molecule pursuit and reward and more and more, and serotonin being one of bliss and being content right where you're at."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "So it's almost like those two things wrap back on themselves and create this very unusual state."}, {"time": 5944, "text": "And I think the bigger conversation is what to do with a state like that."},

"text": "Like these are powerful molecules."}, {"time": 5957, "text": "And I think if the academic community and the clinical community is going to move forward with them in any serious way, I think there needs to be a conversation about what they're being used for."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "Right, and coupled with that, I think similar to what you're saying, like Matt has talked about, as others have talked about, some of the biggest benefits of like progress, whether it's like quitting smoking and all this kind of stuff is in the days after, it's the integration of the experience."},

brain but you have to do then it's work."}, {"time": 6000, "text": "Absolutely, a friend of mine who's a physician, he says, who's quite open to this idea that psychedelics could play a real role in real medicine."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "Says, better living through chemistry still requires better living."}, {"time": 6014, "text": "And I think it's a beautiful statement."}, {"time": 6016,

weeks, three weeks, four weeks afterward?"}, {"time": 6026, "text": "Because that's the real opportunity."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "But those psychedelic experiences are really a case of an amplified experience inside of an amplified experience so much so that everything seems relevant."}, {"time": 6066, "text": "I mean, it's doable."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "It's doable with transcranial magnetic stimulation and it's for shutting down activity and it's doable with ultrasound."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "Ultrasound now allows very focal activation of particular brain regions through the skull, noninvasively."}, {"time": 6081, "text": "So it's approaching the same kind of therapy from different angles."}, {"time": 6084, "text": "One AI is the computational size of injecting like the robotics injecting like maybe you can even think about it as like electricity, the electrical approach versus then like the chemical approach."}, {"time": 6099, "text": "And then the psychology is subjective, right?"}, {"time": 6102, "text": "So it's gonna take some real understanding of what that person's lexicon is."}, {"time": 6109, "text": "Like, you know, that wasn't a pun, sorry."},

these drugs?"}, {"time": 6138, "text": "And like, I mean, his languaging might, if he says that was troubling, it might mean that it was very troubling or not troubling at all."}, {"time": 6147,

need, can you build a tool for that?"}, {"time": 6158, "text": "Can you build an AI tool for that?"}, {"time": 6159, "text": "Yeah, deeper, yeah, well."}, {"time": 6160, "text": "Maybe that's the eye, maybe that's our, that's what the eyes could reveal."}, {"time": 6164, "text": "So language is not just words, it's everything together."}, {"time": 6167, "text": "And that's one of the fascinating things about the eyes and the window to the soul."}, {"time": 6171, "text": "I mean, they express so much, the face, the eyes, the body, I mean, Lisa talks about that, the communication of emotions, it's a super complex."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "Perhaps it's a bit of a side fun tangent, but Matt, Matthew Johnson brings up DMT and the experience of DMT is from a scientific perspective, just a mystery in itself over its intensity of what happens to the brain."}, {"time": 6201, "text": "And of course, Joe Rogan and others bring it up as a very different special kind of experience and elves seem to come up often."}, {"time": 6214, "text": "I've never tried DMT, what allows for hallucinogenic states?"}, {"time": 6218, "text": "And it, I mean, DMT is a really interesting molecule."}, {"time": 6221, "text": "There are a lot of people experimenting now with DMT and the way they've described it is as a kind of a freight train through space and time, very different than the way people describe LSD type experiences or psilocybin where time and space are very fluid, but it tends to be a kind of a slower role, if you will."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "So it's clear that DMT is tapping into a brain state that's distinctly different than the other psychedelics."}, {"time": 6253, "text": "And you mentioned jujitsu and these other communities."}, {"time": 6257, "text": "I mean, I think it's interesting because jujitsu is a nonverbal activity and people get together and talk about this nonverbal activity and they show great love for it in the same way that surfers, I've known some surfers in my time and they will get up at the crack of dawn and drive really, really far to sit in the water and wait for this wave to come."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "I have to imagine it's pretty fantastic."}, {"time": 6280, "text": "I think that human beings now, some of whom are in the scientific community are starting to feel comfortable enough to talk about some of these other loves and other endeavors because they do reveal a certain component about our underlying neurology."}, {"time": 6295, "text": "I'm fascinated by the concept of wordlessness, activities in which language is just not sufficient to capture and in which feel so vital as a reset, as important as sleep."}, {"time": 6311, "text": "I think that's one of the dangers of the phone is not that you're going to get into some online battle or that you're always staring at the phone is that it's a words."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "As we read things, we're hearing the script in our head."}, {"time": 6320, "text": "And I think getting into states where we are in a state of wordlessness is very renewing and replenishing and just can feel amazing."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "And I believe also can help us tap into creative states and allow our neurology to access creative states."}, {"time": 6338, "text": "And sleep is one such wordlessness, period."}, {"time": 6342, "text": "So one of the most interesting things to me are states that one can approach in waking, non sleep depressed, wordlessness through, maybe it's jujitsu, maybe it's for some people surfing, maybe it's dancing, maybe it's just, I don't know, staring at a wall, who knows?"}, {"time": 6358, "text": "But where the language components of the brain are completely shut down."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "And it has to be the case that drugs are no drugs, that the brain is entering and starting to states and starting to use algorithms that are distinctly different than when we're trying to compose things in any kind of coherent way for someone else to understand."}, {"time": 6377, "text": "There's no interest in anyone else understanding what you're experiencing in that moment."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "And I think it's not just beautiful because it feels good."}, {"time": 6387, "text": "I think it's beautiful because it's important and it's clearly fundamental to our neurology."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "And your sense is there's a connection between dreams and DMT and like psychedelic, like all of the, you can understand one by studying the other."}, {"time": 6402, "text": "So for example, dreams are also very difficult to study, but they're more accessible."}, {"time": 6408, "text": "It's safer to study."}, {"time": 6409, "text": "And we're told we need to get more of it."}, {"time": 6411, "text": "Whereas

"There's still a lot of them are scheduled."}, {"time": 6428, "text": "And there's a lot of questions."}, {"time": 6430, "text": "I mean, but nevertheless, it's like, my hope is that science opens up to these drugs a little bit more."}, {"time": 6441, "text": "It's just, I have this intuition that, like a lot of people share, that they would be able to unlock deeper understanding of our own mind."}, {"time": 6451, "text": "It's any kind of, same as studying dreams."}, {"time": 6455, "text": "Well, creativity is in the nonlinearities, right?"}, {"time": 6459, "text": "But productivity is in the implementation of linearities."}, {"time": 6463, "text": "I mean, that's what is absolutely clear."}, {"time": 6465, "text": "This is why I think we were talking earlier about why a formal rigorous training in something where other people are looking at you and telling you, no, not good enough, go back and do it again."}, {"time": 6474, "text": "There's real value to that because otherwise it's just ideas."}, {"time": 6477, "text": "It's just vapors."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "You know, one thing that Matt mentioned as the study that they're working on is, as opposed to, I think most of the psychedelic studies they've done is on how to treat different conditions."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "And one of the things they're working on now is to try to do a study where, for creatives, for people that don't have a condition that they're trying to treat, but instead see how this, how psychedelics can help you create."}, {"time": 6507, "text": "If you take creatives and you give them more psychedelics, they're not gonna be able to get out of their room."}, {"time": 6512, "text": "Well, but this is the, maybe you can speak to that, psychedelics or not, or dreams or tools in general, how to be better creatives."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "That's an interesting, I don't often see studies of this nature of like how to take high performers in the mental creative space and

met him, but it's clear, right?"}, {"time": 6579, "text": "He, it's not just that he's ambitious and bold and brave and all that, it's all that."}, {"time": 6584, "text": "And there's clearly a different way of looking at the same problems that everyone else is looking at."}, {"time": 6591, "text": "And people are probably banging their head against the refrigerator thinking like, think differently, think it doesn't work that way."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "It involves, there's a certain anxiety in for the, I'm not talking about for Elon, but I don't have no idea."}, {"time": 6603, "text": "But I think for somebody who's very structured, very regimented, very linear, the anxiety comes from letting go of those linearities."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "And for the person that's very creative, the anxiety comes from trying to impose linearities, right?"}, {"time": 6618, "text": "The really creative artists or musician, they're, they seem nuts."}, {"time": 6622, "text": "They seem like they can't get their life together because they can't."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "And they, you know, we look at people who are kind of pseudo Asperger's or Asperger's or some forms of autism and

limits to explore further."}, {"time": 6677, "text": "I don't like leaning, this is why I'm bothered there's not more science and psychedelics is, I haven't done almost, so I've eaten mushrooms a few times allegedly, but that's it."}, {"time": 6691, "text": "And the reason I don't do more, the reason I haven't done DMT is because it's illegal and it's like not well studied."}, {"time": 6699,

Podcast."}, {"time": 8102, "text": "It does your, it's basically, it embodies the personality of Andrew Huberman, which is like make science accessible, but also fascinating and giving it, like what do you call it?"}, {"time": 8123, "text": "You give tools for everyday life, meaning it kind of grounds it like, what the hell does this mean for my life?"}, {"time": 8132, "text": "But then also does the beauty of science at the same time."}, {"time": 8135, "text": "So I love both the rigor and the openness of the whole thing, plus the whole corrections things that we mentioned."}, {"time": 8142, "text": "Anyway, what's been the hardest part of this whole process?"}, {"time": 8147, "text": "You're one of, already one of the only, and one of the best science broadcasters out there."}, {"time": 8156, "text": "So in that process, what's been the hardest, what's been the most exciting part?"}, {"time": 8161, "text": "Wow, well, first of all, thanks for the kind words about the podcast."}, {"time": 8165, "text": "It was inspired by you."}, {"time": 8167, "text": "I absolutely, that's no BS."}, {"time": 8171, "text": "The last time we met to do an interview for your podcast, we talked a little bit about it and you gave me the subtle nudge that maybe there was a podcast there and I thought about it and I laughed and I was just like, I gotta do this thing."}, {"time": 8184, "text": "And you really gave me the encouragement to do it."}, {"time": 8186, "text": "And your podcast, this podcast has really forged the way."}, {"time": 8190, "text": "You've been tip of the spear on serious scientific, intellectual, yet fun, accessible conversation."}, {"time": 8197, "text": "And so I, as your colleague and friend, but just even if those things weren't true, like this podcast was and is the inspiration."}, {"time": 8210, "text": "Yeah, I really, like 100%."}, {"time": 8212, "text": "And when I decided to do the podcast, the Huberman Lab Podcast, I thought really long and hard about what would work best and would be most beneficial."}, {"time": 8220, "text": "It turned out to be the hardest thing, which is to stay on a single topic for three or four or more episodes before switching to a new topic."}, {"time": 8228, "text": "Because I know from the experience of university and teaching in university, as you know as well, that there's always the temptation to pivot to something else, but the drilling into something really deeply is where the gems reside."}, {"time": 8245, "text": "And the challenge has been how to make it interesting, how to keep people on board, how to give people tools along the way, but also stay close to the scientific data."}, {"time": 8257, "text": "I like to think that we're headed in the right direction."}, {"time": 8259, "text": "It still needs to evolve, but that's been a challenge."}, {"time": 8263, "text": "I think I also am challenged by the fact that there's a tremendous range of backgrounds of listeners."}, {"time": 8270, "text": "So some people have asked for more names, like more bits and parts of the nervous system and cellular molecular mechanisms and all that kind of thing."}, {"time": 8278, "text": "And other people have said, I don't understand any of that stuff, but I think I'm keeping up."}, {"time": 8282, "text": "And so unlike a university course where there are prerequisites and everyone's coming to the table with more or less the same knowledge, I have a very limited sense of what the audience knows and doesn't know."}, {"time": 8291, "text": "So that's why I incorporated the feature of the comment section on YouTube, being a source of feedback."}, {"time": 8298, "text": "And I do kind of an office hours like episode every third or fourth episode where I address common questions."}, {"time": 8305, "text": "And I think that the podcast space in my mind, at least for the sort of podcasts I'm doing, needed a venue for the listeners to be a more integral part of the experience as opposed to just commenting on what they liked or didn't like."}, {"time": 8320, "text": "So while I like to hear what people liked and didn't like, I also really like to hear about, hey, tell me more about temperature minimums and how they can be used to phase shifts or cadient rhythms or whatever it is."}, {"time": 8330, "text": "And I realized that I'm probably losing some people along the way, but hopefully at the end of each month, and because of the way that the episodes are archived, people will come away feeling as if they've learned a ton and they have tools that they can implement."}, {"time": 8343, "text": "And perhaps most importantly, that they're starting to think scientifically about the tons of other stuff that's out there."}, {"time": 8350, "text": "So that's been the challenge and it's still really early days, but, and of course, there's also an intentional challenge."}, {"time": 8358, "text": "I realize that people are busy."}, {"time": 8359, "text": "Not everyone has two hours to listen to a podcast about jet lag and shift work and raising kids and sleep and that kind of thing."}, {"time": 8367, "text": "I'm not raising kids, but I did a whole thing about babies and sleep with, you know, and how parents can manage their sleep when kids aren't sleeping."}, {"time": 8373, "text": "So it's been, I'm hacking through the jungle of all this stuff, but, and I'll come right back to it."}, {"time": 8381, "text": "My inspiration and my North star on this is getting to a point where the audience that listens to this feels the same way that I do when I listen to your podcast."}, {"time": 8397, "text": "Like when I turn into your podcast, I'm going to embarrass you a little bit more by complimenting you a little bit more, but not out of a sadistic thing, but just because when I tune into your podcast or Joe's podcast, I have the same sensation that other people have."}, {"time": 8411, "text": "Like, I feel like I'm home of sorts."}, {"time": 8415, "text": "I'm like, I'm familiar with the space and I'd like people to feel comfortable in the space that is the Huber and Lab Podcast, whatever that ends up being."}, {"time": 8423, "text": "Yeah, that's the magic of podcasting."}, {"time": 8425, "text": "It's like, I feel like I'm part of your life now in a way that, as a fan, that I wouldn't be otherwise."}, {"time": 8432, "text": "And, you know, like I never was able to have that with Carl Sagan, for example, you know?"}, {"time": 8438, "text": "And that's a whole nother level of connection with a human being that gets you excited."}, {"time": 8444, "text": "And then I share your excitement about different topics in neuroscience or just biology in general."}, {"time": 8454, "text": "And then I don't have to actually understand everything you're saying to really enjoy it."}, {"time": 8460, "text": "So that's the magic of podcasting is like, you can go through like 10 minutes and not understanding what the hell a person is saying, and then you enjoy the excitement and then you reconnect to a thing that you do understand what they're saying."}, {"time": 8475, "text": "And, you know, that's, that personal coupled with the scientific rigor is magic."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "And finding the right, it's exploration."}, {"time": 8484, "text": "Like Joe found something that works for comedians, which is like, you know, having a good laugh, but also every once in a while talking seriously about difficult topics."}, {"time": 8496, "text": "The scientific space, it was unclear."}, {"time": 8500, "text": "You haven't had guests on."}, {"time": 8501, "text": "Not yet, but maybe you'll come on as our first guest."}, {"time": 8505, "text": "I was gonna invite my, I was gonna try to force myself in there."}, {"time": 8508, "text": "I am, I'm officially inviting you now."}, {"time": 8510, "text": "Will you come on the podcast?"}, {"time": 8511, "text": "I would love to, I would love to."}, {"time": 8513, "text": "But it was hard."}, {"time": 8515, "text": "It's still a little bit difficult to tell people that no, you don't get it."}, {"time": 8521, "text": "We're not gonna talk for 10 minutes."}, {"time": 8523, "text": "We're gonna talk for three or four hours."}, {"time": 8527, "text": "It's a different, for scientists, for like, they're like, what are we gonna talk about?"}, {"time": 8532, "text": "They think it's like the NPR interview."}, {"time": 8535, "text": "And they don't realize, first of all, I think at his best, if you're like at the level of Joe Rogan, who I think is an excellent conversationalist, you just lose track of time."}, {"time": 8547, "text": "It can be three, four, five hours and you lose track of time."}, {"time": 8550, "text": "I'm still not there."}, {"time": 8551, "text": "I find that it's still painful."}, {"time": 8554, "text": "Like the conversation is still challenging sometimes."}, {"time": 8556, "text": "You don't lose quite as much of track of time."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "It's still an intellectual effort."}, {"time": 8560, "text": "And I think it might always be as it would be with you because you're talking about difficult topics, maybe that require more brain."}, {"time": 8567, "text": "You're not just shooting the shit with like a Brian Red Band or somebody like comedians or just joking."}, {"time": 8573, "text": "What's like, remember those shows, like where those shows where someone would come out and like spin plates and they're running back and forth."}, {"time": 8582, "text": "Really good scientific discussion is like that."}, {"time": 8585, "text": "You have to be maintaining three or four different logical arguments and jumping back and forth."}, {"time": 8590, "text": "It's occasionally get into like a real streak of linearity."}, {"time": 8593, "text": "But as we found today that typically there's three or four different things that we're bouncing back and forth from."}, {"time": 8599, "text": "And that requires a lot of updating of these, you know, forebrain circuits."}, {"time": 8603, "text": "It's not a passive listening experience."}, {"time": 8605, "text": "But I like to think that the brain likes that."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "I do want to ask just cause we all, I don't want to forget the question came up to me is your podcast has the same kind of rigor that I think like a Dan Carlin podcast has who's a history podcaster."}, {"time": 8626, "text": "Well, that's a definitely a compliment."}, {"time": 8628, "text": "Dan's way, you know, he's something for me to aspire to."}, {"time": 8632, "text": "He goes through hell to prepare."}, {"time": 8634, "text": "He spends months preparing."}, {"time": 8636, "text": "It feels like you've had to really prepare for your podcast."}, {"time": 8641, "text": "I definitely prepare hard."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "How does that?"}, {"time": 8647, "text": "I mean, how much effort does that take?"}, {"time": 8649, "text": "It feels like a conference presentation."}, {"time": 8652, "text": "So we record once a week and in the intervening time, I listened to many university level lectures."}, {"time": 8661, "text": "So NIH has a bank of lectures."}, {"time": 8665, "text": "I have some sources of recorded university seminars."}, {"time": 8668, "text": "I'm trying to find the points of intersection."}, {"time": 8672, "text": "So like for four episodes on sleep, it's not like I'm going to just regurgitate a popular book or take one lecture and just poach the content."}, {"time": 8679, "text": "I'm going to find the overlap in the different elements."}, {"time": 8683, "text": "I also, so what I'll do is I'll generally read 10 or 15 papers and generally those are good reviews, annual reviews, any review of neuroscience, annual review of physiology, those kinds of things."}, {"time": 8695, "text": "I'll chase a few references."}, {"time": 8696, "text": "I'll listen to some YouTube videos, but of university level lectures."}, {"time": 8700, "text": "And then I throw all that on a whiteboard."}, {"time": 8703, "text": "Usually while I work out in the morning, I'll just be working out."}, {"time": 8706, "text": "I have a gym in my house and I'll just put up all these random ideas."}, {"time": 8710, "text": "I want to cover that dreams, hallucination."}, {"time": 8712, "text": "And then I take that and I start to eliminate, I draw lines between the common points of intersection."}, {"time": 8717, "text": "And then from that, I distill out an outline."}, {"time": 8721, "text": "And then I basically think about what I want to say on my walks with my dog."}, {"time": 8727, "text": "And I bother a couple of people and blab to them."}, {"time": 8729, "text": "So I would say each podcast, yeah, I put in 10 to 15 hours at least of passive listening preparation and maybe five or six of active preparation."}, {"time": 8738, "text": "So I do prepare quite a lot, but it has a certain reward component for me."}, {"time": 8744, "text": "To come up at the end with something that's somewhat crystallized for me is just so satisfying."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "It feel like there's something about my dopamine circuits that just love that."}, {"time": 8754, "text": "And the only pain is that a year later after I've talked about the stuff a bunch of times, it's so much more succinct, but that's life."}, {"time": 8764, "text": "At some point you got to pull the trigger."}, {"time": 8765, "text": "Well, I don't know what you think, but for me, YouTube is, that's why I'm sad that Joe left YouTube."}, {"time": 8773, "text": "There's a archival nature to YouTube that's kind of magical."}, {"time": 8776, "text": "And so I'm really glad you're now, you're doing a lot of educational content on Instagram and Instagram before, but now I'm doing this podcasting on YouTube."}, {"time": 8789, "text": "It's like, you know, it's like Feynman lectures."}, {"time": 8792, "text": "Like, I'm not saying every podcast, but there will be, you will have some, I could already tell there'll be some lectures which are like definitive, like really special ones."}, {"time": 8808, "text": "And there's some aspect that's archival to YouTube where at least I hope like 20 years from now, some kid is gonna watch a lecture of yours and it'll create the next Nobel prize, right?"}, {"time": 8822, "text": "It'll create another dream that then becomes a reality."}, {"time": 8828, "text": "And then that's a special thing that YouTube provides."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "So I'm really excited that you're on YouTube."}, {"time": 8834, "text": "And at the same time, I'm excited to see where this thing goes because it seems like change is the cliche thing, that change is the only constant in these times because you're paving with this podcast, with this creativity, what you were doing on Instagram as well, you're paving the new era of what it means to do science."}, {"time": 8857, "text": "So actively doing research and actively explaining that research in new media."}, {"time": 8862, "text": "It's very interesting to see."}, {"time": 8864, "text": "I'm genuinely inspired by you."}, {"time": 8867, "text": "We had this discussion last time after the podcast recording, and it's clear that communication of science cannot be left to the existing institutions."}, {"time": 8878, "text": "And I'm not talking about universities."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "I just mean that the science section of newspapers is, sometimes there's some gems there, but generally it goes, you know?"}, {"time": 8888, "text": "And I think you really have to know a field in order to extract the best things from that field."}, {"time": 8893, "text": "And my hope is that other practicing scientists and people finishing their PhD and postdoc and people who are running labs or working at companies will start to do this."}, {"time": 8902, "text": "I mean, how amazing would it be, for instance, if someone at Neuralink was giving us hints about not necessarily what they're developing because that's complicated for all sorts of reasons, but would talk to us about what the real challenges of building futuristic brain machine interface are like and what it means to understand a clinical problem and address it."}, {"time": 8927, "text": "I mean, my hope is somebody there might eventually do that, that somebody in the world of chemistry or synthetic materials or whatever it is will do this in a way that I could understand because I don't have expertise in those."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "I think it would be marvelous."}, {"time": 8942, "text": "And you were tip of the spear, you were out first, and I'm just happily trying to move along in the direction I'm going."}, {"time": 8950, "text": "But I think the future of science education is online."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "And I think that's gonna be scary to a lot of existing institutions, but it's not about disrupting anything."}, {"time": 8961, "text": "It's just about trying to do things better."}, {"time": 8963, "text": "Yeah, some of the best interviews, some of the best investigative journalism is done by people inside the field."}, {"time": 8973, "text": "Comes to mind a guy by the name of Elon Musk, who I love the possibility that he gets a Pulitzer for that interview."}, {"time": 8981, "text": "But he grilled the crap out of Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood."}, {"time": 8986, "text": "I'm not sure if you're familiar."}, {"time": 8987, "text": "Oh, on Clubhouse the other night."}, {"time": 8990, "text": "Yeah, I saw you guys in there."}, {"time": 8991, "text": "I was kept out, I wasn't quick enough."}, {"time": 8993, "text": "My thumbs don't go fast enough."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "So I was, and I wasn't about to sit in the waiting room."}, {"time": 8997, "text": "Have you tried that social network, by the way, the Clubhouse?"}, {"time": 8999, "text": "I've gone in there a few times and checked some things out."}, {"time": 9003, "text": "I'm there, I have a few questions about it that like if I'm in there, how one can participate or not participate."}, {"time": 9011, "text": "I like being a fly on the wall for those conversations."}, {"time": 9013, "text": "I've been very curious as to what's going on in there."}, {"time": 9015, "text": "Oh, it's quite, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts."}, {"time": 9018, "text": "Maybe it's useful to comment."}, {"time": 9020, "text": "I also have a Discord server that has a few tens of thousands of people on it."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "And then they have also a voice chat capability."}, {"time": 9031, "text": "So there's these get togethers."}, {"time": 9033, "text": "And I was using it in the spring and summer, like actively on those voice discussions."}, {"time": 9040, "text": "And it's anywhere from 10 to like 1,000 people all together in voice."}, {"time": 9046, "text": "Like anyone can speak anytime, right?"}, {"time": 9049, "text": "But there's this weird dynamic that people stay quiet."}, {"time": 9052, "text": "Only one person speaks at a time because they're all like respectful."}, {"time": 9055, "text": "And it's a community of like fundamentally respectful people, even though they're all anonymous."}, {"time": 9061, "text": "So like, except like me and a few others, it's all anonymous people."}, {"time": 9066, "text": "It's so interesting and it works."}, {"time": 9068, "text": "But the magical thing to me about that community was how intimate voice only communication can be."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "It felt as intimate as like a small get together at a home with close friends."}, {"time": 9087, "text": "It felt like there's a calmness to it."}, {"time": 9089, "text": "And you're revealing things about, you know, somebody suffering from depression or being suicidal."}, {"time": 9097, "text": "So those are the dark things or being super excited, getting a new girlfriend or boyfriend."}, {"time": 9102, "text": "Like just the depth of human experience shared on voice without video is, I was really surprised how intimate that is for human connection, especially in this time of COVID, it replaced that."}, {"time": 9114, "text": "So just to give you some context, there's something there."}, {"time": 9119, "text": "There's definitely something there."}, {"time": 9120, "text": "One thing that comes to mind is when like in Clubhouse, you have your little icon."}, {"time": 9124, "text": "So they don't actually, you don't see your face moving."}, {"time": 9126, "text": "I think when people see their own image, it puts them in a state of self consciousness that is eliminated by just having an icon or an avatar."}, {"time": 9135, "text": "So like Zoom is dreadful because if I'm not used to talking to people and seeing a little image of myself staring back at me in the mirror."}, {"time": 9144, "text": "And it's just, I know there are ways that you can adjust that, but it's really awful."}, {"time": 9149, "text": "And I think that when I get on Zooms now, I say hello and then I shut down the video component."}, {"time": 9154, "text": "And then I just talk in the end."}, {"time": 9155, "text": "I come back on just to show that still there, it's still me."}, {"time": 9158, "text": "But I think that voice only is really interesting."}, {"time": 9162, "text": "Eddie Chang would be an interesting person to talk to about this because he understands so much about how inflection communicates emotionality in deeper state."}, {"time": 9170, "text": "But there's a balance between, I think, just like you said, this is the privacy somehow allows for the intimacy."}, {"time": 9179, "text": "So like being able to, as opposed to putting on an act, which I realize we do when we're visually presenting ourselves in remote communication."}, {"time": 9188, "text": "But I think that there's so few places where people can actually communicate without the fear of penalty."}, {"time": 9195, "text": "That's woefully absent these days."}, {"time": 9199, "text": "And so maybe people are just relieved to be in a place where they feel like I can say what I want or not say anything and it's okay."}, {"time": 9206, "text": "And so Clubhouse, to answer your kind of question is, there was a big improvement to me over Discord, which is it has tiers, it has a stage where people, the person that created the room can invite people up that would like to speak potentially, have the opportunity to speak."}, {"time": 9223, "text": "And then there's a bigger audience that don't get a chance to speak unless they click raise their hand and they get called on."}, {"time": 9231, "text": "So there's like a tier system that allows for there to be a group of like five, 10, 20, 30 people talking and a lot larger amount in the audience, which in Discord was the problems that everybody could talk."}, {"time": 9246, "text": "And the other thing about Clubhouse is everybody is strongly encouraged to represent themselves."}, {"time": 9251, "text": "So you're using your real name, it's not anonymous."}, {"time": 9254, "text": "And how many people were in that GameStop discussion the other day?"}, {"time": 9258, "text": "They currently limit rooms to 5,000."}, {"time": 9263, "text": "So I'm sure maxed out at 5,000."}, {"time": 9265, "text": "There's a lot of overflow rooms."}, {"time": 9267, "text": "This is the cool thing about Clubhouse, really big people were on there all tuned in and having a conversation, having all from, all these different worlds being able to connect, even though without the niceties of like arranging the meeting, you could just show up and leave, which is really nice."}, {"time": 9285, "text": "But the reason for my lessons from Discord, I'm going to mostly stay away from Clubhouse."}, {"time": 9296, "text": "Or go in there under another name."}, {"time": 9300, "text": "I'll pretend I know the actual, your actual name."}, {"time": 9302, "text": "Yeah, it's, I've learned, it's quite addicting."}, {"time": 9306, "text": "It's a time sink."}, {"time": 9308, "text": "It's so, the intimacy of it is you find yourself wasting quite a bit of time on there."}, {"time": 9314, "text": "It pulls you in."}, {"time": 9316, "text": "They would in sort of going back to the podcast or earlier, we're talking about books or creating a technology."}, {"time": 9324, "text": "One thing that's absolutely clear is that anything that's easy to reproduce is probably not worth much effort and time."}, {"time": 9335, "text": "I mean, most posts could be easily reproduced."}, {"time": 9339, "text": "You just repost them."}, {"time": 9341, "text": "So now there are some original posts that for which the attribution goes to the original person and it's clear it came from you."}, {"time": 9348, "text": "But anything that can be easily reproduced is, doesn't really expand us very much as individuals or as groups."}, {"time": 9355, "text": "And most of what I see on social media is stuff that is purely reproduced."}, {"time": 9361, "text": "But I think Clubhouse, I mean, it could be that some real magic emerges on there."}, {"time": 9368, "text": "So in moderation could be good."}, {"time": 9370, "text": "The magic is, this is another thing that I've found through COVID that maybe you can think about is live."}, {"time": 9380, "text": "I used to be, not understand the appeal of live video or live connection or like in this Clubhouse live events."}, {"time": 9388, "text": "Because Clubhouse is technically, for the most part, it's not supposed to be recorded."}, {"time": 9394, "text": "Most people don't record most conversations."}, {"time": 9396, "text": "It's a one time live event."}, {"time": 9398, "text": "And there's a magic to that."}, {"time": 9401, "text": "That's not captured by like your podcast or my podcast produced video that's like recorded, like packaged up."}, {"time": 9410, "text": "Well, anything can happen."}, {"time": 9412, "text": "It's that anything can happen."}, {"time": 9414, "text": "And that's the kind of thing like live concerts."}, {"time": 9417, "text": "I definitely, I love live music."}, {"time": 9420, "text": "And it's the idea that, cause you can always listen to the album."}, {"time": 9423, "text": "Actually the album usually sounds cleaner and better, but it's just this idea that anything can happen."}, {"time": 9428, "text": "And then you listen to like the parts, I don't know, you like a Costello did something weird."}, {"time": 9433, "text": "Your dog did something weird."}, {"time": 9435, "text": "And then you have to go, God damn it."}, {"time": 9437, "text": "You have to go to the kitchen or something to get something."}, {"time": 9439, "text": "And then you come back and it's funny."}, {"time": 9442, "text": "I watched live video like that of people and I'll be there for the whole time."}, {"time": 9446, "text": "I'll wait for them to go to the kitchen and come back."}, {"time": 9448, "text": "It's not like I tune out."}, {"time": 9450, "text": "And that makes it like a richer experience for some reason."}, {"time": 9454, "text": "Well, it humanizes it."}, {"time": 9455, "text": "Yeah, humanizes it."}, {"time": 9456, "text": "And I think there is this weird effect of whether or not it's a podcast, Instagram or Twitter or anything else."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "There's kind of like two people shouting into a tunnel and then a bunch of people with ears at the other end of those tunnels and shouting some things back."}, {"time": 9469, "text": "You know, that's kind of the format we're in."}, {"time": 9472, "text": "I think I'll check out Clubhouse again."}, {"time": 9474, "text": "I've gone in there a few times during the day and I was surprised to see how many people were in there in the middle of the day."}, {"time": 9478, "text": "I was like, aren't these people supposed to be working?"}, {"time": 9481, "text": "But maybe that is their work."}, {"time": 9482, "text": "Well, be very careful about the time sink of it."}, {"time": 9487, "text": "But yeah, if you want to, you and I go together, we'll have a conversation on there."}, {"time": 9490, "text": "But one of the things you have to figure out, I don't still know how to do it, but how to exit."}, {"time": 9497, "text": "Which is like."}, {"time": 9498, "text": "And you just do the, isn't there the leave quietly button?"}, {"time": 9500, "text": "Yeah, no, but like when you and I are on stage having a conversation, okay, you and I is harder."}, {"time": 9507, "text": "But like you really, if it's just you and I, then it's the usual human communication of like, all right, I gotta go."}, {"time": 9515, "text": "Like, but when it's like four people, you don't want to interrupt everyone and announce you're leaving."}, {"time": 9521, "text": "You just have to, I mean, there's a weird dynamic that I haven't quite figured out of."}, {"time": 9525, "text": "The etiquette isn't clear."}, {"time": 9527, "text": "The etiquette is not clear."}, {"time": 9528, "text": "Well, the etiquette on different platforms and how that changes is really interesting."}, {"time": 9534, "text": "You know, how YouTube has one etiquette, which is kind of, it's a lot of harshness is tolerated on YouTube video comments."}, {"time": 9541, "text": "Twitter seems a bit harsher than Instagram."}, {"time": 9544, "text": "Instagram, there's kind of, it seems to be a little."}, {"time": 9545, "text": "People are nice."}, {"time": 9546, "text": "People are really nice."}, {"time": 9547, "text": "People are really nice on Instagram for the most part, except for those phishing things."}, {"time": 9553, "text": "I actually know someone who had their quite sizable account poached by those copyright."}, {"time": 9558, "text": "They come in with those like, you violated copyright thing."}, {"time": 9561, "text": "There's all sorts of harshness in there that if you think about it in the real world, I like to think about Instagram as if it was the real world."}, {"time": 9568, "text": "Someone comes over and is basically saying like, hey, can I hold your wallet and go into the bank and I'll get some money out for you?"}, {"time": 9573, "text": "And like, but there's this trust based on the format it comes in that it can almost get past your radar unless you're suspicious."}, {"time": 9580, "text": "If you took comments, like, you know, you're posting a lot of comments and you said, you just walk past 500 random people on the street and just listen to what they say, it's like, that's ridiculous."}, {"time": 9592, "text": "I don't have time for that."}, {"time": 9593, "text": "But the comments somehow take on this importance and this relevance."}, {"time": 9596, "text": "And you feel, we feel obligated to give them value, right?"}, {"time": 9600, "text": "And so the online communities, the rules really are different."}, {"time": 9606, "text": "And they evolve with time, which is fascinating."}, {"time": 9608, "text": "With Clubhouse, it's a new social network, so it's evolving and people are figuring it out as you go."}, {"time": 9613, "text": "And the same thing with podcasting on video and like scientific podcasting."}, {"time": 9618, "text": "This is the cool thing when I look at what you've created, I'm learning, I'm thinking like, hmm, that's interesting to do it this way."}, {"time": 9626, "text": "Because like, I have nobody to copy."}, {"time": 9629, "text": "Not many people to copy, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 9631, "text": "Well, you threw out an idea."}, {"time": 9632, "text": "I'm not gonna put it out here now, cause I don't wanna, cause knowing you, you'll hold yourself to it no matter what."}, {"time": 9638, "text": "But when we talked about this issue of the challenge of staying on a particular topic for a while, I mean, you do have some cool stuff brewing in there."}, {"time": 9646, "text": "Oh, no, no, no."}, {"time": 9647, "text": "That's separate from this format."}, {"time": 9648, "text": "And I love your interview format, but when you told me about that, I got really excited that you might go forward."}, {"time": 9654, "text": "I'm not gonna tell your audience what it is, but I will say this, it is super cool."}, {"time": 9658, "text": "I would have never thought about it."}, {"time": 9660, "text": "It's distinctly different than what I'm doing or what Lex is currently doing."}, {"time": 9663, "text": "And if you decide to do that podcast, I will be your first and your number one fan."}, {"time": 9669, "text": "And I know there are gonna be millions of other people interested in that."}, {"time": 9672, "text": "It would be amazing."}, {"time": 9673, "text": "So if you decide to go forward with the idea, that would be awesome."}, {"time": 9679, "text": "I was gonna say what it is, but now I'm not going to because, cause that's even more interesting."}, {"time": 9684, "text": "I brought up the clubhouse thing actually in Elon, because I just wanted to get your thoughts about something he's said a few times to me and in general, is that he's under a huge amount of stress."}, {"time": 9700, "text": "And I'm thinking of doing a startup now and kind of thinking about all of this."}, {"time": 9707, "text": "Cause I enjoy podcasts, I enjoy science, but he says that his life is basically hell."}, {"time": 9717, "text": "He looks happy, but he's probably very good at."}, {"time": 9719, "text": "He's fulfilled."}, {"time": 9721, "text": "He's fulfilled, but the stress levels, the constant fires that he has to put out."}, {"time": 9728, "text": "And he says that most people wouldn't want to be me."}, {"time": 9731, "text": "And that basically the reason he does what he does is because there's probably something wrong with him."}, {"time": 9739, "text": "Like it's not, he can't help it, but do that."}, {"time": 9744, "text": "Kind of beautiful in a kind of Russian masochistic way."}, {"time": 9749, "text": "Well, I just wonder the stress."}, {"time": 9751, "text": "I mean, I'm sure you can imagine the kind of stress he's under because, so it's running three plus companies and there's constant, he says that every single meeting is not about like, should we install a coffee maker in the kitchen?"}, {"time": 9771, "text": "It's like, this rocket is going to blow up and we're all fucked."}, {"time": 9779, "text": "And we have to, you have to fix, you have to fix real like big problems there."}, {"time": 9784, "text": "And like, how do you deal with that?"}, {"time": 9787, "text": "What do you think about that kind of life?"}, {"time": 9789, "text": "One, is there a way to walk through that fire?"}, {"time": 9793, "text": "And two, should you walk through that fire?"}, {"time": 9798, "text": "Well, I mean, without knowing I've never met Elon, but certainly we have common friends in you and in other people that he worked with long ago in the PayPal days, all of whom speak very highly of him and show, express immense admiration for the number of things that he can maintain."}, {"time": 9820, "text": "I think it's fair to say that he accomplishes more before 9 a.m. than most people do in a decade."}, {"time": 9828, "text": "It's clear."}, {"time": 9829, "text": "And that what he does would dissolve most people into a puddle of tears."}, {"time": 9833, "text": "Mostly because of this whole thing about the brain working hard equates to thinking about duration path and outcome and anticipating outcomes given A, B, C, or D, a lot of very scripted linear thinking and prediction."}, {"time": 9849, "text": "And that is hard, it's stressful."}, {"time": 9851, "text": "It requires intense neurochemical output."}, {"time": 9854, "text": "And he's doing that for multiple projects."}, {"time": 9856, "text": "So presumably he's buffered himself from the coffee maker issues and the little tiny issues, but he is himself, unless there's something I don't know, he's walking around in a biological system."}, {"time": 9867, "text": "Yes, allegedly, yes."}, {"time": 9870, "text": "So, and I don't wanna reveal too much here, but I have a common coworker and colleague through some contract work I do that what I can tell you is that he's accessing the best resources in terms of how to optimize his biology."}, {"time": 9888, "text": "And he's thinking about that, not just for himself, but for all of Neuralink."}, {"time": 9893, "text": "Because I think, I'm not trying to dodge the question, but I think there's the scale of the individual, but then there's the companies that he's creating."}, {"time": 9902, "text": "And you've got people there that you could imagine if they're working at 10% better capacity or can focus 5% better for 20% of the day, you're looking at a enormous increase in productivity and a reduction in the time to reach goals, which will reduce the amount of stress presumably on Elon, unless he goes and starts another endeavor."}, {"time": 9923, "text": "So I think it's certainly not healthy for most people."}, {"time": 9928, "text": "It seems to be where he gets his dopamine hits."}, {"time": 9931, "text": "I'm also really struck by the fact that he has a family and he's got kids growing up and a relationship and all that, so it's super impressive."}, {"time": 9940, "text": "I think that, I don't know, how old is Elon?"}, {"time": 9944, "text": "He's 40, I mean, pushing 50, I think 48."}, {"time": 9949, "text": "Even more impressive."}, {"time": 9951, "text": "Because many people who've been at exceedingly high output for a decade or more don't do well."}, {"time": 9958, "text": "Their system breaks down."}, {"time": 9960, "text": "Well, this is what he was saying."}, {"time": 9998, "text": "Like, it's like puzzles, it's constant puzzle solving."}, {"time": 10001, "text": "I would be concerned about taking somebody who's in that regime and suddenly putting them into a regime where they don't have enough to bite down into."}, {"time": 10008, "text": "It's like my bulldog, Costello, he's happiest when chewing and tugging at that big old neck of his, and he is just not going to become a retriever, he's not going to, he does well and gets his dopamine hits from chewing and pulling."}, {"time": 10020, "text": "And it seems like Elon has ended up where he is by way of his natural leanings."}, {"time": 10027, "text": "Unless there's a backstory that's trauma based or something, and I don't even begin to think that there is, it seems that he has, he's one of those rare individuals in history that has an immense drive to create in all these different domains."}, {"time": 10042, "text": "I'm just saying the obvious here, but it seems like that's what makes him tick."}, {"time": 10047, "text": "I mean, you're doing an awful lot too."}, {"time": 10049, "text": "Well, the problem is not really, the problem is I've been on the verge of pulling the trigger on starting a company, which will increase the workload significantly."}, {"time": 10063, "text": "And I'm attracted to that because of a dream I have, but it's a little bit scary because it can destroy you in a lot of ways."}, {"time": 10076, "text": "There's two sources of destruction."}, {"time": 10079, "text": "So one source is, I've, for the first time in my life, a few months ago, I think, have gotten, this feels like such a noob thing to say it, but I've gotten some hate on the internet."}, {"time": 10097, "text": "I know, right?"}, {"time": 10099, "text": "But like, I am such an idiot."}, {"time": 10100, "text": "I'm so naive to, it was, I had the question that I guess a lot of people have when they get hate on the internet."}, {"time": 10109, "text": "It's like, mom, why are these people making up stuff about me?"}, {"time": 10115, "text": "That kind of feeling of like, why are you saying that?"}, {"time": 10119, "text": "And the reason I mentioned that is like, well, if you wanna go and start a business and do, as I think people should when they start a big, ambitious business, really try to go big."}, {"time": 10134, "text": "Like, what does success look like in terms of your emotional journey?"}, {"time": 10140, "text": "You're going to have a lot of people who make up stuff about you, who say negative things."}, {"time": 10146, "text": "I mean, majority, hopefully, if you do a good job, will be supportive
