program that says, get an element of this array, look at something, make a decision, go get another element, it's kind of random."}, {"time": 275, "text": "And you can think, that's really unpredictable."}, {"time": 277, "text": "And then you make this big predictor that looks at this kind of pattern and you realize, well, if you get this data and this data, then you probably want that one."}, {"time": 284, "text": "And if you get this one and this one and this one, you probably want that one."}, {"time": 287, "text": "And is that theory or is that engineering?"}, {"time": 289, "text": "Like the paper that was written, was it asymptotic kind of discussion or is it more like, here's a hack that works well?"}, {"time": 297, "text": "It's a little bit of both."}, {"time": 299, "text": "Like there's information theory in it, I think somewhere."}, {"time": 301, "text": "Okay, so it's actually trying to prove some kind of stuff."}, {"time": 304, "text": "But once you know the method, implementing it is an engineering problem."}, {"time": 309, "text": "Now there's a flip side of this, which is in a big design team, what percentage of people think their plan or their life's work is engineering versus inventing things?"}, {"time": 323, "text": "So lots of companies will reward you for filing patents."}, {"time": 327, "text": "Some, many big companies get stuck because to get promoted, you have to come up with something new."}, {"time": 332, "text": "And then what happens is everybody's trying to do some random new thing, 99% of which doesn't matter."}, {"time": 339, "text": "And the basics get neglected."}, {"time": 341, "text": "Or there's a dichotomy, they think like the cell library and the basic CAD tools or basic software validation methods, that's simple stuff."}, {"time": 354, "text": "They wanna work on the exciting stuff."}, {"time": 356, "text": "And then they spend lots of time trying to figure out how to patent something."}, {"time": 360, "text": "And that's mostly useless."}, {"time": 362, "text": "But the breakthrough is on simple stuff."}, {"time": 364, "text": "No, no, you have to do the simple stuff really well."}, {"time": 368, "text": "If you're building a building out of bricks, you want great bricks."}, {"time": 373, "text": "So you go to two places that sell bricks."}, {"time": 374, "text": "So one guy says, yeah, they're over there in a ugly pile."}, {"time": 377, "text": "And the other guy is like lovingly tells you about the 50 kinds of bricks and how hard they are and how beautiful they are and how square they are."}, {"time": 386, "text": "Which one are you gonna buy bricks from?"}, {"time": 388, "text": "Which is gonna make a better house?"}, {"time": 390, "text": "So you're talking about the craftsman, the person who understands bricks, who loves bricks, who loves the varieties."}, {"time": 395, "text": "That's a good word."}, {"time": 396, "text": "Good engineering is great craftsmanship."}, {"time": 399, "text": "And when you start thinking engineering is about invention and you set up a system that rewards invention, the craftsmanship gets neglected."}, {"time": 410, "text": "Okay, so maybe one perspective is the theory, the science overemphasizes invention and engineering emphasizes craftsmanship."}, {"time": 420, "text": "And therefore, so it doesn't matter what you do, theory, engineering."}, {"time": 423, "text": "Well, everybody does."}, {"time": 425, "text": "Like read the tech ranks are always talking about some breakthrough or innovation and everybody thinks that's the most important thing."}, {"time": 432, "text": "But the number of innovative ideas is actually relatively low."}, {"time": 435, "text": "We need them, right?"}, {"time": 437, "text": "And innovation creates a whole new opportunity."}, {"time": 439, "text": "Like when some guy invented the internet, right?"}, {"time": 444, "text": "Like that was a big thing."}, {"time": 445, "text": "The million people that wrote software against that were mostly doing engineering software writing."}, {"time": 451, "text": "So the elaboration of that idea was huge."}, {"time": 454, "text": "I don't know if you know Brendan Eich, he wrote JavaScript in 10 days."}, {"time": 458, "text": "That's an interesting story."}, {"time": 459, "text": "It makes me wonder, and it was famously for many years considered to be a pretty crappy programming language."}, {"time": 467, "text": "Still is perhaps."}, {"time": 468, "text": "It's been improving sort of consistently."}, {"time": 471, "text": "But the interesting thing about that guy is, you know, he doesn't get any awards."}, {"time": 478, "text": "You don't get a Nobel Prize or a Fields Medal or."}, {"time": 481, "text": "For inventing a crappy piece of, you know, software code."}, {"time": 486, "text": "That is currently the number one programming language in the world and runs, now is increasingly running the backend of the internet."}, {"time": 493, "text": "Well, does he know why everybody uses it?"}, {"time": 497, "text": "Like that would be an interesting thing."}, {"time": 499, "text": "Was it the right thing at the right time?"}, {"time": 502, "text": "Cause like when stuff like JavaScript came out, like there was a move from, you know, writing C programs and C++ to what they call managed code frameworks, where you write simple code, it might be interpreted, it has lots of libraries, productivity is high, and you don't have to be an expert."}, {"time": 519, "text": "So, you know, Java was supposed to solve all the world's problems."}, {"time": 522, "text": "It was complicated."}, {"time": 523, "text": "JavaScript came out, you know, after a bunch of other scripting languages."}, {"time": 527, "text": "I'm not an expert on it."}, {"time": 529, "text": "But was it the right thing at the right time?"}, {"time": 531, "text": "Or was there something, you know, clever?"}, {"time": 534, "text": "Cause he wasn't the only one."}, {"time": 536, "text": "There's a few elements."}, {"time": 537, "text": "And maybe if he figured out what it was, then he'd get a prize."}, {"time": 542, "text": "Yeah, you know, maybe his problem is he hasn't defined this."}, {"time": 546, "text": "Or he just needs a good promoter."}, {"time": 549, "text": "Well, I think there was a bunch of blog posts written about it, which is like, wrong is right, which is like doing the crappy thing fast."}, {"time": 559, "text": "Just like hacking together the thing that answers some of the needs."}, {"time": 563, "text": "And then iterating over time, listening to developers."}, {"time": 566, "text": "Like listening to people who actually use the thing."}, {"time": 568, "text": "This is something you can do more in software."}, {"time": 571, "text": "But the right time, like you have to sense, you have to have a good instinct of when is the right time for the right tool."}, {"time": 577, "text": "And make it super simple."}, {"time": 580, "text": "And just get it out there."}, {"time": 582, "text": "The problem is, this is true with hardware."}, {"time": 585, "text": "This is less true with software."}, {"time": 586, "text": "Is there's backward compatibility that just drags behind you as, you know, as you try to fix all the mistakes of the past."}, {"time": 593, "text": "But the timing."}, {"time": 597, "text": "And it wasn't accidental."}, {"time": 598, "text": "You have to like give yourself over to the, you have to have this like broad sense of what's needed now."}, {"time": 607, "text": "Both scientifically and like the community."}, {"time": 610, "text": "And just like this, it was obvious that there was no, the interesting thing about JavaScript is everything that ran in the browser at the time, like Java and I think other like Scheme, other programming languages, they were all in a separate external container."}, {"time": 630, "text": "And then JavaScript was literally just injected into the webpage."}, {"time": 634, "text": "It was the dumbest possible thing running in the same thread as everything else."}, {"time": 639, "text": "And like it was inserted as a comment."}, {"time": 643, "text": "So JavaScript code is inserted as a comment in the HTML code."}, {"time": 647, "text": "And it was, I mean, there's, it's either genius or super dumb, but it's like."}, {"time": 653, "text": "Right, so it had no apparatus for like a virtual machine and container, it just executed in the framework of the program that's already running."}, {"time": 660, "text": "And then because something about that accessibility, the ease of its use resulted in then developers innovating of how to actually use it."}, {"time": 671, "text": "I mean, I don't even know what to make of that, but it does seem to echo across different software, like stories of different software."}, {"time": 679, "text": "PHP has the same story, really crappy language."}, {"time": 682, "text": "They just took over the world."}, {"time": 685, "text": "I always have a joke that the random length instructions, variable length instructions, that's always one, even though they're obviously worse."}, {"time": 693, "text": "Like nobody knows why."}, {"time": 694, "text": "X86 is arguably the worst architecture on the planet."}, {"time": 698, "text": "It's one of the most popular ones."}, {"time": 700, "text": "Well, I mean, isn't that also the story of risk versus, I mean, is that simplicity?"}, {"time": 706, "text": "There's something about simplicity that us in this evolutionary process is valued."}, {"time": 713, "text": "If it's simple, it spreads faster, it seems like."}, {"time": 718, "text": "Or is that not always true?"}, {"time": 719, "text": "Not always true."}, {"time": 721, "text": "Yeah, it could be simple is good, but too simple is bad."}, {"time": 724, "text": "So why did risk win, you think, so far?"}, {"time": 726, "text": "Did risk win?"}, {"time": 728, "text": "In the long archivist tree."}, {"time": 731, "text": "So who's gonna win?"}, {"time": 732, "text": "What's risk, what's CISC, and who's gonna win in that space in these instruction sets?"}, {"time": 737, "text": "AI software's gonna win, but there'll be little computers that run little programs like normal all over the place."}, {"time": 744, "text": "But we're going through another transformation, so."}, {"time": 748, "text": "But you think instruction sets underneath it all will change?"}, {"time": 752, "text": "Yeah, they evolve slowly."}, {"time": 753, "text": "They don't matter very much."}, {"time": 755, "text": "They don't matter very much, okay."}, {"time": 756, "text": "I mean, the limits of performance are predictability of instructions and data."}, {"time": 761, "text": "I mean, that's the big thing."}, {"time": 763, "text": "And then the usability of it is some quality of design, quality of tools, availability."}, {"time": 772, "text": "Like right now, x86 is proprietary with Intel and AMD, but they can change it any way they want independently."}, {"time": 779, "text": "ARM is proprietary to ARM, and they won't let anybody else change it."}, {"time": 783, "text": "So it's like a sole point."}, {"time": 785, "text": "And RISC 5 is open source, so anybody can change it, which is super cool."}, {"time": 790, "text": "But that also might mean it gets changed too many random ways that there's no common subset of it that people can use."}, {"time": 797, "text": "Do you like open or do you like closed?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "Like if you were to bet all your money on one or the other, RISC 5 versus it?"}, {"time": 804, "text": "It's case dependent?"}, {"time": 805, "text": "Well, x86, oddly enough, when Intel first started developing it, they licensed like seven people."}, {"time": 810, "text": "So it was the open architecture."}, {"time": 813, "text": "And then they moved faster than others and also bought one or two of them."}, {"time": 817, "text": "But there was seven different people making x86 because at the time there was 6502 and Z80s and 8086."}, {"time": 826, "text": "And you could argue everybody thought Z80 was the better instruction set, but that was proprietary to one place."}, {"time": 834, "text": "Oh, and the 6800."}, {"time": 836, "text": "So there's like four or five different microprocessors."}, {"time": 839, "text": "Intel went open, got the market share because people felt like they had multiple sources from it, and then over time it narrowed down to two players."}, {"time": 847, "text": "So why, you as a historian, why did Intel win for so long with their processors?"}, {"time": 858, "text": "They were great."}, {"time": 858, "text": "Their process development was great."}, {"time": 861, "text": "Oh, so it's just looking back to JavaScript and what I like is Microsoft and Netscape and all these internet browsers."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Microsoft won the browser game because they aggressively stole other people's ideas like right after they did it."}, {"time": 877, "text": "You know, I don't know if Intel was stealing other people's ideas."}, {"time": 881, "text": "They started making."}, {"time": 882, "text": "In a good way, stealing in a good way just to clarify."}, {"time": 883, "text": "They started making RAMs, random access memories."}, {"time": 888, "text": "And then at the time when the Japanese manufacturers came up, you know, they were getting out competed on that and they pivoted the microprocessors and they made the first, you know, integrated microprocessor grant programs."}, {"time": 899, "text": "It was the 4D04 or something."}, {"time": 903, "text": "Who was behind that pivot?"}, {"time": 904, "text": "That's a hell of a pivot."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Andy Grove and he was great."}, {"time": 910, "text": "And then they led semiconductor industry."}, {"time": 913, "text": "Like they were just a little company, IBM, all kinds of big companies had boatloads of money and they out innovated everybody."}, {"time": 921, "text": "Out innovated, okay."}, {"time": 923, "text": "So it's not like marketing, it's not any of that stuff."}, {"time": 926, "text": "Their processor designs were pretty good."}, {"time": 929, "text": "I think the, you know, Core 2 was probably the first one I thought was great."}, {"time": 936, "text": "It was a really fast processor and then Haswell was great."}, {"time": 940, "text": "What makes a great processor in that?"}, {"time": 942, "text": "Oh, if you just look at it, it's performance versus everybody else."}, {"time": 945, "text": "It's, you know, the size of it, the usability of it."}, {"time": 949, "text": "So it's not specific, some kind of element that makes you beautiful."}, {"time": 952, "text": "It's just like literally just raw performance."}, {"time": 955, "text": "Is that how you think about processors?"}, {"time": 957, "text": "It's just like raw performance?"}, {"time": 961, "text": "It's like a horse race."}, {"time": 962, "text": "The fastest one wins."}, {"time": 965, "text": "You don't care how."}, {"time": 965, "text": "Just as long as it wins."}, {"time": 968, "text": "Well, there's the fastest in the environment."}, {"time": 970, "text": "Like, you know, for years you made the fastest one you could and then people started to have power limits."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So then you made the fastest at the right PowerPoint."}, {"time": 977, "text": "And then when we started doing multi processors, like if you could scale your processors more than the other guy, you could be 10% faster on like a single thread, but you have more threads."}, {"time": 988, "text": "So there's lots of variability."}, {"time": 990, "text": "And then ARM really explored, like, you know, they have the A series and the R series and the M series, like a family of processors for all these different design points from like unbelievably small and simple."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "And so then when you're doing the design, it's sort of like this big pallet of CPUs."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "Like they're the only ones with a credible, you know, top to bottom pallet."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "What do you mean a credible top to bottom?"}, {"time": 1016, "text": "Well, there's people who make microcontrollers that are small, but they don't have a fast one."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "There's people who make fast processors, but don't have a medium one or a small one."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "Is that hard to do that full pallet?"}, {"time": 1027, "text": "That seems like a... Yeah, it's a lot of different."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "So what's the difference in the ARM folks and Intel in terms of the way they're approaching this problem?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "Well, Intel, almost all their processor designs were, you know, very custom high end, you know, for the last 15, 20 years."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "So the fastest horse possible."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "In one horse race."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "Yeah, and then architecturally they're really good, but the company itself was fairly insular to what's going on in the industry with CAD tools and stuff."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And there's this debate about custom design versus synthesis and how do you approach that?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "I'd say Intel was slow on getting to synthesize processors."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "ARM came in from the bottom and they generated IP, which went to all kinds of customers."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "So they had very little say on how the customer implemented their IP."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "So ARM is super friendly to the synthesis IP environment."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "Whereas Intel said, we're gonna make this great client chip or server chip with our own CAD tools, with our own process, with our own, you know, other supporting IP and everything only works with our stuff."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "So is that, is ARM winning the mobile platform space in terms of process?"}, {"time": 1098, "text": "And so in that, what you're describing is why they're winning."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Well, they had lots of people doing lots of different experiments."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "So they controlled the processor architecture and IP, but they let people put in lots of different chips."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And there was a lot of variability in what happened there."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Whereas Intel, when they made their mobile, their foray into mobile, they had one team doing one part, right?"}, {"time": 1121, "text": "So it wasn't 10 experiments."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "And then their mindset was PC mindset, Microsoft software mindset."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "And that brought a whole bunch of things along that the mobile world and the embedded world don't do."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "Do you think it was possible for Intel to pivot hard and win the mobile market?"}, {"time": 1138, "text": "That's a hell of a difficult thing to do, right?"}, {"time": 1140, "text": "For a huge company to just pivot."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "I mean, it's so interesting to, because we'll talk about your current work."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "It's like, it's clear that PCs were dominating for several decades, like desktop computers."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "And then mobile, it's unclear."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "It's a leadership question."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "Like Apple under Steve Jobs, when he came back, they pivoted multiple times."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "You know, they built iPads and iTunes and phones and tablets and great Macs."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Like who knew computers should be made out of aluminum?"}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Nobody knew that."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "But they're great."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "It's super fun."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "That was Steve?"}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Yeah, Steve Jobs."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Like they pivoted multiple times."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "And you know, the old Intel, they did that multiple times."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "They made DRAMs and processors and processes and I gotta ask this, what was it like working with Steve Jobs?"}, {"time": 1193, "text": "I didn't work with him."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "Did you interact with him?"}, {"time": 1195, "text": "Twice."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "I said hi to him twice in the cafeteria."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "What did he say?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "Hi?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "He said, hey fellas."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "He was friendly."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "He was wandering around and with somebody, he couldn't find a table because the cafeteria was packed and I gave him my table."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "So many times I'd be sitting with Mike and the phone would ring and it'd be Steve and Mike would hold the phone like this because Steve would be yelling about something or other."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And then he would translate."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "And he'd translate and then he would say, Steve wants us to do this."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "Was Steve a good engineer or no?"}, {"time": 1262, "text": "He was a great idea guy."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "Idea person."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And he's a really good selector for talent."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "Yeah, that seems to be one of the key elements of leadership, right?"}, {"time": 1270, "text": "And then he was a really good first principles guy."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "Like somebody would say something couldn't be done and he would just think, that's obviously wrong, right?"}, {"time": 1280, "text": "But you know, maybe it's hard to do."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "Maybe it's expensive to do."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "Maybe we need different people."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "You know, there's like a whole bunch of, if you want to do something hard, you know, maybe it takes time."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "Maybe you have to iterate."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "There's a whole bunch of things you could think about but saying it can't be done is stupid."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "How would you compare?"}, {"time": 1298, "text": "So it seems like Elon Musk is more engineering centric but is also, I think he considers himself a designer too."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "He has a design mind."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "Steve Jobs feels like he's much more idea space, design space versus engineering."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "Just make it happen."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Like the world should be this way."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Just figure it out."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "But he used computers."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "You know, he had computer people talk to him all the time."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "Like Mike was a really good computer guy."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "He knew computers could do."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "Computer meaning computer hardware?"}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Like hardware, software, all the pieces."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "And then he would have an idea about what could we do with this next."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "That was grounded in reality."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "It wasn't like he was just finger painting on the wall and wishing somebody would interpret it."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "So he had this interesting connection because he wasn't a computer architect or designer but he had an intuition from the computers we had to what could happen."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "And it's interesting you say intuition because it seems like he was pissing off a lot of engineers in his intuition about what can and can't be done."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "Those, like the, what is all these stories about like floppy disks and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "Yeah, so in Steve, the first round, like he'd go into a lab and look at what's going on and hate it and fire people or ask somebody in the elevator what they're doing for Apple."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "And not be happy."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "When he came back, my impression was is he surrounded himself with a relatively small group of people and didn't really interact outside of that as much."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "And then the joke was you'd see like somebody moving a prototype through the quad with a black blanket over it."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "And that was because it was secret, partly from Steve because they didn't want Steve to see it until it was ready."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Yeah, the dynamic with Johnny Ive and Steve is interesting."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "It's like you don't wanna, he ruins as many ideas as he generates."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "It's a dangerous kind of line to walk."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "If you have a lot of ideas, like Gordon Bell was famous for ideas, right?"}, {"time": 1427, "text": "And it wasn't that the percentage of good ideas was way higher than anybody else."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "It was, he had so many ideas and he was also good at talking to people about it and getting the filters right."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "And seeing through stuff."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "Whereas Elon was like, hey, I wanna build rockets."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "So Steve would hire a bunch of

like that."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And so if you just walk into a room and say, guys, love what you're doing, but I need you to have less order."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "If you don't have some

get stuff done, you need people who can manage stuff and manage people, because humans are complicated."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "They need lots of care and feeding that you need to tell them they

design worked."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "Because if you don't understand it properly, when you start to draw it, you'll fill up half the whiteboard with like a little piece of it and like your

you have two different ideas that you can't do both, right?"}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And, but the fact that you wanna do both causes you to go try to solve that problem."}, {"time": 1889, "text":

ideas."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "Over filters?"}, {"time": 1944, "text": "He'd start thinking about something and as soon as he figured out what was wrong with it, he'd throw it out."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "And then I start thinking about it and you come up with an idea and then you find out what's wrong with it."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "And then you give it a little time to set because sometimes you figure out how to tweak it or maybe that idea helps some other idea."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "So idea generation is really funny."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "So you have to give your ideas space."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "Like spaciousness of mind is key."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "But you also have to execute programs and get shit done."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "And then it turns out computer engineering is fun because it takes 100 people to build a computer, 200 or 300, whatever the number is."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "And people are so variable about temperament and skill sets and stuff."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "That in a big organization, you find the people who love the perfect ideas and the people that want to get stuffed on yesterday and people like to come up with ideas and people like to, let's say shoot down ideas."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "And it takes the whole, it takes a large group of people."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "Some are good at generating ideas, some are good at filtering ideas."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "And then all in that giant mess, you're somehow, I guess the goal is for that giant mess of people to find the perfect path through the tension, the creative tension."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "But like, how do you know when you said there's some people good at articulating what perfect looks like, what a good design is?"}, {"time": 2024, "text": "Like if you're sitting in a room and you have a set of ideas about like how to design a better processor, how do you know this is something special here?"}, {"time":

kind of go into it and you don't quite understand it and you're working on it."}, {"time": 2049, "text": "And then you start talking about it, putting it on the whiteboard, maybe it takes days or weeks."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "And then your brain starts to kind of synchronize."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "Like you start to see what each other is thinking."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "And it starts to work."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "Like you can see work."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "Like my talent in computer design is I can see how computers work in my head, like really well."}, {"time":

drifted along in the direction that was useless."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "That happens too."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "Like you have to, because the nice thing about computer design is always reduction in practice."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "Like you come up with your good ideas and I know some architects who really love ideas and then they work on them and they put it on the shelf and they go work on the next idea and put it on the shelf and they never reduce it to practice."}, {"time": 2116, "text": "So they find out what's good and bad."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "Because almost

problems?"}, {"time": 2156, "text": "Oh, when I look back?"}, {"time": 2158, "text": "What do you remember?"}, {"time": 2158, "text": "I think earlier in my career, like EV5 was the second alpha chip."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "I was so embarrassed about the mistakes, I could barely talk about it."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "And it was in the Guinness Book of World Records and it was the

lot."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "That EV6 also had some really cool things in it."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "I think the proportion of good stuff went up, but it had a couple of fatal flaws in it that

beautifully done."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "Is there something that pops to mind?"}, {"time": 2264, "text": "Well, when things are beautifully done, usually there's a well thought out set of

can't be bigger than the person doing it."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "It's just, you know, their piece of it."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "Like the odds of you doing a really beautiful design of something that's way too hard for you is low, right?"}, {"time": 2386, "text": "If it's way too simple for you, it's not that interesting."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "It's like, well, anybody could do that."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "But when you get the right match of your expertise and, you know, mental power to the right design size, that's cool, but that's not big enough to make a meaningful

dozen innovations."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "But as they scaled up the number of computers on that, it kept breaking, finding new bottlenecks in their software and their schedulers, and made them

interesting."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "So up until recently, I thought there was two kinds of computers."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "There are serial computers that run like C programs, and then there's parallel computers."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "So the way I think about it is, you know, parallel computers have given parallelism."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "Like, GPUs are great because you have a million pixels, and modern GPUs run a program on every pixel."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "They call it the shader program, right?"}, {"time": 3039, "text": "So, or like finite element analysis."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "You build something, you know, you make this into little tiny chunks, you give each chunk to a computer, so you're given all these chunks, you have parallelism like that."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "But most C programs, you write this linear narrative, and you have to make it go fast."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "To make it go fast, you predict all the branches, all the data fetches, and you run that."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "More parallel, but that's found parallelism."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "AI is, I'm still trying to decide how fundamental this is."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "It's a given parallelism problem."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "But the way people describe the neural networks, and then how they write them in PyTorch, it makes graphs."}, {"time": 3077, "text": "Yeah, that might be fundamentally different than the GPU kind of."}, {"time": 3081, "text": "Parallelism, yeah, it might be."}, {"time": 3083, "text": "Because when you run the GPU program on all the pixels, you're running, you know, it depends, this group of pixels say it's background blue, and it runs a really simple program."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "This pixel is, you know, some patch of your face, so you have some really interesting shader program to give you the impression of translucency."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "But the pixels themselves don't talk to each other."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "There's no graph, right?"}, {"time": 3106, "text": "So you do the image, and then you do the next image, and you do the next image, and you run eight million pixels, eight million programs every time, and modern GPUs have like 6,000 thread engines in them."}, {"time": 3119, "text": "So, you know, to get eight million pixels, each one runs a program on, you know, 10 or 20 pixels."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "And that's how they work, but there's no graph."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "But you think graph might be a totally new way to think about hardware."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "So Rajagat Dori and I have been having this conversation about given versus found parallelism."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "And then the kind of walk, because we got more transistors, like, you know, computers way back when did stuff on scalar data."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "Now we did it on vector data, famous vector machines."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "Now we're making computers that operate on matrices, right?"}, {"time": 3154, "text": "And then the category we said that was next was spatial."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "Like, imagine you have so much data that, you know, you want to do the compute on this data, and then when it's done, it says, send the result to this pile of data on some software on that."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "And it's better to think about it spatially than to move all the data to a central processor and do all the work."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "So spatially, you mean moving in the space of data as opposed to moving the data."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "Yeah, you have a petabyte data space spread across some huge array of computers."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "And when you do a computation somewhere, you send the result of that computation or maybe a pointer to the next program to some other piece of data and do it."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "But I think a better word might be graph."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "And all the AI neural networks are graphs."}, {"time": 3201, "text": "Do some computations, send the result here, do another computation, do a data transformation, do a merging, do a pooling, do another computation."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "Is it possible to compress and say how we make this thing efficient, this whole process efficient, this different?"}, {"time": 3217, "text": "So first, the fundamental elements in the graphs are things like matrix multiplies, convolutions, data manipulations, and data movements."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "So GPUs emulate those things with their little singles, you know, basically running a single threaded program."}, {"time": 3233, "text": "And then there's, you know, and NVIDIA calls it a warp where they group a bunch of programs that are similar together."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "So for efficiency and instruction use."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "And then at a higher level, you kind of, you take this graph and you say this part of the graph is a matrix multiplier, which runs on these 32 threads."}, {"time": 3249, "text": "But the model at the bottom was built for running programs on pixels, not executing graphs."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "So it's emulation, ultimately."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "So is it possible to build something that natively runs graphs?"}, {"time": 3263, "text": "Yes, so that's what 10storrent did."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "Where are we on that?"}, {"time": 3268, "text": "How, like, in the history of that effort, are we in the early days?"}, {"time": 3273, "text": "10storrent started by a friend of mine, Labisha Bajek, and I was his first investor."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "So I've been, you know, kind of following him and talking to him about it for years."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "And in the fall when I was considering things to do, I decided, you know, we held a conference last year with a friend, organized it, and we wanted to bring in thinkers."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "And two of the people were Andre Carpassi and Chris Ladner."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "And Andre gave this talk, it's on YouTube, called Software 2.0, which I think is great."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "Which is, we went from programmed computers, where you write programs, to data program computers."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "You know, like the future of software is data programs, the networks."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "And I think that's true."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "And then Chris has been working, he worked on LLVM, the low level virtual machine, which became the intermediate representation for all compilers."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "And now he's working on another project called MLIR, which is mid level intermediate representation, which is essentially under the graph about how do you represent that kind of computation and then coordinate large numbers of potentially heterogeneous computers."}, {"time": 3347, "text": "And I would say technically, Tens Torrents, you know, two pillars of those two ideas, software 2.0 and mid level representation."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "But it's in service of executing graph programs."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "The hardware is designed to do that."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "So it's including the hardware piece."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "And then the other cool thing is, for a relatively small amount of money, they did a test chip and two production chips."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "So it's like a super effective team."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "And unlike some AI startups, where if you don't build the hardware to run the software that they really want to do, then you have to fix it by writing lots more software."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "So the hardware naturally does matrix multiply, convolution, the data manipulations, and the data movement between processing elements that you can see in the graph, which I think is all pretty clever."}, {"time": 3400, "text": "And that's what I'm working on now."}, {"time": 3405, "text": "So the, I think it's called the Grace Call Processor."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "I introduced last year."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "It's, you know, there's a bunch of measures of performance."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "We're talking about horses."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "It seems to outperform 368 trillion operations per second."}, {"time": 3419, "text": "It seems to outperform NVIDIA's Tesla T4 system."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "So these are just numbers."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "What do they actually mean in real world performance?"}, {"time": 3427, "text": "Like what are the metrics for you that you're chasing in your horse race?"}, {"time": 3432, "text": "Like what do you care about?"}, {"time": 3433, "text": "Well, first, so the native language of, you know, people who write AI network programs is PyTorch now, PyTorch, TensorFlow."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "There's a couple others."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "Do you think PyTorch is one over TensorFlow?"}, {"time": 3446, "text": "I'm not an expert on that."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "I know many people who have switched from TensorFlow to PyTorch."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "And there's technical reasons for it."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "I use both."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "Both are still awesome."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "But the deepest love is for PyTorch currently."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "Yeah, there's more love for that."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "And that may change."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "So the first thing is when they write their programs, can the hardware execute it pretty much as it was written?"}, {"time": 3470, "text": "Right, so PyTorch turns into a graph."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "We have a graph compiler that makes that graph."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "Then it fractions the graph down."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "So if you have big matrix multiply, we turn it into right size chunks to run on the processing elements."}, {"time": 3482, "text": "It hooks all the graph up."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "It lays out all the data."}, {"time": 3485, "text": "There's a couple of mid level representations of it that are also simulatable."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "So that if you're writing the code, you can see how it's gonna go through the machine, which is pretty cool."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "And then at the bottom, it schedules kernels, like math, data manipulation, data movement kernels, which do this stuff."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "So we don't have to write a little program to do matrix multiply, because we have a big matrix multiplier."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "There's no SIMD program for that."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "But there is scheduling for that, right?"}, {"time": 3516, "text": "So one of the goals is, if you write a piece of PyTorch code that looks pretty reasonable, you should be able to compile it, run it on the hardware without having to tweak it and do all kinds of crazy things to get performance."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "There's not a lot of intermediate steps."}, {"time": 3530, "text": "It's running directly as written."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "Like on a GPU, if you write a large matrix multiply naively, you'll get five to 10% of the peak performance of the GPU."}, {"time": 3538, "text": "Right, and then there's a bunch of people who've published papers on this, and I read them about what steps do you have to do."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "And it goes from pretty reasonable, well, transpose one of the matrices."}, {"time": 3548, "text": "So you do row ordered, not column ordered, block it so that you can put a block of the matrix on different SMs, groups of threads."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "But some of it gets into little details, like you have to schedule it just so, so you don't have register conflicts."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "So they call them CUDA ninjas."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "CUDA ninjas, I love it."}, {"time": 3571, "text": "To get to the optimal point, you either use a prewritten library, which is a good strategy for some things, or you have to be an expert in micro architecture to program it."}, {"time": 3582, "text": "Right, so the optimization step is way more complicated with the GPU."}, {"time": 3584, "text": "So our goal is if you write PyTorch, that's good PyTorch, you can do it."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "Now there's, as the networks are evolving, they've changed from convolutional to matrix multiply."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "People are talking about conditional graphs, they're talking about very large matrices, they're talking about sparsity, they're talking about problems that scale across many, many chips."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "So the native data item is a packet."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "So you send a packet to a processor, it gets processed, it does a bunch of work, and then it may send packets to other processors, and they execute in like a data flow graph kind of methodology."}, {"time": 3622, "text": "We have a big network on chip, and then the second chip has 16 ethernet ports to hook lots of them together, and it's the same graph compiler across multiple chips."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "So that's where the scale comes in."}, {"time": 3633, "text": "So it's built to scale naturally."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "Now, my experience with scaling is as you scale, you run into lots of interesting problems."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "So scaling is the mountain to climb."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "So the hardware is built to do this, and then we're in the process of."}, {"time": 3647, "text": "Is there a software part to this with ethernet and all that?"}, {"time": 3651, "text": "Well, the protocol at the bottom, we sent, it's an ethernet PHY, but the protocol basically says, send the packet from here to there."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "It's all point to point."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "The header bit says which processor to send it to, and we basically take a packet off our on chip network, put an ethernet header on it, send it to the other end to strip the header off, and send it to the local thing."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "It's pretty straightforward."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "Human to human interaction is pretty straightforward too, but when you get a million of us, we could do some crazy stuff together."}, {"time": 3681, "text": "Yeah, it's gonna be fun."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "So is that the goal is scale?"}, {"time": 3685, "text": "So like, for example, I've been recently doing a bunch of robots at home for my own personal pleasure."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "Am I going to ever use 10th Story, or is this more for?"}, {"time": 3695, "text": "There's all kinds of problems."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "Like, there's small inference problems, or small training problems, or big training problems."}, {"time": 3701, "text": "What's the big goal?"}, {"time": 3702, "text": "Is it the big training problems, or the small training problems?"}, {"time": 3706, "text": "Well, one of the goals is to scale from 100 milliwatts to a megawatt, you know?"}, {"time": 3711, "text": "So like, really have some range on the problems, and the same kind of AI programs work at all different levels."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "So that's the goal."}, {"time": 3720, "text": "The natural, since the natural data item is a packet that we can move around, it's built to scale, but so many people have small problems."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "But the, you know."}, {"time": 3733, "text": "Like, inside that phone is a small problem to solve."}, {"time": 3736, "text": "So do you see 10th Story potentially being inside a phone?"}, {"time": 3739, "text": "Well, the power efficiency of local memory, local computation, and the way we built it is pretty good."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "And then there's a lot of efficiency on being able to do conditional graphs and sparsity."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "I think it's, for complicated networks that wanna go in a small factor, it's gonna be quite good."}, {"time": 3758, "text": "But we have to prove that, that's all."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "It's a fun problem."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "And that's the early days of the company, right?"}, {"time": 3762, "text": "It's a couple years, you said?"}, {"time": 3764, "text": "But you think, you invested, you think they're legit."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "And so you joined."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "Yeah, I joined."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "That's a really

people want."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "But that's more on an incremental path than what's gonna happen in AI in the next 10 years."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "So this is kind of, you know, an exciting place to be part of."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "Yeah, the revolutions will be happening in the very space that Tesla is."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "And then lots of people are working on it, but there's lots of technical reasons why some of them, you know, aren't gonna work out that well."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "And, you know, that's interesting."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "And there's also the same problem about getting the basics right."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "Like, we've talked to customers about exciting features."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "And at some point we realized that, Labish and I were realizing they want to hear first about memory bandwidth, local bandwidth, compute intensity, programmability."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "They want to know the basics, power management, how the network ports work, what are the basics, do all the basics work."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "Because it's easy to say, we've got this great idea, you know, the crack GPT3, but the people we talked to want to say, if I buy the, so we have a PCI Express card with our chip on it, if you buy the card, you plug it in your machine to download the driver, how long does it take me to get my network to run?"}, {"time": 3845, "text": "You know, that's a real question."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "It's a very basic question."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "Is there an answer to that yet, or

3887, "text": "They educate large numbers of people, and they've created platforms for other people to go do their stuff on."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "Yeah, the clear thinking that's able to be communicated is kind of impressive."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "It's kind of remarkable to, yeah, I'm a fan."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "Well, let me ask, because I talk to Chris actually a lot these days."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "He's been one of the, just to give him a shout out, he's been so supportive as a human being."}, {"time": 3913, "text": "So everybody's quite different."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "Like great engineers are different, but he's been like sensitive to the human element in a way that's been fascinating."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "Like he was one of the early people on

it, let's see what turns out."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "That's a pretty powerful thing."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "But what do you, what's your sense about, he used to be, no, I think stepped away from Google, right?"}, {"time": 3958, "text": "He's at SciFive, I think."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "What's really impressive to you about the things that Chris has worked on?"}, {"time": 3965, "text":

the programming language side."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "Talking about people that work in the entirety of the stack."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "What, from your time interacting with Chris and knowing the guy, what's really impressive to you that just inspires you?"}, {"time": 3992, "text": "Well, like LLVM became the defacto platform for the defacto platform for compilers."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "And it was good code quality, good design choices."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "He hit the right level of abstraction."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "There's a little bit of the right time, the right place."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "And then he built a new programming language called Swift, which after, let's say some adoption resistance became very successful."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "I don't know that much about his work at Google, although I know that that was a typical, they started TensorFlow stuff and it was new."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "They wrote a lot of code and then at some point it needed to be refactored to be, because its development slowed down, why PyTorch started a little later and then passed it."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "So he did a lot of work on that."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "And then his idea about MLIR, which is what people started to realize is the complexity of the software stack above the low level IR was getting so high that forcing the features of that into the level was putting too much of a burden on it."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "So he's splitting that into multiple pieces."}, {"time": 4061, "text": "And that was one of the inspirations for our software stack where we have several intermediate representations that are all executable and you can look at them and do transformations on them before you lower the level."},

{"time": 4084, "text": "That's his like little baby."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "So he, and there seems to be some profound ideas on that that are really useful."}, {"time": 4091, "text": "So each one of those things has been, as the world of software gets more and more complicated, how do we create the right abstraction levels to simplify it in a way that people can now work independently on different levels of it?"}, {"time": 4105, "text": "So I would say all three of those projects, LLVM, Swift, and MLIR did that successfully."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "So I'm interested in what he's gonna do next in the same kind of way."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "On either the TPU or maybe the Nvidia GPU side, how does 10th Story think, or the ideas underlying it, does it have to be 10th

NVIDIA?"}, {"time": 4143, "text": "What's that process look like?"}, {"time": 4145, "text": "What's that journey look like, you think?"}, {"time": 4148, "text": "Well, GPUs were built to run shader programs on millions of pixels, not to run graphs."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "So there's a hypothesis that says the way the graphs are built is going to be really interesting to be inefficient on computing this."}, {"time": 4164, "text": "And then the primitives is not a SIMD program, it's matrix multiply convolution."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And then the data manipulations are fairly extensive about, like, how do you do a fast transpose with a program?"}, {"time": 4176, "text": "I don't know if you've ever written a transpose program."}, {"time": 4178, "text": "They're ugly and slow, but in hardware, you can do really well."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "Like, I'll give you an example."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "So when GPU accelerators first started doing triangles, like, so you have a triangle which maps on a set of pixels."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "So you build, it's very easy, straightforward to build a hardware engine that'll find all those pixels."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "And it's kind of weird because you walk along the triangle to get to the edge, and then you have to go back down to the next row and walk along, and then you have to decide on the edge if the line of the triangle is like half on the pixel, what's the pixel color?"}, {"time": 4209, "text": "Because it's half of this pixel and half the next one."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "That's called rasterization."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "And you're saying that could be done in hardware?"}, {"time": 4215, "text": "No, that's an example of that operation as a software program is really bad."},

faster."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "Right, so there are certain times when the abstraction you have, rasterize a triangle, you know, execute a graph, you know, components of a graph."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "But the right thing to do in the hardware software boundary is for the hardware to naturally do it."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "And so the GPU is really optimized for the rasterization of triangles."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "Well, you know, that's just, well, like in a modern, you know, that's a small piece of modern GPUs."}, {"time": 4256, "text": "What they did is that they still rasterize triangles when you're running in a game, but for the most part, most of the computation in the area of the GPU is running shader programs."}, {"time": 4265, "text": "But they're single threaded programs on pixels, not graphs."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "I have to be honest, I'd say I don't actually know the math behind shader, shading and lighting and all that kind of stuff."},

instructions in a shader program."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "But I don't have a good intuition why it could be parallelized so easily."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "No, it's because you have 8 million pixels in every single."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "So when you have a light, right, that comes down, the angle, you know, the amount of light, like say this is a line of pixels across this table, right?"}, {"time": 4300, "text": "The amount of light on each pixel is subtly different."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "And each pixel is responsible for figuring out what."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "Figuring it out."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "So that pixel says, I'm this pixel."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "I know the angle of the light."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "I know the occlusion."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "I know the color I am."}, {"time": 4312, "text": "Like every single pixel here is a different color."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "Every single pixel gets a different amount of light."},

"text": "So you build a reflection map, which also has some pixelated thing."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "And then when the pixel is looking at the reflection map, it has to calculate what the normal of the surface is."}, {"time": 4339, "text": "And it does it per pixel."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "By the way, there's boatloads of hacks on that."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "You know, like you may have a lower resolution light map, your reflection map."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "There's all these, you know, tax they do."}, {"time": 4349, "text": "But at the end of the day, it's per pixel computation."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "And it's so happening that you can map graph like computation onto this pixel central computation."}, {"time": 4359, "text": "You can do floating point programs

Yeah, it was a CV problem."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "And did classic CV and found stoplights and lines."}, {"time": 4529, "text": "And they were really good at it."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "Yeah, and they never, I mean, I don't know what's happening now, but they never fully pivoted."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "I mean, it's like, it's the Nvidia thing."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "And then as opposed to, so if you look at the new Tesla work, it's like neural networks from the ground up, right?"}, {"time": 4545, "text": "Yeah, and even Tesla started with a lot of CV stuff in it and Andrei's basically been eliminating it."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "Move everything into the network."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "So without, this isn't like confidential stuff, but you sitting on a porch, looking over the world, looking at the work that Andrei's doing, that Elon's doing with Tesla Autopilot, do you like the trajectory of where things are going on the hardware side?"}, {"time": 4569,

taking longer than anybody thought."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "You know, my wonder is, you know, hardware three, is it enough computing off by two, off by five, off by 10, off by a hundred?"},

better."}, {"time": 4615, "text": "And then there's this interesting thing is you sort of train and build an arbitrary size network that solves the problem."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "And then you refactor the network down to the thing that you can afford to ship, right?"}, {"time": 4626, "text": "So the goal isn't to build a network that fits in the phone."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "It's to build something that actually works."}, {"time": 4634, "text": "And then how do you make that most effective on the hardware you have?"}, {"time": 4639, "text": "And they seem to be doing that much better than a couple of years ago."}, {"time": 4643, "text": "Well, the one really important thing is also what they're doing well is how to iterate that quickly, which means like it's not just about one time deployment, one building, it's constantly iterating the network and trying to automate as many steps as possible, right?"}, {"time": 4657, "text": "And that's actually the principles of the Software 2.0, like you mentioned with Andre is it's not just, I mean, I don't know what the actual, his description of Software 2.0 is."}, {"time": 4670, "text": "If it's just high level philosophical or their specifics, but the interesting thing about what that actually looks in the real world is it's that what I think Andre calls the data engine, it's like it's the iterative improvement of the thing."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "You have a neural network that does stuff, fails on a bunch of things and learns from it over and over and over."}, {"time": 4693, "text": "So you're constantly discovering edge cases."}, {"time": 4695, "text": "So it's very much about like data engineering, like figuring out, it's kind of what you were talking about with TestTorrent is you have the data landscape."}, {"time": 4705, "text": "And you have to walk along that data landscape in a way that is constantly improving the neural network."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "And that feels like that's the central piece of it."}, {"time": 4715, "text": "And there's two pieces of it."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "Like you find edge cases that don't work and then you define something that goes, get your data for that."}, {"time": 4724, "text": "But then the other constraint is whether you have to label it or not."}, {"time": 4726, "text": "Like the amazing thing about like the GPT3 stuff is it's unsupervised."}, {"time": 4731, "text": "So there's essentially infinite amount of data."}, {"time": 4733, "text": "Now there's obviously infinite amount of data available from cars of people successfully driving."}, {"time": 4739, "text": "But the current pipelines are mostly running on labeled data, which is human limited."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "So when that becomes unsupervised, it'll create unlimited amount of data, which then they'll scale."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "Now the networks that may use that data might be way too big for cars, but then there'll be the transformation from now we have unlimited data, I know exactly what I want."}, {"time": 4762, "text": "Now can I turn that into something that fits in the car?"}, {"time": 4765, "text": "And that process is gonna happen all over the place."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "Every time you get to the place where you have unlimited data, and that's what software 2.0 is about, unlimited data training networks to do stuff without humans writing code to do it."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "And ultimately also trying to discover, like you're saying, the self supervised formulation of the problem."}, {"time": 4787, "text": "So the unsupervised formulation of the problem."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "Like in driving, there's this really interesting thing, which is you look at a scene that's before you, and you have data about what a successful human driver did in that scene one second later."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "It's a little piece of data that you can use just like with GPT3 as training."}, {"time": 4809, "text": "Currently, even though Tesla says they're using that, it's an open question to me, how far can you, can you solve all of the driving with just that self supervised piece of data?"}, {"time": 4820, "text": "And like, I think."}, {"time": 4823, "text": "Well, that's what Common AI is doing."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "That's what Common AI is doing, but the question is how much data."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "So what Common AI doesn't have is as good of a data engine, for example, as Tesla does."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "That's where the, like the organization of the data."}, {"time": 4839, "text": "I mean, as far as I know, I haven't talked to George, but they do have the data."}, {"time": 4844, "text": "The question is how much data is needed, because we say infinite very loosely here."}, {"time": 4851, "text": "And then the other question, which you said, I don't know if you think it's still an open question is, are we on the right order of magnitude for the compute necessary?"}, {"time": 4862, "text": "That is this, is it like what Elon said, this chip that's in there now is enough to do full self driving, or do we need another order of magnitude?"}, {"time": 4870, "text": "I think nobody actually knows the answer to that question."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "I like the confidence that Elon has, but."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "Yeah, we'll see."}, {"time": 4877, "text": "There's another funny thing is you don't learn to drive with infinite amounts of data."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "You learn to drive with an intellectual framework that understands physics and color and horizontal surfaces and laws and roads and all your experience from manipulating your environment."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "Like, look, there's so many factors go into that."}, {"time": 4899, "text": "So then when you learn to drive, like driving is a subset of this conceptual framework that you have, right?"}, {"time": 4906, "text": "And so with self driving cars right now, we're teaching them to drive with driving data."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "You never teach a human to do that."}, {"time": 4913, "text": "You teach a human all kinds of interesting things, like language, like don't do that, watch out."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "There's all kinds of stuff going on."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "Well, this is where you, I think previous time we talked about where you poetically disagreed with my naive notion about humans."}, {"time": 4930, "text": "I just think that humans will make this whole driving thing really difficult."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "Yeah, all right."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "I said, humans don't move that slow."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "It's a ballistics problem."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "It's a ballistics, humans are a ballistics problem, which is like poetry to me."}, {"time": 4944, "text": "It's very possible that in driving they're indeed purely a ballistics problem."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "And I think that's probably the right way to think about it."}, {"time": 4950, "text": "But I still, they still continue to surprise me, those damn pedestrians, the cyclists, other

regrets about your own trajectory?"}, {"time": 9098, "text": "Yeah, some of it's painful, but you wanna hear the painful stuff?"}, {"time": 9102, "text": "I would say, like in terms of working with people, when people did stuff I didn't like, especially if it was a bit nefarious, I took it personally and I also felt it was personal about them."}, {"time": 9116, "text": "But a lot of times, like

little bit."}, {"time": 9146, "text": "And then when they do stuff, I'm way less surprised."}, {"time": 9149, "text": "And if it's bad, I'm way less hurt."}, {"time": 9152, "text": "And I react way less."}, {"time": 9154, "text": "Like I sort of expect everybody's got their shit."}, {"time": 9157, "text": "Yeah, and it's not about you as much."}, {"time": 9158, "text": "It's not about me that much."}, {"time": 9161, "text": "It's like, you know, you do something and you think you're embarrassed, but nobody cares."}, {"time": 9165, "text": "Like, and somebody's really mad at you, the odds of it being about you."}, {"time": 9169, "text": "No, they're getting mad the way they're doing that because of some pattern they learned."}, {"time": 9173, "text": "And you know, and maybe you can help them if you care enough about it."}, {"time": 9176, "text": "But, or you could see it coming and step out of the way."}, {"time": 9180, "text": "Like, I wish I was way better at that."}, {"time": 9182, "text": "I'm a bit of a hothead."}, {"time": 9184, "text": "And in support of that."}, {"time": 9186, "text": "You said with Steve, that was a feature, not a bug."}, {"time": 9188, "text":

don't think my vision was big enough."}, {"time": 9198, "text": "It was more like I just got pissed off and did stuff."}, {"time": 9202, "text": "I'm sure that's the, yeah, you're telling me."},

left and, or made enemies that I shouldn't have."}, {"time": 9218, "text": "And yeah, it's hard."}, {"time": 9220, "text": "Like, I didn't really understand politics until I worked at Apple where, you
