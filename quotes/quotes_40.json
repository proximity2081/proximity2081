million dollars into this."}, {"time": 343, "text": "And you know what, I can follow that trade easily."}, {"time": 346, "text": "And there's a bunch of people like that."}, {"time": 347, "text": "So you're kind of integrating all that information together yourself to see like, huh, there's something happening here."}, {"time": 353, "text": "And then you jump onto this little boat of like behavior, like we should buy the stock or sell the stock."}, {"time": 360, "text": "And then another person jumps on, another person jumps on."}, {"time": 364, "text": "And all of a sudden you have just a huge number of people behaving in the same direction."}, {"time": 368, "text": "It's like flock of whatever birds."}, {"time": 371, "text": "What was strange with this one, it wasn't just let's all buy Tesla."}, {"time": 375, "text": "We love Elon, we love Tesla, let's all buy Tesla."}, {"time": 378, "text": "Because that we've heard before, right?"}, {"time": 381, "text": "Everybody likes Tesla."}, {"time": 383, "text": "Well, now they do."}, {"time": 386, "text": "So what they did with this in this case, they're buying a stock that was bad."}, {"time": 391, "text": "They're buying it because it was bad."}, {"time": 393, "text": "And that's really weird because that's a little bit too galaxy brain for a decentralized community."}, {"time": 401, "text": "How did they come up with it?"}, {"time": 403, "text": "How did they know that was the right one?"}, {"time": 404, "text": "And the reason they liked it is because it had really, really high short interest."}, {"time": 409, "text": "It had been shorted more than its own float, I believe."}, {"time": 414, "text": "And so they figured out that if they all bought this bad stock, they could short squeeze some hedge funds."}, {"time": 423, "text": "And those hedge funds would have to capitulate and buy the stock at really, really high prices."}, {"time": 428, "text": "And we should say that shorted means that these are a bunch of people, when you short a stock, you're betting on the, you're predicting that the stock's going to go down and then you will make money if it does."}, {"time": 439, "text": "And then what's a short squeeze?"}, {"time": 442, "text": "It's really that if you are a hedge fund and you take a big short position in a company, there's a certain level at which you can't sustain holding that position."}, {"time": 454, "text": "There's no limit to how high a stock can go, but there is a limit to how low it can go, right?"}, {"time": 459, "text": "So if you short something, you have infinite loss potential."}, {"time": 463, "text": "And if the stock doubles overnight, like GameStop did, you're putting a lot of stress on that hedge fund."}, {"time": 471, "text": "And that hedge fund manager might have to say, you know what, I have to get out of the trade."}, {"time": 476, "text": "And the only way to get out is to buy the bad stock that they don't want, like they believe will go down."}, {"time": 482, "text": "So it's an interesting situation, particularly because it's not zero sum."}, {"time": 489, "text": "If you say, let's all get together and make a bubble in watermelons, you buy a bunch of watermelons, the price goes up, it comes down again, it's a zero sum game."}, {"time": 500, "text": "If someone's already shorted a stock and you can make them short squeeze, it's actually a positive sum game."}, {"time": 505, "text": "So yes, some Redditors will make a lot of money, some will lose a lot, but actually the whole group will make money."}, {"time": 512, "text": "And that's really why it was such a clever thing for them to do."}, {"time": 518, "text": "And coupled to the fact that shorting, I mean, maybe you can push back, but to me always from an outsider's perspective, seemed, I hope I'm not using too strong of a word, but it seemed almost unethical."}, {"time": 531, "text": "Maybe not unethical, maybe it's just a asshole thing to do."}, {"time": 535, "text": "Okay, I'm speaking not from an economics or financial perspective, I'm speaking from just somebody who loves, I'm a fan of a lot of people, I love celebrating the success of a lot of people."}, {"time": 547, "text": "And this is like the stock market equivalent of like haters."}, {"time": 553, "text": "I know that's not what it is."}, {"time": 554, "text": "I know that there's efficient, you wanna have an economy efficient mechanism for punishing sort of overhyped, overvalued things."}, {"time": 563, "text": "That's what shorthand guess is designed for."}, {"time": 566, "text": "But it just always felt like these people are just, because they're not just betting on the loss of the company."}, {"time": 573, "text": "It feels like they're also using their leverage and power to manipulate media or just to write articles or just to hate on you on social media."}, {"time": 583, "text": "Then you get to see that with Elon Musk and so on."}, {"time": 586, "text": "So this is like the man, so people like hedge funds that were shorting are like the sort of embodiment of the evil or just the bad guy, the overpowerful that's misusing their power."}, {"time": 602, "text": "And here's the crowd, the people that are standing up and rising up."}, {"time": 606, "text": "So it's not just that they were able to collaborate on Wall Street bets to sort of effectively make money for themselves."}, {"time": 614, "text": "It's also that this is like a symbol of the people getting together and fighting the centralized elites, the powerful."}, {"time": 623, "text": "And that, I don't know what your thoughts are about that in general."}, {"time": 628, "text": "At this stage, it feels like that's really exciting that people have power, just like regular people have power."}, {"time": 638, "text": "At the same time, it's scary a little bit because just studying history, people could be manipulated by charismatic leaders."}, {"time": 649, "text": "And so just like Elon right now is manipulating, encouraging people to buy Dogecoin or whatever, there can be good charismatic leaders and there can be bad charismatic leaders."}, {"time": 662, "text": "And so it's nerve wracking."}, {"time": 664, "text": "It's a little bit scary how much power a subreddit can have to destroy somebody because right now we're celebrating they might be attacking or destroying somebody that everybody doesn't like, but what if they attack somebody that is actually good for this world?"}, {"time": 681, "text": "So that, and that's kind of the awesomeness and the price of freedom."}, {"time": 688, "text": "It's like it could destroy the world or it can save the world."}, {"time": 692, "text": "But at this stage, it feels like, I don't know, overall, when you sit back, do you think this was just a positive wave of emergent behavior?"}, {"time": 701, "text": "Is there something negative about what happened?"}, {"time": 703, "text": "Well, yeah, the cool thing is they weren't doing anything, the Reddit people weren't doing anything exotic."}, {"time": 710, "text": "It was a creative trade, but it wasn't exotic."}, {"time": 715, "text": "It wasn't, it was just buying the stock."}, {"time": 717, "text": "Okay, maybe they bought some options too, but it was the hedge fund that was doing the exotic thing."}, {"time": 724, "text": "So I liked that."}, {"time": 726, "text": "It was, it's hard to say, well, we've got together and we've pulled all our money together and now there's a company out there that's worth more."}, {"time": 736, "text": "What's wrong with that?"}, {"time": 738, "text": "But it doesn't talk about the motivations, which is, and then we destroyed some hedge funds in the process."}, {"time": 745, "text": "Is there something to be said about the humor and the, I don't know, the edginess, sometimes viciousness of that subreddit?"}, {"time": 754, "text": "I haven't looked at it too much, but it feels like people can be quite aggressive on there."}, {"time": 760, "text": "So is there, what is that?"}, {"time": 765, "text": "Is that what Freedom looks like?"}, {"time": 769, "text": "I think it does, yeah."}, {"time": 770, "text": "You definitely need to let people, one of the things that people have compared it to is the Occupy Wall Street, which is, let's say, some very sincere liberals, like 23 years old, whatever, and they go out with signs and they have some kind of case to make."}, {"time": 788, "text": "But this isn't sincere, really."}, {"time": 791, "text": "It's like a little bit more nihilistic, a little bit more YOLO, and therefore a little bit more scary because who's scared of the Occupy Wall Street people with the signs?"}, {"time": 804, "text": "But these hedge funds really are scared."}, {"time": 806, "text": "I was scared of the Wall Street bats people."}, {"time": 809, "text": "I'm still scared of them."}, {"time": 811, "text": "Yeah, the anonymity is a bit terrifying and exciting."}, {"time": 817, "text": "I mean, yeah, I don't know what to do with this."}, {"time": 820, "text": "I've been following events in Russia, for example."}, {"time": 823, "text": "It's like there's a struggle between centralized power and the distributed."}, {"time": 827, "text": "I mean, that's the struggle of the history of human civilization, right?"}, {"time": 831, "text": "But this on the internet, just that you can multiply people."}, {"time": 837, "text": "Like some of them don't have to be real."}, {"time": 839, "text": "Like you can probably create bots."}, {"time": 841, "text": "Like it starts getting me, me as a programmer, I start to think like, hmm, me as one person, how much chaos can I create by writing some bots?"}, {"time": 853, "text": "And I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking that."}, {"time": 857, "text": "There's, I'm sure there's hundreds, thousands of good developers out there listening to this, thinking the same thing."}, {"time": 863, "text": "And then as that develops further and further in the next like decade or two, what impact does that have on financial markets, on just destruction of reputations of just, or politics, the bickering of left and right political discourse, the dynamics of that being manipulated by, you know, people talk about like Russian bots or whatever."}, {"time": 889, "text": "We're probably in a very early stage of that, right?"}, {"time": 893, "text": "And this is a good example."}, {"time": 896, "text": "So do you have a sense that most of WallStreetBets folks are actually individual people, right?"}, {"time": 902, "text": "That's the feeling I have is they're just individual, maybe young investors, just doing a little bit of an investment, but just on a large scale."}, {"time": 911, "text": "The reason I found out, I've known about WallStreetBets for a while, but the reason I found out about GameStop was this, just I met somebody at a party who told me about it and he was like 21 years old and he's like, it's gonna go up 100% in the next one day."}, {"time": 923, "text": "That we're talking about in last year?"}, {"time": 926, "text": "This was probably, no, this was, yeah, a few days ago."}, {"time": 929, "text": "Yeah, it was like maybe two weeks ago or something."}, {"time": 934, "text": "So it was already high GameStop, but it was just strange to me that there was someone telling me at a party how to trade stocks who was like 21 years old."}, {"time": 944, "text": "And I started to, yeah, I started to look into it."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And yeah, and he did make, he made it, yeah, he made 140% in one day, he was right."}, {"time": 955, "text": "And now he's supercharged, he's a little bit wealthier and now he's gonna wait for the next thing."}, {"time": 961, "text": "And this decentralized entity is just gonna get bigger and bigger."}, {"time": 964, "text": "And they're gonna together search for the next thing."}, {"time": 966, "text": "So there's thousands of folks like him and they're going to probably search for the next thing to attack."}, {"time": 971, "text": "People that have power in this world that sit there with power right now in government and in finance and any kind of position are probably a little bit scared right now."}, {"time": 982, "text": "And honestly, that's probably a little bit good."}, {"time": 986, "text": "It's dangerous, but it's good."}, {"time": 988, "text": "Yeah, it certainly makes you think twice about shorting."}, {"time": 991, "text": "It certainly makes you think twice about putting a lot of money into a short."}, {"time": 995, "text": "Like these funds put a lot into one or two names."}, {"time": 998, "text": "And so it was very, very badly risk managed."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Do you think shorting is, can you speak at a high level just for your own as a person, is it good for the world?"}, {"time": 1010, "text": "Is it good for markets?"}, {"time": 1012, "text": "I do think that the two kinds of shorting, evil shorting and chill shorting."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "Evil shorting is what Melvin Capital was doing."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "And it's like, you put a huge position down, you get all your buddies to also short it and you start making press and trying to bring this company down."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "And I don't think in some cases, you go out after like fraudulent companies say, this company is a fraud."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "Maybe that's okay."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "Like some, but they weren't even saying, they're just saying it's a bad company and we're going to bring it to the ground, bring it to its knees."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "So a quant fund like Numerai, we always have lots of positions and we never have a position that's like more than 1% of our fund."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So we actually have right now, 250 shorts."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "I don't know any of them except for one because it was one of the meme stocks."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "But we shorting them not to make them go, we don't even want them to go down necessarily."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "That doesn't sound a bit strange that I say that, but we just want them to not go up as much as our longs."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "So by shorting a little bit, we can actually go long more in the things we do believe in."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "So when we were going long in Tesla, we could do it with more money than we had because we would borrow from banks who would lend us money to go down."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "Who would lend us money because we had longs and shorts, because we didn't have market exposure, we didn't have market risk."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "And so I think that's a good thing because that means we can short the oil companies and go long Tesla and make the future come forward faster."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "And I do think that's not a bad thing."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "So we've talked about this incredible distributed system created by Wall Street Bets."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "And then there's a platform which is Robinhood, which allows investors to efficiently as far, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but there's those and there's others in this new MRI that allow you to make it accessible for people to invest."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "But that said, Robinhood was in a centralized way applied its power to restrict trading on the stocks that we're referring to."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "Do you have a thoughts on actually like the things that happened?"}, {"time": 1163, "text": "I don't know how much you were paying attention to sort of the shadiness around the whole thing."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Do you think it was forced to do it?"}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Or was there something shady going on?"}, {"time": 1174, "text": "What are your thoughts in general?"}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Well, I think I wanna see the alternate history."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "Like I wanna see the counterfactual history of them not doing that."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "How bad would it have gotten for hedge funds?"}, {"time": 1187, "text": "How much more damage could have been done if the momentum of these short squeezes could continue?"}, {"time": 1193, "text": "What happens when there are short squeezes, even if they're in a few stocks, they affect kind of all the other shorts too."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "And suddenly brokers are saying things like, you need to put up more collateral."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So we had a short, it wasn't GameStop luckily, it was Blackberry and it went up like 100% in a day."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "It was one of these meme stocks, super bad company."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "The AIs don't like it, okay?"}, {"time": 1219, "text": "The AIs think it's going down."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "What's a meme stock?"}, {"time": 1222, "text": "A meme stock is kind of a new term for these stocks that catch memetic momentum on Reddit."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "And so the meme stocks were GameStop, the biggest one, GameStonk, as Elon calls it, AMC."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "And Blackberry was one, Nokia was one."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "So these are high short interest stocks as well."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "So these are targeted stocks."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "Some people say, oh, isn't it adorable that these people are investing money in these companies that are nostalgic?"}, {"time": 1259, "text": "It's like, you go into the AMC movie theater, it's like nostalgic."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "It's like, no, it's not why they're doing it."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "It's that they had a lot of short interest."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "That was the main thing."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "And so there were high chance of short squeeze."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "In saying, I would love to see an alternate history, do you have a sense that that, what is your prediction of what that history would look like?"}, {"time": 1279, "text": "Well, you wouldn't have needed very many more days of that kind of chaos to hurt hedge funds."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "I think it's underrated how damaging it could have been."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "Because when your shorts go up, your collateral requirements for them go up."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "It's similar to Robinhood."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "Like we have a prime broker that says, said to us, you need to put up like $40 per $100 of short exposure."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "And then the next day they said, actually you have to put up all of it, 100%."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And we were like, what?"}, {"time": 1318, "text": "But if that happens to all the short, all the commonly held hedge fund shorts, because they're all kind of holding the same things."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "If that happens, not only do you have to cover the short, which means you're buying the bad companies, you need to sell your good companies in order to cover the short."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So suddenly like all the good companies, all the ones that the hedge funds like are coming down and all the ones that the hedge funds hate are going up in a cascading way."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "So I believe that if you could have had a few more days of GameStop doubling, AMC doubling, you would have had more and more hedge fund deleveraging."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "But so hedge funds, I mean, they get a lot of shit, but they, do you have a sense that they do some good for the world?"}, {"time": 1373, "text": "I mean, ultimately, so, okay."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "First of all, Wall Street bets itself is a kind of distributed hedge fund."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "Numeri is a kind of hedge fund."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "So I got, hedge fund is a very broad category."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "I mean, like if some of those were destroyed, would that be good for the world?"}, {"time": 1388, "text": "Or would there be coupled with the destroying the evil shorting, would there be just a lot of pain in terms of investment in good companies?"}, {"time": 1398, "text": "Yeah, a thing I like to tell people if they hate hedge funds is, I don't think you want to rerun American economic history without hedge funds."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "So on mass they're, yeah, they're good."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "Yeah, you really wouldn't want to."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Because hedge funds are kind of like picking up, they're making liquidity, right, in stocks."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "And so if you love venture capitalists, they're investing in new technology, it's so good."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "You have to also kind of like hedge funds because they're the reason venture capitalists exist because their companies can have a liquidity event when they go to the public markets."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "So it's kind of essential that we have them."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "There are many different kinds of them."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "I believe we could maybe get away with only having an AI hedge fund."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "But we don't necessarily need these evil billions type hedge funds that make the media and try to kill companies."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "But we definitely need hedge funds."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "Maybe from your perspective, because you run such an organization and Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood, sort of had to make decisions really quickly, probably had to wake up in the middle of the night kind of thing."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "And he also had a conversation with Elon Musk on Clubhouse, which I just signed up for."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "It was a fascinating, one of the great journalistic performances of our time with Elon Musk."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "Pull a surprise for Elon."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "How hilarious would it be if he gets a pull a surprise?"}, {"time": 1495, "text": "And then his Wikipedia would be like journalist and part time entrepreneur."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "As you know, I don't know if you can comment on any aspects of that, but like, if you were Vlad, how would you do things differently?"}, {"time": 1510, "text": "What are your thoughts about his interaction with Elon?"}, {"time": 1513, "text": "How he should have played it differently?"}, {"time": 1515, "text": "Like, I guess there's a lot of aspects to this interaction."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "One is about transparency."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "Like how much do you want to tell people about really what went down?"}, {"time": 1524, "text": "There's NDAs potentially involved."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "How much in private do you want to push back and say, no, fuck you, to centralize power?"}, {"time": 1536, "text": "Whatever the phone calls you're getting, which I'm sure he was getting some kind of phone calls that might not be contractual."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "Like it's not contracts that are forcing him, but he was being, what do you call it?"}, {"time": 1547, "text": "Like pressured to behave in certain kinds of ways from all kinds of directions."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "Like what do you take from this whole situation?"}, {"time": 1555, "text": "I was very excited to see Vlad's response."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "I mean, it's pretty cool to have him talk to Elon."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "And one of the things that like struck me in the first like few seconds of Vlad speaking was like, I was like, is Vlad like a boomer?"}, {"time": 1570, "text": "Like, but hear me out."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "Like he seemed like a 55 year old man talking to a 20 year old."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "Elon was like the 20 year old."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "And he's like the 55 year old man."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "You can see why Citadel are NMR buddies, right?"}, {"time": 1585, "text": "Like you can, you can see why."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "It's like, this is a nice, it's not a bad thing."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "It's like, he's got a respectable professional attitude."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "Well, he also tried to do like a jokey thing."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "Like, no, we're not being ageist here."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "Boomer, but like a 60 year old CEO of Bank of America would try to make a joke for the kids."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "That's what Vlad's like."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "Yeah, I was like, what is this?"}, {"time": 1611, "text": "This guy's like, what is he, 30?"}, {"time": 1615, "text": "And I'm like, this is weird."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "But I think, and maybe that's also what I like about Elon's kind of influence on American business is like, he's super like anti the professional."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "Like why say, you know, a hundred words about nothing?"}, {"time": 1633, "text": "And so I liked how he was cutting in and saying, Vlad, what do you mean?"}, {"time": 1636, "text": "Spill the beans, bro."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "Yeah, so you don't have to be courteous."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "It's like the first principles thinking."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "It's like, what the hell happened?"}, {"time": 1644, "text": "Let's just talk like normal people."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "The problem of course is, you know, for Elon, it's cost them, what is it?"}, {"time": 1653, "text": "Tens of millions of dollars is tweeting like that."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "But perhaps it's a worthy price to pay because ultimately there's something magical about just being real and honest and just going off the cuff and making the mistakes and paying for them, but just being real."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And then moments like this, that was an opportunity for Vlad to be that."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "And it felt like he wasn't."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "Do you think we'll ever find out what really went down if there was something shady underneath it all?"}, {"time": 1685, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it would be sad if nothing shady happened, but his presence made it shady."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "Sometimes I feel like that would mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Sometimes I feel like, yeah, there's a lot of shitty things that Facebook is doing, but sometimes I think he makes it look worse by the way he presents himself about those things."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "Like I honestly think that a large amount of people at Facebook just have a huge unstable chaotic system and they're all, not all, but mass are trying to do good with this chaotic system."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "But the presentation is like, it sounds like there's a lot of back room conversations that are trying to manipulate people."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "And there's something about the realness that Elon has that it feels like CEO should have and Vlad had that opportunity."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "I think Mark Zuckerberg had that too when he was younger."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "Younger."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And somebody said, you gotta be more professional, man."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "You can't say, you know, lol to an interview."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "And then suddenly he became like this distant person that was hot."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "Like you'd rather have him make mistakes, but be honest than be like professional and never make mistakes."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Yeah, one of the difficult hires I think is like marketing people or like PR people is you have to hire people that get the fact that you can say lol on an interview."}, {"time": 1771, "text": "Or, you know, take risks as opposed to what the PR, I've talked to quite a few big CEOs and the people around them are trying to constantly minimize risk of like, what if he says the wrong thing?"}, {"time": 1788, "text": "What if she says the wrong thing?"}, {"time": 1789, "text": "It's like, what, be careful."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "It's constantly like, ooh, like, I don't know."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "And there's this nervous energy that builds up over time with larger and larger teams where the whole thing, like I visited YouTube, for example."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "Everybody I talked at YouTube, incredible engineering and incredible system, but everybody's scared."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "Like, let's be honest about this like madness that we have going on of huge amounts of video that we can't possibly ever handle."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "There's a bunch of hate on YouTube."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "There's this chaos of comments, bunch of conspiracy theories, some of which might be true."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And then just like this mess that we're dealing with and it's exciting, it's beautiful."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "It's a place where like democratizes education, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "And instead they're all like sitting in like, trying to be very polite and saying like, well, we just want to improve the health of our platforms."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Like, it's like this discussion like, all right, man, let's just be real."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "Let's both advertise how amazing this fricking thing is, but also to say like, we don't know what we're doing."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "We have all these Nazis posting videos on YouTube."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "We don't know how to like handle it."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "And just being real like that, because I suppose that's just a skill."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "Maybe it can't be taught, but over time, the whatever the dynamics of the company is, it does seem like Zuckerberg and others get worn down."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "They just get tired."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "They get tired of."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "Not being real."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "Of not being real, which is sad."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "So let's talk about Numerai, which is an incredible company system idea, I think, but good place to start."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "What is Numerai and how does it work?"}, {"time": 1890, "text": "So Numerai is the first hedge fund that gives away all of its data."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "So this is like probably the last thing a hedge fund would do, right?"}, {"time": 1899, "text": "Why would we give away a data?"}, {"time": 1900, "text": "It's like giving away your edge."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "But the reason we do it is because we're looking for people to model our data."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "And the way we do it is by obfuscating the data."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "So when you look at Numerai's data that you can download for free, it just looks like a million rows of numbers between zero and one."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "And you have no idea what the columns mean, but you do know that if you're good at machine learning or have done regressions before, you know that I can still find patterns in this data, even though I don't know what the features mean."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And the data itself is a time series data."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "And even though it's obfuscated, anonymized, what is the source data like approximately?"}, {"time": 1947, "text": "So we are buying data from lots of different data vendors and they would also never want us to share that data."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "So we have strict contracts with them."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "So we only can, but that's the kind of data you could never buy yourself unless you had maybe a million dollars a year of budget to buy data."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "So what's happened with the hedge fund industry is you have a lot of talented people who used to be able to trade and still can trade, but now they have such a data disadvantage, it would never make sense for them to trade themselves."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "But Numerai, by giving away this obfuscated data, we can give them a really, really high quality data set that would otherwise be very expensive."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "And they can use whatever new machine learning technique they want to find patterns in that data that we can use in our hedge fund."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "And so how much variety is there in underlying data?"}, {"time": 2007, "text": "We're talking about, I apologize if I'm using the wrong terms, but one is just like the stock price."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "The other, there's like options and all that kind of stuff, like the, what are they called, order books or whatever."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Is there maybe other totally unrelated directly to the stock market data, like natural language as well, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 2031, "text": "Yeah, we were really focused on stock data that's specific to stocks."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "So things like you can have like a, every stock has like a PE ratio."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "For some stocks, it's not as meaningful, but every stock has that."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "Every stock has one year momentum, how much they went up in the last year, but those are very common factors."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "But we try to get lots and lots of those factors that we have for many, many years, like 15, 20 years history."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "And then the setup of the problem is commonly in quant called like cross sectional global equity."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "You're not really trying to say, I believe this stock will go up."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "You're trying to say the relative position of this stock in feature space makes it not a bad buy in a portfolio."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "So it captures some period of time and you're trying to find the patterns, the dynamics captured by the data of that period of time in order to make short term predictions about what's going to happen."}, {"time": 2093, "text": "Yeah, so our predictions are also not that short."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "We're not really caring about things like order books and tech data, not high frequency at all."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "We're actually holding things for quite a bit longer."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "So our prediction time horizon is about one month."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "We end up holding stocks for maybe like three or four months."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "So I kind of believe that's a little bit more like investing than kind of plumbing, like to go long a stock that's mispriced on one exchange and short on another exchange, that's just arbitrage."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "But what we're trying to do is really know something more about the longer term future of the stock."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "Yeah, so from the patterns, from these like periods of time series data, you're trying to understand something fundamental about the stock, not like about deep value, about like it's big in the context of the market, is it underpriced, overpriced, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "So like, this is about investing."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "It's not about like, just like you said, high frequency trading, which I think is a fascinating open question from a machine learning perspective, but just to like sort of build on that."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So you've anonymized the data and now you're giving away the data."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "And then now anyone can try to build algorithms that make investing decisions on top of that data or predictions on the top of that data."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "And so that's, what does that look like?"}, {"time": 2181, "text": "What's the goal of that?"}, {"time": 2182, "text": "What are the underlying principles of that?"}, {"time": 2184, "text": "So the first thing is, we could obviously model that data in house, right?"}, {"time": 2189, "text": "We can make an XGBoost model on the data and that would be quite good too."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "But what we're trying to do is by opening it up and letting anybody participate, we can do quite a lot better than if we modeled it ourselves and a lot better on the stock market doesn't need to be very much."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "Like it really matters the difference between if you can make 10 and 12% in an equity market neutral hedge fund because usually you're charging 2% fees."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "So if you can do 2% better, that's like all your fees, it's worth it."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "So we're trying to make sure that we always have the best possible model as new machine learning libraries come out, new techniques come out, they get automatically synthesized."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "Like if there's a great paper on supervised learning, someone on Numerai will figure out how to use it on Numerai's data."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "And is there an ensemble of models going on or is it more towards kind of like one or two or three like best performing models?"}, {"time": 2255, "text": "So the way we decide on how to weight all of the predictions together is by how much the users are staking on them."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "How much of the cryptocurrency that they're putting behind their models."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "So they're saying, I believe in my model."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "You can trust me because I'm gonna put skin in the game."}, {"time": 2275, "text": "And so we can take the stake weighted predictions from all our users, add those together, average those together, and that's a much better model than any one model in the sum because ensembling a lot of models together is kind of the key thing you need to do in investing too."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "Yeah, so you're putting, so there's a kind of duality from the user, from the perspective of a machine learning engineer where it's both a competition, just a really interesting, difficult machine learning problem, and it's a way to invest algorithmically."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "So like, but the way to invest algorithmically also is a way to put skin in the game that communicates to you that the quality of the algorithm and also forces you to really be serious about the models that you build."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "So it's like, everything just works nicely together."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "Like, I guess one way to say that is the interests are aligned."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "Okay, so it's just like poker is not fun when it's like for very low stakes."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "The higher the stakes, the more the dynamics of the system starts playing out correctly."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "Like as a small side note, is there something you can say about which kind, looking at the big broad view of machine learning today or AI, what kind of algorithms seem to do good in these kinds of competitions at this time?"}, {"time": 2367, "text": "Is there some universal thing you can say, like neural networks suck, recurrent neural networks suck, transformers suck, or they're awesome, like old school, sort of more basic kind of classifiers are better, all that, is there some kind of conclusions so far that you can say?"}, {"time": 2384, "text": "There is definitely something pretty nice about tree models, like XGBoost, and they just seem to work pretty nicely on this type of data."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "So out of the box, if you're trying to come a hundredth in the competition, in the tournament, maybe you would try to use that."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "But what's particularly interesting about the problem that not many people understand, if you're familiar with machine learning, this typically will surprise you when you model our data."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "So one of the things that you look at in finance is you don't wanna be too exposed to any one risk."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "Like, even if the best sector in the world to invest in over the last 10 years was tech, does not mean you should put all of your money into tech."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "So if you train a model, it would say, put all your money in tech, it's super good."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "But what you wanna do is actually be very careful of how much of this exposure you have to certain features."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "Why would you reduce your exposure to the thing that's helping your model the most?"}, {"time": 2494, "text": "And that's actually this counterintuitive thing you have to do with machine learning on financial data."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "So reducing your exposure would help you generalize the things that are..."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "So basically, a financial data has a large amount of patterns that appeared in the past and also a large amount of patterns that have not appeared in the past."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "And so like in that sense, you have to reduce the exposure to red lights, to the color red."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "That's interesting, but how much of this is art and how much of it is science from your perspective so far in terms of as you start to climb from the 100th position to the 95th in the competition?"}, {"time": 2536, "text": "Yeah, well, if you do make yourself super exposed to one or two features, you can have a lot of volatility when you're playing Numerai."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "You could maybe very rapidly rise to be high if you were getting lucky."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "And that's a bit like the stock market."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "Sure, take on massive risk exposure, put all your money into one stock and you might make 100%, but it doesn't in the long run work out very well."}, {"time": 2567, "text": "And so the best users are trying to stay high for as long as possible, not necessarily try to be first for a little bit."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "So me, a developer, machine learning researcher, how do I, Lex Friedman, participate in this competition and how do others, which I'm sure there'll be a lot of others interested in participating in this competition, what are, let's see, there's like a million questions, but like first one is how do I get started?"}, {"time": 2599, "text": "Well, you can go to numero.ai, sign up, download the data."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "And on the data is pretty small."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "In the data pack you download, there's like an example script, Python script that just builds a XGBoost model very quickly from the data."}, {"time": 2620, "text": "And so in a very short time, you can have an example model."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "Is that a particular structure?"}, {"time": 2627, "text": "Like what, is this model then submitted somewhere?"}, {"time": 2630, "text": "So there needs to be some kind of structure that communicates with some kind of API."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "Like how does the whole, how does your model, once you've built, once you create a little baby Frankenstein, how does it then live in the world?"}, {"time": 2642, "text": "Okay, well, we want you to keep your baby Frankenstein at home and take care of it."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "We don't want it."}, {"time": 2647, "text": "So you never upload your model to us."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "You always only giving us predictions."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "So we never see the code that wrote your model, which is pretty cool, that our whole hedge fund is built from models where we've never, ever seen the code."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "But it's important for the users because it's their IP, why do they want to give it to us?"}, {"time": 2668, "text": "So they've got it themselves, but they can basically almost like license the predictions from that model to us."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "License the predictions, yeah."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "What some users do is they set up a compute server and we call it Numeric Compute."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "It's like a little AWS kind of image and you can automate this process."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "So we can ping you."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "We can be like, we need more predictions now."}, {"time": 2693, "text": "And then you send it to us."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "So that's, is that described somewhere, like what the preferred is, the AWS, or whether another cloud platform, is there, I mean, is there sort of specific technical things you want to say that comes to mind that is a good path for getting started?"}, {"time": 2712, "text": "So download the data, maybe play around, see if you can modify the basic algorithm provided in the example."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "And then you, what, set up a little server on the AWS that then runs this model and takes pings and then makes predictions."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "And so how does your own money actually come into play doing the stake of a cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Yeah, so you don't have to stake."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "You can start without staking."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "And many users might try for months without staking anything at all to see if their model works on the real life data, right?"}, {"time": 2754, "text": "And is not overfit."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "But then you can get Numeraire many different ways."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "You can buy it on, you can buy some on Coinbase."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "You can buy some on Uniswap."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "You can buy some on Binance."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "So what did you say this is?"}, {"time": 2771, "text": "How do you pronounce it?"}, {"time": 2772, "text": "So this is the Numeraire cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "Yeah, NMR."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "NMR, you just say NMR?"}, {"time": 2779, "text": "It is technically called Numeraire."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "Numeraire, I like it."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "Yeah, but NMR is simple."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "NMR, Numeraire."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "Okay, so, and you could buy it basically anywhere."}, {"time": 2791, "text": "Yeah, so it's a bit strange because sometimes people are like, is this like pay to play?"}, {"time": 2797, "text": "And it's like, yeah, you need to put some money down to show us you believe in your model."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "But weirdly, we're not selling you the, like you can't buy the cryptocurrency from us."}, {"time": 2809, "text": "It's like, it's also, we never, if you do badly, we destroy your cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "Okay, that's not good, right?"}, {"time": 2818, "text": "You don't want it to be destroyed."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "But what's good about it is it's also not coming to us."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "So it's not like we win when you lose or something, like we're the house."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "Like we're definitely on the same team."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "Helping us make a hedge fund that's never been done before."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "Yeah, so again, interests are aligned."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "There's no, there's no tension there at all, which is really fascinating."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "You're giving away everything and then the IP is owned by sort of the code."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "You never share the code."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "So since I have you here and you said a hundred, I didn't ask out of how many, so we'll just, but if I then once you get started and you find this interesting, how do you then win or do well, but also how do you potentially try to win if this is something you want to take on seriously from the machine learning perspective, not from a financial perspective?"}, {"time": 2873, "text": "Yeah, I think that first of all, you would want to talk to the community."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "People are pretty open."}, {"time": 2878, "text": "We give out really interesting scripts and ideas for things you might want to try."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "And, but you're also going to need a lot of compute probably."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "And so some of the best users are, you know, actually the very first time someone won on Numerai, I would, I wrote them a personal email."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "It's like, you know, you've won some money."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "We're so excited to give you $300."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "And then they said, I spend way more on the compute, but."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So this is fundamentally a machine learning problem first, I think is this is one of the exciting things."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "And I mean, I should say to that, I'd love to participate in this and I will participate in this and I'd love to hear from other people."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "If you're listening to this, if you're a machine learning person, you should participate in it and tell me, give me some hints how I can do well at this thing."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "Cause this boomer, I'm not sure I still got it, but cause some of it is, it's like a Kaggle competitions."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "Like some of it is certainly set of ideas, like research ideas, like fundamental innovation, but I'm sure some of it is like deeply understanding, getting like an intuition about the data."}, {"time": 2982, "text": "And then like a lot of it will be like figuring out like what works, like tricks."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "I mean, you could argue most of deep learning research is just tricks on top of tricks, but there's some of it is just the art of getting to know how to work in a really difficult machine learning problem."}, {"time": 3000, "text": "And I think what's important, the important difference with something like a Kaggle competition, where they'll set up this kind of toy problem and then there will be an out of sample test, like, Hey, you did well out of sample."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "And this is like, okay, cool."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "But what's cool with Numeri is the out of sample is the real life stock market."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "We don't even know, like we don't know the onset of the problem."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "We don't, like you'll have to find out live."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "And so we've had users who've like submitted every week for like four years because it's kind of, we say it's the hardest data science problem on the planet, right?"}, {"time": 3041, "text": "And it sounds maybe sounds like maybe but too much for like a marketing thing, but it's the hardest because it's the stock market."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "It's like literally there are like billions of dollars at stake and like no one's like letting it be inefficient on purpose."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "So if you can find something that works at Numeri, you really have something that is like working on the real stock market."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "Yeah, because there's like humans involved in the stock market."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "I mean, you could argue there might be harder data sets like maybe predicting the weather, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "But the fundamental statement here is, which I like, I was thinking like, is this really the hardest data science problem?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "And you start thinking about that, but ultimately it also boils down to a problem where the data is accessible."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "It's made accessible, made really easy and efficient at like submitting algorithms."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "So it's not just, you know, it's not about the data being out there, like the weather."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "It's about making the data super accessible, making the ability of community around it."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "Like this is what ImageNet did."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Like it's not just, there's always images."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "The point is you aggregate them together."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "You give it a little title."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "This is a community and that was one of the hardest, right, for a time."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "And most important data science problems in the world because it was accessible, because it was made sort of,

there's also the biggest one is it's non stationary time series."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "We've tried to regularize the data so you can find patterns by doing certain things to the features and the target."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "But ultimately you're in a space where you don't, there's no guarantees that the out of sample distributions will conform to any of the training data."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "And every single era, which we call on the website, like every single era in the data, which is like sort of showing you the order of the time."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "Even the training data has the same dislocations."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "And so, yeah, and then there's so many things that you might wanna try."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "There's unlimited possible number of models, right?"}, {"time": 3210, "text": "And so by having it be open, we can at least search that space."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "Zooming back out to the philosophical, you said that Numerai is very much like Wall Street Bets."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "Is there, I think it'd be interesting to dig in why you think so."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "I think you're speaking to the distributed nature of the two and the power of the people nature of the two."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "So maybe can you speak to the similarities and the differences and in which way is Numerai more powerful in which way is Wall Street Bets more powerful?"}, {"time": 3249, "text": "Yeah, this is why the Wall Street Bets story is so interesting to me because it's like, feels like we're connected."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "And looking at how, just looking at the form of Wall Street Bets, I was talking earlier about how, how can you make credible claims?"}, {"time": 3263, "text": "You're anonymous."},

work at all."}, {"time": 3282, "text": "People made multiple accounts."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "They made really random models and hoped they would get lucky."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "And some of them did."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "Staking was our solution to, could we make it so that we could trust?"}, {"time": 3296, "text": "We could know which model people believed in the most."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "And we could weight models that had high stake more and effectively coordinate this group of people to be like, well, actually there's no incentive to creating bot accounts anymore."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "Either I stake my accounts, in which case I should believe in them because I could lose my stake or I don't."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "And that's a very powerful thing that having a negative incentive and a positive incentive can make things a lot better."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "And staking is like this, is this really nice like key thing about blockchain."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "It's like something special you can do where they're not even trusting us with their stake in some ways."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "They're trusting the blockchain, right?"}, {"time": 3340, "text": "So the incentives, like you say, it's about making these perfect incentives so that you can have coordination to solve one problem."}, {"time": 3347, "text": "And nowadays I sleep easy because I have less money in my own hedge fund than our users are staking on their models."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "In some sense, from a human psychology perspective, it's fascinating that the WallStreetBets worked at all, right?"}, {"time": 3368, "text": "That amidst that chaos, emerging behavior, like behavior that made sense emerged."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "It would be fascinating to think if numerized style staking could then be transferred to places like Reddit, you know?"}, {"time": 3384, "text": "And not necessarily for financial investments, but I wish sometimes people would have to stake something in the comments they make on the internet."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "That's the problem with anonymity is like, anonymity is freedom and power that you don't have to, you can speak your mind, but it's too easy to just be shitty."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "So this, I mean, you're making me realize from a profoundly philosophical aspect, numerized staking is a really clean way to solve this problem."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "It's a really beautiful way."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "Of course, it only with Numerai currently works for a very particular problem, right?"},

open sourced the code we use for staking in a protocol we call Erasure."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "And if Reddit wanted to, they could even use that code to enable staking on our Wall Street pets."},

thought that you're saying AI systems can be dangerous, but you just describe how humans can be dangerous."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "So which is safer?"}, {"time": 3630, "text": "So one thing is, so Wall Street bets these kinds of attacks."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "It's not possible to model, numerize data, and then come up with the idea from the model, let's short squeak, just game stop."},

{"time": 3654, "text": "So I think this, it's, numera could get very powerful without it being dangerous."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "But Wall Street bets needs to get a little bit more powerful, and it'll be pretty dangerous."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, this is a good place to think about numera data today and numera signals and what that looks like in 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 years."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "Right now, I guess, maybe you can correct me, but the data that we're working with is like a window."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "It's an anonymized, obfuscated window

you're still providing predictions to us, but you can do it from your own data sets."}, {"time": 3738, "text": "So numera, it's all you have to model our data to come up with predictions."}, {"time": 3742, "text": "Numa signals is whatever data you can find out there, you can turn it into a signal and give it to us."}, {"time": 3749, "text": "So it's a way for us to import signals on data we don't yet have."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And that's why it's particularly valuable, because it's going to be signals."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "You're only rewarded for signals that are orthogonal to our core signal."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "So you have to be doing something uncorrelated."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "And so strange alternative data tends to have that property."}, {"time": 3775,

ratio."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "And we have some users, as of recently, as of a week ago, there was a user that created, I think he's in India, he created a signal that is scraped from Wall Street bets."}, {"time": 3801, "text": "And now we have that signal as one of our signals in thousands that we use at Numerai."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "And the structure of the signal is similar, so it's just numbers and time series data."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "And it's just like, you're providing a ranking of stocks."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "So you just say, a one means you like the stock, zero means you don't like the stock, and you provide that for 5,000 stocks in the world."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "And they somehow converted the natural language that's in the Wall Street bet."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "And they open sourced this Colab notebook."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "You can go and see it."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "And so, yeah, it's making a sentiment score."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "And then turning it into a rank of stocks."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "A sentiment score."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "Like, this stock sucks, or this stock is awesome."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "And then converting."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "Just even looking at that data would be fascinating."}, {"time": 3851, "text": "So on the signal side, what's the vision?"}, {"time": 3855, "text": "This long term, what do you see that becoming?"}, {"time": 3858, "text": "So we want to manage all the money in the world."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "That's Numerai's mission."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "And to get that, we need to have all the data and have all of the talent."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "Like, there's no way, first principles, if you had really good modeling and really good data that you would lose, right?"}, {"time": 3877, "text": "It's just a question of how much do you need to get really good."}, {"time": 3881, "text": "So Numerai already has some really nice data that we give out."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "This year, we are 10xing that."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "And I actually think we'll 10x the amount of data we have on Numerai every year for at least the next 10 years."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "So it's going to get very big, the data we give out."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And signals is more data."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "People with any other random data set can turn that into a signal and give it to us."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "And in some sense, that kind of data is the edge cases, the weirdness is the, so you're focused on the bulk, the main data."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "And then there's just weirdness from all over the place that just can enter through this back door of Numerai signals."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "And it's also a little bit shorter term."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "So the signals are about a seven day time horizon."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "And on Numerai, it's like a 30 day."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "So it's often for faster situations."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "You've written about a master plan."}, {"time": 3940, "text": "And you've mentioned, which I love, in a similar sort of style of big style thinking, you would like Numerai to manage all of the world's money."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "So how do we get there from yesterday to several years from now?"}, {"time": 3959, "text": "Like what is the plan?"}, {"time": 3962, "text": "So you've already started to allure to get all the data and get all the talent, humans, models."}, {"time": 3972, "text": "I mean, the important thing to note there is, what would that mean?"}, {"time": 3976, "text": "And I think the biggest thing it means is if there was one hedge fund, you would have not so much talent wasted on all the other hedge funds."}, {"time": 3987, "text": "Like it's super weird how the industry works."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "It's like one hedge fund gets a data source and hires a PhD."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "And another hedge fund has to buy the same data source and hire a PhD."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "And suddenly, a third of American PhDs are working at hedge funds."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "And we're not even on Mars."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "And so in some ways, Numerai, it's all about freeing up people who work at hedge funds to go work for Elon."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "And also, the people who are working on Numerai problem, it feels like a lot of the knowledge there is also transferable to other domains."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "One of our top users, he works at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "And he's amazing."}, {"time": 4030, "text": "I went to go visit him there."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "And he's got Numerai posters."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "And it looks like the movies."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "It looks like Apollo 11 or whatever."}, {"time": 4039, "text": "Yeah, the point is he didn't quit his job to join full time."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "He's working on getting us to Jupiter's moon."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "That's his mission, the Europa Klippa mission."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "Actually, literally what you're saying."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "He's smart enough that we really want his intelligence to reach the stock market."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "Because the stock market's a good thing."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "Hedge funds are a good thing."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "All kinds of hedge funds, especially."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "But we don't want him to quit his job."}, {"time": 4065, "text": "So he can just do Numerai on the weekends."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "And that's what he does."}, {"time": 4067, "text": "He just made a model and it just automatically submits to us."}, {"time": 4070, "text": "And he's like one of our best users."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "You mentioned briefly that stock markets are good."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "From my sort of outsider perspective, is there a sense, do you think trading stocks is closer to gambling?"}, {"time": 4086, "text": "Or is it closer to investing?"}, {"time": 4089, "text": "Sometimes it feels like it's gambling as opposed to betting on companies that succeed."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "And this is maybe connected to our discussion of shorting in general, but from your sense, the way you think about it, is it fundamentally still investing?"}, {"time": 4103, "text": "I do think, I mean, it's a good question."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "I've also seen lately people say, this is like speculation."}, {"time": 4113, "text": "Is there too much speculation in the market?"}, {"time": 4115, "text": "And it's like, but all the trades are speculative."}, {"time": 4118, "text": "All the trades have a horizon."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "People want them to work."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "So I would say that there's certainly a lot of aspects of gambling math that applies to investing."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "Like one thing you don't do in gambling is put all your money in one bet."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "You have bankroll management, and it's a key part of it."}, {"time": 4144, "text": "And small alterations to your bankroll management might be better than improvements to your skill."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "And then there are things we care about in our fund."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "Like we want to make a lot of independent bets."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "We talk about it, like we want to make a lot of independent bets, because that's going to be a higher sharp than if you have a lot of bets that depend on each other, like all in one sector."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "But yeah, I mean, the point is that you want the prices of the stocks to be reflective of their value."}, {"time": 4179, "text": "Of the underlying value of the company."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "Yeah, you shouldn't have there be like a hedge fund that's able to say, well, I've looked at some data, and all of this stuff's super mispriced."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "That's super bad for society if it looks like that to someone."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "I guess the underlying question then is, do you see that the market often drifts away from the underlying value of companies, and it becomes a game in itself?"}, {"time": 4206, "text": "Like with these, whatever they're called, like derivatives, like the options, and shorting, and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "It's like layers of game on top of the actual, like what you said, which is like the basic thing that the Wall Street Bets was doing, which is like just buying stocks."}, {"time": 4229, "text": "There are a lot of games that people play that are in the derivatives market."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "And I think a lot of the stuff people dislike when they look at the history of what's happened, they hate like credit default swaps, or collateralized debt obligations."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "Like these are the enemies of 2008."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "And then the long term capital management thing, it was like they had 30 times leverage, or something."}, {"time": 4260, "text": "You could just go to a gas station and ask anybody at the gas station, is it a good idea to have 30 times leverage?"}, {"time": 4268, "text": "And they just say no."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "It's like common sense just like went out the window."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "So yeah, I don't respect long term capital management."}, {"time": 4281, "text": "But Numerai doesn't actually use any derivatives unless you call shorting derivative."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "We just we do put money into companies."}, {"time": 4289, "text": "And that does help the companies we're investing in."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "It's just in little ways."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "We really did buy Tesla."}, {"time": 4297, "text": "And we played some role in its success."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "Super small, make no mistake."}, {"time": 4306, "text": "But still, I think that's important."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "Can I ask you a pothead question, which is what is money, man?"}, {"time": 4315, "text": "So if we just kind of zoom out and look at, because I'd love to talk to you about cryptocurrency, which perhaps could be the future of money."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "In general, how do you think about money?"}, {"time": 4327,

that."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "But it's definitely in my personal life, it's become more and more warped."}, {"time": 4349, "text": "And you start to care about the real thing, like what's really going on here."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "Elon talks about things like this, like what is a company, really?"}, {"time": 4360, "text": "It's a bunch of people who show up to work together and they solve a problem."}, {"time": 4365, "text": "And there might not be a stock out there that's trading that represents what they're doing, but it's not the real thing."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "And being involved in crypto, I put in crowdsale of Ethereum and all these other things and different crypto hedge funds and things that I've invested in."}, {"time": 4387, "text": "And it's just kind of like, it feels like how I used to think about money stuff is just totally warped."}, {"time": 4395, "text": "Because you stop caring about the price and you care about the product."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "So by the product, you mean the different mechanisms that money is exchanged."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "I mean, money is ultimately a kind of a little, one is a store of wealth, but it's also a mechanism of exchanging wealth."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "But what wealth means becomes a totally different thing, especially with cryptocurrency, to where it's almost like these little contracts, these little agreements, these transactions between human beings that represent something that's bigger than just cash being exchanged at 7.11, it feels like."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "Maybe I'll answer what is finance."}, {"time": 4443, "text": "It's what are you doing when you have the ability to take out a loan?"}, {"time": 4448, "text": "You can bring a whole new future into being with finance."}, {"time": 4455, "text": "If you couldn't get a student loan to get a college degree, you couldn't get a college degree if you didn't have the money."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "But now, weirdly, you can get it with, and all you have is this loan, which is like, so now you can bring a different future into the world."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "And that's how when I was saying earlier about if you rerun American economic history without these things, like you're not allowed to take out loans, you're not allowed to have derivatives, you're not allowed to have money,

empowering."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "We sometimes forget this, but it enables innovation."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "It enables big risk takers and bold builders that ultimately make this world

4990, "text": "I think that one thing I do like, and it might be a particular thing about America, but there is something about playing, tell people what you really want to happen in the world."},

dollars."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "When you actually believe something else, you actually believe you're actually more optimistic, but you're toning down your optimism because you want to appear like

invest in a mediocre company."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "So you should play the real game."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "And obviously this doesn't apply to all businesses, but if you play a venture backed startup kind of game, like play for keeps, play to win, go big."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "And it's very hard to do that."}, {"time": 5053, "text": "I've always feel like, yeah, you can start narrowing your focus because 10 people are telling you, you gotta care about this boring thing that won't matter five years from now."}, {"time": 5068, "text": "And you should push back and do the real, play the real game."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "So be bold."}, {"time": 5073, "text": "So both, I mean, there's an interesting duality there."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "So there's the way you speak to other people about like your plans and what you are like privately just in your own mind."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "And maybe it's connected with what you were saying about, yeah, sincerity as well."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "Like if you appear to be sincerely optimistic about something that's big or crazy, it's putting yourself up to be kind of like ridiculed or something."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "And so if you say, my mission is to, yeah, go to Mars, it's just so bonkers that it's hard to say."}, {"time": 5112, "text": "It is, but one powerful thing, just like you said, is if you say it and you believe it, then actually amazing people come and work with you."}, {"time": 5126, "text": "It's not just skill, but the dreams."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "There's something about optimism that, like that fire that you have when you're optimistic of actually having the hope of building something totally cool, something totally new, that when those people get in a room together, like they can actually do it."}, {"time": 5143, "text": "Yeah, there's, yeah, that's, and also makes life really fun when you're in that room."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "So all of that together, ultimately, I don't know, that's what makes this crazy ride of a startup really look fun."}, {"time": 5159, "text": "And Elon is an example of a person who succeeded at that."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "There's not many other inspiring figures, which is sad."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "I used to be at Google and there's something that happens that sometimes when the company grows bigger and bigger

and strange to me also, I think you're right that there's how many boring companies there are."}, {"time": 5226, "text": "Something I always talk about, especially in FinTech, it's like, why am I excited about, this is so lame."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "Like what is, this isn't even important."}, {"time": 5236, "text": "Even if you succeed, this is gonna be like terrible."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "This is not good."}, {"time": 5241, "text": "And it's just strange how people can kind of get fake enthusiastic about like boring ideas when there's so many bigger ideas that, yeah, I mean, you read these things, like this company raises money, and it's just like, that's a lot of money for the worst idea I've ever heard."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "Some ideas are really big."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "So like I worked on autonomous vehicles quite a bit."}, {"time": 5264, "text": "And there's so many ways in which you can present that idea to yourself, to the team you work with, to just, yeah, like to yourself when you're quietly looking in the mirror in the morning, that's really boring or really exciting."}, {"time": 5278, "text": "Like if you're really ambitious with autonomous vehicles, it changes the nature of like human robot interaction, it changes the nature of how we move."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "Forget money, forget all that stuff."}, {"time": 5289, "text": "It changes like everything about robotics and AI, machine learning, it changes everything about manufacture."}, {"time": 5296, "text": "I mean, cars, transportation is so fundamentally connected to cars, and if that changes, it's changing the fabric of society, of movies, of everything."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "And if you go bold and take risks and be willing to go bankrupt with your company, as opposed to cautiously, you can really change the world."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "And yeah, so that's just an example."}, {"time": 5352, "text": "Like the idea can be big, but if you don't allow yourself to take that idea and think really big with it, then you're not gonna make anything happen."}, {"time": 5362, "text": "Yeah, you're absolutely right in that."}, {"time": 5364, "text": "So you've been connected in your work with a bunch of amazing people."}, {"time": 5371, "text": "How much interaction do you have with investors, that whole process is an entire mystery to me."}, {"time": 5376, "text": "Is there some people that just have influence on the trajectory of your thinking completely, or is it just this collective energy behind the company?"}, {"time": 5386, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I came here and I was amazed how, yeah, people would, I was only here for a few months and I met some incredible investors and I'd almost run out of money."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "And once they invested, I was like, I am not gonna let you down."}, {"time": 5406, "text": "And I was like, okay, I'm gonna send them like an email update every like three minutes."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "And then they don't care at all."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "So they kind of wanna, I don't know, like, so for some, I like it when it's just like, they're always available to talk, but a lot of building a business, especially a high tech business, there's a little for them to add, right?"}, {"time": 5429, "text": "There's little for them to add on product."}, {"time": 5431, "text": "There's a lot for them to add on like business development."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And if we are doing product research, which is for us research into the market, research into how to make a great hedge fund, and we do that for years, there's not much to tell the investors."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "So that basically is like, I believe in you."}, {"time": 5449, "text": "There's something, I like the cut of your jib."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "There's something in your idea, in your ambition, in your plans that I like."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "And it's almost like a pat on the back."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "It's like, go get them kid."}, {"time": 5461, "text": "Yeah, it is a bit like that."}, {"time": 5464, "text": "That's a good way to do it."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "I'm glad they do it that way."}, {"time": 5467, "text": "Like the one meeting I had, which was like really good with this was meeting Howard Morgan, who's actually a co founder of Renaissance Technologies in the like 1980s and worked with Jim Simons."}, {"time": 5481, "text": "And he was in the room and I was meeting some other guy and he was in the room and I was explaining how quantitative finance works."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "I was like, so they use mathematical models."}, {"time": 5496, "text": "And then he was like, yeah, I started Renaissance."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "I know a bit about this."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "And then I was like, oh my God."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "So yeah, but then, and then I think he kind of said, well, yeah, he said, well, cause I was talking, he was working at first round capital as a partner and they kind of said, they didn't want to invest."}, {"time": 5519, "text": "And then I wrote a blog post describing the idea and I was like, I really think you guys should invest."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "And then they end up."}, {"time": 5525, "text": "You convinced them on that."}, {"time": 5526, "text": "That must be good."}, {"time": 5527, "text": "Yeah, cause they're like, we don't really invest in hedge funds."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "And I was like, you don't see like what I'm doing."}, {"time": 5531, "text": "This is so a tech company, not a hedge fund, right?"}, {"time": 5534, "text": "Yeah, and Numerai is brilliant."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "It's, when it caught my eye, there's something special there."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "So I really do hope you succeed in the, obviously it's a risky thing you're taking on, the ambition of it, the size of it, but I do hope you succeed."},

real life thing."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "And they have a lot of like world series of bracelet, world series poker bracelets holders, but it's kind of Jim's thing."}, {"time": 5593, "text": "And I met him there and yeah, it was kind of brief, but I was just like, he's like, oh, how do you, why are you here?"}, {"time": 5602, "text": "And I was like, oh, Howard sent me, you know, he's like, go play this tournament, meet some of the other players."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "And then...

crazy."}, {"time": 5616, "text": "On my right was the CEO, who's the current CEO of Renaissance, Peter Brown."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "And Peter Muller, who's a hedge fund manager at PDT."},

fun."}, {"time": 5657, "text": "And then I managed to knock out Peter Muller."}, {"time": 5659, "text": "I have a, I got a little trophy for knocking him out because he was a previous champion."},

say Jim outlasted me in the tournament."}, {"time": 5675, "text": "And they're all extremely good at poker, but they're also, so it was a $10,000 buy in."}, {"time": 5685, "text": "And I was like, this is kind of expensive, but it all goes to charity, Jim's math charity."}, {"time": 5694, "text": "But then the way they play, they have like rebis and like they all do a shit ton of rebis because it's for charity."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "So immediately they're like going all in and I'm like, man, like, so I ended up adding more as well."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "So it's like you couldn't play at all without doing that."}, {"time": 5715, "text": "Yeah, the stakes are high."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "But you're connected to a lot of these folks that are kind of titans of just of economics and tech in general."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "Do you feel a burden from this?"}, {"time": 5728, "text": "You're a young guy."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "I did feel a bit out of place

didn't like."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "And they were also kind of making fun of me a little bit."}, {"time": 5757, "text": "Like they would say, like they'd call me like, I don't know, the Bitcoin kid or."}, {"time": 5762, "text": "And then they would say, even things like, member Peter, yeah, said to me something like, I don't think AI is gonna have a big role in finance."}, {"time": 5772,

having a really big impact on things like self driving cars."}, {"time": 5785, "text": "But finance, it's too noisy and whatever."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "And so I don't think it's like the perfect application."}, {"time": 5790, "text": "And I was like, that was interesting to hear because it's like, and I think it was that same day that Libra, I think it is, the poker playing AI started to beat like the human."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "So it was kind of funny hearing them like say, oh, I'm not sure AI could ever attack that problem."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "And then that very day it's attacking the problem of the game we're playing."}, {"time": 5811, "text": "Well, there's a kind of a magic to somebody who's exceptionally successful looking at you, giving you respect, but also

"We're just like ants, a part of a system, a part of another system."}, {"time": 6348, "text": "And then asking this bigger question allows you to kind of zoom out and think about it."}, {"time":
