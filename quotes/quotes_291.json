[{"title": "Bret Weinstein: Truth, Science, and Censorship in the Time of a Pandemic | Lex Fridman Podcast #194", "id": "TG6BuSjwP4o", "quotes": [{"time": 409, "text": "So like, I don't know what to attribute the parkour to, like biomechanics of how our bodies can move, or is it the mind?"}, {"time": 418, "text": "Like how much percent wise, is it the entirety of the hierarchies of biology that we've been talking about, or is it just all the mind?"}, {"time": 429, "text": "The way to think about creatures is that every creature is two things simultaneously."}, {"time": 434, "text": "A creature is a machine of sorts, right?"}, {"time": 437, "text": "It's not a machine in the, I call it an aqueous machine, right?"}, {"time": 442, "text": "And it's run by an aqueous computer, right?"}, {"time": 444, "text": "So it's not identical to our technological machines."}, {"time": 449, "text": "But every creature is both a machine that does things in the world sufficient to accumulate enough resources to continue surviving, to reproduce."}, {"time": 459, "text": "It is also a potential."}, {"time": 461, "text": "So each creature is potentially, for example, the most recent common ancestor of some future clade of creatures that will look very different from it."}, {"time": 470, "text": "And if a creature is very, very good at being a creature, but not very good in terms of the potential it has going forward, then that lineage will not last very long into the future because change will throw at challenges that its descendants will not be able to meet."}, {"time": 487, "text": "So the thing about humans is we are a generalist platform, and we have the ability to swap out our software to exist in many, many different niches."}, {"time": 500, "text": "And I was once watching an interview with this British group of parkour experts who were being, they were discussing what it is they do and how it works."}, {"time": 511, "text": "And what they essentially said is, look, you're tapping into deep monkey stuff, right?"}, {"time": 519, "text": "And I thought, yeah, that's about right."}, {"time": 521, "text": "And anybody who is proficient at something like skiing or skateboarding, you know, has the experience of flying down the hill on skis, for example, bouncing from the top of one mogul to the next."}, {"time": 539, "text": "And if you really pay attention, you will discover that your conscious mind is actually a spectator."}, {"time": 545, "text": "It's there, it's involved in the experience, but it's not driving."}, {"time": 549, "text": "Some part of you knows how to ski, and it's not the part of you that knows how to think."}, {"time": 552, "text": "And I would just say that what accounts for this flexibility in humans is the ability to bootstrap a new software program and then drive it into the unconscious layer where it can be applied very rapidly."}, {"time": 570, "text": "And, you know, I will be shocked if the exact thing doesn't exist in robotics."}, {"time": 576, "text": "You know, if you programmed a robot to deal with circumstances that were novel to it, how would you do it?"}, {"time": 581, "text": "It would have to look something like this."}, {"time": 583, "text": "There's a certain kind of magic, you're right, with the consciousness being an observer."}, {"time": 588, "text": "When you play guitar, for example, or piano for me, music, when you get truly lost in it, I don't know what the heck is responsible for the flow of the music, the kind of the loudness of the music going up and down, the timing, the intricate, like even the mistakes, all those things, that doesn't seem to be the conscious mind."}, {"time": 609, "text": "It is just observing, and yet it's somehow intricately involved."}, {"time": 614, "text": "More, like, because you mentioned parkour, the dance is like that too."}, {"time": 618, "text": "When you start up in tango dancing, if when you truly lose yourself in it, then it's just like you're an observer, and how the hell is the body able to do that?"}, {"time": 629, "text": "And not only that, it's the physical motion is also creating the emotion, the, like, the damn is good to be alive feeling."}, {"time": 640, "text": "So, but then that's also intricately connected to the full biology stack that we're operating in."}, {"time": 647, "text": "I don't know how difficult it is to replicate that."}, {"time": 650, "text": "We're talking offline about Boston Dynamics robots."}, {"time": 654, "text": "They've recently been, they did both parkour, they did flips, they've also done some dancing, and it's something I think a lot about because what most people don't realize because they don't look deep enough is those robots are hard coded to do those things."}, {"time": 673, "text": "The robots didn't figure it out by themselves, and yet the fundamental aspect of what it means to be human is that process of figuring out, of making mistakes, and then there's something about overcoming those challenges and the mistakes and, like, figuring out how to lose yourself in the magic of the dancing or just movement is what it means to be human."}, {"time": 695, "text": "That learning process, so that's what I want to do with the, almost as a fun side thing with the Boston Dynamics robots, is to have them learn and see what they figure out, even if they make mistakes."}, {"time": 710, "text": "I want to let Spot make mistakes and in so doing discover what it means to be alive, discover beauty, because I think that's the essential aspect of mistakes."}, {"time": 725, "text": "Boston Dynamics folks want Spot to be perfect because they don't want Spot to ever make mistakes because it wants to operate in the factories, it wants to be very safe and so on."}, {"time": 736, "text": "For me, if you construct the environment, if you construct a safe space for robots and allow them to make mistakes, something beautiful might be discovered, but that requires a lot of brain power."}, {"time": 749, "text": "So Spot is currently very dumb and I'm gonna give it a brain."}, {"time": 754, "text": "So first make it see, currently it can't see, meaning computer vision, it has to understand its environment, it has to see all the humans, but then also has to be able to learn, learn about its movement, learn how to use its body to communicate with others, all those kinds of things that dogs know how to do well, humans know how to do somewhat well."}, {"time": 774, "text": "I think that's a beautiful challenge, but first you have to allow the robot to make mistakes."}, {"time": 780, "text": "Well, I think your objective is laudable, but you're gonna realize that the Boston Dynamics folks are right the first time Spot poops on your rug."}, {"time": 791, "text": "I hear the same thing about kids and so on."}, {"time": 793, "text": "I still wanna have kids."}, {"time": 794, "text": "No, you should, it's a great experience."}, {"time": 798, "text": "So let me step back into what you said in a couple of different places."}, {"time": 801, "text": "One, I have always believed that the missing element in robotics and artificial intelligence is a proper development, right?"}, {"time": 810, "text": "It is no accident, it is no mere coincidence that human beings are the most dominant species on planet Earth and that we have the longest childhoods of any creature on Earth by far, right?"}, {"time": 822, "text": "The development is the key to the flexibility."}, {"time": 824, "text": "And so the capability of a human at adulthood is the mirror image, it's the flip side of our helplessness at birth."}, {"time": 837, "text": "So I'll be very interested to see what happens in your robot project if you do not end up reinventing childhood for robots, which of course is foreshadowed in 2001 quite brilliantly."}, {"time": 850, "text": "But I also wanna point out, you can see this issue of your conscious mind becoming a spectator very well if you compare tennis to table tennis, right?"}, {"time": 864, "text": "If you watch a tennis game, you could imagine that the players are highly conscious as they play."}, {"time": 872, "text": "You cannot imagine that if you've ever played ping pong decently."}, {"time": 876, "text": "A volley in ping pong is so fast that your conscious mind, if your reactions had to go through your conscious mind, you wouldn't be able to play."}, {"time": 884, "text": "So you can detect that your conscious mind, while very much present, isn't there."}, {"time": 889, "text": "And you can also detect where consciousness does usefully intrude."}, {"time": 894, "text": "If you go up against an opponent in table tennis that knows a trick that you don't know how to respond to, you will suddenly detect that something about your game is not effective, and you will start thinking about what might be, how do you position yourself so that move that puts the ball just in that corner of the table or something like that doesn't catch you off guard."}, {"time": 915, "text": "And this, I believe, is we highly conscious folks, those of us who try to think through things very deliberately and carefully, mistake consciousness for the highest kind of thinking."}, {"time": 930, "text": "And I really think that this is an error."}, {"time": 933, "text": "Consciousness is an intermediate level of thinking."}, {"time": 936, "text": "What it does is it allows you, it's basically like uncompiled code."}, {"time": 940, "text": "And it doesn't run very fast."}, {"time": 942, "text": "It is capable of being adapted to new circumstances."}, {"time": 945, "text": "But once the code is roughed in, it gets driven into the unconscious layer, and you become highly effective at whatever it is."}, {"time": 952, "text": "And from that point, your conscious mind basically remains there to detect things that aren't anticipated by the code you've already written."}, {"time": 960, "text": "And so I don't exactly know how one would establish this, how one would demonstrate it."}, {"time": 967, "text": "But it must be the case that the human mind contains sandboxes in which things are tested, right?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "Maybe you can build a piece of code and run it in parallel next to your active code so you can see how it would have done comparatively."}, {"time": 983, "text": "But there's gotta be some way of writing new code and then swapping it in."}, {"time": 988, "text": "And frankly, I think this has a lot to do with things like sleep cycles."}, {"time": 991, "text": "Very often, when I get good at something, I often don't get better at it while I'm doing it."}, {"time": 996, "text": "I get better at it when I'm not doing it, especially if there's time to sleep and think on it."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "So there's some sort of new program swapping in for old program phenomenon, which will be a lot easier to see in machines."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "It's gonna be hard with the wetware."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "I like, I mean, it is true, because somebody that played, I played tennis for many years, I do still think the highest form of excellence in tennis is when the conscious mind is a spectator."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "So the compiled code is the highest form of being human."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "And then consciousness is just some specific compiler."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "You used to have like Borland C++ compiler."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "You could just have different kind of compilers."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "Ultimately, the thing that by which we measure the power of life, the intelligence of life is the compiled code."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And you can probably do that compilation all kinds of ways."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Yeah, I'm not saying that tennis is played consciously and table tennis isn't."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "I'm saying that because tennis is slowed down by the just the space on the court, you could imagine that it was your conscious mind playing."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "But when you shrink the court down, It becomes obvious."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "It becomes obvious that your conscious mind is just present rather than knowing where to put the paddle."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "And weirdly for me, I would say this probably isn't true in a podcast situation."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "But if I have to give a presentation, especially if I have not overly prepared, I often find the same phenomenon when I'm giving the presentation."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "My conscious mind is there watching some other part of me present, which is a little jarring, I have to say."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "Well, that means you've gotten good at it."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "Not let the conscious mind get in the way of the flow of words."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Yeah, that's the sensation to be sure."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "And that's the highest form of podcasting too."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "I mean, that's what it looks like when a podcast is really in the pocket, like Joe Rogan, just having fun and just losing themselves."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "And that's something I aspire to as well, just losing yourself in conversation."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "Somebody that has a lot of anxiety with people, like I'm such an introvert."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "I was scared before you showed up."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "I'm scared right now."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "There's just anxiety."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "There's just, it's a giant mess."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "It's hard to lose yourself."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "It's hard to just get out of the way of your own mind."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "Yeah, actually, trust is a big component of that."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "Your conscious mind retains control if you are very uncertain."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "But when you do get into that zone when you're speaking, I realize it's different for you with English as a second language, although maybe you present in Russian and it happens."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "But do you ever hear yourself say something and you think, oh, that's really good, right?"}, {"time": 1165, "text": "Like you didn't come up with it, some other part of you that you don't exactly know came up with it?"}, {"time": 1171, "text": "I don't think I've ever heard myself in that way because I have a much louder voice that's constantly yelling in my head at, why the hell did you say that?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "There's a very self critical voice that's much louder."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "So I'm very, maybe I need to deal with that voice, but it's been like, what is it called?"}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Like a megaphone just screaming so I can't hear the other voice that says, good job, you said that thing really nicely."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "So I'm kind of focused right now on the megaphone person in the audience versus the positive, but that's definitely something to think about."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "It's been productive, but the place where I find gratitude and beauty and appreciation of life is in the quiet moments when I don't talk, when I listen to the world around me, when I listen to others, when I talk, I'm extremely self critical in my mind."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "When I produce anything out into the world that originated with me, like any kind of creation, extremely self critical."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "It's good for productivity, for always striving to improve and so on."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "It might be bad for just appreciating the things you've created."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "I'm a little bit with Marvin Minsky on this where he says the key to a productive life is to hate everything you've ever done in the past."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "I didn't know he said that."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "I must say, I resonate with it a bit."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "And unfortunately, my life currently has me putting a lot of stuff into the world, and I effectively watch almost none of it."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "I can't stand it."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "I just yesterday read Metamorphosis by Kafka, we read Metamorphosis by Kafka where he turns into a giant bug because of the stress that the world puts on him."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "His parents put on him to succeed."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "And I think that you have to find the balance because if you allow the self critical voice to become too heavy, the burden of the world, the pressure that the world puts on you to be the best version of yourself and so on to strive, then you become a bug and that's a big problem."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "And then the world turns against you because you're a bug."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "You become some kind of caricature of yourself."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "I don't know, you become the worst version of yourself and then thereby end up destroying yourself and then the world moves on."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "That's the story."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "That's a lovely story."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "I do think this is one of these places, and frankly, you could map this onto all of modern human experience, but this is one of these places where our ancestral programming does not serve our modern selves."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "So I used to talk to students about the question of dwelling on things."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "Dwelling on things is famously understood to be bad and it can't possibly be bad."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "It wouldn't exist, the tendency toward it wouldn't exist if it was bad."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "So what is bad is dwelling on things past the point of utility."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "This is the point at which it is no longer useful for me to dwell on this error I have made."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "That's what you're looking for."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "And it also gives you license, right?"}, {"time": 1400, "text": "If some part of you feels like it's punishing you rather than searching, then that also has a point at which it's no longer valuable and there's some liberty in realizing, yep, even the part of me that was punishing me knows it's time to stop."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "So if we map that onto compiled code discussion, as a computer science person, I find that very compelling."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "You know, when you compile code, you get warnings sometimes."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "And usually, if you're a good software engineer, you're going to make sure there's no, you know, you treat warnings as errors."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "So you make sure that the compilation produces no warnings."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "But at a certain point, when you have a large enough system, you just let the warnings go."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "Like, I don't know where that warning came from, but, you know, just ultimately you need to compile the code and run with it and hope nothing terrible happens."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "Well, I think what you will find, and believe me, I think what you're talking about with respect to robots and learning is gonna end up having to go to a deep developmental state and a helplessness that evolves into hyper competence and all of that."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "But I live, I noticed that I live by something that I, for lack of a better descriptor, call the theory of close calls."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "And the theory of close calls says that people typically miscategorize the events in their life where something almost went wrong."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "And, you know, for example, if you, I have a friend who, I was walking down the street with my college friends and one of my friends stepped into the street thinking it was clear and was nearly hit by a car going 45 miles an hour, would have been an absolute disaster, might have killed her, certainly would have permanently injured her."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "But she didn't, you know, car didn't touch her, right?"}, {"time": 1521, "text": "Now you could walk away from that and think nothing of it because, well, what is there to think?"}, {"time": 1526, "text": "Nothing happened."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "Or you could think, well, what is the difference between what did happen and my death?"}, {"time": 1533, "text": "The difference is luck."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "I never want that to be true, right?"}, {"time": 1537, "text": "I never want the difference between what did happen and my death to be luck."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "Therefore, I should count this as very close to death and I should prioritize coding so it doesn't happen again at a very high level."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "So anyway, my basic point is the accidents and disasters and misfortune describe a distribution that tells you what's really likely to get you in the end."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And so personally, you can use them to figure out where the dangers are so that you can afford to take great risks because you have a really good sense of how they're gonna go wrong."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "But I would also point out civilization has this problem."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "Civilization is now producing these events that are major disasters, but they're not existential scale yet, right?"}, {"time": 1587, "text": "They're very serious errors that we can see."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And I would argue that the pattern is you discover that we are involved in some industrial process at the point it has gone wrong, right?"}, {"time": 1597, "text": "So I'm now always asking the question, okay, in light of the Fukushima triple meltdown, the financial collapse of 2008, the Deepwater Horizon blowout, COVID 19, and its probable origins in the Wuhan lab, what processes do I not know the name of yet that I will discover at the point that some gigantic accident has happened?"}, {"time": 1623, "text": "And can we talk about the wisdom or lack thereof of engaging in that process before the accident, right?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "That's what a wise civilization would be doing."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "And yet we don't."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "I just wanna mention something that happened a couple of days ago."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "I don't know if you know who JB Straubel is."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "He's the co founder of Tesla, CTO of Tesla for many, many years."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "His wife just died."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "She was riding a bicycle."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "And in the same thin line between death and life that many of us have been in, where you walk into the intersection and there's this close call."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Every once in a while, you get the short straw."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "I wonder how much of our own individual lives and the entirety of the human civilization rests on this little roll of the dice."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "Well, this is sort of my point about the close calls is that there's a level at which we can't control it, right?"}, {"time": 1686, "text": "The gigantic asteroid that comes from deep space that you don't have time to do anything about."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "There's not a lot we can do to hedge that out, or at least not short term."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "But there are lots of other things."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "Obviously, the financial collapse of 2008 didn't break down the entire world economy."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "It threatened to, but a Herculean effort managed to pull us back from the brink."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "The triple meltdown at Fukushima was awful, but every one of the seven fuel pools held, there wasn't a major fire that made it impossible to manage the disaster going forward."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "We got lucky."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "We could say the same thing about the blowout at the Deepwater Horizon, where a hole in the ocean floor large enough that we couldn't have plugged it, could have opened up."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "All of these things could have been much, much worse, right?"}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And I think we can say the same thing about COVID, as terrible as it is."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And we cannot say for sure that it came from the Wuhan lab, but there's a strong likelihood that it did."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "And it also could be much, much worse."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "So in each of these cases, something is telling us, we have a process that is unfolding that keeps creating risks where it is luck that is the difference between us and some scale of disaster that is unimaginable."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "And that wisdom, you can be highly intelligent and cause these disasters."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "To be wise is to stop causing them, right?"}, {"time": 1771, "text": "And that would require a process of restraint, a process that I don't see a lot of evidence of yet."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "So I think we have to generate it."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "And somehow, at the moment, we don't have a political structure that would be capable of taking a protective algorithm and actually deploying it, right?"}, {"time": 1795, "text": "Because it would have important economic consequences."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "And so it would almost certainly be shot down."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "But we can obviously also say, we paid a huge price for all of the disasters that I've mentioned."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "And we have to factor that into the equation."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "Something can be very productive short term and very destructive long term."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "Also, the question is how many disasters we avoided because of the ingenuity of humans or just the integrity and character of humans."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "That's sort of an open question."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "We may be more intelligent than lucky."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "Because the optimistic message here that you're getting at is maybe the process that we should be, that maybe we can overcome luck with ingenuity."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "Meaning, I guess you're suggesting the processes we should be listing all the ways that human civilization can destroy itself, assigning likelihood to it, and thinking through how can we avoid that."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "And being very honest with the data out there about the close calls and using those close calls to then create sort of mechanism by which we minimize the probability of those close calls."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "And just being honest and transparent with the data that's out there."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "Well, I think we need to do a couple things for it to work."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "So I've been an advocate for the idea that sustainability is actually, it's difficult to operationalize, but it is an objective that we have to meet if we're to be around long term."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "And I realized that we also need to have reversibility of all of our processes."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "Because processes very frequently when they start do not appear dangerous."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "And then when they scale, they become very dangerous."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "So for example, if you imagine the first internal combustion engine vehicle driving down the street, and you imagine somebody running after them saying, hey, if you do enough of that, you're gonna alter the atmosphere and it's gonna change the temperature of the planet."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "It's preposterous, right?"}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Why would you stop the

I disagree with Sam on this, but he thinks about this way about AGI as well, not about artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "It's a different discussion, I think, but with viruses, it seems like something that could happen on the scale of years, maybe a few decades."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "AGI is a little bit farther out for me, but it seemed, the terrifying thing, it seemed obvious that this will happen very soon for a much deadlier virus as we get better and better at both engineering viruses and doing this kind of evolutionary driven research, gain of function research."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "Okay, but then you started speaking out about this as well, but also started to say, no, no, no, we should hurry up and figure out the origins now because it will help us figure out how to actually respond to this particular virus, how to treat this particular virus."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "What is in terms of vaccines, in terms of antiviral drugs, in terms of just all the number of responses that we should have."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "Okay, I still am much more freaking out about the future."}, {"time": 2813, "text": "Maybe you can break that apart a little bit."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "Which are you most focused on now?"}, {"time": 2823, "text": "Which are you most freaking out about now in terms of the importance of figuring out the origins of this virus?"}, {"time": 2830, "text": "I am most freaking out about both of them because they're both really important and we can put bounds on this."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "Let me say first that this is a perfect test case for the theory of close calls because as much as COVID is a disaster, it is also a close call from which we can learn much."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "You are absolutely right."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "If we keep playing this game in the lab, if we are not, if we are, especially if we do it under pressure and when we are told that a virus is going to leap from nature any day and that the more we know, the better we'll be able to fight it, we're gonna create the disaster, all the sooner."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "So yes, that should be an absolute focus."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "The fact that there were people saying that this was dangerous back in 2015 ought to tell us something."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "The fact that the system bypassed a ban and offshored the work to China ought to tell us this is not a Chinese failure."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "This is a failure of something larger and harder to see."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "But I also think that there's a clock ticking with respect to SARS CoV2 and COVID, the disease that it creates."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "And that has to do with whether or not we are stuck with it

incalculable."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "So that ought to be a very high priority, driving this extinct before it becomes permanent."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "And the ability to drive extinct goes down the longer we delay effective responses."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "To the extent that we let it have this very large canvas, large numbers of people who have the disease in which mutation and

I'm feeling the pressure of driving it extinct."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "I believe we could have driven it extinct six months ago and we didn't do it because of very mundane concerns among a small number of people."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "And I'm not alleging that they were brazen about or that they were callous about deaths that would be caused."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "I have the sense that they were working from a kind of autopilot in which you, let's say you're in some kind of a corporation, a pharmaceutical corporation, you have a portfolio of therapies that in the context of a

competitors don't."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "And lo and behold, at some point through means that I think those of us on the outside can't really intuit, you end up saying things about competing therapies that work better and much more safely than the ones you're selling that aren't true and do cause people to die in large numbers."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "But it's some kind of autopilot, at least part of it is."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "So there's a complicated coupling of the autopilot of institutions, companies, governments."}, {"time": 3053, "text": "And then there's also the geopolitical game theory thing going on where you wanna keep secrets."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "It's the Chernobyl thing where if you messed up, there's a big incentive, I think, to hide the fact that you messed up."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "So how do we fix this?"}, {"time": 3072, "text": "And what's more important to fix?"}, {"time": 3074, "text": "The autopilot, which is the response that we often criticize about our institutions, especially the leaders in those institutions, Anthony Fauci and so on, some of the members of the scientific community."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "And the second part is the game with China of hiding the information in terms of on the fight between nations."}, {"time": 3100, "text": "Well, in our live streams on Dark Horse, Heather and I have been talking from the beginning about the fact that although, yes, what happens began in China, it very much looks like a failure of the international scientific community."}, {"time": 3114, "text":

navigating a question of collective responsibility for something that has been terribly costly to all of us."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "So that's not a very happy process."}, {"time": 3137, "text":

just as a person that does not learn the lessons of their own errors doesn't get smarter and they remain in danger, we collectively, humanity has to say, well, there sure is a lot of evidence that suggests that this is a self inflicted wound."}, {"time": 3166, "text": "When you have done something that has caused a massive self inflicted wound, self inflicted wound, it makes sense to dwell on it exactly to the point that you have learned the lesson that makes it very, very unlikely that something similar will happen again."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "I think this is a good place to kind of ask you to do almost like a thought experiment or to steel man the argument against the lab leak hypothesis."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "So if you were to argue, you said 95% chance that the virus leak from a lab."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "There's a bunch of ways I think you can argue that even talking about it is bad for the world."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "So if I just put something on the table, it's to say that for one, it would be racism versus Chinese people that talking about that it leaked from a lab, there's a kind of immediate kind of blame and it can spiral down into this idea

the possibility of the lab leak hypothesis?"}, {"time": 3252, "text": "Well, so I think steel manning is a tool that is extremely valuable, but it's also possible to abuse it."}, {"time": 3262,

there's a vaccine that is very safe, though not perfectly safe."}, {"time": 5800, "text": "And we are then faced with YouTube trying to figure out what to do for somebody searching on vaccine safety."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "Suppose it is necessary in order to drive the pathogen to extinction, something like smallpox, that people get on board with the vaccine."}, {"time": 5817, "text": "But there's a tiny fringe of people who thinks that the vaccine is a mind control agent."}, {"time": 5825, "text": "So should YouTube direct people to the only claims against this vaccine, which is that it's a mind control agent when in fact the vaccine is very safe, whatever that means."}, {"time": 5842, "text": "If that were the actual configuration of the puzzle, then YouTube would be doing active harm, pointing you to this other video potentially."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "Now, yes, I would love to live in a world where people are up to the challenge of sorting that out."}, {"time": 5859, "text": "But my basic point would be, if it's an evidentiary question, and there is essentially no evidence that the vaccine is a mind control agent, and there's plenty of evidence that the vaccine is safe, then while you look for this video, we're gonna give you this one, puts it on a par, right?"}, {"time": 5875, "text": "So for the mind that's tracking how much thought is there behind it's safe versus how much thought is there behind it's a mind control agent will result in artificially elevating this."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "Now in the current case, what we've seen is not this at all."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "We have seen evidence obscured in order to create a false story about safety."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "And we saw the inverse with ivermectin."}, {"time": 5902,

thing, but I guess my point is the algorithmic solution that you point to creates a problem of its own, which is that it means that the way to get exposure is to generate something fringy."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "If you're the only thing on some fringe, then suddenly YouTube would be recommending those things, and that's obviously a gameable system at best."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "Yeah, but the solution to that, I know you're creating a thought experiment, maybe playing a little bit of a devil's advocate."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "I think the solution to that is not to limit the algorithm in the case of the super deadly virus."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "It's for the scientists to step up and become better communicators, more charismatic, fight the battle of ideas, sort of create better videos."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "Like if the virus is truly deadly, you have a lot more ammunition, a lot more data, a lot more material to work with in terms of communicating with the public."}, {"time": 5966, "text": "So be better at communicating and stop being, you have to start trusting the intelligence of people and also being transparent and playing the game of the internet, which is like, what is the internet hungry for, I believe?"}, {"time": 5980, "text": "Authenticity, stop looking like you're full of shit."}, {"time": 5986, "text": "The scientific community, if there's any flaw that I currently see, especially the people that are in public office, that like Anthony Fauci, they look like they're full of shit and I know they're brilliant."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "Why don't they look more authentic?"}, {"time": 5999, "text": "So they're losing that game and I think a lot of people observing this entire system now, younger scientists are seeing this and saying, okay, if I want to continue being a scientist in the public eye and I want to be effective at my job, I'm gonna have to be a lot more authentic."}, {"time": 6018, "text": "So they're learning the lesson, this evolutionary system is working."}, {"time": 6022, "text": "So there's just a younger generation of minds coming up that I think will do a much better job in this battle of ideas that when the much more dangerous virus comes along, they'll be able to be better communicators."}, {"time": 6034, "text": "At least that's the hope."}, {"time": 6036, "text": "Using the algorithm to control that is, I feel like is a big problem."}, {"time": 6041, "text": "So you're going to have the same problem with a deadly virus as with the current virus if you let YouTube draw hard lines by the PR and the marketing people versus the broad community of scientists."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "Well, in some sense you're suggesting something that's close kin to what I was saying about freedom of expression ultimately provides an advantage to better ideas."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "So I'm in agreement broadly speaking, but I would also say there's probably some sort of, let's imagine the world that you propose where YouTube shows you the alternative point of view."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "That has the problem that I suggest, but one thing you could do is you could give us the tools to understand what we're looking at, right?"}, {"time": 6087, "text": "You could give us, so first of all, there's something I think myopic, solipsistic, narcissistic about an algorithm that serves shareholders by showing you what you want to see rather than what you need to know, right?"}, {"time": 6102, "text": "That's the distinction is flattering you, playing to your blind spot is something that algorithm will figure out, but it's not healthy for us all to have Google playing to our blind spot."}, {"time": 6113, "text": "It's very, very dangerous."}, {"time": 6114, "text": "So what I really want is analytics that allow me or maybe options and analytics."}, {"time": 6122, "text": "The options should allow me to see what alternative perspectives are being explored, right?"}, {"time": 6129, "text": "So here's the thing I'm searching and it leads me down this road, right?"}, {"time": 6132, "text": "Let's say it's ivermectin, okay?"}, {"time": 6134, "text": "I find all of this evidence that ivermectin works."}, {"time": 6136, "text": "I find all of these discussions and people talk about various protocols and this and that."}, {"time": 6140, "text": "And then I could say, all right, what is the other side?"}, {"time": 6144, "text": "And I could see who is searching, not as individuals, but what demographics are searching alternatives."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "And maybe you could even combine it with something Reddit like where effectively, let's say that there was a position that, I don't know, that a vaccine is a mind control device and you could have a steel man this argument competition effectively and the better answers that steel man and as well as possible would rise to the top."}, {"time": 6173, "text": "And so you could read the top three or four explanations about why this really credibly is a mind control product."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "And you can say, well, that doesn't really add up."}, {"time": 6183, "text": "I can check these three things myself and they can't possibly be right, right?"}, {"time": 6187, "text": "And you could dismiss it."}, {"time": 6188, "text": "And then as an argument that was credible, let's say plate tectonics before that was an accepted concept, you'd say, wait a minute, there is evidence for plate tectonics."}, {"time": 6199, "text": "As crazy as it sounds that the continents are floating around on liquid, actually that's not so implausible."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "We've got these subduction zones, we've got a geology that is compatible, we've got puzzle piece continents that seem to fit together."}, {"time": 6213, "text": "Wow, that's a surprising amount of evidence for that position."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "So I'm gonna file some Bayesian probability with it that's updated for the fact that actually the steel man arguments better than I was expecting, right?"}, {"time": 6223, "text": "So I could imagine something like that where A, I would love the search to be indifferent to who's searching, right?"}, {"time": 6229, "text": "The solipsistic thing is too dangerous."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "So the search could be general, so we would all get a sense for what everybody else was seeing too."}, {"time": 6236, "text": "And then some layer that didn't have anything to do with what YouTube points you to or not, but allowed you to see, you know, the general pattern of adherence to searching for information."}, {"time": 6251, "text": "And again, a layer in which those things could be defended."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "So you could hear what a good argument sounded like rather than just hear a caricatured argument."}, {"time": 6259, "text": "Yeah, and also reward people, creators that have demonstrated like a track record of open mindedness and correctness as much as it could be measured over a long term and sort of, I mean, a lot of this maps to incentivizing good longterm behavior, not immediate kind of dopamine rush kind of signals."}, {"time": 6290,

7634, "text": "We call that process, which is otherwise called aging, we call it senescence."}, {"time": 7640, "text": "And senescence, in this paper, it is hypothesized, is the unavoidable downside of a cancer prevention feature of our bodies."}, {"time": 7656, "text": "That each cell has a limit on the number of times it can divide."}, {"time": 7660, "text": "There are a few cells in the body that are exceptional, but most of our cells can only divide a limited number of times."}, {"time": 7666, "text": "That's called the Hayflick limit."}, {"time": 7667, "text": "And the Hayflick limit reduces the ability of the organism to replace tissues."}, {"time": 7675, "text": "It therefore results in a failure over time of maintenance and repair."}, {"time": 7681, "text": "And that explains why we become decrepit as we grow old."}, {"time": 7686, "text": "The question was why would that be, especially in light of the fact that the mechanism that seems to limit the ability of cells to reproduce is something called a telomere."}, {"time": 7698, "text": "Telomere is a, it's not a gene, but it's a DNA sequence at the ends of our chromosomes that is just simply repetitive."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "And the number of repeats functions like a counter."}, {"time": 7710, "text": "So there's a number of repeats that you have after development is finished."}, {"time": 7714, "text": "And then each time the cell divides a little bit of telomere is lost."}, {"time": 7717, "text": "And at the point that the telomere becomes critically short, the cell stops dividing even though it still has the capacity to do so."}, {"time": 7724, "text": "Stops dividing and it starts transcribing different genes than it did when it had more telomere."}, {"time": 7730, "text": "So what my work did was it looked at the fact that the telomeric shortening was being studied by two different groups."}, {"time": 7737, "text": "It was being studied by people who were interested in counteracting the aging process."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "And it was being studied in exactly the opposite fashion by people who were interested in tumorigenesis and cancer."}, {"time": 7750, "text": "The thought being because it was true that when one looked into tumors, they always had telomerase active."}, {"time": 7756, "text": "That's the enzyme that lengthens our telomeres."}, {"time": 7759, "text": "So those folks were interested in bringing about a halt to the lengthening of telomeres in order to counteract cancer."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "And the folks who were studying the senescence process were interested in lengthening telomeres in order to generate greater repair capacity."}, {"time": 7775, "text": "And my point was evolutionarily speaking, this looks like a pleiotropic effect that the genes which create the tendency of the cells to be limited in their capacity to replace themselves are providing a benefit in youth, which is that we are largely free of tumors and cancer at the inevitable late life cost that we grow feeble and inefficient and eventually die."}, {"time": 7804, "text": "And that matches a very old hypothesis in evolutionary theory by somebody I was fortunate enough to know, George Williams, one of the great 20th century evolutionists who argued that senescence would have to be caused by pleiotropic genes that cause early life benefits at unavoidable late life costs."}, {"time": 7826, "text": "And although this isn't the exact nature of the system, he predicted it matches what he was expecting in many regards to a shocking degree."}, {"time": 7835,

the abstract."}, {"time": 7849, "text": "We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols designed to increase reproductive output, simultaneously exert strong selection against reproductive senescence and virtually eliminate selection that would otherwise favor tumor suppression."}, {"time": 7863, "text": "This appears to have greatly elongated the telomeres of laboratory mice."}, {"time": 7867, "text": "With their telomeric failsafe effectively disabled, these animals are unreliable models of normal senescence and tumor formation."}, {"time": 7875, "text": "So basically using these mice is not going to lead to the right kinds of conclusions."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "Safety tests employing these animals likely overestimate cancer risks and underestimate tissue damage and consequent accelerated senescence."}, {"time": 7892, "text": "So I think, especially with your discussion with Eric, the conclusion of this paper has to do with the fact that, like we shouldn't be using these mice to test the safety or to make conclusions about cancer or senescence."}, {"time": 7913, "text": "Is that the basic takeaway?"}, {"time": 7915, "text": "Like basically saying that the length of these telomeres is an important variable to consider."}, {"time": 7921, "text": "I think there was a reason that the world of scientists who was working on telomeres did not spot the pleiotropic relationship that was the key argument in my paper."}, {"time": 7936, "text": "The reason they didn't spot it was that there was a result that everybody knew, which seemed inconsistent."},

very long lives is, but in the end, I was confronted with a hypothesis that would explain a great many features of the way mammals and indeed vertebrates age, but it was inconsistent with one result."}, {"time": 7966, "text": "And at first I thought, maybe there's something wrong with the result."}, {"time": 7970, "text": "Maybe this is one of these cases where the result was achieved once through some bad protocol and everybody else was repeating it, didn't turn out to be the case."}, {"time": 7978, "text": "Many laboratories had established that mice had ultra long telomeres."}, {"time": 7982, "text": "And so I began to wonder whether or not there was something about the breeding protocols that generated these mice."}, {"time": 7991, "text": "And what that would predict is that the mice that have long telomeres would be laboratory mice and that wild mice would not."}, {"time": 7998, "text": "And Carol Greider, who agreed to collaborate with me, tested that hypothesis and showed that it was indeed true, that wild derived mice, or at least mice that had been in captivity for a much shorter period of time did not have ultra long telomeres."}, {"time": 8015, "text": "Now, what this implied though, as you read, is that our breeding protocols generate lengthening of telomeres."}, {"time": 8023, "text": "And the implication of that is that the animals that have these very long telomeres will be hyper prone to create tumors."}, {"time": 8030, "text": "They will be extremely resistant to toxins because they have effectively an infinite capacity to replace any damaged tissue."}, {"time": 8038, "text": "And so ironically, if you give one of these ultra long telomere lab mice a toxin, if the toxin doesn't outright kill it, it may actually increase its lifespan because it functions as a kind of chemotherapy."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "So the reason that chemotherapy works is that dividing cells are more vulnerable than cells that are not dividing."}, {"time": 8061, "text": "And so if this mouse has effectively had its cancer protection turned off, and it has cells dividing too rapidly, and you give it a toxin, you will slow down its tumors faster than you harm its other tissues."}, {"time": 8073, "text": "And so you'll get a paradoxical result that actually some drug that's toxic seems to benefit the mouse."}, {"time": 8080, "text": "Now, I don't think that that was understood before I published my paper."}, {"time": 8084, "text": "Now I'm pretty sure it has to be."}, {"time": 8086, "text": "And the problem is that this actually is a system that serves pharmaceutical companies that have the difficult job of bringing compounds to market, many of which will be toxic."}, {"time": 8099, "text": "Maybe all of them will be toxic."}, {"time": 8101, "text": "And these mice predispose our system to declare these toxic compounds safe."}, {"time": 8107, "text": "And in fact, I believe we've seen the errors that result from using these mice a number of times, most famously with Vioxx, which turned out to do conspicuous heart damage."}, {"time": 8118, "text": "Why do you think this paper and this idea has not gotten significant traction?"}, {"time": 8123, "text": "Well, my collaborator, Carol Greider, said something to me that rings in my ears to this day."}, {"time": 8132, "text": "She initially, after she showed that laboratory mice have anomalously long telomeres and that wild mice don't have long telomeres, I asked her where she was going to publish that result so that I could cite it in my paper."},

8154, "text": "I didn't really understand what she was saying."}, {"time": 8156, "text": "But in some sense, the knowledge that a model organism is broken in a way that creates the likelihood that certain results will be reliably generateable, you can publish a paper and make a big splash with such a thing, or you can exploit the fact that you know how those models will misbehave and other people don't."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "So there's a question, if somebody is motivated cynically and what they want to do is appear to have deeper insight into biology because they predict things better than others do, knowing where the flaw is so that your predictions come out true is advantageous."}, {"time": 8194, "text": "At the same time, I can't help but imagine that the pharmaceutical industry, when it figured out that the mice were predisposed to suggest that drugs were safe, didn't leap to fix the problem because in some sense, it was the perfect cover for the difficult job of bringing drugs to market and then discovering their actual toxicity profile, right?"}, {"time": 8217, "text": "This made things look safer than they were and I believe a lot of profits have likely been generated downstream."}, {"time": 8224, "text": "So to kind of play devil's advocate, it's also possible that this particular, the length of the telomeres is not a strong variable for the drug development and for the conclusions that Carol and others have been studying."}, {"time": 8238, "text": "Is it possible for that to be the case?"}, {"time": 8242, "text": "So one reason she and others could be ignoring this is because it's not a strong variable."}, {"time": 8249, "text": "Well, I don't believe so and in fact, at the point that I went to publish my paper, Carol published her result."}, {"time": 8256, "text": "She did so in a way that did not make a huge splash."}, {"time": 8259, "text": "Did she, I apologize if I don't know how, what was the emphasis of her publication of that paper?"}, {"time": 8269, "text": "Was it purely just kind of showing data or is there more, because in your paper, there's a kind of more of a philosophical statement as well."}, {"time": 8277,
