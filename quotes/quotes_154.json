pandemic feels like everybody is already at an eight."}, {"time": 388, "text": "So anything that comes along, it's like light it all on fire, you know, burn it down."}, {"time": 393, "text": "Like that's part of what I think is part of the reason for a lot of the looting and the riots and all the chaos."}, {"time": 399, "text": "It's not just the people that are at work, but it's also that everyone feels so tense already and everyone feels so helpless."}, {"time": 407, "text": "And it's like, you know, doing something like that makes people, it just, it gives people a whole new motivation for chaos, a whole new motivation for doing destructive things that I've never experienced in my life."}, {"time": 427, "text": "And your better days when you see a positive future, what do you think is the way out of this chaos of 2020?"}, {"time": 435, "text": "Like if you visualize a 2025, that's a better world than today."}, {"time": 440, "text": "How do we get there and what does that look like?"}, {"time": 446, "text": "I can honestly say I don't know."}, {"time": 449, "text": "And I wouldn't have said I don't know a year ago."}, {"time": 452, "text": "A year ago, I would have said, we're gonna be okay."}, {"time": 454, "text": "As much as people hate Trump, the economy is doing great."}, {"time": 458, "text": "I think we're gonna be fine."}, {"time": 459, "text": "That's not how I feel today."}, {"time": 461, "text": "Today, I don't think there's a clear solution politically because I think if Trump wins, people are gonna be furious."}, {"time": 468, "text": "And I think if Biden wins, people are gonna be furious."}, {"time": 472, "text": "Particularly like if things get more woke, if people continue to enforce this force compliance and make people behave a certain way and act a certain way, which seems to be a part of what this whole woke thing is."}, {"time": 487, "text": "The most disturbing for me is that I see what's going on."}, {"time": 490, "text": "I see there's a lot of losers that have hopped on this and they shove it in people's faces and it doesn't have to make sense."}, {"time": 498, "text": "Like there was a Black Lives Matter protest that stopped this woman at a restaurant."}, {"time": 503, "text": "They were surrounding her outside a restaurant."}, {"time": 505, "text": "They were forcing her to raise her fist in compliance."}, {"time": 508, "text": "This is a woman who's marched for Black Lives multiple times, Black Lives Matter multiple times."}, {"time": 513, "text": "And the people all around her doing this were all white."}, {"time": 516, "text": "It's all weird."}, {"time": 517, "text": "My friend, Coach T, he's a wrestling coach, is also on a podcast, my friend, Brian Moses."}, {"time": 522, "text": "His take on it is that black, and he's a black guy."}, {"time": 525, "text": "He says, Black Lives Matter is a white cult."}, {"time": 527, "text": "And I'm like, when you see that picture, it's hard to argue that he's got a point."}, {"time": 532, "text": "I mean, it's clearly not all about that, but there's a lot of people that have jumped on board that are very much like cult members."}, {"time": 540, "text": "Because the thing about Black Lives Matter or any movement is you can't control who joins."}, {"time": 547, "text": "There's no entrance examination."}, {"time": 550, "text": "So you don't go, okay, how do you feel about this?"}, {"time": 552, "text": "What's your perceptions on that?"}, {"time": 553, "text": "Like the man who shot the Trump supporter in Portland, that guy who murdered the Trump supporter then the cops shot him."}, {"time": 561, "text": "That guy was walking around with his hand on his gun looking for Trump supporters."}, {"time": 567, "text": "Just want, I mean, he's a known violent guy who was walking around looking for Trump supporters, found one and shot one."}, {"time": 574, "text": "That has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter."}, {"time": 576, "text": "He's a white guy, he shot another white guy."}, {"time": 578, "text": "It's just madness."}, {"time": 580, "text": "And that kind of madness is, it's disturbing to see it ramp up so quickly."}, {"time": 587, "text": "I mean, there's been riots in Portland every night."}, {"time": 591, "text": "Oh, excuse me, demonstrations for 101 days now."}, {"time": 595, "text": "101 days in a row of them lighting things on fire, breaking into federal buildings."}, {"time": 599, "text": "It's like, whoever saw that coming?"}, {"time": 602, "text": "Nobody saw that coming."}, {"time": 603, "text": "So I don't know what the solution is and I don't know what it looks like in five years."}, {"time": 609, "text": "But 2025, to answer your question, like it could be anything."}, {"time": 612, "text": "I mean, we could be looking at Mad Max."}, {"time": 614, "text": "We could be looking at the apocalypse."}, {"time": 616, "text": "We could also be looking at an invasion from another country."}, {"time": 620, "text": "We could be looking at a war, like a real hot war."}, {"time": 625, "text": "To put a little bit of responsibility on you, like for me, I've listened to you since the Red Band, Olive Garden days, that's the very beginning."}, {"time": 633, "text": "And there was something in the way you communicated about the world, maybe there was others, but you're the one I was aware of, is you're open minded and like loving towards the world, especially as the podcast developed."}, {"time": 645, "text": "Like you just demonstrated and lived this kind of just kindness, or maybe even like lack of jealousy in your own little profession of comedy."}, {"time": 655, "text": "It was clear that you didn't succumb to the weaker aspects of human nature and thereby inspire like people like me, who I was naturally, probably especially in like the 20s, early 20s, kind of jealous on the success of others."}, {"time": 672, "text": "And you're really the primary person that taught me to truly celebrate the success of others."}, {"time": 679, "text": "And so by way of question, you kind of have a role in this of making a better 2025."}, {"time": 686, "text": "You have such a big megaphone."}, {"time": 687, "text": "Is there something you think you can do on this podcast with the words, the way you talk, the things you discuss that could create a better 2025?"}, {"time": 699, "text": "I think if anything, I could help in leading by example, but that's only gonna help the people that are listening."}, {"time": 710, "text": "I don't know what else I can do in terms of like make the world a better place, other than express my hopes and wishes for that and just try to be as nice as I can to people as often as I can."}, {"time": 724, "text": "But I also think that I've fallen into this weird category, particularly with the Spotify deal, where I'm one of them now."}, {"time": 732, "text": "I'm not a regular person anymore."}, {"time": 735, "text": "Now I'm like some famous rich guy."}, {"time": 738, "text": "So you go from being a regular person to a famous rich guy that's out of touch."}, {"time": 743, "text": "And that's a real issue whenever you're talking about the economy, about just real life problems."}, {"time": 752, "text": "It kind of hurts my heart to hear people say about Elon Musk, he's just a billionaire."}, {"time": 756, "text": "It's an interesting statement."}, {"time": 758, "text": "But I think if you just continue being you and he continue being him, I think people are just voicing their worry that you become some rich guy."}, {"time": 769, "text": "I don't even know if they're doing that."}, {"time": 771, "text": "I think they're just finding, the way he describes it, an attack vector."}, {"time": 775, "text": "Yeah, and I think he's right."}, {"time": 778, "text": "I think they can dismiss you by just saying, oh, you're just a that."}, {"time": 783, "text": "You're easily definable."}, {"time": 788, "text": "Right, but there's truth to that."}, {"time": 791, "text": "If you're not careful, you can become out of touch."}, {"time": 794, "text": "But that's an interesting thing."}, {"time": 797, "text": "Why haven't you become out of touch?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "As a human off the podcast, you don't act like a, like you talk to somebody like me."}, {"time": 806, "text": "You don't talk like a famous person or you don't act rich, like you're better than others."}, {"time": 813, "text": "There's a certain, listen, I've talked to quite a few, you have too, but I've talked to a special kind of group of people that are like Nobel Prize winners, let's say."}, {"time": 822, "text": "They sometimes have an air to them that's of arrogance."}, {"time": 827, "text": "And you don't, what's that about?"}, {"time": 829, "text": "Well, you gotta know what that is, right?"}, {"time": 831, "text": "Like that air of arrogance comes from drinking your own Koolaid."}, {"time": 837, "text": "You start believing that somehow or another, just because you're getting praise from all these people, that you really are something different."}, {"time": 844, "text": "Usually it exemplifies, there's something there where there's a lack of struggle."}, {"time": 851, "text": "And I think a struggle is probably one of the most important balancing tools that a person can have."}, {"time": 864, "text": "And for me, I struggle mentally and I struggle physically."}, {"time": 869, "text": "I struggle mentally in that, like we were talking about on the podcast we did previously, you and I on my podcast said, I'm not a fan of my work."}, {"time": 877, "text": "I'm not a fan of what I do."}, {"time": 878, "text": "I'm my harshest critic."}, {"time": 881, "text": "So anytime anybody says something bad about me, I'm like, listen, I said way worse about myself."}, {"time": 886, "text": "I don't like anything I do."}, {"time": 890, "text": "I'm ruthlessly introspective."}, {"time": 893, "text": "And I will continue to be that way."}, {"time": 894, "text": "Cause that's the only way you could be good as a comedian."}, {"time": 897, "text": "There's no other way."}, {"time": 897, "text": "You can't just think you're awesome and just go out there."}, {"time": 899, "text": "You have to be like picking apart everything you do."}, {"time": 903, "text": "But there's a balance to that too, cause you have to have enough confidence to go out there and perform."}, {"time": 906, "text": "You can't think, oh my God, I suck."}, {"time": 908, "text": "I know what I'm doing, but I know what I'm doing because I put in all that work."}, {"time": 911, "text": "And one of the reasons why I put in all that work is I don't like the end result most of the time."}, {"time": 917, "text": "So I need to work at it all the time."}, {"time": 919, "text": "And then there's physical struggle, which I think balances everything out."}, {"time": 923, "text": "Without physical struggle, I always make the analogy that the body is in a lot of ways like a battery, where if you have extra charge, it's like it leaks out of the top and it becomes unmanageable and messy."}, {"time": 937, "text": "And that's how my psyche is."}, {"time": 939, "text": "If I have too much energy, if I'm not exerting myself in a violent way, like an explosive way, like wearing myself out, I just don't like the way the world is."}, {"time": 952, "text": "I don't like the way I interface with the world."}, {"time": 954, "text": "I'm too tense."}, {"time": 956, "text": "I'm too quick to be upset about things."}, {"time": 960, "text": "But when I work out hard and I put in a brutal training session, everything's fine."}, {"time": 967, "text": "Well, the first time I talked to you, Jerry, you were doing Sober October."}, {"time": 975, "text": "And there's something in your eyes, like I think you've talked about that you exercise the demons out essentially."}, {"time": 982, "text": "So you exercise to get whatever the parts of you that you don't like out."}, {"time": 987, "text": "There's a darkness in you there, like the competitiveness and the focus of that person."}, {"time": 994, "text": "That was a scary time in a lot of ways, that Sober October thing."}, {"time": 998, "text": "Because my friends, we were all talking shit, right?"}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Because we're competing against each other in these fitness challenges."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "And you had one point, like you got a certain amount of points for each minute that you went at 80% of your max heart rate."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "And one day I got 1100 points."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "So I did seven hours on an elliptical machine watching the bathhouse scene from John Wick where he murders all those people in the bathhouse."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "I watched it probably 50 times in a row."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "I went crazy."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "I went crazy, but I went crazy in a weird way where it brought me back to my fighting days."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "It was like the same, that person came out again."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "It was like, well, I didn't even know he was in there."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "It's like they're like an assassin, like a killer."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "Like I felt like a different person."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "Is it echoes of like what Mike Tyson talked about essentially?"}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Like the... Maybe, but no orgasm in the oceans."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "All the crazy shit that he was saying."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "Is there a violent person in there?"}, {"time": 1064, "text": "Yeah, there's a lot of violence in me for sure."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "I don't know if it's genetic or learned or it's because during my formative years from the time I was 15 till I was 22, all I did was fight."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "That was all I did."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "All I did was train and compete."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "That's all I did."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "That was my whole life."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "Is it connected to..."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "So your mom and dad broke up early on."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "Is it connected to the dad at all?"}, {"time": 1090, "text": "I'm sure it's connected to him also because he was violent and it made me feel very scared to be around him."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "But I also think it's connected in who he was as a human is transferred into my DNA."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "I think there's a certain amount of..."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "I mean, to be prejudiced against myself, I look like a violent person."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "If I didn't know me, even the way I'm built, not even just the working out part, just the size of my hands and there's the width of my shoulders."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "There's most likely a lot of violence in my history, in my past, in my ancestry."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "And I think we minimize that with people."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So much of your behavior, when I see my daughter, I have one daughter that's obsessive in terms of she wants to get really good at things and she'll practice things all day long."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "And it's 100% my personality."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "She's me in female form."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "But without the anger as much and without the fear, she has loving household and everything like that."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "But she has this intense obsession with doing things and doing things really well and getting better."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "What's the point?"}, {"time": 1164, "text": "We have to tell her, stop doing hand springs in the house."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "Stop, stop, come on, just sit down, have dinner."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "Like one more, one more."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "Like she's just like, she's psycho."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And I think there's a lot of behavior and personality and a lot of these things are passed down through genetics."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "We don't really know, right?"}, {"time": 1187, "text": "We don't know how much of who you are genetically is learned behavior, nature or nurture."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "We don't know if it's learned behavior or whether or not it's something that's intrinsically a part of you because of who your parents were."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "I think there's certainly some genetic violence in me."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "There's certainly."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "And then you channeled it."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "So you figured out it's basically your life is a productive exploration of how to channel that."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "Yes, how to figure out how to get that monkey to sit down and calm down."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "There's another person in there."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "Like there's a calm, rational, kind, friendly person who just wants to laugh and have fun."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "And then there's that dude who comes out when I did Sober October."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "That guy's scary."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "I don't like that guy."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "That guy just wants to get up in the morning and go."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "It's like, I mean, when I was competing, it was necessary."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "But it makes me remember."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "I didn't really remember what I used to be like until that."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "It's like when I'm working out seven hours a day and just so obsessed."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And all I was thinking about was winning."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "That's all I was thinking about."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Like if they were working out five hours a day, I wanted them to know that I was gonna work out an extra three hours and I was gonna get up early and I was gonna text them all."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "Hey, pussies, I'm up already."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "Take pictures, send selfies."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "I was like, you're gonna die."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "I kept telling them, you're all gonna die."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "You try to keep up with me, you're gonna die."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "You weren't fully joking."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "No, I wasn't joking at all."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "That's what was fucked up about it."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "This is the scary thing when I interacted with Goggins and what I saw in you during that time is like, this guy, like, this is why I've been avoiding David Ganga's recently."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "Is like, cause he wants to meet, he wants to talk on this podcast, but he also wants to run an ultra marathon with me."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "And I felt like this is a person, if I spend any time in this realm, if I spend any time with a Joe Rogan of that sober October, like, I might have to die to get out."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "Like, there's this kind of... Yeah, there's a competitive aspect that's super unhealthy."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "I mean, you saw the video that we watched earlier today of Goggins draining his knee."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "That would stop me from running ever again because I would think in my head, okay, I'm gonna ruin my cartilage."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "I'm gonna need a knee replacement."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "I would start thinking, I would go down that line, but he is perpetually in this push it mindset, what he calls the dog in him."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "That dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dog."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "And that's who he is."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "That's one of the reasons why he's so inspirational and he's fuel for millions and millions of people."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "I mean, he really is."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "He motivates people in a way that is so powerful, but it can be very destructive."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "I know now, especially after the sober October thing, that that thing's still in me."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "I didn't know, so I really haven't done anything physically competitive, except one time I was supposed to fight Wesley Snipes."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "It came out then too."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "That came out too."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "That got creepy too, but luckily that never happened."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "But that was many months of training, like training twice a day, every day, kickboxing in the morning, jiu jitsu at night."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "I was just going and going and going and going."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "And I was just thinking just all day long."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "But it fucks with all the other aspects of your life."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "It fucks with your friendships."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "It fucks with my comedy."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "It fucks with everything."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Because that mindset is not a mindset of an artist."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "It's a mindset of a conqueror."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "The conqueror."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "Destroyer."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "That's why it's so interesting to see Mike Tyson make the switch."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "It's clear that whatever that is, however that fight goes, there's a switch."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "He stepped into a different dimension."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Roy Jones Jr. is coming on my podcast soon."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "And Roy's going to be on before the fight."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "I'm so curious to see how it goes down, but genuinely concerned."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "Because Mike Tyson is a heavyweight."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "And Roy Jones at his best was 168 pounds."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And that's a lot."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "I don't know if Roy has that room in his house, mental house, of where Mike Tyson goes."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "I don't know if he has that room."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "Mike doesn't have a room."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "He's got an empire in there."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "He opens up the door."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "There's a whole empire in his head."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "And he's in that firmly."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "When he got out of the weed and started training again, you could see it in him."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "And by the way, physically, in person, he looks spectacular."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "He looks like a fucking Adonis."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "I mean, he looks ready to go."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "Yeah, I watch his videos of him."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "What about you?"}, {"time": 1465, "text": "Have you ever considered competing in jiu jitsu?"}, {"time": 1468, "text": "No, for that very reason."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "I don't want to get obsessed."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "That's my number one concern."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "I had to quit video games when we were playing video games in the studio."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "I had to quit because I was playing five hours a day, like out of nowhere."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "All of a sudden, I was playing five hours a day."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "I was coming home late for dinner."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "I was ending podcasts early and jumping on the video games and playing."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "I get obsessed with things."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "And I have to recognize what that is and these competitive things, like competitive, especially like really exciting competitive things like video games."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "They're very dangerous for me."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "The ultimate competitive video game is like jiu jitsu."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And if I was young, I most certainly would have done it."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "If I didn't have a very clear career path, it was something that I enjoyed."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "My concern would be that I would become a professional jiu jitsu fighter when I was young."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "And then I would not have the energy to do stand up and do all the other things

to."}, {"time": 2649, "text": "First of all, I have what you call fuck you money."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "And if you have fuck you money, you don't say fuck you."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "What's the point of having the fuck you money?"}, {"time": 2658, "text": "You're wasting it."}, {"time": 2659, "text": "Like you're wasting the position."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "Like someone said to me like, why do you like sports cars so much?"}, {"time": 2664, "text": "Like how many cars do you have, a bunch of cars?"}, {"time": 2666, "text": "Because if I was a kid and I said, hey, if I was that crazy rich famous guy, like I don't want to have a bunch of cool fucking cars."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "Like, so I would do that."}, {"time": 2676, "text": "Like, cause not everybody gets to do that."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "Like if you're the person that gets to do that, you're kind of supposed to do it."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "Like that's if you want to, if that really does speak to you."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "And, you know, I've talked to you about this before, muscle cars, specifically ones from the 1960s and the early seventies."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "They speak to me in some weird way, man."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "I could just stare at them."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "Like I have a 65 Corvette."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "I walk around it sometimes at night when

just love muscle cars for whatever reason."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "But the point is like, I like what I like."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "And if I can do what I want to do, I should do what I want to do."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "And it's not hurting anybody."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "And the thing is like, I would do the Duncan podcast if no one was listening, right?"}, {"time": 2745,

"I think about on a technical side, by the way."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "When I heard you say that, cause I've been thinking, I was like, whoa, that's interesting."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "It might be, they might be alive because they, I don't know what the fuck they are, but when someone has an idea for, you know, whatever an invention, a toaster, and then they think about this, all it

that ideas like creativity, like we are the only animal other than, there's a few species that create things like bees make beehives and, but it's very, they're very uniform, you know, some animals use tools, you know, like, you know, champs will use like sticks to get termites and things like that."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "But there's something about what we do that's, it makes you wonder."},

others inventions and proved and innovated."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "These all came out of ideas."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "Like the idea, it germinates in someone's head, it bounces around, they write it down, they share it with others, the other people who have similar ideas or ideas that are complimentary, they work together and they change the world."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "And the new

come up with a bit, that's why I'm always telling people about the Steven Pressfield book, The War of Art, because he talks about respecting the muse and the idea that your ideas come when you sit down and you do the work or you sit down like a professional and you talk to the muse, like come tell me what to do."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "Like if the muse was a real thing, as if the muse is

idea."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "And then all of a sudden I can't stop."}, {"time": 2983, "text": "And then, you know, it was a couple hours later and I'm like, whoa."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "And

3003, "text": "Like he seems to have a podcast that's popular."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "I'm gonna breed inside his brain and spread it to others."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "It's the same as."},

the frequency that your mind operates under has to be correct."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "Because one of the things about creativity seems to be if you think about yourself a lot, if you're really into yourself or your image or you're selfish, those ideas are not, they don't find you."}, {"time": 3045, "text": "Yeah, it's funny."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "It stifles the creative."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "Yeah, it stifles the opportunity that the idea has to find you."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "Yes, which is one of the reasons why joke thieves, people that steal jokes are terrible

ideas."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "Because the thing that would make you steal a person's idea is that ego part, the like the wanting to claim it for yourself, the wanting to be the man or the woman."}, {"time": 3083, "text": "You know, I wanna be the person who gets out there and says it and everybody's gonna love me for it."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "Like you can't think like that and be creative."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "It requires a humility and it requires a detachment from self in order to create."}, {"time": 3096, "text": "Like when I'm writing, I'm blank."}, {"time": 3099,

just run out of the room real quick and I write it down on my phone and then I can come back."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "Because those are like little gifts that you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhere."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "And some people rely only on those gifts, you know?"}, {"time": 3151, "text": "And I've talked to comics about it."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "They're like,

smart."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "And he's so good as an audio engineer and as a podcast producer, he's the best."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "But he's basically one of the only people on this whole

that could, you basically kind of, well."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "Well, here's the problem with the cohost."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "Like when you and I are talking, when we're talking, I'm tuned in to you and I'm waiting to hear what you're saying and I'm listening and I'm interpreting it."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "And then I'm calculating whether or not I have anything to say, whether to

there's another person there chiming in too, it fucks the dance up."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "It's like dancing."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "Like if you're doing a dance with someone, like if you're

all together."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "On that point, one of the interesting things about your show is you don't almost never have done, and you just generally don't do remote, sorry, not remote
