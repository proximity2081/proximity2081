"text": "I think it's unfortunate that we didn't get to, or no one got to really examine this individual's brain and this person and why they thought the way they thought."}, {"time": 418, "text": "Because that's always been the biggest thing for me is I'm really curious about why people do what they do, like deeply, deeply curious about it."}, {"time": 427, "text": "I'm not sure who's more interesting, the people that follow Hitler or Hitler himself."}, {"time": 432, "text": "So I mean, the question that's coupled with that is, would history roll out in similar ways even if there wasn't a Hitler?"}, {"time": 440, "text": "It's the people that created Hitler or did Hitler create the events of World War II?"}, {"time": 446, "text": "I think the people would be more interesting in my opinion."}, {"time": 449, "text": "That seems to be the, that the charismatic leaders are all out there."}, {"time": 454, "text": "The failed artists in the case of Hitler, they're all out there and it's just when there's this environment of anger and fear, charismatic leaders can take over and it doesn't matter if they're evil or good."}, {"time": 468, "text": "It's like a roll of the dice in terms of history, how evil, how truly insane they are."}, {"time": 475, "text": "I think Stalin was much more cold in calculating."}, {"time": 480, "text": "He wasn't as insane as Hitler."}, {"time": 482, "text": "Hitler was legitimately insane, like especially later on in the war where he would do irrational actions I would say."}, {"time": 490, "text": "But that's like a weird roll of the dice."}, {"time": 493, "text": "You could have gotten a totally different leader."}, {"time": 497, "text": "Wanting to take over the entirety of Europe and then invading Russia, that's like insanity."}, {"time": 503, "text": "Yeah, just even, just the first part of that wanting to take over Europe, if you really think about the scale, if you really sit down and go, this one individual was like, I want all of this."}, {"time": 515, "text": "If you really sat down and you were to sit down and put him in his traits that we know of into any sort of document nowadays that deems somebody a psychopath or a narcissist, this guy would set it on fire."}, {"time": 530, "text": "He himself was so, I think so damaged and he reminds me a lot of people now who struggle to find their way."}, {"time": 540, "text": "He reminds me a lot of angry individuals who are told no, either by women or by business or by whatever the sector they're in."}, {"time": 550, "text": "He reminds me very much of that like, what's the word I'm looking for?"}, {"time": 555, "text": "Just that individual who's just like, the world is shit and the world owes me everything."}, {"time": 560, "text": "It's that mentality."}, {"time": 562, "text": "He really came from that it seems like."}, {"time": 565, "text": "And when you foster that too long, you get that."}, {"time": 568, "text": "There's a book called, what is it, Man From Underground by Dostoevsky, I might be misnaming the book, but it's about the bitterness of a man."}, {"time": 578, "text": "It breeds within his mind and it just grows, that bitterness."}, {"time": 582, "text": "I mean, we all have that sort of resenting of the world when you're younger, when you have a choice."}, {"time": 590, "text": "When you fail, do you blame the world or do you hold, it's the Jaco thing, do you carry the responsibility of that and become a better man or woman because of that?"}, {"time": 602, "text": "That's the decision."}, {"time": 603, "text": "And in some sense, I mean, unfortunately, see that's because he took responsibility and leadership."}, {"time": 610, "text": "I know you can't say he wasn't a leader."}, {"time": 615, "text": "So it's not that he's a failure."}, {"time": 617, "text": "He's not a failure, but you can't say he's powerless, did not take action."}, {"time": 623, "text": "I think he's just basically a embodiment of the anger and the fear of people at the time."}, {"time": 629, "text": "But the insanity of, obviously, many of my relatives, not just murdering them, but putting them in camps and torturing them, but many of those people, Jewish people, were also some of the best scientists."}, {"time": 642, "text": "The insanity of murdering some of the best Germans, it makes no sense."}, {"time": 649, "text": "So that's why it's fascinating to kind of look back at that time in history and think, are these the same humans?"}, {"time": 657, "text": "And also, are there echoes of that now?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "And is that going to happen again?"}, {"time": 664, "text": "Is there going to be a World War III in some other kind of way?"}, {"time": 668, "text": "Is there going to be some mass scale injustice in some other kind of way, which we're not yet, because of our blindness and maybe not learning the lessons of history, will allow it to happen again?"}, {"time": 683, "text": "And then obviously, it's a very common thing to whatever political leader you don't like, to call them Hitler."}, {"time": 690, "text": "Which is, that to me, I got to tell you, when somebody calls somebody Hitler, the weight behind that has been completely lost in this generation."}, {"time": 700, "text": "This generation does not understand what that truly means to call someone Hitler or a Nazi."}, {"time": 707, "text": "Or Stalin."}, {"time": 708, "text": "To be honest, the starvation, I've just been talking to a lot of folks recently, especially like North Korea, with Wyoming Park, starvation."}, {"time": 718, "text": "And I remember from my grandmother, it wasn't, time and time again, not having food to eat is the thing that people say is the worst, everything."}, {"time": 730, "text": "It's way worse than murder, not having food, and the places that takes your mind and the actions that forces you to do, that's terrifying."}, {"time": 739, "text": "And all of that seems very distant in our history."}, {"time": 742, "text": "Yeah, I love her."}, {"time": 743, "text": "I watched that interview with her."}, {"time": 746, "text": "She is, I want to talk to that woman so bad, because when she was on Joe and she sat there and said, Joe's like, do you, have you done any therapy?"}, {"time": 753, "text": "And she laughed."}, {"time": 754, "text": "I was like, oh, that's my girl."}, {"time": 756, "text": "It's such a fascinating, I mean, I would love for you to kind of talk to her and explore her mind, because we kind of explored her story and that's, there's power and importance to her story, but it's so difficult to understand, like, how does she become healthier and better?"}, {"time": 776, "text": "Even more so than she's already, she's, she's recovered quite a bit, you know, she's found herself quite a bit, but I wonder, is she haunted?"}, {"time": 785, "text": "You're saying questions I want to ask."}, {"time": 787, "text": "Like, that's what I mean, because after being in a war, there are certain things, there are certain atrocities that you see that, it doesn't matter the therapy that you do."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And I don't care what all the special ops guys say, like, I know plenty of them that have a light switch and they turn it off and they can function, but I also know them when they've been out for 10 years."}, {"time": 806, "text": "There's things that haunt people differently, but there's no way, there's not something going on there deeply."}, {"time": 813, "text": "Yeah, but there's also extra levels of complexity in her case because, I mean, this is what, just looking at history about family, is she spent much of her early life loving the dictator, right?"}, {"time": 834, "text": "We like the water or something."}, {"time": 836, "text": "We like water or we like this because there is no, like, individual, like, when they said there was no love or anything."}, {"time": 841, "text": "But there is a love for the... Just that individual."}, {"time": 844, "text": "For that individual."}, {"time": 845, "text": "And so, I mean, it's like the ultimate abusive relationship."}, {"time": 852, "text": "But it's still love, like you don't know the alternative."}, {"time": 855, "text": "So it's not even, it's complicated because, like, I wonder if she truly explored it what you would find because the trauma, much of her trauma, I think comes from when she was escaping North Korea, treatment by China."}, {"time": 874, "text": "It's like the... And her mom and what she had to witness within that and being helpless with that on her own."}, {"time": 879, "text": "So it's like evil men essentially abusing her, trading her, you know, and doing so nonchalantly, like it's part of just the way of life that I wonder if she sees kind of, yeah, it's so complicated because childhood..."}, {"time": 894, "text": "It would be normal to her because she didn't know any different."}, {"time": 898, "text": "Like there's... Like I grew up poor, but I never sensed that."}, {"time": 904, "text": "Because your parents didn't make you."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Well, and everyone else around was too."}, {"time": 909, "text": "And so you don't notice it."}, {"time": 910, "text": "I mean, it's a cultural thing."}, {"time": 911, "text": "So the way you grow up, you only start to notice it when you compare yourself to others, when you learn of the alternative."}, {"time": 918, "text": "That's the dark reality when you're abused."}, {"time": 920, "text": "You truly begin to suffer in some kind of way when you understand that you were being abused."}, {"time": 932, "text": "That's a dark kind of thought that I wonder if you live your whole life just in that abuse, if you don't know better, that that's a safer... That's like, what's a better life, suffering and then learning that you were suffering or just suffering until your last days."}, {"time": 951, "text": "There's two ways to look at this."}, {"time": 952, "text": "I'd argue on one side that suffering and suffering until you die, you know no different."}, {"time": 958, "text": "So you can't have hope."}, {"time": 960, "text": "You can't have this idea that there's better."}, {"time": 963, "text": "And sometimes that's... Keep that in its box."}, {"time": 966, "text": "But then if you have kind of what you have with Park where she knows now that there's different, she knows that there's better, then you run into those."}, {"time": 975, "text": "What is the damage that has been done?"}, {"time": 977, "text": "What is going to be passed on as intergenerational trauma?"}, {"time": 979, "text": "I know she's a mom."}, {"time": 981, "text": "So it's like, now you got to look long term a little bit because now she's an influence on a child."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And there's a positive to looking at both, I would say."}, {"time": 992, "text": "And I know that sounds horrible for the living in trauma your whole life and just not knowing any better."}, {"time": 997, "text": "But there's..."}, {"time": 998, "text": "I don't know if that saves the brain and the body and just that overall or if it actually would be better because there's no way to really find that out."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "Yeah, I think."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "But the reality is when you give people hope and you make them realize that they're suffering, you're putting a burden on them."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "That's the first step on a long journey."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "And so, and obviously now that she knows that the suffering she wants to make people in North Korea currently suffer less."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "And that's an admirable goal."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "It's what we do to each other is try to like, when you see suffering in the world, you try to make it better and unmask that's probably in a long arc of history going to make for a better world."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "I'm hopeful at that idea for North Korea."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "I'm hopeful for that because you never want to leave individuals suffering when you know that they're actively suffering while you're just living your day to day life in the Western world just out grocery shopping and you see all this food and you know in the back of your mind... Like that interview fucked me up a little bit, I won't lie."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "And I had some of the girls in my office listen to it, they're just bawling."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "Because we're all parents and there's this idea that not being able to feed our children, just the idea of that damages the psyche."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "It brings up the pain in the chest, just the idea of it."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "And so going to the grocery store for about a week after that, I just remember standing there looking and just going, fuck are we doing?"}, {"time": 1091, "text": "But then there's that snap reality that comes into play and goes, so how do we fix that?"}, {"time": 1097, "text": "You got to take on China, that's never going to happen."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And the reason that's not going to happen, it's happening again."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "So Akhani comes down through Afghanistan, Chinese are all through Afghanistan, Iran makes the deal with China for the roadway to get the oil, well that's done in the blink of an eye without anyone knowing."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "There's just so much at play with China, they control such a large aspect of our world, unfortunately that to take and free North Korea, a drastic action would have to happen."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "And then your people would come in, it would be a mess."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "What do you mean your people?"}, {"time": 1137, "text": "Your Russians."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "Did you hear what she said about Russians?"}, {"time": 1140, "text": "Did you hear what she says?"}, {"time": 1141, "text": "Russians?"}, {"time": 1142, "text": "I love Russians."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "You know what I didn't love?"}, {"time": 1144, "text": "The Russian recruiting video that came out, that shit was terrifying."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Did you watch it?"}, {"time": 1149, "text": "I told you about it and of course you didn't watch it."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "I didn't watch it, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "The USA put out a recruiting video and then like a day or two later Russia put one out."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "And the recruiting video in the States was an animation of a female soldier with two moms and she was going to go change the world, right?"}, {"time": 1171, "text": "Russia came out with one."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "It's like, it's the character from like Rocky essentially and they're guys in the mud and just in the rain just fucking doing pushups, just pushing it out."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "They're just like, they see their boot, they're just like crushing things and I'm like, and it's all like, and the deep Russian voice, I'm like, oh my God."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Which one is better would you say?"}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Which bothered you more?"}, {"time": 1194, "text": "What do you mean by bother, specify."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "So deception is a funny thing because when you're young and you're choosing to go to the military or not, it's not like you know, like none of us know what the best trajectory for a life is."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "For many people going to the military is a really, makes them incredible human beings."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "Some of the best people in this world I know are soldiers."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "So it's, I'm not, I don't mean like it's somehow bad to go to the military."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "I think it's a great choice, but there is something, the honest truth is I just don't like marketing people."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "And so this is essentially a marketing effort."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "Yeah, it is a marketing effort."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "So which one do you like as a marketing effort better?"}, {"time": 1235, "text": "Oh, yeah, I do."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "Cause Canada doesn't, you know what our recruiting videos are?"}, {"time": 1241, "text": "It's like, I love it."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "They're the best."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "Sorry, eh?"}, {"time": 1247, "text": "Oh, fuck."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "It's starting."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "It started."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So Canada does these ones where it's like, it'll have a bunch of like soldiers doing movements and then they'll like snip it together really quick."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "It'll be like a Navy one and a guy jumping out of a plane and then it'll be like an artillery and then like an armored and it'd be like, join the Canadian forces today."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "And like, that's like their, their videos."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "So it's like very marketable, very palatable to Canadians who don't really want war and who don't really acknowledge their military in the first place and do everything they can to make sure that vets don't get any support when they come home."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So they, I can see why that one is acceptable."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "What Russia did was meant to be more of an intimidation tactic in my opinion."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "I like that style better though."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "I think we need harder, I think we need people to be harder."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "I think it's acceptable and okay to say that our soldiers need to have a harder mindset, a stronger mindset, a better mentality and mental health support going into the service and a harder body because I know when you go to the US, I've also encountered plenty of soldiers that are 600 pounds."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So we should say that you, when you joined the military, you were in incredible shape or not maybe incredible, but very good shape."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "No, I was in incredible shape."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "It was the best shape of my life."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "I'm okay with that."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "I, you know what?"}, {"time": 1333, "text": "I used to do sit ups."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "Like no, I would do sit ups in the morning when I was little until I could see my six."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "Like I always had a six pack because all I did was train."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "But like if I couldn't like see it, I would just sit there in morning cartoons and just do sit ups."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And my mom and dad thought that was like normal acceptable behavior."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "So if you had like Instagram back then, you'd be a David Goggins, you would be just like screaming."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Without the cursing."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "That cursing started once the military started."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "So I mean, the people should know, is it probably already know that you also competed in Taekwondo, like you were an athlete of all kinds."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "They even saw rugby in there."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "I was, I was, I was good at rugby."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "I played that for seven, six years, I guess you could say total."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "I think the worst injury I ever ended up having was I tore my right eyelid off."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "We were doing an exhibition game."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "I don't do exhibition games well."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "I don't do like for fun well."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "I don't do like."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "So you're very competitive."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "No, not me."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "So you're being funny."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "Ah, there it is."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "He gets it."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "You see, he's not, he's not a robot."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "What I was saying though to you was that we did an exhibition game and the team ahead was winning."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "The team we were playing was winning, which was annoying."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "And so there was an opportunity to take out a girl that was going one end of the field to the other and she just kept hitting tries left, right and center."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "She was fast."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "So I figured if I just aimed her up, like she's a target and I just run full force at her because she was really, she was a tall individual, but I just, if I do that, I'll take her out of the knees."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "So I did that."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "But that, what that resulted in was she put her tooth through her mouth guard and knocked out and didn't just, she just stayed there."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "But when I stood up, I tore the right eyelid off and it was hanging from the inner corner."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "My mom was there cause mom was my mom's, my biggest fan and she's supportive of everything and she didn't miss a game."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "She didn't miss an anything."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "And um, I stood up and I kind of turned around and we already had a girl break her nose that day."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "So she was on the sideline with her nose sideways and just bloody."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "My mom was like, I'll take her to the emergency after once the game's over."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And so I turned around and looked at her and she just, she almost vomited on the spot and I was like, what's wrong?"}, {"time": 1467, "text": "She's like, don't move your eyelids off."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "I'm like, but I can see like I was trying to blink, but like it was just down so I could just constantly see."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "She's like, we're just, we're just going to go to the emergency."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "We're just going to go there now."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "Was there blood?"}, {"time": 1481, "text": "There's lots of it, but I couldn't really tell."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Were you okay with blood at that point?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "I mean, I guess you did taekwondo and all that."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "I didn't get knocked out very often."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "Like when I was younger in taekwondo, I was really good."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "I only lost a handful of times."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "So when I did lose, that was bad."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "But I never had like a broken nose or a lot of blood on my face, like nothing like that really."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "So nothing freaked me out too much."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Was there aggression there or just purely competition over skill?"}, {"time": 1512, "text": "A mix of both."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "I was, this was right after, not too long after my coach went to prison for statutory rape and that was like how you talk about Park talking about how that was like she knew love because of that person."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "That person was like a God to me."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "And so when that happened, I was just an angry individual from that point on."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "So there was competition and aggression mixed in there."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "Oh, like it was betrayal that there's just somebody that is, was a symbol of love for you, could also be a very bad person."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "I used to eat, sleep, and breathe whatever that man said from four years old on."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "I lived with my coaches at a point so I could train that much."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "I helped look after their daughter."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "I was at the club 24 seven."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "It just the idea that somebody could do something like that, yeah, that really messed me up."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Where were you on 9 11?"}, {"time": 1570, "text": "I was 11 and I was in my parents basement."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "In where?"}, {"time": 1576, "text": "Ontario."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "Ontario, Canada."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "What did you think of 9 11 at that age from Canada that have an impact on you in terms of changing the level of evil you thought is there in the world today?"}, {"time": 1595, "text": "Not initially."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "I remember it really vividly."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "I have a decent memory for certain things."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "It seems like stuff like that I stick with really well."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "I remember watching it."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "I was sitting on the couch and my mom called my dad because my parents are truck drivers."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "My dad was on the road, if I'm not mistaken, and he would go in and out of cities all the time."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "I think he was on the East Coast."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "My mom was a little panicky."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "She tried to get a hold of him."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "I think at the time it was beepers and yeah, so he would get a beep, he would go to a payphone and call us."}, {"time": 1628,

used much closer artillery."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "So we're called the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery because the Queen made us Royal Canadian Artillery."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "And we shoot these rounds."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "When you're in training, you shoot smaller, smaller ammunition."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "They're about 40 pounds."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "They go, I'm

what it is, it's a 155 millimeter howitzer that shoots up to up to 40 kilometers accurately, 45 unrecorded and it shoots a hundred pound round."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "So that, but there is still

raided, a bunch of the sole infantry get raided and then the artillery saves them or are they the first line of attack or what are they, where does the artillery go?"}, {"time": 2294, "text": "Like the hand of God presumes they're helping."}, {"time": 2299, "text": "That's, well, that's it."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "So depending on the operation or whomever is running it or how they want it done, sometimes if they just know there's targets, they'll use us, you know, high value targets."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "So we have this round, it's called the Excalibur round."}, {"time": 2312,

and it's only used for VIP targets."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "So like we have VIP for everyone and it will, it's GPS guided, it's rocket propelled and when you fire it, it will, if this is a wall and

whatever concrete, whatever and it will destroy."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "So it's basically the same thing as being a sniper, but with a much more damaging weapon."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "We don't use that round often."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "I think it's only been used a handful of times max in Afghanistan that I'm aware of."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "Again, I haven't, I wasn't there from 2009 until 21, but I, I know people that still deployed in that, in those units and I don't know that it was used very often, but the regular rounds, so there's HE, there's loom, so HE is high explosive, there's loom."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "You shoot that, it explodes in the sky, it lights up the sky for the infantry below and then there's shrapnel rounds that will explode in the sky and then shrapnel just rains down hell on you."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "HE is what you use normally in my, I'm trying to say this right because I know people squawked at me about some of the stuff on Jocko, so I'm trying to be very accurate."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "In my experience, we used HE rounds to wipe people off the face of the earth when the infantry needed us."}, {"time": 2400,

there's, it's sketchy and there's bad shits happening."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "Can you explain that?"}, {"time": 2413, "text": "So there's two gun, two people, two guns?"}, {"time": 2415, "text":

those."}, {"time": 2422, "text": "How much electronics is there?"}, {"time": 2424, "text": "The GPS, like the computer system that's on it itself, I never ran that much, but it is completely

technical word, word for it, but basically wheels and one does the trajectory, you know, you do your, and you're just kind of doing this and you're watching the watch in it."}, {"time": 2446, "text":

there's cameras and they help you target using like all different kinds of cameras to see through like the fog, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "We use, um, the FOO, which are Forward Observation Officers, which are an artillery individual that is embedded with an infantry unit."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "They call from the front, give us their grid coordinates and

"text": "Like the whole deployment?"}, {"time": 3819, "text": "Getting like actual deploying, not the deployment itself."}, {"time": 3823, "text": "Well actually getting ready to deploy is a little different."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "So I mean the emotional buildup to it and some of the memorable things that kind of you remember from that experience, both on the excitement, I get to see battle, I get to be part of this and the fear and also like being surprised like with the Tim Hortons and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "So like the lead up before everything like shit hit the fan, okay cool."}, {"time": 3849, "text": "So... You're such a fascinating person, but yes, yes."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "I've been called..."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "Many things."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "Yeah, fascinating."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "That start with the letter F. Yeah."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "I don't know many words with F. Okay, so the buildup to the deployment."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "So for the buildup for the deployment, I was in Quebec and my unit was deploying from Quebec."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "And at that time you kind of get your marching orders, you know you're deploying."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "I knew I was deploying before I even graduated."}, {"time": 3878, "text": "That's how much they needed people."}, {"time": 3879, "text": "So once I did all that training, on graduation parade day, a couple men from Quebec in uniforms came over and said, you, you, you and you are all being posted back here today and you're going to deploy with us in April."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "So that's how I found out I was deploying."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "Why was there such a need for troops in Afghanistan?"}, {"time": 3895, "text": "That was a well known thing that there's a scaling up of troops."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "2007 on, Canada really started taking a combat role."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "Before it was very much more a UN type deal where doing what we normally do in most wars where we just, we wear blue and we don't shoot anyone."}, {"time": 3910, "text": "And so we're there to help."}, {"time": 3913, "text": "And so they were really, they were scaling up and there wasn't a lot of people in those trades initially, I think when the war kind of started."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "So Canada really started to scale."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "And so when I got to Quebec, we've kind of found, oh yeah, we're deploying."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "And it was a weird situation because I've never actually been at a unit on a non deployable unit."}, {"time": 3932, "text": "I don't know what they do day to day."}, {"time": 3933, "text": "That's different from what I did."}, {"time": 3934, "text": "I just know what I did."}, {"time": 3936, "text": "So we would do things like in the morning we would get up and we would meet for PT at 5 a.m. and that would include going for a 10k run or playing ball hockey for a few hours in the gym or lifting weights together or just going on a rock march, a long rock march."}, {"time": 3953, "text": "Just stuff like that."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "You would have a shower, you would meet and then you would just sit around the regiment."}, {"time": 3959, "text": "You would just sit around the regiment and you would, if there was busy work, you'd mop the floors, you would clean weapons."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "There wasn't a whole lot until there was a whole lot to do."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "We did a lot for a while and then we went away on workup training to Texas for a week."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "We came down here and we did live fire with our other troop that was gonna be with us."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "So Alpha had two guns and two guns has two groups of people and so we all would go down to Texas and we did live fire here for a week and I ended up getting gastro which was awesome."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "So thanks for that."}, {"time": 3999, "text": "Oh apparently there was, they were having water problems and sanitary problems so everyone was getting it on the base."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "Okay so it just makes your life way harder."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "I didn't get it towards the end, till towards the end so that was fortunate."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "So we would fire live fire, we would go out to the middle of nowhere, the guns would be there and we would get offloaded truck of rounds and we would do live fire and we would practice, just constant practice."}, {"time": 4024, "text": "What's that saying?"}, {"time": 4025, "text": "Perfect practice makes perfect."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "Yeah so this is a sensory, like a shooting range for artillery, for long range."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "So what does practice look like?"}, {"time": 4036, "text": "So you roll up in your trucks and you're, you know, you've got each group of people."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "You've got two trucks and then you've got like a medic vehicle and then you've got like an officer vehicle and a comms vehicle and you go to your perspective guns and then you offload your ammo and then you basically wait for them to send you like a fire mission."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "Wow, get that together."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "They would call, they would say a mission, so it would be a fire mission."}, {"time": 4061, "text": "So we'd wait for that and once we got that then you all run like a bunch of scattered rats to the gun like it's like the greatest thing you've ever seen and then you just wait, you wait for the call for the sergeants to say and then you'll hear it because it's not headphones."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "You can hear it on a speaker and it'd be like, I'm not going to do it in French, don't ask."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "It'd be like so and so, 10 rounds, fire when ready and then you would get your rounds ready and everyone would have them ready and would be in their respective positions and then you would wait and then they would say fire when ready and as soon as they say fire when ready that means just start going."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "Just start and then that's when the magic starts."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "You go like the loop, like you shoot one or whatever, there's a reloading process."}, {"time": 4106, "text": "Yeah, there's a loop."}, {"time": 4107, "text": "So what you would do, you get the fire mission, you would find out the rounds, the 2IC would be standing by the rounds and it was his job to make sure the amount of rounds that was told would be the only rounds that would go downrange and so he'd stand there and on each round depending on the type of round is a fuse which gets screwed onto the top of the round."}, {"time": 4125, "text": "So they're about that big and it's just a point and then you would have to put it on, give it a spin and depending if it was a time release, you had a little, what do you call it?"}, {"time": 4138, "text": "You get those at IKEA when you have to build everything."}, {"time": 4139, "text": "Allen wrench?"}, {"time": 4140, "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, Allen wrench."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "Yeah, you know what I'm talking about."}, {"time": 4143, "text": "But like a big one or something?"}, {"time": 4144, "text": "No, just a little one because it's a tiny little hole and you just got to click it to where it's supposed to go and it depended on what the call was for and it was a timer."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "When you said like wheel, you mean like a little thing then?"}, {"time": 4155, "text": "Is that what we're talking about?"}, {"time": 4157, "text": "I'm talking about the round itself."}, {"time": 4158, "text": "So you would put a fuse on top of the round."}, {"time": 4160, "text": "So you would unload the ammo and then you would put fuses on them and the fuses are on the top and they're like a little ice cream topper kind of thing and you would spin those on."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "And then once they're on, depending if it's a time release or not, you would take this little thing and you would move it the top and that would, it's almost like a little timer."}, {"time": 4181, "text": "That's what I did."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "So you're assembling a bullet."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "A very big one that goes up to my waist."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "This is very cool."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "And you're a fascinating person."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "So just that you still even years later have all this in your memory."}, {"time": 4195, "text": "It's not all perfectly accurate and that's what irritates me though is because it bothers me when I can't remember things accurately but I have a lot of, I've had a lot of memory issues and problems after like having too many hits to the head and..."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "This is from earlier in childhood or

out exactly what it is, but there's new research that's being done that shows that if you're an artillery gunner and you stand within a certain range of that gun, you get the same amount of concussive blasts and there's a range."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "I had no idea but you feel it when it goes off, like it hurt, your whole body feels it."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "Your mind is fascinating

4480, "text": "I don't remember the exact time we were there because it was just, you sleep in a tent, you're in your cot, you're in like full mission mode."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "And you go outside and we did this operation called Operation Maple Leaf, I think it was."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "And you put on these little suits, they have haptic, you can feel when you're shot."},

minds, in our imagination."}, {"time": 4598, "text": "So that's getting you closer to Afghanistan."}, {"time": 4602, "text": "I mean, are you getting anxious at this point?"}, {"time": 4604, "text":

not salute."}, {"time": 4627, "text": "Like that was the focus of, that was my experience of the military."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "And then the next experience was sitting in a regiment, just working out a lot and going for breakfast a lot and drinking."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "Like that was, I was like, this is the army."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "So when I actually got to go to Wainwright, I got my first full taste of, okay, well, there's fire picket duty."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "So one person gets picked every night to do sentry."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "There's a

earplugs that you, it blocks out the gut, like certain kinds of sounds associated with guns and you can still hear other types of stuff."}, {"time": 5356, "text": "So the ones they issued us were these big things that had like a headpiece like here, but you have to wear your helmet when you're firing."}, {"time": 5363, "text": "So you can't have both on."}, {"time": 5366, "text": "So how much

"text": "But I had never heard it, heard it like that before."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "And then you would see the, the, the guys, the Americans would roll out every day and go on patrol and come back, back, back."}, {"time": 5436, "text": "And so you would see them, you would hear them, they would tell the stories, those types of things."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "But I never experienced it

there."}, {"time": 5456, "text": "I believe the entry got, there was an attempt."}, {"time": 5460, "text": "There was an attempt at some point in a past, but I wasn't privy to that."}, {"time": 5464,

guns and ready to run the guns at all times."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "We only had to man one tower."}, {"time": 5476, "text": "So you would do four hour shifts with a fire team partner in the tower, depending on whatever, but you would do it every day."}, {"time": 5482, "text": "So I would look out into the rest of Afghanistan at that opportunity."}, {"time": 5486, "text": "Otherwise it was just

right?"}, {"time": 12077, "text": "And so at that point, we went through the meditation part and the shamans were, they literally sing for like six hours straight."}, {"time": 12086, "text": "So you sit there, you take it and then there's just what you're quietly listening to them."}, {"time": 12091, "text": "Meditate and you wait and you wait and you're in pitch black, like can't see this far in

just a puke bucket and a little light for the, like I can imagine these like little lights going every once in a while and then the rest is just in darkness meditating with this singing."}, {"time": 12123, "text": "It's so beautiful."}, {"time": 12125, "text": "I would love to do that sometime."}, {"time": 12126, "text": "Because trust me, you would, I wouldn't offer if it wasn't the group I

don't do that though."}, {"time": 12180, "text": "Did you do like integration?"}, {"time": 12182, "text": "Did you do conversations with somebody?"}, {"time": 12184, "text": "Did you talk to, like, is there a process to, because similar with psilocybin you mentioned, as I understand, it's exceptionally beneficial for when you also do like talk therapy."}, {"time": 12196, "text": "Like you couple that with the integration in some form where you talk through your experience and you talk through different things."}, {"time": 12203, "text": "Like that seems to be a really, you know, I need to do that more with basically every substance I take."}, {"time": 12208, "text": "Like if I get, which I have been every once in a while known to do, a bit of vodka or whiskey or whatever, like do integration the next day."}, {"time": 12217, "text": "What did you learn?"}, {"time": 12218, "text": "What did you get from that?"}, {"time": 12219, "text": "What did you get?"}, {"time": 12220, "text": "Because you learn a lot, but you sometimes kind of just move on and you celebrate that that happened, but like really kind of think through it."}, {"time": 12226, "text": "Write it down."}, {"time": 12228, "text": "It's important because that's what this was."}, {"time": 12230, "text": "So the first night, I'll give like a very, because trust me, we could spend a whole podcast on both of the, all three of those nights, but the first night, the biggest thing that happened for me is I got to see my daughter, which was my first baby."}, {"time": 12244, "text": "And so people say, well, you know, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 12248, "text": "That was my daughter."}, {"time": 12249, "text": "And I'm very aware it was, I'm very conscious that it was."}, {"time": 12252, "text": "And at that point, she just eased me in enough to let me know and showed me enough that this wasn't it."}, {"time": 12260, "text": "This wasn't the end all be all."}, {"time": 12263, "text": "Where you are right now on this plane, on this dimension, in this life, this is, this is a blip and it is, it is so minuscule to the big picture."}, {"time": 12274, "text": "And so she really did that by, she showed me just a black and then like a crack."}, {"time": 12280, "text": "And then these vibrant colors that I can't describe because there aren't words, Alex Gray does really great art."}, {"time":

"I think he's got stuff in New York as well."}, {"time": 12299, "text": "But she just, she eased me in and gave me some relief and showed me enough that I could go, I could wake up the next day and not want to die the next day."}, {"time": 12312, "text": "And so what Heroic Heart said, because they gave us all these journals, they're like, you know, the next day you kind of wake up and you, you do a meet, like a meeting."}, {"time": 12323, "text": "You do like a circle."}, {"time": 12324, "text": "You just sit in a room and talk about what just happened the night before."}, {"time": 12327, "text": "People are crying and people are quiet and you just listen and that's what you do."}, {"time": 12332, "text": "And then you write on your free time."}, {"time": 12335, "text": "So after that, it's like up to you what you want to do."}, {"time": 12337, "text": "Do you want to just go walk in the woods?"}, {"time": 12338, "text": "Well, I chose to go find a fence post and lie on it for an hour."}, {"time": 12343, "text": "I'm not kidding."}, {"time": 12344, "text": "I lied there and stared up at these two eagles that were just in like the, I'll tell you where we were after and you'll be like, oh, okay, I get it."}, {"time": 12350, "text": "And then I found a forest and I just walked up with my book and I just lied there for hours."}, {"time": 12361, "text": "And then she all of a sudden started giving me what you call your downloads."}, {"time": 12365, "text": "So the stuff you learn, the stuff that you were all of a sudden you're remembering and these messages that come through."}, {"time": 12371, "text": "And that's what this is."}, {"time": 12373, "text": "What kind of things are we talking about?"}, {"time": 12377, "text": "So my biggest thing that she tried to reiterate to me at the beginning of that first night was that I don't breathe."}, {"time": 12384, "text": "I just, I don't, I don't breathe."}, {"time": 12390, "text": "I don't fucking breathe at all."}, {"time": 12392, "text": "I just, one thing to the next thing, the next thing, the next thing, the next thing just to survive."}, {"time": 12396, "text": "I don't take a minute and breathe."}, {"time": 12399, "text": "And so she made, when I say she and I say it because it's hard for people to understand, but I showed this to my husband, I showed it to my doctors and they're like, bitch, that's not you."}, {"time": 12408, "text": "You don't write like that."}, {"time": 12409, "text": "You don't talk like that."}, {"time": 12410, "text": "So like you can flip through it, but it was like, I'll just give, I'll just let Lex read for a second and just, I'll just do here."}, {"time": 12419, "text": "Let me do, I'll do an ad for heroic hearts."}, {"time": 12421, "text": "Heroic

"So I met him and I, we stayed in touch and just became friends and just texted."}, {"time": 13315, "text": "Nothing weird."}, {"time": 13316, "text": "And I was deploying though."}, {"time": 13317,

"We met, I slept in the bed beside him because my girlfriend didn't want to get in trouble from her boyfriend from sleeping beside a random dude."}, {"time": 13365, "text": "And then, yeah, we just, we started dating and he really slowly became my rock and he understands trauma."}, {"time": 13375, "text": "He had some stuff happen in his life and his family that he went through a lot of therapy."}, {"time": 13380, "text": "He went through a lot of shit."}, {"time": 13381, "text": "He went, he saw what traumatic situations can do to a family and to people and those that are suffering with it."}, {"time": 13389, "text": "And so he was well equipped to handle me, thankfully."}, {"time": 13395, "text": "And it got to a point where we were doing the long distance back and forth, back and forth and back and forth."}, {"time": 13399, "text": "And I finally got the call that I was going to be released from the military and I wanted to live near him, but I couldn't afford to live in

then his family was like, come live with us."}, {"time": 13415, "text": "They had a big enough house."}, {"time": 13419, "text": "Trust me, it was fine."}, {"time": 13420, "text": "So I was like, okay."}, {"time": 13422, "text": "And so I went from dating this guy long distance to over from 2009 to 2011, just back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."}, {"time": 13430, "text": "And then finally his parents were like, should her get off the pot here with her?"}, {"time": 13434, "text": "It's obvious she loves you and I would never say it."}, {"time": 13438, "text": "That word just as a love."}, {"time": 13440, "text": "Like it was just, I couldn't say for a long time, for a long time because I was dead inside."}, {"time": 13447, "text": "I didn't know what that meant because I couldn't feel, I didn't feel anything."}, {"time": 13451, "text": "He loved it because he like, we go, we go do something."}, {"time": 13455, "text": "You would never complain about anything."}, {"time": 13457, "text": "You wouldn't say a fucking word."}, {"time": 13459, "text": "You would just sit there."}, {"time": 13460, "text": "And now you got all your feelings back and your emotions back and now you're too hot and you're too cold."}, {"time": 13467, "text": "And anyways, so yeah, he loved it."}, {"time": 13469, "text": "I was numb and dead inside."}, {"time": 13470, "text": "Seriously, when I call him back."}, {"time": 13472, "text": "Were you still able to have fun together?"}, {"time": 13474, "text": "That kind of thing?"}, {"time": 13475, "text": "Like when you say there's no emotion, there's more emotion around the basics of like everyday life, but you're still able to just like enjoy shit together?"}, {"time": 13483, "text": "I was enjoying stuff, but I wasn't feeling."}, {"time": 13489, "text": "I was like, this is fun."}, {"time": 13493, "text": "That was surface level like Lex, this is fun."}, {"time": 13495, "text": "There's nothing there."}, {"time": 13496, "text": "Yeah, no, there's nothing that, Hey, yeah, nothing."}, {"time": 13502, "text": "And so we went through that for a long time and then I lived with his parents and we, we lived there and that was, you know, God damn it."}, {"time": 13509, "text": "His family was so good to me because I was a nightmare."}, {"time": 13512, "text": "I was a nightmare."}, {"time": 13514, "text": "Couldn't cook certain food around me anymore."}, {"time": 13516, "text": "Couldn't, couldn't go certain places anymore."}, {"time": 13518, "text": "Couldn't, you know, crowds were in hard no, we didn't do Canada today."}, {"time": 13522, "text": "And like, I just changed, I moved in and was like, shit's got to change."}, {"time": 13526, "text": "If you guys don't want me to kill everyone, like, and they were willing and they were accepting and they were amazing about it."}, {"time": 13534, "text": "And then we finally said, okay, well like, does this, is this, we're good."}, {"time": 13537, "text": "We're like, I said, I used to say like, I L you like, I couldn't say love."}, {"time": 13544, "text": "It freaked me out for a long time."}, {"time": 13546, "text": "And then I finally said it and then that shit had said it like a month later and I was like, that's not fair."}, {"time": 13551, "text": "That's not the same exact time."}, {"time": 13552, "text": "I wanted the response."},

moved out and we bought a house and then he took a sweet ass time."}, {"time": 13567, "text": "We were dating for four years before we were engaged because just to be sure the crazy wasn't too crazy, he waited four years on that."}, {"time": 13575, "text": "Smart man."}, {"time": 13578, "text": "Or you can, you could say he's just terrified of commitment, but both."}, {"time": 13581, "text": "Hey, when you were the guy on the posters that all the girls sign up to, that sent all the dirty pictures, fucking why are you giving that up?"}, {"time": 13590, "text": "Commitment is a real commitment then."}, {"time": 13593, "text": "This is the Jaco reset."}, {"time": 13597, "text": "We talked about Brass in Unity a little bit."}, {"time": 13600, "text": "What's the longterm mission goal and dream of your company and the podcast of the same name?"}, {"time": 13638, "text": "I work with organizations that are doing this outreach and they're overloaded right now like they have never seen before because this whole thing is just, it's hit ahead here."}, {"time": 13648, "text": "And so what Brass in Unity tries to do is it is really just a vehicle to get the money in the hands of the people that are doing the work with it."}, {"time": 13655, "text": "I couldn't start a nonprofit because I'm not good at fundraising."}, {"time": 13658, "text": "I'm not good at being like, give me your money, I'm going to do this with it."}, {"time": 13662, "text": "The least I could do is come up with a product that I know I could give to people or people could purchase and if I gave pretty much all of the actual profit from it to those organizations and I give them something to wear that is a touch piece or if they're out and somebody sees a bullet on the wrist they go, hey, what is that?"}, {"time": 13684, "text": "It's a conversation starter and that's exactly what it's been and it's done its job as that."}, {"time": 13690, "text": "And so we, like I said, we are a way to get the vehicle, we're the vehicle, we're the money in the hands of the people."}, {"time": 13695, "text": "People don't always want to just get a tax receipt."}, {"time": 13698, "text": "It's great to donate to something, great on you to do that but most people have a selfish aspect and that's okay but if you can tap into that you can then fund these charities properly and give them the tools to do their jobs effectively."}, {"time": 13712, "text": "Up until this point they just count on people's goodness of their hearts."}, {"time": 13716, "text": "Hate to break it to you, humanity is rough right now."}, {"time": 13718, "text": "We need to look at something a little differently."}, {"time": 13720, "text": "So these things spark, like a jewelry sparks conversations and then do you work with charities?"}, {"time": 13726, "text": "Yes, oh God, yeah, that's what I do."}, {"time": 13729, "text": "So my whole mission every day is I get up, I push jewelry and sunglasses on people and say but now that you're gonna wear that, now you're a part of the B&U Army, now you're a part of this community."}, {"time": 13740, "text": "Speaking of which, let me put it right back on, branded."}, {"time": 13745, "text": "This is organic product placement."}, {"time": 13747, "text": "Yeah, this isn't like marketing at all, nothing weird about this at all and so we work with a lot of organizations and I'm very particular about where we send our money because there are, it feels like thousands of vet organizations right now and if we were able to consolidate, it would be more ideal."}, {"time": 13765, "text": "I spoke about that on another show but that's not currently happening."}, {"time": 13768, "text": "So I try to work with the nonprofits I know, number one, are not paying six figure salaries which trust me, there's lots, a lot."}, {"time": 13776, "text": "Number two, I look at the actual resources that they're providing and if they're going to be something that are gonna be useful, in my opinion, whether or not they're actually useful and I just don't think they are, that's up for debate."}, {"time": 13786, "text": "I know it's worked for me so I try to fund the things that I know have been helpful for me and the people I associate with."}, {"time": 13792, "text": "So that's why I brought all the paper because I didn't wanna be an idiot and forget anybody that's really important because I get caught up in things and I think it's important to acknowledge."}, {"time": 13802, "text": "So number one, Heroic Hearts, we just started working to talk about them and really make them known but we're gonna be donating to them as well."}, {"time": 13812, "text": "Are they doing more stuff than the ayahuasca thing?"}, {"time": 13815, "text": "Yeah, so their points are, I got Jesse to actually, I'm like what are your talking points because I need people to know exactly what you do."}, {"time": 13821, "text": "So veterans have had to take their mental and general health into their own hands due to the failure of the government system so that is why they were created but Heroic Hearts is a peer supported mental health network involving full preparation, integration, coaching and connection to vetted psychedelic treatments."}, {"time": 13836, "text": "So they don't just do ayahuasca, they deal with psilocybin, ketamine, ibogaine but they've got protocols in place, they've got locations you go to that are safely vetted and they work."}, {"time": 13848, "text": "They've got over right now, Jesse said they have 800 veterans on a waiting list for treatment."}, {"time": 13853, "text": "That's just before the spike of the end of this war."}, {"time": 13857, "text": "They have over a hundred, they've helped over a hundred veterans including dozens of special operation vets find effective care."}, {"time": 13864, "text": "They've now got branches in the US, UK and Canada and the biggest thing about them and why we talk about them is because the problem of psychedelics and the stigma around it is so significant but because of great universities that are now stepping up and doing the research behind it, it is being legitimized."},

first responders."}, {"time": 13962, "text": "And so their whole thing, and I'll read it so I say it exactly right because I used to be on the board of their charity, but I ran out of time, so now I just consult."}, {"time": 13970, "text": "But they are a home away from home for members of the Canadian Armed Forces, veterans and first responders and their families to stay completely free of charge while they're receiving medical care and treatment in the Vancouver area."}, {"time": 13983, "text": "But since then, they've expanded since I've come on board and they've opened Honour Ranch,
