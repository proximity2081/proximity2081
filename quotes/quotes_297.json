20 days."}, {"time": 268, "text": "We wanted to get 120,000 hands in because we wanted to get statistical significance."}, {"time": 276, "text": "So it's a lot of hands for humans to play, even for these top pros who play fairly quickly normally."}, {"time": 282, "text": "So we couldn't just have one of them play so many hands."}, {"time": 286, "text": "20 days, they were playing basically morning to evening."}, {"time": 290, "text": "And I raised 200,000 as a little incentive for them to play."}, {"time": 295, "text": "And the setting was so that they didn't all get 50,000."}, {"time": 301, "text": "We actually paid them out based on how they did against the AI each."}, {"time": 305, "text": "So they had an incentive to play as hard as they could, whether they're way ahead or way behind or right at the mark of beating the AI."}, {"time": 313, "text": "And you don't make any money, unfortunately."}, {"time": 316, "text": "Right, no, we can't make any money."}, {"time": 317, "text": "So originally, a couple of years earlier, I actually explored whether we could actually play for money because that would be, of course, interesting as well, to play against the top people for money."}, {"time": 329, "text": "But the Pennsylvania Gaming Board said no, so we couldn't."}, {"time": 333, "text": "So this is much like an exhibit, like for a musician or a boxer or something like that."}, {"time": 339, "text": "Nevertheless, they were keeping track of the money and brought us close to $2 million, I think."}, {"time": 348, "text": "So if it was for real money, if you were able to earn money, that was a quite impressive and inspiring achievement."}, {"time": 355, "text": "Just a few details, what were the players looking at?"}, {"time": 359, "text": "Were they behind a computer?"}, {"time": 360, "text": "What was the interface like?"}, {"time": 362, "text": "Yes, they were playing much like they normally do."}, {"time": 365, "text": "These top players, when they play this game, they play mostly online."}, {"time": 368, "text": "So they're used to playing through a UI."}, {"time": 371, "text": "And they did the same thing here."}, {"time": 373, "text": "So there was this layout."}, {"time": 374, "text": "You could imagine there's a table on a screen."}, {"time": 377, "text": "There's the human sitting there, and then there's the AI sitting there."}, {"time": 381, "text": "And the screen shows everything that's happening."}, {"time": 384, "text": "The cards coming out and shows the bets being made."}, {"time": 387, "text": "And we also had the betting history for the human."}, {"time": 389, "text": "So if the human forgot what had happened in the hand so far, they could actually reference back and so forth."}, {"time": 397, "text": "Is there a reason they were given access to the betting history for?"}, {"time": 401, "text": "Well, we just, it didn't really matter."}, {"time": 405, "text": "They wouldn't have forgotten anyway."}, {"time": 407, "text": "These are top quality people."}, {"time": 408, "text": "But we just wanted to put out there so it's not a question of the human forgetting and the AI somehow trying to get advantage of better memory."}, {"time": 416, "text": "So what was that like?"}, {"time": 417, "text": "I mean, that was an incredible accomplishment."}, {"time": 419, "text": "So what did it feel like before the event?"}, {"time": 422, "text": "Did you have doubt, hope?"}, {"time": 425, "text": "Where was your confidence at?"}, {"time": 428, "text": "Yeah, that's great."}, {"time": 429, "text": "So great question."}, {"time": 430, "text": "So 18 months earlier, I had organized a similar brains versus AI competition with a previous AI called Cloudyco and we couldn't beat the humans."}, {"time": 440, "text": "So this time around, it was only 18 months later."}, {"time": 443, "text": "And I knew that this new AI, Libratus, was way stronger, but it's hard to say how you'll do against the top humans before you try."}, {"time": 452, "text": "So I thought we had about a 50, 50 shot."}, {"time": 455, "text": "And the international betting sites put us as a four to one or five to one underdog."}, {"time": 461, "text": "So it's kind of interesting that people really believe in people and over AI, not just people."}, {"time": 468, "text": "People don't just over believe in themselves, but they have overconfidence in other people as well compared to the performance of AI."}, {"time": 475, "text": "And yeah, so we were a four to one or five to one underdog."}, {"time": 479, "text": "And even after three days of beating the humans in a row, we were still 50, 50 on the international betting sites."}, {"time": 486, "text": "Do you think there's something special and magical about poker and the way people think about it, in the sense you have, I mean, even in chess, there's no Hollywood movies."}, {"time": 497, "text": "Poker is the star of many movies."}, {"time": 501, "text": "And there's this feeling that certain human facial expressions and body language, eye movement, all these tells are critical to poker."}, {"time": 513, "text": "Like you can look into somebody's soul and understand their betting strategy and so on."}, {"time": 517, "text": "So that's probably why, possibly, do you think that is why people have a confidence that humans will outperform?"}, {"time": 525, "text": "Because AI systems cannot, in this construct, perceive these kinds of tells."}, {"time": 531, "text": "They're only looking at betting patterns and nothing else, betting patterns and statistics."}, {"time": 538, "text": "So what's more important to you if you step back on human players, human versus human?"}, {"time": 546, "text": "What's the role of these tells, of these ideas that we romanticize?"}, {"time": 551, "text": "Yeah, so I'll split it into two parts."}, {"time": 555, "text": "So one is why do humans trust humans more than AI and have overconfidence in humans?"}, {"time": 562, "text": "I think that's not really related to the tell question."}, {"time": 565, "text": "It's just that they've seen these top players, how good they are, and they're really fantastic."}, {"time": 571, "text": "So it's just hard to believe that an AI could beat them."}, {"time": 576, "text": "So I think that's where that comes from."}, {"time": 577, "text": "And that's actually maybe a more general lesson about AI."}, {"time": 580, "text": "That until you've seen it overperform a human, it's hard to believe that it could."}, {"time": 585, "text": "But then the tells, a lot of these top players, they're so good at hiding tells that among the top players, it's actually not really worth it for them to invest a lot of effort trying to find tells in each other because they're so good at hiding them."}, {"time": 605, "text": "So yes, at the kind of Friday evening game, tells are gonna be a huge thing."}, {"time": 611, "text": "You can read other people."}, {"time": 613, "text": "And if you're a good reader, you'll read them like an open book."}, {"time": 616, "text": "But at the top levels of poker now, the tells become a much smaller and smaller aspect of the game as you go to the top levels."}, {"time": 624, "text": "The amount of strategies, the amount of possible actions is very large, 10 to the power of 100 plus."}, {"time": 635, "text": "So there has to be some, I've read a few of the papers related, it has to form some abstractions of various hands and actions."}, {"time": 644, "text": "So what kind of abstractions are effective for the game of poker?"}, {"time": 649, "text": "Yeah, so you're exactly right."}, {"time": 650, "text": "So when you go from a game tree that's 10 to the 161, especially in an imperfect information game, it's way too large to solve directly, even with our fastest equilibrium finding algorithms."}, {"time": 663, "text": "So you wanna abstract it first."}, {"time": 667, "text": "And abstraction in games is much trickier than abstraction in MDPs or other single agent settings."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Because you have these abstraction pathologies that if I have a finer grained abstraction, the strategy that I can get from that for the real game might actually be worse than the strategy I can get from the coarse grained abstraction."}, {"time": 687, "text": "So you have to be very careful."}, {"time": 688, "text": "Now the kinds of abstractions, just to zoom out, we're talking about, there's the hands abstractions and then there's betting strategies."}, {"time": 697, "text": "Yeah, betting actions, yeah."}, {"time": 698, "text": "Baiting actions."}, {"time": 699, "text": "So there's information abstraction, don't talk about general games, information abstraction, which is the abstraction of what chance does."}, {"time": 707, "text": "And this would be the cards in the case of poker."}, {"time": 710, "text": "And then there's action abstraction, which is abstracting the actions of the actual players, which would be bets in the case of poker."}, {"time": 719, "text": "Yourself and the other players?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "Yes, yourself and other players."}, {"time": 723, "text": "And for information abstraction, we were completely automated."}, {"time": 731, "text": "So these are algorithms, but they do what we call potential aware abstraction, where we don't just look at the value of the hand, but also how it might materialize into good or bad hands over time."}, {"time": 742, "text": "And it's a certain kind of bottom up process with integer programming there and clustering and various aspects, how do you build this abstraction?"}, {"time": 751, "text": "And then in the action abstraction, there it's largely based on how humans and other AIs have played this game in the past."}, {"time": 762, "text": "But in the beginning, we actually used an automated action abstraction technology, which is provably convergent that it finds the optimal combination of bet sizes, but it's not very scalable."}, {"time": 775, "text": "So we couldn't use it for the whole game, but we use it for the first couple of betting actions."}, {"time": 779, "text": "So what's more important, the strength of the hand, so the information abstraction or the how you play them, the actions, does it, you know, the romanticized notion again, is that it doesn't matter what hands you have, that the actions, the betting may be the way you win no matter what hands you have."}, {"time": 800, "text": "Yeah, so that's why you have to play a lot of hands so that the role of luck gets smaller."}, {"time": 806, "text": "So you could otherwise get lucky and get some good hands and then you're gonna win the match."}, {"time": 811, "text": "Even with thousands of hands, you can get lucky because there's so much variance in No Limit Texas Holden because if we both go all in, it's a huge stack of variance, so there are these massive swings in No Limit Texas Holden."}, {"time": 827, "text": "So that's why you have to play not just thousands, but over 100,000 hands to get statistical significance."}, {"time": 835, "text": "So let me ask another way this question."}, {"time": 837, "text": "If you didn't even look at your hands, but they didn't know that, the opponents didn't know that, how well would you be able to do?"}, {"time": 846, "text": "Oh, that's a good question."}, {"time": 847, "text": "There's actually, I heard this story that there's this Norwegian female poker player called Annette Oberstad who's actually won a tournament by doing exactly that, but that would be extremely rare."}, {"time": 858, "text": "So you cannot really play well that way."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Okay, so the hands do have some role to play, okay."}, {"time": 867, "text": "So Labradus does not use, as far as I understand, they use learning methods, deep learning."}, {"time": 875, "text": "Is there room for learning in, there's no reason why Labradus doesn't combine with an AlphaGo type approach for estimating the quality for function estimator."}, {"time": 889, "text": "What are your thoughts on this, maybe as compared to another algorithm which I'm not that familiar with, DeepStack, the engine that does use deep learning, that it's unclear how well it does, but nevertheless uses deep learning."}, {"time": 903, "text": "So what are your thoughts about learning methods to aid in the way that Labradus plays in the game of poker?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "Yeah, so as you said, Labradus did not use learning methods and played very well without them."}, {"time": 915, "text": "Since then, we have actually, actually here, we have a couple of papers on things that do use learning techniques."}, {"time": 924, "text": "And deep learning in particular."}, {"time": 926, "text": "And sort of the way you're talking about where it's learning an evaluation function, but in imperfect information games, unlike let's say in Go or now also in chess and shogi, it's not sufficient to learn an evaluation for a state because the value of an information set depends not only on the exact state, but it also depends on both players beliefs."}, {"time": 959, "text": "Like if I have a bad hand, I'm much better off if the opponent thinks I have a good hand and vice versa."}, {"time": 965, "text": "If I have a good hand, I'm much better off if the opponent believes I have a bad hand."}, {"time": 971, "text": "So the value of a state is not just a function of the cards."}, {"time": 975, "text": "It depends on, if you will, the path of play, but only to the extent that it's captured in the belief distributions."}, {"time": 983, "text": "So that's why it's not as simple as it is in perfect information games."}, {"time": 989, "text": "And I don't wanna say it's simple there either."}, {"time": 991, "text": "It's of course very complicated computationally there too, but at least conceptually, it's very straightforward."}, {"time": 996, "text": "There's a state, there's an evaluation function."}, {"time": 998, "text": "You can try to learn it."}, {"time": 999, "text": "Here, you have to do something more."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And what we do is in one of these papers, we're looking at where we allow the opponent to actually take different strategies at the leaf of the search tree, if you will."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "And that is a different way of doing it."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "And it doesn't assume therefore a particular way that the opponent plays, but it allows the opponent to choose from a set of different continuation strategies."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And that forces us to not be too optimistic in a look ahead search."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "And that's one way you can do sound look ahead search in imperfect information games, which is very difficult."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "And you were asking about DeepStack."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "What they did, it was very different than what we do, either in Libratus or in this new work."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "They were randomly generating various situations in the game."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "Then they were doing the look ahead from there to the end of the game, as if that was the start of a different game."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "And then they were using deep learning to learn those values of those states, but the states were not just the physical states."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "They include belief distributions."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "When you talk about look ahead for DeepStack or with Libratus, does it mean, considering every possibility that the game can evolve, are we talking about extremely, sort of this exponentially growth of a tree?"}, {"time": 1086, "text": "Yes, so we're talking about exactly that."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "Much like you do in alpha beta search or Monte Carlo tree search, but with different techniques."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "So there's a different search algorithm."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "And then we have to deal with the leaves differently."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "So if you think about what Libratus did, we didn't have to worry about this because we only did it at the end of the game."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "So we would always terminate into a real situation and we would know what the payout is."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "It didn't do these depth limited lookaheads, but now in this new paper, which is called depth limited, I think it's called depth limited search for imperfect information games, we can actually do sound depth limited lookahead."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "So we can actually start to do the look ahead from the beginning of the game on, because that's too complicated to do for this whole long game."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "So in Libratus, we were just doing it for the end."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "So, and then the other side, this belief distribution, so is it explicitly modeled what kind of beliefs that the opponent might have?"}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Yeah, it is explicitly modeled, but it's not assumed."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "The beliefs are actually output, not input."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "Of course, the starting beliefs are input, but they just fall from the rules of the game because we know that the dealer deals uniformly from the deck, so I know that every pair of cards that you might have is equally likely."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "I know that for a fact, that just follows from the rules of the game."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "Of course, except the two cards that I have, I know you don't have those."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "You have to take that into account."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "That's called card removal and that's very important."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "Is the dealing always coming from a single deck in Heads Up, so you can assume."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "Single deck, so you know that if I have the ace of spades, I know you don't have an ace of spades."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Great, so in the beginning, your belief is basically the fact that it's a fair dealing of hands, but how do you start to adjust that belief?"}, {"time": 1202, "text": "Well, that's where this beauty of game theory comes."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So Nash equilibrium, which John Nash introduced in 1950, introduces what rational play is when you have more than one player."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And these are pairs of strategies where strategies are contingency plans, one for each player."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "So that neither player wants to deviate to a different strategy, given that the other doesn't deviate."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "But as a side effect, you get the beliefs from base roll."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "So Nash equilibrium really isn't just deriving in these imperfect information games, Nash equilibrium, it doesn't just define strategies."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "It also defines beliefs for both of us and defines beliefs for each state."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "So at each state, it's called information sets."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "At each information set in the game, there's a set of different states that we might be in, but I don't know which one we're in."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "Nash equilibrium tells me exactly what is the probability distribution over those real world states in my mind."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "How does Nash equilibrium give you that distribution?"}, {"time": 1272, "text": "I'll do a simple example."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So you know the game Rock, Paper, Scissors?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So we can draw it as player one moves first and then player two moves."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "But of course, it's important that player two doesn't know what player one moved, otherwise player two would win every time."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "So we can draw that as an information set where player one makes one of three moves first, and then there's an information set for player two."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "So player two doesn't know which of those nodes the world is in."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "But once we know the strategy for player one, Nash equilibrium will say that you play 1 3rd Rock, 1 3rd Paper, 1 3rd Scissors."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "From that, I can derive my beliefs on the information set that they're 1 3rd, 1 3rd, 1 3rd."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "So Bayes gives you that."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "Bayes gives you."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "But is that specific to a particular player, or is it something you quickly update with the specific player?"}, {"time": 1325, "text": "No, the game theory isn't really player specific."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "So that's also why we don't need any data."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "We don't need any history how these particular humans played in the past or how any AI or human had played before."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "It's all about rationality."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So the AI just thinks about what would a rational opponent do?"}, {"time": 1344, "text": "And what would I do if I am rational?"}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And that's the idea of game theory."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "So it's really a data free, opponent free approach."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "So it comes from the design of the game as opposed to the design of the player."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "Exactly, there's no opponent modeling per se."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "I mean, we've done some work on combining opponent modeling with game theory so you can exploit weak players even more, but that's another strand."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And in Librarus, we didn't turn that on."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So I decided that these players are too good."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "And when you start to exploit an opponent, you typically open yourself up to exploitation."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "And these guys have so few holes to exploit and they're world's leading experts in counter exploitation."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "So I decided that we're not gonna turn that stuff on."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Actually, I saw a few of your papers exploiting opponents."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "It sounded very interesting to explore."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "Do you think there's room for exploitation generally outside of Librarus?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "Is there a subject or people differences that could be exploited, maybe not just in poker, but in general interactions and negotiations, all these other domains that you're considering?"}, {"time": 1414, "text": "We've done some work on that."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "And I really like the work at hybrid digested too."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "So you figure out what would a rational opponent do."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "And by the way, that's safe in these zero sum games, two player zero sum games, because if the opponent does something irrational, yes, it might throw off my beliefs, but the amount that the player can gain by throwing off my belief is always less than they lose by playing poorly."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "So it's safe."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "But still, if somebody's weak as a player, you might wanna play differently to exploit them more."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "So you can think about it this way, a game theoretic strategy is unbeatable, but it doesn't maximally beat the other opponent."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "So the winnings per hand might be better with a different strategy."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "And the hybrid is that you start from a game theoretic approach."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "And then as you gain data about the opponent in certain parts of the game tree, then in those parts of the game tree, you start to tweak your strategy more and more towards exploitation while still staying fairly close to the game theoretic strategy so as to not open yourself up to exploitation too much."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "How do you do that?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Do you try to vary up strategies, make it unpredictable?"}, {"time": 1493, "text": "It's like, what is it, tit for tat strategies in Prisoner's Dilemma or?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "Well, that's a repeated game."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "Repeated games."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "Simple Prisoner's Dilemma, repeated games."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "But even there, there's no proof that says that that's the best thing."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "But experimentally, it actually does well."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "So what kind of games are there, first of all?"}, {"time": 1515, "text": "I don't know if this is something that you could just summarize."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "There's perfect information games where all the information's on the table."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "There is imperfect information games."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "There's repeated games that you play over and over."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "There's zero sum games."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "There's non zero sum games."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And then there's a really important distinction you're making, two player versus more players."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "So what are, what other games are there?"}, {"time": 1544, "text": "And what's the difference, for example, with this two player game versus more players?"}, {"time": 1550, "text": "What are the key differences in your view?"}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So let me start from the basics."}, {"time": 1554, "text": "So a repeated game is a game where the same exact game is played over and over."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "In these extensive form games, where it's, think about three form, maybe with these information sets to represent incomplete information, you can have kind of repetitive interactions."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "Even repeated games are a special case of that, by the way."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "But the game doesn't have to be exactly the same."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "It's like in sourcing auctions."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "Yes, we're gonna see the same supply base year to year, but what I'm buying is a little different every time."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "And the supply base is a little different every time and so on."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "So it's not really repeated."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "So to find a purely

conceptually easier and computationally easier."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "They're still huge like this one, but they're conceptually easier and computationally easier in that conceptually, you don't

some things unknown."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "Can you give an example of a collusion type game or is it usually?"}, {"time": 1916, "text": "So like bridge."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "So think about bridge."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "It's like when you and I are on a team, our payoffs are the same."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "The problem is that we can't talk."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "So when I get my cards, I can't whisper to you what my cards are."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "That would not be allowed."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "So we have to somehow coordinate our strategies ahead of time

the opponents in games, the prerequisite is that you formalize the interaction in some way that can be amenable to analysis."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "And you've done this amazing work with mechanism

situations to negotiate manually."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "So you could use automated negotiation, this is the idea at least, you could use automated negotiation to negotiate all of these situations

is not very likely, but if there's a breakthrough, would achieve?"}, {"time": 3061, "text": "Yeah, so I think that overall, we're in a very different situation in game theory than we are in, let's say, machine learning."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "So in machine learning, it's a fairly mature technology and it's very broadly applied and proven success in the real world."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "In game solving, there are almost no applications yet."}, {"time": 3084, "text": "We have just become superhuman, which machine learning you could argue happened in the 90s, if not earlier, and at least on supervised learning, certain complex supervised learning applications."}, {"time": 3096, "text": "Now, I think the next challenge problem, I know you're not asking about it this way, you're asking about the technology breakthrough, but I think that big, big breakthrough is to be able to show that, hey, maybe most of, let's say, military planning or most of business strategy will actually be done strategically using computational game theory."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "That's what I would like to see as the next five or 10 year goal."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "Maybe you can explain to me again, forgive me if this is an obvious question, but machine learning methods, neural networks suffer from not being transparent, not being explainable."}, {"time": 3129, "text": "Game theoretic methods, Nash equilibria, do they generally, when you see the different solutions, are they, when you talk about military operations, are they, once you see the strategies, do they make sense, are they explainable, or do they suffer from the same problems as neural networks do?"}, {"time": 3147, "text": "So that's a good question."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "I would say a little bit yes and no."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "And what I mean by that is that these game theoretic strategies, let's say, Nash equilibrium, it has provable properties."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "So it's unlike, let's say, deep learning where you kind of cross your fingers, hopefully it'll work."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "And then after the fact, when you have the weights, you're still crossing your fingers, and I hope it will work."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "Here, you know that the solution quality is there."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "There's provable solution quality guarantees."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that the strategies are human understandable."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "That's a whole other problem."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "So I think that deep learning and computational game theory are in the same boat in that sense, that both are difficult to understand."}, {"time": 3193, "text": "But at least the game theoretic techniques, they have these guarantees of solution quality."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "So do you see business operations, strategic operations, or even military in the future being at least the strong candidates being proposed by automated systems?"}, {"time": 3212, "text": "Do you see that?"}, {"time": 3214, "text": "Yeah, I do, I do."}, {"time": 3215, "text": "But that's more of a belief than a substantiated fact."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "Depending on where you land in optimism or pessimism, that's a really, to me, that's an exciting future, especially if there's provable things in terms of optimality."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "So looking into the future, there's a few folks worried about the, especially you look at the game of poker, which is probably one of the last benchmarks in terms of games being solved."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "They worry about the future and the existential threats of artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 3250, "text": "So the negative impact in whatever form on society."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "Is that something that concerns you as much, or are you more optimistic about the positive impacts of AI?"}, {"time": 3261, "text": "Oh, I am much more optimistic about the positive impacts."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "So just in my own work, what we've done so far, we run the nationwide kidney exchange."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "Hundreds of people are walking around alive today, who would it be?"}, {"time": 3274, "text": "And it's increased employment."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "You have a lot of people now running kidney exchanges and at the transplant centers, interacting with the kidney exchange."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "You have extra surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists, hospitals, all of that."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "So employment is increasing from that and the world is becoming a better place."}, {"time": 3295, "text": "Another example is combinatorial sourcing auctions."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "We did 800 large scale

by 12.6%."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "So that's over $6 billion of efficiency improvement in the world."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "And this is not like shifting value from somebody to somebody else, just efficiency improvement, like in trucking, less empty driving, so there's less waste, less carbon footprint and so on."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "So a huge positive impact in the near term, but sort of to stay in it for a little longer, because I think game theory has a role to play here."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "Oh, let me actually come back on that as one thing."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "I think AI is also going to make the world much safer."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "So that's another aspect that often gets overlooked."}, {"time": 3353, "text": "Well, let me ask this question."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "Maybe you can speak to the safer."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "So I talked to Max Tegmark and Stuart Russell, who are very concerned about existential threats of AI."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "And often the concern is about value misalignment."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "So AI systems basically working, operating towards goals that are not the same as human civilization, human beings."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "So it seems like game theory has a role to play there to make sure the values are aligned with human beings."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "I don't know if that's how you think about it."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "If not, how do you think AI might help with this problem?"}, {"time": 3395, "text": "How do you think AI might make the world safer?"}, {"time": 3399, "text": "Yeah, I think this value misalignment is a fairly theoretical worry."}, {"time": 3406, "text": "And I haven't really seen it in, because I do a lot of real applications."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "I don't see it anywhere."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "The closest I've seen it was the following type of mental exercise really, where I had this argument in the late eighties when we were building these transportation optimization systems."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "And somebody had heard that it's a good idea to have high utilization of assets."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "So they told me, hey, why don't you put that as objective?"}, {"time": 3431, "text": "And we didn't even put it as an objective because I just showed him that, if you had that as your objective, the solution would be to load your trucks full and drive in circles."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "Nothing would ever get delivered."}, {"time": 3443, "text": "You'd have a hundred percent utilization."}, {"time": 3445, "text": "So yeah, I know this phenomenon."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "I've known this for over 30 years, but I've never seen it actually be a problem in reality."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "And yes, if you have the wrong objective, the AI will optimize that to the hilt and it's gonna hurt more than some human who's kind of trying to solve it in a half baked way with some human insight too."},

and reality."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "That's very difficult to put into words, I think."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "It's what you can theoretically imagine, the worst possible case or even, yeah, I mean bad cases."}, {"time": 3488, "text": "And what usually happens in reality."}, {"time": 3490, "text": "So for example, to me, maybe it's something you can comment on having grown up and I grew up in the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 3499, "text": "There's currently 10,000 nuclear weapons in the world."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "And for many decades, it's theoretically surprising to me that the nuclear war is not broken out."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "Do you think about this aspect from a game theoretic perspective in general, why is that true?"}, {"time": 3518, "text": "Why in theory you could see how things would go terribly wrong and somehow yet they have not?"}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Yeah, how do you think about it?"}, {"time": 3525, "text": "So I do think about that a lot."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "I think the biggest two threats that we're facing as mankind, one is climate change and the other is nuclear war."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "So those are my main two worries that I worry about."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "And I've tried to do something about climate, thought about trying to do something for climate change twice."}, {"time": 3542, "text": "Actually, for two of my startups, I've actually commissioned studies of what we could do on those things."}, {"time": 3549, "text": "And we didn't really find a sweet spot, but I'm still keeping an eye out on that."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "If there's something where we could actually provide a market solution or optimizations solution or some other technology solution to problems."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "Right now, like for example, pollution critic markets was what we were looking at then."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "And it was much more the lack of political will by those markets were not so successful rather than bad market design."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "So I could go in and make a better market design, but that wouldn't really move the needle on the world very much if there's no political will."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "And in the US, the market, at least the Chicago market was just shut down and so on."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "So then it doesn't really help how great your market design was."}, {"time": 3591, "text": "And then the nuclear side, it's more, so global warming is a more encroaching problem."}, {"time": 3600, "text": "Nuclear weapons have been here."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "It's an obvious problem that's just been sitting there."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "So how do you think about, what is the mechanism design there that just made everything seem stable?"}, {"time": 3612, "text": "And are you still extremely worried?"}, {"time": 3614, "text": "I am still extremely worried."}, {"time": 3616, "text": "So you probably know the simple game theory of mad."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "So this was a mutually assured destruction and it doesn't require any computation with small matrices."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "You can actually convince yourself that the game is such that nobody wants to initiate."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "Yeah, that's a very coarse grained analysis."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "And it really works in a situational way."},

now than it was maybe ever before."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "And what idea, application of AI, you've talked about a little bit, but what is the most exciting to you right now?"}, {"time": 3667,
