"Yeah, we're good."}, {"time": 189, "text": "So Lex, the objective of this, I'm going to tell you some jokes and your objective is to not smile, which as a Russian, you should have an edge."}, {"time": 202, "text": "Make the motherland proud."}, {"time": 208, "text": "Let's hear the jokes."}, {"time": 209, "text": "Lex, and this is from the Colonel Crew."}, {"time": 213, "text": "We've been working on a device that can read your mind and we would love to see your thoughts."}, {"time": 222, "text": "Is that the joke?"}, {"time": 223, "text": "That's the opening."}, {"time": 229, "text": "If I'm seeing the muscle activation correctly on your lips, you're not going to do well on this."}, {"time": 235, "text": "All right, here comes the first."}, {"time": 236, "text": "I'm screwed."}, {"time": 237, "text": "Here comes the first one."}, {"time": 238, "text": "Is this going to break the device?"}, {"time": 241, "text": "Is it resilient to laughter?"}, {"time": 247, "text": "Lex, what goes through a potato's brain?"}, {"time": 254, "text": "I got already failed."}, {"time": 255, "text": "That's the hilarious opener."}, {"time": 259, "text": "Tater thoughts."}, {"time": 264, "text": "What kind of fish performs brain surgery?"}, {"time": 269, "text": "A neural surgeon."}, {"time": 275, "text": "And so we're getting data of everything that's happening in my brain right now?"}, {"time": 279, "text": "Lifetime, yeah."}, {"time": 279, "text": "We're getting activation patterns of your entire cortex."}, {"time": 285, "text": "I'm going to try to do better."}, {"time": 286, "text": "I'll edit out all the parts where I laughed."}, {"time": 288, "text": "Photoshop put a serious face over me."}, {"time": 290, "text": "You can recover."}, {"time": 293, "text": "Lex, what do scholars eat when they're hungry?"}, {"time": 297, "text": "I don't know, what?"}, {"time": 298, "text": "Academia nuts."}, {"time": 303, "text": "That was a pretty good one."}, {"time": 305, "text": "So what we'll do is, so you're wearing kernel flow, which is an interface built using technology called spectroscopy."}, {"time": 317, "text": "So it's similar to what we wear wearables on the wrist using light."}, {"time": 322, "text": "So using LIDAR, as you know, and we're using that to image the functional imaging of brain activity."}, {"time": 330, "text": "And so as your neurons fire electrically and chemically, it creates blood oxygenation levels."}, {"time": 337, "text": "We're measuring that."}, {"time": 338, "text": "And so you'll see in the reconstructions we do for you, you'll see your activation patterns in your brain as throughout this entire time we are wearing it."}, {"time": 345, "text": "So in the reaction to the jokes and as we were sitting here talking, and so we're moving towards a real time feed of your cortical brain activity."}, {"time": 356, "text": "So there's a bunch of things that are in contact with my skull right now."}, {"time": 362, "text": "How many of them are there?"}, {"time": 363, "text": "And so how many of them are, what are they?"}, {"time": 365, "text": "What are the actual sensors?"}, {"time": 367, "text": "There's 52 modules, and each module has one laser and six sensors."}, {"time": 373, "text": "And the sensors fire in about 100 picoseconds."}, {"time": 378, "text": "And then the photons scatter and absorb in your brain."}, {"time": 381, "text": "And then a few go in, a few come back out, a bunch go in, then a few come back out, and we sense those photons and then we do the reconstruction for the activity."}, {"time": 390, "text": "Overall, there's about a thousand plus channels that are sampling your activity."}, {"time": 395, "text": "How difficult is it to make it as comfortable as it is?"}, {"time": 398, "text": "Because it's surprisingly comfortable."}, {"time": 400, "text": "I would not think it would be comfortable."}, {"time": 404, "text": "Something that's measuring brain activity, I would not think it would be comfortable, but it is."}, {"time": 412, "text": "In fact, I want to take this home."}, {"time": 414, "text": "So people are accustomed to being in big systems like fMRI where there's 120 decibel sounds and you're in a claustrophobic encasement, or EEG, which is just painful, or surgery."}, {"time": 429, "text": "And so, yes, I agree that this is a convenient option to be able to just put on your head that measures your brain activity in the contextual environment you choose."}, {"time": 437, "text": "So if we want to have it during a podcast, if we want to be at home in a business setting, it's freedom to record your brain activity in the setting that you choose."}, {"time": 449, "text": "Yeah, but sort of from an engineering perspective, are these, what is it?"}, {"time": 452, "text": "There's a bunch of different modular parts and they're kind of, there's like a rubber band thing where they mold to the shape of your head."}, {"time": 461, "text": "So we built this version of the mechanical design to accommodate most adult heads."}, {"time": 469, "text": "But I have a giant head and it fits fine."}, {"time": 471, "text": "It fits well, actually."}, {"time": 473, "text": "So I don't think I have an average head."}, {"time": 475, "text": "Okay, maybe I feel much better about my head now."}, {"time": 481, "text": "Maybe I'm more average than I thought."}, {"time": 486, "text": "Okay, so what else is there interesting that you could say while it's on our heads?"}, {"time": 490, "text": "I can keep this on the whole time."}, {"time": 492, "text": "This is kind of awesome."}, {"time": 493, "text": "And it's amazing for me, as a fan of Ubuntu, I use Ubuntu MATE, you guys use that too."}, {"time": 498, "text": "But it's amazing to have code running to the side, measuring stuff and collecting data."}, {"time": 506, "text": "I mean, I feel like much more important now that my data is being recorded."}, {"time": 512, "text": "Like, you know when you have a good friend that listens to you, that actually is listening to you?"}, {"time": 520, "text": "This is what I feel like, like a much better friend because it's like accurately listening to me, Ubuntu."}, {"time": 527, "text": "What a cool perspective, I hadn't thought about that, of feeling understood."}, {"time": 533, "text": "Heard."}, {"time": 534, "text": "Yeah, heard deeply by the mechanical system that is recording your brain activity, versus the human that you're engaging with, that your mind immediately goes to that there's this dimensionality and depth of understanding of this software system which you're intimately familiar with."}, {"time": 554, "text": "And now you're able to communicate with this system in ways that you couldn't before."}, {"time": 559, "text": "Yeah, I feel heard."}, {"time": 564, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I guess what's interesting about this is your intuitions are spot on."}, {"time": 568, "text": "Most people have intuitions about brain interfaces that they've grown up with this idea of people moving cursors on the screen or typing or changing the channel or skipping a song."}, {"time": 578, "text": "It's primarily been anchored on control."}, {"time": 581, "text": "And I think the more relevant understanding of brain interfaces or neuroimaging is that it's a measurement system."}, {"time": 589, "text": "And once you have numbers for a given thing, a seemingly endless number of possibilities emerge around that of what to do with those numbers."}, {"time": 597, "text": "So before you tell me about the possibilities, this was an incredible experience."}, {"time": 601, "text": "I can keep this on for another two hours, but I'm being told that for a bunch of reasons, just because we probably wanna keep the data small and visualize it nicely for the final product, we wanna cut this off and take this amazing helmet away from me."}, {"time": 618, "text": "So Brian, thank you so much for this experience and let's continue without helmetless."}, {"time": 626, "text": "So that was an incredible experience."}, {"time": 628, "text": "Can you maybe speak to what kind of opportunities that opens up that stream of data, that rich stream of data from the brain?"}, {"time": 635, "text": "First, I'm curious, what is your reaction?"}, {"time": 638, "text": "What comes to mind when you put that on your head?"}, {"time": 641, "text": "What does it mean to you?"}, {"time": 642, "text": "And what possibilities emerge and what significance might it have?"}, {"time": 646, "text": "I'm curious where your orientation is at."}, {"time": 650, "text": "Well, for me, I'm really excited by the possibility of various information about my body, about my mind being converted into data, such that data can be used to create products that make my life better."}, {"time": 667, "text": "So that to me is really exciting possibility."}, {"time": 669, "text": "Even just like a Fitbit that measures, I don't know, some very basic measurements about your body is really cool."}, {"time": 677, "text": "But the bandwidth of information, the resolution of that information is very crude, so it's not very interesting."}, {"time": 683, "text": "The possibility of just building a data set coming in a clean way and a high bandwidth way from my brain opens up all kinds of..."}, {"time": 697, "text": "I was kind of joking when we were talking, but it's not really, it's like I feel heard in the sense that it feels like the full richness of the information coming from my mind is actually being recorded by the machine."}, {"time": 716, "text": "I mean, I can't quite put it into words, but there is genuinely for me, there's not some kind of joke about me being a robot."}, {"time": 725, "text": "It just genuinely feels like I'm being heard in a way that's going to improve my life, as long as the thing that's on the other end can do something useful with that data."}, {"time": 737, "text": "But even the recording itself is like, once you record, it's like taking a picture."}, {"time": 745, "text": "That moment is forever saved in time."}, {"time": 780, "text": "Of course, there's health that I consider, but honestly, to me, the exciting thing is just being heard."}, {"time": 786, "text": "My state of mind, the level of focus, all those kinds of things, being heard."}, {"time": 833, "text": "Yeah, that's the promise, that was the feeling, and it felt like the future."}, {"time": 839, "text": "So it was a pretty cool experience."}, {"time": 840, "text": "And from the sort of mechanical perspective, it was cool to have an actual device that feels pretty good, that doesn't require me to go into the lab."}, {"time": 851, "text": "And also the other thing I was feeling, there's a guy named Andrew Huberman, he's a friend of mine, amazing podcast, people should listen to it, Huberman Lab Podcast."}, {"time": 861, "text": "We're working on a paper together about eye movement and so on."}, {"time": 866, "text": "And we're kind of, he's a neuroscientist and I'm a data person, machine learning person, and we're both excited by how much the, how much the data measurements of the human mind, the brain and all the different metrics that come from that could be used to understand human beings and in a rigorous scientific way."}, {"time": 890, "text": "So the other thing I was thinking about is how this could be turned into a tool for science."}, {"time": 895, "text": "Sort of not just personal science, not just like Fitbit style, like how am I doing on my personal metrics of health, but doing larger scale studies of human behavior and so on."}, {"time": 907, "text": "So like data, not at the scale of an individual, but data at a scale of many individuals or a large number of individuals."}, {"time": 914, "text": "So personal being heard was exciting and also just for science is exciting."}, {"time": 919, "text": "It's very easy, like there's a very powerful thing to it being so easy to just put on that you could scale much easier."}, {"time": 928, "text": "If you think about that second thing you said about the science of the brain, most, we've done a pretty good job, like we, the human race has done a pretty good job figuring out how to quantify the things around us from distant stars to calories and steps and our genome."}, {"time": 952, "text": "So we can measure and quantify pretty much everything in the known universe except for our minds."}, {"time": 960, "text": "And we can do these one offs if we're going to get an fMRI scan or do something with a low res EEG system, but we haven't done this at population scale."}, {"time": 971, "text": "And so if you think about human thought or human cognition is probably the single law, largest raw input material into society at any given moment is our conversations with ourselves and with other people."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And we have this raw input that we can't, that haven't been able to measure yet."}, {"time": 995, "text": "And if you, when I think about it through that frame, it's remarkable, it's almost like we live in this wild, wild West of unquantified communications within ourselves and between each other when everything else has been grounded in me."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "For example, I know if I buy an appliance at the store or on a website, I don't need to look at the measurements on the appliance and make sure it can fit through my door."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "That's an engineered system of appliance manufacturing and construction."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "Everyone's agreed upon engineering standards."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "And we don't have engineering standards around cognition."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "It's not a, it has not entered as a formal engineering discipline that enables us to scaffold in society with everything else we're doing, including consuming news, our relationships, politics, economics, education, all the above."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "And so to me that the most significant contribution that kernel technology has to offer would be the formal, the introduction to formal engineering of cognition as it relates to everything else in society."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "I love that idea that you kind of think that there's just this ocean of data that's coming from people's brains as being in a crude way, reduced down to like tweets and texts and so on, just a very hardcore, many scale compression of actual, the raw data."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "But maybe you can comment, because you're using the word cognition."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "I think the first step is to get the brain data."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "But is there a leap to be taking to sort of interpreting that data in terms of cognition?"}, {"time": 1102, "text": "So is your idea is basically you need to start collecting data at scale from the brain, and then we start to really be able to take little steps along the path to actually measuring some deep sense of cognition."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "Because as I'm sure you know, we understand a few things, but we don't understand most of what makes up cognition."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "This has been one of the most significant challenges of building Kernel, and Kernel wouldn't exist if I wasn't able to fund it initially by myself."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "Because when I engage in conversations with investors, the immediate thought is, what is the killer app?"}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And of course, I understand that heuristic, that's what they're looking at, is they're looking to de risk."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Is the product solved?"}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Is there a customer base?"}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Are people willing to pay for it?"}, {"time": 1151, "text": "How does it compare to competing options?"}, {"time": 1154, "text": "And in the case with brain interfaces, when I started the company, there was no known path to even build a technology that could potentially become mainstream."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "And then once we figured out the technology, we could even, we could commence having conversations with investors and it became, what is the killer app?"}, {"time": 1171, "text": "And so what has been, so I funded the first $53 million for the company."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "And to raise the round of funding, the first one we did, I spoke to 228 investors."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "One said yes, it was remarkable."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And it was mostly around this concept around what is a killer app."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "And so internally, the way we think about it is, we think of the go to market strategy much more like the Drake equation, where if we can build technology that has the characteristics of, it has the data quality is high enough, it meets some certain threshold, cost, accessibility, comfort, it can be worn in contextual environments."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "If it meets the criteria of being a mass market device, then the responsibility that we have is to figure out how to create the algorithm that enables the human, to enable humans to then find value with it."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "So the analogy is like brain interfaces are like early 90s of the internet, is you wanna populate an ecosystem with a certain number of devices, you want a certain number of people who play around with them, who do experiments of certain data collection parameters, you want to encourage certain mistakes from experts and non experts."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "These are all critical elements that ignite discovery."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "And so we believe we've accomplished the first objective of building technology that reaches those thresholds."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "And now it's the Drake equation component of how do we try to generate 20 years of value discovery in a two or three year time period?"}, {"time": 1272, "text": "How do we compress that?"}, {"time": 1274, "text": "So just to clarify, so when you mean the Drake equation, which for people who don't know, I don't know why you, if you listen to this, I bring up aliens every single conversation."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "So I don't know how you would know what the Drake equation is, but you mean like the killer app, it would be one alien civilization in that equation."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "So meaning like this is in search of an application that's impactful, transformative."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "By the way, it should be, we need to come up with a better term than killer app as a."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "It's also violent, right?"}, {"time": 1303, "text": "It's very violent."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "You can go like viral app, that's horrible too, right?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "It's some very inspiringly impactful application."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Okay, so ballistic with killer app, that's fine."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Nobody's."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "But I concur with you."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "I dislike the chosen words in capturing the concept."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "You know, it's one of those sticky things that is as effective to use in the tech world."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "But when you now become a communicator outside of the tech world, especially when you're talking about software and hardware and artificial intelligence applications, it sounds horrible."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "Yeah, no, it's interesting."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "I actually regret now having called attention to cyber regret having used that word in this conversation because it's something I would not normally do."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "I used it in order to create a bridge of shared understanding of how others would, what terminology others would use."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "But yeah, I concur."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Let's go with impactful application."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "Or the."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "Just value creation."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "Value creation."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "Something people love using."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "There we go, that's it."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "Love app."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "Okay, so what, do you have any ideas?"}, {"time": 1369, "text": "So you're basically creating a framework where there's the possibility of a discovery of an application that people love using."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "Is, do you have ideas?"}, {"time": 1379, "text": "We've began to play a fun game internally where when we have these discussions or we begin circling around this concept of, does anybody have an idea?"}, {"time": 1390, "text": "Does anyone have intuitions?"}, {"time": 1391, "text": "And if we see the conversation starting to veer in that direction, we flag it and say, human intuition alert, stop it."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "And so we really want to focus on the algorithm of there's a natural process of human discovery."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "That when you populate a system with devices and you give people the opportunity to play around with it in expected and unexpected ways, we are thinking that is a much better system of discovery than us exercising intuitions."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "And it's interesting, we're also seeing a few neuroscientists who have been talking to us."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "While I was speaking to this one young associate professor, and I approached a conversation and said, hey, we have these five data streams that we're pulling off."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "When you hear that, what weighted value do you add to each data source?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "Which one do you think is going to be valuable for your objectives and which one's not?"}, {"time": 1443, "text": "And he said, I don't care, just give me the data."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "All I care about is my machine learning model."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "But importantly, he did not have a theory of mind."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "He did not come to the table and say, I think the brain operates in this way and these reasons or have these functions."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "He didn't care, he just wanted the data."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "And we're seeing that more and more that certain people are devaluing human intuitions for good reasons, as we've seen in machine learning over the past couple years."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "And we're doing the same in our value creation market strategy."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "So collect more data, clean data, make the product such that the collection of data is easy and fun and then the rest will just spring to life."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "Through humans playing around with them."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "Our objective is to create the most valuable data collection system of the brain ever."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "And with that, then applying all the best tools of machine learning and other techniques to extract out, to try to find insight."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "But yes, our objective is really to systematize the discovery process because we can't put definite timeframes on discovery."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "The brain is complicated and science is not a business strategy."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "And so we really need to figure out how to, this is the difficulty of bringing technology like this to market."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And it's why most of the time it just languishes in academia for quite some time."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "But we hope that we will cross over and make this mainstream in the coming years."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "The thing was cool to wear, but are you chasing a good reason for millions of people to put this on their head and keep on their head regularly?"}, {"time": 1560, "text": "Is there, like who's going to discover that reason?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "Is it going to be people just kind of organically or is there going to be an Angry Birds style application that's just too exciting to not use?"}, {"time": 1578, "text": "If I think through the things that have changed my life most significantly over the past few years, when I started wearing a wearable on my wrist that would give me data about my heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, metabolic approximations, et cetera, for the first time in my life, I had access to information, sleep patterns that were highly impactful."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "They told me, for example, if I eat close to bedtime, I'm not going to get deep sleep."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "And not getting deep sleep means you have all these follow on consequences in life."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And so it opened up this window of understanding of myself that I cannot self introspect and deduce these things."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "This is information that was available to be acquired, but it just wasn't."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "I would have to get an expensive sleep study, then it's an end, like one night, and that's not good enough to look at, to run all my trials."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "And so if you look just at the information that one can acquire on their wrist, and now you're applying it to the entire cortex on the brain and you say, what kind of information could we acquire?"}, {"time": 1645, "text": "It opens up a whole new universe of possibilities."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "For example, we did this internal study at Kernel where I wore a prototype device and we were measuring the cognitive effects of sleep."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "So I had a device measuring my sleep."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "I performed with 13 of my coworkers."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "We performed four cognitive tasks over 13 sessions."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And we focused on reaction time, impulse control, short term memory, and then a resting state task."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "And with mine, we found, for example, that my impulse control was independently correlated with my sleep outside of behavioral measures of my ability to play the game."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "The point of the study was I had, the brain study I did at Kernel confirmed my life experience that if I, my deep sleep determined whether or not I would be able to resist temptation the following day."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "And my brain did show that as one example."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "And so if you start thinking, if you actually have data on yourself, on your entire cortex and you can control the settings, I think there's probably a large number of things that we could discover about ourselves, very, very small and very, very big."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "I just, for example, like when you read news, what's going on?"}, {"time": 1724, "text": "Like when you use social media, when you use news, like all the ways we allocate attention."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "With the computer."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "I mean, that seems like a compelling place to where you would want to put on a Kernel, by the way, what is it

that's going on and then now in parallel to that, then you say, okay, what then happens if when that cost curve is heading to zero?"}, {"time": 2544, "text": "Our existence becomes a goal alignment

it makes sense from a biological perspective that humans, the knee jerk reaction is fear."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "What I don't think has been properly weighted with that is that we are the first

their pros and cons and it's give and take."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "And so the decision I made with kernel was that these two technologies, flux and flow were basically the answer for the next seven years."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "And that they would give rise to the ecosystem which would become much more valuable than the hardware itself."}, {"time": 5355, "text": "And that we would just

replicated the model because now people could fund their Venmo account with their checking account, keep money in the account."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "And then you could just plug Venmo as a form of payment."}, {"time": 6077, "text": "And so I think PayPal saw that, that we were getting the best merchants in the world."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "We had people using Venmo."}, {"time": 6085,
