mean, the whole point, a difficult case, especially in the latter that you mentioned of the going against popular opinion, you have the eyes of millions potentially looking at you with anger as you try to defend this set of laws that this country's built on."}, {"time": 440, "text": "No, it doesn't stress me out particularly."}, {"time": 444, "text": "It sort of comes with the territory."}, {"time": 446, "text": "I try not to get too excited in either direction."}, {"time": 451, "text": "So a big part of my practice is wrongful convictions, and I've gotten over 6,000 people out of prison who've been wrongfully incarcerated, and a subset of those people have been convicted, and people who've been in jail 20, 30 years who have gotten out."}, {"time": 471, "text": "And those are the sorts of cases where people praise you and that sort of thing."}, {"time": 477, "text": "And so, look, I do the work that I do, I'm proud of the work that I do, and in that sense I'm sort of a part time Daoist, the expression reversal is the movement of the Dao."}, {"time": 491, "text": "So I don't get too high, I don't get too low, I just try to do my work and represent people to the best of my ability."}, {"time": 498, "text": "So one of the hardest cases of recent history would be the Harvey Weinstein in terms of popular opinion or unpopular opinion."}, {"time": 505, "text": "So if you continue on that line, where does that story take you, of taking on this case?"}, {"time": 513, "text": "Yeah, so I took on the case and then there was a few students at the college."}, {"time": 520, "text": "So let me back up, I had an administrative post at Harvard College, which is a separate entity from the Harvard Law School, Harvard College is the undergraduate portion of Harvard University and the law school is obviously the law school, and I initially was appointed as master of one of the houses."}, {"time": 538, "text": "We did a name change five or six years into it and were called faculty deans."}, {"time": 544, "text": "But the houses at Harvard are based on the college system of Oxford and Cambridge."}, {"time": 549, "text": "So when students go to Harvard after their first year, they're assigned to a particular house or college and that's where they live and eat and so forth."}, {"time": 559, "text": "And these are undergraduate students?"}, {"time": 560, "text": "These are undergraduate students."}, {"time": 561, "text": "So I was responsible for one of the houses as its faculty dean."}, {"time": 568, "text": "So it's an administrative appointment at the college and some students who clearly didn't like Harvey Weinstein began to protest about the representation."}, {"time": 582, "text": "And from there, it just mushroomed into one of the most craven, cowardly acts by any university in modern history."}, {"time": 593, "text": "It's just a complete and utter repudiation of academic freedom."}, {"time": 600, "text": "And it is a decision that Harvard certainly will live to regret, frankly, it's an embarrassment."}, {"time": 609, "text": "We expect students to do what students do and I encourage students to have their voices heard and to protest."}, {"time": 617, "text": "I mean, that's what students do."}, {"time": 620, "text": "What is vexing are the adults."}, {"time": 624, "text": "The dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Claudine Gay, absolutely craven and cowardly."}, {"time": 631, "text": "The dean of the college, same thing, Rakesh Khurana, craven and cowardly."}, {"time": 637, "text": "They capitulated to the loudest voice in the room and ran around afraid of 19 year olds."}, {"time": 645, "text": "Oh, 19 year olds are upset that I need to do something."}, {"time": 650, "text": "And it appeared to me that they so desired the approval of students that they were afraid to make the tough decision and the right decision."}, {"time": 661, "text": "It really could have been an important teaching moment at Harvard."}, {"time": 666, "text": "Very important teaching moment."}, {"time": 667, "text": "So they forced you to step down from that faculty dean position at the house."}, {"time": 673, "text": "I would push back on the description a little bit."}, {"time": 677, "text": "So I don't write the, you know, the references to the op ed I did in New York time."}, {"time": 683, "text": "Harvard made a mistake by making me step down or something like that."}, {"time": 687, "text": "So I don't write those things."}, {"time": 689, "text": "I did not step down and refuse to step down."}, {"time": 693, "text": "Harvard declined to renew my contract."}, {"time": 697, "text": "And I made it clear that I was not going to resign as a matter of principle and forced them to do the cowardly act that they, in fact, did."}, {"time": 710, "text": "And you know, the worst thing about this, they did the college, Dean Gay and Dean Khurana, commissioned this survey."}, {"time": 721, "text": "They've never done this before."}, {"time": 722, "text": "Survey from the students, you know, how do you feel at Winthrop House?"}, {"time": 726, "text": "And the funny thing about the survey is they never released the results."}, {"time": 731, "text": "Why did they never release the results?"}, {"time": 733, "text": "They never released the results because I would bet my salary that the results came back positive for me."}, {"time": 741, "text": "And it didn't fit their narrative because most of the students were fine."}, {"time": 746, "text": "Most of the students were fine."}, {"time": 747, "text": "It was the loudest voice in the room."}, {"time": 749, "text": "So they never released it, and I challenged them to this day, release it, release it."}, {"time": 755, "text": "But no, they wanted to create this narrative."}, {"time": 762, "text": "And when the data didn't support the narrative, then they just got silent, oh, we're not going to release it."}, {"time": 771, "text": "The students demanded it."}, {"time": 772, "text": "I demanded it."}, {"time": 773, "text": "And they wouldn't release it because I just know in my heart of hearts that it came back in my favor that most students at Winthrop House said they were fine."}, {"time": 788, "text": "There was a group of students that weaponized the term unsafe."}, {"time": 793, "text": "They said we felt unsafe, and they bantied this term about."}, {"time": 799, "text": "But again, I'm confident that the majority of students at Winthrop House said they felt completely fine and felt safe and so forth."}, {"time": 809, "text": "And the supermajority, I am confident, either said I feel great at Winthrop or I don't care one way or the other."}, {"time": 817, "text": "And then there was some minority who had a different view."}, {"time": 820, "text": "But lessons learned, it was a wonderful opportunity at Winthrop."}, {"time": 829, "text": "I met some amazing students over my 10 years as master and then faculty dean, and I'm still in touch with a number of students, some of whom are now my students at the law school."}, {"time": 842, "text": "So in the end, I thought it ended up being a great experience, the national media was just wonderful in this, just wonderful."}, {"time": 855, "text": "People wrote such wonderful articles and accounts and wagged their finger appropriately at Harvard."}, {"time": 864, "text": "Compare me to John Adams, which I don't think is an apt comparison, but it's always great to read something like that."}, {"time": 871, "text": "But anyway, that was the Harvard versus Harvey situation."}, {"time": 877, "text": "So that seems like a seminal mistake by Harvard, and Harvard is one of the great universities in the world."}, {"time": 884, "text": "And sort of its successes and its mistakes are really important for the world as a beacon of how we make progress."}, {"time": 893, "text": "So what lessons for the bigger academia that's under fire a lot these days, what bigger lessons do you take away?"}, {"time": 903, "text": "Like how do we make Harvard great?"}, {"time": 906, "text": "How do we make other universities, Yale, MIT great in the face of such mistakes?"}, {"time": 912, "text": "Well, I think that we have moved into a model where we have the consumerization of education."}, {"time": 924, "text": "That is to say, we have feckless administrators who make policy based on what the students say."}, {"time": 937, "text": "Now this comment is not intended to suggest that students have no voice in governance, but it is to suggest that the faculty are there for a reason."}, {"time": 948, "text": "They are among the greatest minds on the planet Earth in their particular fields, at schools like Harvard and Yale, Stanford, the schools that you mentioned, MIT, quite literally the greatest minds on Earth, they are there for a reason."}, {"time": 964, "text": "Things like curriculum and so forth are rightly in the province of faculty."}, {"time": 971, "text": "And while you take input and critique and so forth, ultimately, the grownups in the room have to be sufficiently responsible to take charge and to direct the course of a student's education."}, {"time": 988, "text": "And my situation is one example where it really could have been an excellent teaching moment about the value of the Sixth Amendment, about what it means to treat people who are in the crosshairs of the criminal justice system, but rather than having that conversation, it's just this consumerization model, well, there's a lot of noise out here, so we're going to react in this sort of way."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "Higher education as well, unfortunately, has been commodified in other sorts of ways that has reduced or impeded, hampered these schools commitments to free and robust and open dialogue."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "So to the degree that academic freedom doesn't sit squarely at the center of the academic mission, any school is going to be in trouble."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "And I really hope that we weather this current political moment where 19 year olds without degrees are running universities and get back to a system where faculty, where adults make decisions in the best interests of the university and the best interests of the student."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "Even to the degree though, some of those decisions may be unpopular, and that is going to require a certain courage and hopefully in time, and I'm confident that in time, administrators are going to begin to push back on these current trends."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "Harvard's been around for a long time, it's been around for a long time for a reason, and one of the reasons is that it understands itself not to be static."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "So I have every view that Harvard is going to adapt and get itself back on course and be around another 400 years, at least that's my hope."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "So I mean, what this kind of boils down to is just having difficult conversation, difficult debates."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "When you mentioned sort of 19 year olds, and it's funny, I've seen this even at MIT, it's not that they shouldn't have a voice."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "They do seem to, I guess you have to experience it and just observe it."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "They have a strangely disproportionate power."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "It's very interesting to basically, I mean, you say, yes, there's great faculty and so on, but it's not even just that the faculty is smart or wise or whatever, it's that they're just silenced."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "So the terminology that you mentioned is weaponized as sort of safe spaces or that certain conversations make people feel unsafe."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "What do you think about this kind of idea?"}, {"time": 1187, "text": "Is there some things that are unsafe to talk about in the university setting?"}, {"time": 1195, "text": "Is there lines to be drawn somewhere?"}, {"time": 1198, "text": "And just like you said on the flip side with a slippery slope, is it too easy for the lines to be drawn everywhere?"}, {"time": 1208, "text": "So this idea of unsafe space, at least the vocabulary derives from some research, academic research about feeling psychologically unsafe."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "And so the notion here is that there are forms of psychological disquiet that impedes people from experiencing the educational environment to the greatest degree possible."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "And that's the argument."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And assuming for a moment that people do have these feelings of disquiet at elite universities like MIT and like Harvard, that's probably the safest space people are going to be in for their lives because when they get out into the quote unquote real world, they won't have the sorts of nets that these schools provide, safety nets that these schools provide."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "So to the extent that research is descriptive of a psychological feeling, I think that the duty of the universities are to challenge people."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "Seems to me that it's a shame to go to a place like Harvard or a place like MIT, Yale, any of these great institutions and come out the same person that you were when you went in."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "That seems to be a horrible waste of four years and money and resources."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "Rather, we ought to challenge students, that they grow, challenge some of their most deeply held assumptions."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "They may continue to hold them, but the point of an education is to rigorously interrogate these fundamental assumptions that have guided you thus far and to do it fairly and civilly."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "So to the extent that there are lines that should be drawn, there's a long tradition in the university of civil discourse."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "So you should draw a line somewhere between civil discourse and uncivil discourse."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "The purpose of a university is to talk difficult conversations, tough issues, talk directly and frankly, but do it civilly."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "Also to yell and cuss at somebody and that sort of thing, well, do that on your own space, but observe the norms of civil discourse at the university."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "So look, I think that the presumption ought to be that the most difficult topics are appropriate to talk about at a university."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "That ought to be the presumption."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Now should MIT, for example, give its imprimatur to someone who is espousing the flat earth theory, the earth is flat, right?"}, {"time": 1400, "text": "If certain ideas are so contrary to the scientific and cultural thinking of the moment, yeah, there's space there to draw a line and say, yeah, we're not going to give you this platform to tell our students that the earth is flat."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "But a topic that's controversial, but contestatory, that's what universities are for."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "If you don't like the idea, present better ideas and articulate them."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "And I think there needs to be a mechanism outside of the space of ideas of humbling."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "I've done martial arts for a long time."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "I got my ass kicked a lot."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "I think that's really important."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "In the space of ideas, I mean, even just in engineering, just all the math classes, my memories of math, which I love, is kind of pain."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "It's basically coming face to face with the idea that I'm not special, that I'm much dumber than I thought I was, and that accomplishing anything in this world requires really hard work."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "It's really humbling."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "That puts you, because I remember when I was 18 and 19, and I thought I was going to be the smartest, the best fighter, the Nobel Prize winning, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And then you come face to face with reality, and it hurts."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "And it feels like there needs to be efficient mechanisms from the best universities in the world without abusing you."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "It's a very difficult line to walk without mentally or physically abusing you, be able to humble you."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "And that's what I felt was missing in these very difficult, very important conversations is the 19 year olds, when they spoke up, the mechanism for humbling them with ideas was missing."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "It kind of got broken down because, as you say, I sensed fear."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "Everything was permeated with fear."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "And fear is paralyzing, fear is destructive, especially in a place that's supposed to be all about freedom of ideas."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "And I don't know if you have anything, any thoughts to say on this whole idea of cancel culture, where people, a lot of people use it as become political, so staying maybe outside of the world of politics."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "Is this, do you have thoughts about it, does it bother you that people are sort of put in this bin and labeled as something and then thereby you can ignore everything they say?"}, {"time": 1579, "text": "I mean, Steven Pinker, there's a lot of Harvard folks that are fighting against these set of ideas, but do you have thoughts?"}, {"time": 1587, "text": "I think that we as a culture are way, way, way too quick to cancel people."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "And it's become almost reflexive now, someone says something or makes an offhand comment, even a mistake, there's a move to simply cancel folks."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "So I think that this, quote unquote, cancel culture has really gotten out of control at this point."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "It's forcing people to be robotic in many ways."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "No offense to robots."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "I was going to say, now I know I'm venturing into your intellectual domain."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "For future robots watching this, no offense."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "And there are minutes discouraging a lot of good people from getting into public life in any sort of way, because who needs the stress of it?"}, {"time": 1649, "text": "Well, in some sense, you're an inspiration that you're able to withstand the pressure of the masses."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "But it's a sad aspect of human nature that we kind of get into these crowds and we start chanting and it's fun for some reason, and then you forget yourself and then you sort of wake up the next day not having anticipated the consequences of all the chanting."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "And we would get ourselves in trouble in that."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "I mean, there's some responsibility on social networks and the mechanisms by which they make it more frictionless to do the chanting, to do the canceling, to do the outrage and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "I actually, on the technology side, have a hope that that's fixable."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "But yeah, it does seem to be, you know, it almost like the internet showed to us that we have a lot of broken ways about which we communicate with each other and we're trying to figure that out."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Same with the university."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "This mistake by Harvard showed that we need to reinvent what the university is."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "I mean, all of this is, it's almost like we're finding our baby deer legs and trying to strengthen the institutions that have been very successful for a long time."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "You know, the really interesting thing about Harvey Weinstein and you choosing these exceptionally difficult cases is also thinking about what it means to defend evil people, what it means to defend these, we could say unpopular, and you might push back against the word evil, but bad people in society."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "First of all, do you think there's such a thing as evil or do you think all people are good and it's just circumstances that create evil?"}, {"time": 1764, "text": "And also, is there somebody too evil for the law to defend?"}, {"time": 1769, "text": "So the first question, that's a deep philosophical question, whether the category of evil does any work for me."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "It does for me."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "I do think that, I do subscribe to that category that there is evil in the world as conventionally understood."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "So there are many who will say, yeah, that just doesn't do any work for me."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "But the category evil, in fact, does intellectual work for me and I understand it as something that exists."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "Is it genetic or is it the circumstance?"}, {"time": 1811, "text": "What kind of work does it do for you intellectually?"}, {"time": 1813, "text": "I think that it's highly contingent, that is to say that the conditions in which one grows up and so forth begins to create this category that we may think of as evil."}, {"time": 1832, "text": "Now there are studies and whatnot that show that certain brain abnormalities and so forth are more prevalent in, say, serial killer."}, {"time": 1845, "text": "So there may be a biological predisposition to certain forms of conduct, but I don't have the biological evidence to make a statement that someone is born evil and I'm not a determinist thinker in that way, so you come out the womb evil and you're destined to be that way."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "To the extent there may be biological determinants, they still require some nurture as well."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "But do you still put a responsibility on the individual?"}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Of course, yeah."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "We all make choices and so some responsibility on the individual indeed."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "We live in a culture, unfortunately, where a lot of people have a constellation of bad choices in front of them and that makes me very sad."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "Some people grow up with predominantly bad choices in front of them and that's unfair and that's on all of us, but yes, I do think we make choices."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "Wow, that's so powerful, the constellation of bad choices."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "That's such a powerful way to think about equality, which is the set of trajectories before you that you could take."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "If you just roll the dice, life is a kind of optimization problem, sorry to take this into math, over a set of trajectories under imperfect information."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "So you're going to do a lot of stupid shit to put it in technical terms, but the fraction of the trajectories that take you into bad places or into good places is really important and that's ultimately what we're talking about."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "And evil might be just a little bit of a predisposition biologically, but the rest is just trajectories that you can take."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "I've been studying Hitler a lot recently."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "And all the possible trajectories that could have avoided that are fascinating, including he wasn't that bad at painting, at drawing from the very beginning and his time in Vienna, there's all these possible things to think about and of course there's millions of others like him that never came to power and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "But that goes to the second question on the side of evil."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "Do you think, and Hitler's often brought up as like an example of somebody who is like the epitome of evil, do you think you would, if you got that same phone call after World War II and Hitler survived during the trial for war crimes, would you take the case defending Adolf Hitler?"}, {"time": 2079, "text": "If you don't want to answer that one, is there a line to draw for evil for who not to defend?"}, {"time": 2086, "text": "No, I think everyone, I'll do the second one first, everyone has a right to a defense if you're charged criminally in the United States of America."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "So no, I do not think that there's someone so evil that they do not deserve a defense."}, {"time": 2103, "text": "Process matters."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "Process helps us get to results more accurately than we would otherwise."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "So it is important and it's vitally important and indeed more important for someone deemed to be evil to receive the same quantum of process and the same substance of process that anyone else would."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "It's vitally important to the health of our criminal justice system for that to happen."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "So yes, everybody, Hitler included, were he charged in the United States for a crime that occurred in the United States, yes."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "Whether I would do it, if I were a public defender and assigned the case, yes, I started my career as a public defender."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "I represent anyone who was assigned to me."}, {"time": 2156, "text": "I think that is our duty."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "In private practice, I have choices and I likely, based on the hypo you gave me, and I would tweak it a bit because it would have to be a U.S. crime."}, {"time": 2175, "text": "But I get the broader point and don't want to bog down in technicalities."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "I'd likely pass right now as I see it, unless it was a case where nobody else would represent him, then I would think that I have some sort of duty and obligation to do it."}, {"time": 2200, "text": "But yes, everyone absolutely deserves a right to competent counsel."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "That is a beautiful ideal, it's difficult to think about it in the face of public pressure."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "It's just, I mean, it's kind of terrifying to watch the masses during this past year of 2020, to watch the power of the masses to make a decision before any of the data is out, if the data is ever out, any of the details, any of the processes, and there is an anger to the justice system."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "There's a lot of people that feel like even though the ideal you describe is a beautiful one, it does not always operate justly."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "It does not operate to the best of its ideals, it operates unfairly."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "When we go to the big picture of the criminal justice system, what do you, given the ideal, works about our criminal justice system and what is broken?"}, {"time": 2268, "text": "Well there's a lot broken right now, and I usually focus on that."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "But in truth, a lot works about our criminal justice system."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "So there's an old joke, and it's funny, but it carries a lot of truth to it."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "And the joke is that in the United States, we have the worst criminal justice system in the world, except for every place else."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And yes, we certainly have a number of problems, and a lot of problems based on race and class, and economics, station, but we have a process that privileges liberty."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And that's a good feature of the criminal justice system."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "So here's how it works."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "The idea of the relationship between the individual and the state is such that in the United States, we privilege liberty over and above very many values, so much so that a statement by increased Mather not terribly far from where we're sitting right now has gained traction over all these years, and it's that better ten guilty go free than one innocent

certain questions you ask in the jury selection."}, {"time": 3846, "text": "I remember I think one jumped out at me, which is something like, does the fact that this person is a police officer make you feel any kind of way about them?"}, {"time": 3861, "text": "So trying to get at that, you know, I don't know what that is, I guess that's bias."}, {"time": 3867, "text": "And it's such a difficult question to ask, like I asked myself with that question, like how much, you know, we all kind of want to pretend that we're not racist, we don't judge, we don't have, we're like these, we're the reasonable human, but, you know, legitimately asking yourself like, what are the prejudgments you have in your mind?"}, {"time": 3893, "text": "Is that even impossible for a human being?"}, {"time":

me, sounds more honest."}, {"time": 3958, "text": "And if you want a person, you want a person to try to do that."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "And then in closing arguments, as the lawyer, I'd say

3979, "text": "And I'm confident that you're going to do that here."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "So when you heard that police officer's testimony, the judge told you, you can't give more credit to that testimony just because it's a police officer."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "And I trust that you're going to do that and that you're going to look at witness number three, you know, John Smith, you're

like me wiping my finger against my nose and just that little bit of DNA."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "And that was effective because the prosecution hadn't done a good job of establishing that yes, it's microscopic, you don't need that much, yes, wiping your hand on your nose and touching something, you can transfer a lot of DNA and that gives you good information."}, {"time": 4457, "text": "But you know, it was the first time that the public generally, and that jury maybe since high school science had heard, you know, nucleotide, I mean, it was just all these terms getting thrown at them, but it was not weaved into a narrative."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "So Cochran taught us that no matter what type of case it is, no matter what science is involved, it's still about storytelling."},

separate murder."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "And we had a jury pool just about all of whom knew that he had been convicted of a murder because he was a very popular football player in Boston, which is

idea that he was a homosexual."}, {"time": 5043, "text": "And some of the trauma, some of the suffering that he endured in his life had to do with sort of fear given the society of what his father

even leaning up to a suicide, do you think his struggle with coming to terms with the sexuality had a role to play in much of his difficulties?"}, {"time": 5083, "text": "Well I'm not going to talk about my interactions with them and anything I derived from that."}, {"time": 5090, "text": "But what I will say is that a story broke on the radio at some point during the trial that Aaron had been in the same sex relationship with someone and some local sportscasters, local Boston sportscasters really mushroomed the story."}, {"time": 5118, "text": "So he and everyone was aware of it."}, {"time": 5125, "text": "You also may know from the court record that the prosecutors floated a specious theory for a minute but then backed off of it that Aaron was, that there was some sort of I

offensive claim in theory."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "So but to answer your question more directly, I mean I have no idea why he killed himself."}, {"time": 5164, "text": "It was a surprise and a shock."}, {"time": 5168, "text": "I was scheduled to go see him like a couple days after it happened."}, {"time": 5173, "text": "I mean he was anxious for Jose and I to come in and do the appeal from the murder which he was convicted for."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "He wanted us to take over that appeal."}, {"time": 5187, "text": "He was talking about going back to football."}, {"time": 5189,

know, I want to get back in the league and I was like, you know, Aaron, that's going to be tough, man."}, {"time": 5207, "text": "But he really believed it and then for a few days later that to happen, it was a real shock to me."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "Like when you look back at that, at his story, does it make you sad?"}, {"time": 5226, "text": "I thought, so one, I believe he absolutely did not commit the crimes that we acquitted him on."}, {"time": 5237, "text": "I think that was the right answer for that."}, {"time": 5243, "text": "I don't know enough about Bradley, the first case, I'm sorry, to make an opinion on."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "But in our case, it was just, he had the misfortune of having a famous name and the police department just really got on him there."},

give you a couple."}, {"time": 5345, "text": "So one is Contingency, Irony and Solidarity by Richard Warty."}, {"time": 5349, "text": "He's passed away now, but was a philosopher at some of our major institutions, Princeton, Stanford."}, {"time": 5363, "text": "Contingency, Irony and Solidarity, at least that's a book that really helped me work through a series of thoughts."}, {"time": 5371, "text": "So it stands for the proposition that our most deeply held beliefs are contingent, that there's nothing beyond history or prior to socialization that's definatory of the human being, that's Warty."}, {"time": 5390, "text": "And he says that our most deeply held beliefs are received wisdom and highly contingent along a number of registers."}, {"time": 5401, "text": "And he does that, but then goes on to say that he nonetheless can hold strongly held beliefs, recognizing their contingency, but still believes them to be true and accurate."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "He helps you to work through what could be an intellectual tension, other words, so you don't delve into, one doesn't delve into relativism, everything is okay, but he gives you a vocabulary to think about how to negotiate these realities."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "Do you share this tension?"}, {"time": 5440, "text": "I mean, there is a real tension."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "It seems like even the law, the legal system is all just a construct of our human ideas, and yet it seems to be, almost feels fundamental to what a just society is."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "Yeah, I definitely share the tension and love his vocabulary and the way he's helped me resolve the tension."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "So right, I mean, yeah, so like, you know, infanticide, for example."}, {"time": 5475, "text": "Perhaps it's socially contingent, perhaps it's received wisdom, perhaps it's anthropological, you know, we need to propagate the species, and I still think it's wrong."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "And Warty has helped me develop a category to say that, no, I can't provide any, in Warty's words, noncircular theoretical backup for this proposition."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "At some point, it's going to run me into a circularity problem, but that's okay."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "I hold this nonetheless in full recognition of its contingency, but what it does is makes you humble, and when you're humble, that's good because, you know, this notion that ideas are always already in progress, never fully formed, I think is the sort of intellectual I strive to be."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "And if I have a sufficient degree of humility that I don't have the final answer, capital A, then that's going to help me to get to better answers, lowercase a."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "And Warty does that, and he talks about in the solidarity part of the book, he has this concept of imaginative, the imaginative ability to see other different people as we instead of they."}, {"time": 5563, "text": "And I just think it's a beautiful concept, but he talks about this imaginative ability and it's this active process."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "So I mean, so that's a book that's done a lot of work for me over the years."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "Souls of Black Folk by W.
