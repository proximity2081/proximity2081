"And that's why you're saying it's just a computation, a deterministic thing that's just unrolling."}, {"time": 329, "text": "But the immense complexity of it is nevertheless like processing."}, {"time": 334, "text": "There's a state and then it changes with good rules."}, {"time": 340, "text": "And there's a sense for a lot of people that if the brain operates, the human brain operates within that world, then it's simply just a small subset of that."}, {"time": 349, "text": "And so there's no reason we can't build arbitrarily great intelligences."}, {"time": 356, "text": "Do you think of intelligence in this way?"}, {"time": 358, "text": "Intelligence is tricky."}, {"time": 359, "text": "I don't have a definition of it offhand."}, {"time": 361, "text": "So I remember this panel discussion that I saw on YouTube."}, {"time": 365, "text": "I wasn't there, but Seth Lloyd was on the panel."}, {"time": 367, "text": "And so was Martin Rees, the famous astrophysicist."}, {"time": 370, "text": "And Seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer and explained this."}, {"time": 374, "text": "And Martin Rees said, so what is not a computer?"}, {"time": 379, "text": "And Seth was like, oh, that's a good question."}, {"time": 382, "text": "Because if you have a sufficiently broad definition of what a computer is, then everything is, right?"}, {"time": 388, "text": "And the simile or the analogy gains force when it excludes some things."}, {"time": 394, "text": "You know, is the moon going around the earth performing a computation?"}, {"time": 398, "text": "I can come up with definitions in which the answer is yes, but it's not a very useful computation."}, {"time": 403, "text": "I think that it's absolutely helpful to think about the universe in certain situations, certain contexts, as an information processing device."}, {"time": 413, "text": "I'm even guilty of writing a paper called Quantum Circuit Cosmology, where we modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit."}, {"time": 419, "text": "As a circuit."}, {"time": 420, "text": "As a circuit, yeah."}, {"time": 421, "text": "With qubits kind of thing?"}, {"time": 422, "text": "With qubits basically, right, yeah."}, {"time": 425, "text": "So, and qubits becoming more and more entangled."}, {"time": 427, "text": "So do we wanna digress a little bit?"}, {"time": 429, "text": "Let's do it."}, {"time": 431, "text": "So here's a mystery about the universe that is so deep and profound that nobody talks about it."}, {"time": 436, "text": "Space expands, right?"}, {"time": 439, "text": "And we talk about, in a certain region of space, a certain number of degrees of freedom, a certain number of ways that the quantum fields and the particles in that region can arrange themselves."}, {"time": 448, "text": "That number of degrees of freedom in a region of space is arguably finite."}, {"time": 453, "text": "We actually don't know how many there are, but there's a very good argument that says it's a finite number."}, {"time": 459, "text": "So as the universe expands and space gets bigger, are there more degrees of freedom?"}, {"time": 466, "text": "If it's an infinite number, it doesn't really matter."}, {"time": 468, "text": "Infinity times two is still infinity."}, {"time": 469, "text": "But if it's a finite number, then there's more space, so there's more degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 474, "text": "So where did they come from?"}, {"time": 475, "text": "That would mean the universe is not a closed system."}, {"time": 478, "text": "There's more degrees of freedom popping into existence."}, {"time": 481, "text": "So what we suggested was that there are more degrees of freedom, and it's not that they're not there to start, but they're not entangled to start."}, {"time": 490, "text": "So the universe that you and I know of, the three dimensions around us that we see, we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom making up space time."}, {"time": 499, "text": "And as the universe expands, there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state that become entangled with the rest of space time through the action of these quantum circuits."}, {"time": 511, "text": "So what does it mean that there's now more degrees of freedom as they become more entangled?"}, {"time": 520, "text": "As the universe expands."}, {"time": 521, "text": "That's right, so there's more and more degrees of freedom that are entangled, that are playing part, playing the role of part of the entangled space time structure."}, {"time": 529, "text": "So the basic, the underlying philosophy is that space time itself arises from the entanglement of some fundamental quantum degrees of freedom."}, {"time": 537, "text": "Wow, okay, so at which point is most of the entanglement happening?"}, {"time": 545, "text": "Are we talking about close to the Big Bang?"}, {"time": 547, "text": "Are we talking about throughout the time of the life?"}, {"time": 551, "text": "Throughout history, yeah."}, {"time": 552, "text": "So the idea is that at the Big Bang, almost all the degrees of freedom that the universe could have were there, but they were unentangled with anything else."}, {"time": 562, "text": "And that's a reflection of the fact that the Big Bang had a low entropy."}, {"time": 565, "text": "It was a very simple, very small place."}, {"time": 568, "text": "And as space expands, more and more degrees of freedom become entangled with the rest of the world."}, {"time": 574, "text": "Well, I have to ask John Carroll, what do you think of the thought experiment from Nick Bostrom that we're living in a simulation?"}, {"time": 581, "text": "So I think, let me contextualize that a little bit more."}, {"time": 584, "text": "I think people don't actually take this thought experiments."}, {"time": 588, "text": "I think it's quite interesting."}, {"time": 590, "text": "It's not very useful, but it's quite interesting."}, {"time": 592, "text": "From the perspective of AI, a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens in simulation from artificial examples."}, {"time": 600, "text": "And so it's a constructive question to ask, how difficult is our real world to simulate?"}, {"time": 609, "text": "Which is kind of a dual part of, if we're living in a simulation and somebody built that simulation, if you were to try to do it yourself, how hard would it be?"}, {"time": 618, "text": "So obviously we could be living in a simulation."}, {"time": 621, "text": "If you just want the physical possibility, then I completely agree that it's physically possible."}, {"time": 625, "text": "I don't think that we actually are."}, {"time": 627, "text": "So take this one piece of data into consideration."}, {"time": 630, "text": "You know, we live in a big universe, okay?"}, {"time": 635, "text": "There's two trillion galaxies in our observable universe with 200 billion stars in each galaxy, et cetera."}, {"time": 641, "text": "It would seem to be a waste of resources to have a universe that big going on just to do a simulation."}, {"time": 647, "text": "So in other words, I want to be a good Bayesian."}, {"time": 650, "text": "I want to ask under this hypothesis, what do I expect to see?"}, {"time": 654, "text": "So the first thing I would say is I wouldn't expect to see a universe that was that big, okay?"}, {"time": 660, "text": "The second thing is I wouldn't expect the resolution of the universe to be as good as it is."}, {"time": 665, "text": "So it's always possible that if our superhuman simulators only have finite resources, that they don't render the entire universe, right?"}, {"time": 672, "text": "That the part that is out there, the two trillion galaxies, isn't actually being simulated fully, okay?"}, {"time": 679, "text": "But then the obvious extrapolation of that is that only I am being simulated fully."}, {"time": 685, "text": "Like the rest of you are just non player characters, right?"}, {"time": 689, "text": "I'm the only thing that is real."}, {"time": 690, "text": "The rest of you are just chat bots."}, {"time": 692, "text": "Beyond this wall, I see the wall, but there is literally nothing on the other side of the wall."}, {"time": 697, "text": "That is sort of the Bayesian prediction."}, {"time": 699, "text": "That's what it would be like to do an efficient simulation of me."}, {"time": 702, "text": "So like none of that seems quite realistic."}, {"time": 705, "text": "I don't see, I hear the argument that it's just possible and easy to simulate lots of things."}, {"time": 713, "text": "I don't see any evidence from what we know about our universe that we look like a simulated universe."}, {"time": 719, "text": "Now, maybe you can say, well, we don't know what it would look like, but that's just abandoning your Bayesian responsibilities."}, {"time": 724, "text": "Like your job is to say under this theory, here's what you would expect to see."}, {"time": 729, "text": "Yeah, so certainly if you think about simulation as a thing that's like a video game where only a small subset is being rendered."}, {"time": 737, "text": "But say the entire, all the laws of physics, the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe, it had a creator."}, {"time": 747, "text": "Yeah, it's always possible."}, {"time": 749, "text": "Right, so that's not useful to think about when you're thinking about physics."}, {"time": 754, "text": "The way Nick Bostrom phrases it, if it's possible to simulate a universe, eventually we'll do it."}, {"time": 762, "text": "You can use that by the way for a lot of things."}, {"time": 765, "text": "But I guess the question is, how hard is it to create a universe?"}, {"time": 797, "text": "So there's an argument that not only is being a simulation possible, it's probable because in the space of all living consciousnesses, most of them are being simulated, right?"}, {"time": 806, "text": "Most of them are not at the top level."}, {"time": 808, "text": "I think that argument must be wrong because it follows from that argument that, if we're simulated, but we can also simulate other things, well, but if we can simulate other things, they can simulate other things, right?"}, {"time": 821, "text": "If we give them enough power and resolution and ultimately we'll reach a bottom because the laws of physics in our universe have a bottom, we're made of atoms and so forth, so there will be the cheapest possible simulations."}, {"time": 835, "text": "And if you believe the original argument, you should conclude that we should be in the cheapest possible simulation because that's where most people are."}, {"time": 842, "text": "But we don't look like that."}, {"time": 843, "text": "It doesn't look at all like we're at the edge of resolution, that we're 16 bit things."}, {"time": 849, "text": "It seems much easier to make much lower level things than we are."}, {"time": 854, "text": "And also, I questioned the whole approach to the anthropic principle that says we are typical observers in the universe."}, {"time": 862, "text": "I think that that's not actually, I think that there's a lot of selection that we can do that we're typical within things we already know, but not typical within all of the universe."}, {"time": 872, "text": "So do you think there's intelligent life, however you would like to define intelligent life, out there in the universe?"}, {"time": 879, "text": "My guess is that there is not intelligent life in the observable universe other than us, simply on the basis of the fact that the likely number of other intelligent species in the observable universe, there's two likely numbers, zero or billions."}, {"time": 901, "text": "And if there had been billions, you would have noticed already."}, {"time": 905, "text": "For there to be literally like a small number, like, you know, Star Trek, there's a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, but not a billion, that's weird."}, {"time": 917, "text": "That's sort of bizarre to me."}, {"time": 918, "text": "It's easy for me to imagine that there are zero others because there's just a big bottleneck to making multicellular life or technological life or whatever."}, {"time": 927, "text": "It's very hard for me to imagine that there's a whole bunch out there that have somehow remained hidden from us."}, {"time": 932, "text": "The question I'd like to ask is what would intelligent life look like?"}, {"time": 938, "text": "What I mean by that question and where it's going is what if intelligent life is just in some very big ways different than the one that has on Earth?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "That there's all kinds of intelligent life that operates at different scales of both size and temporal."}, {"time": 957, "text": "Right, that's a great possibility because I think we should be humble about what intelligence is, what life is."}, {"time": 962, "text": "We don't even agree on what life is, much less what intelligent life is, right?"}, {"time": 967, "text": "So that's an argument for humility, saying there could be intelligent life of a very different character, right?"}, {"time": 973, "text": "Like you could imagine the dolphins are intelligent but never invent space travel because they live in the ocean and they don't have thumbs, right?"}, {"time": 984, "text": "So they never invent technology, they never invent smelting."}, {"time": 987, "text": "Maybe the universe is full of intelligent species that just don't make technology, right?"}, {"time": 994, "text": "That's compatible with the data, I think."}, {"time": 996, "text": "And I think maybe what you're pointing at is even more out there versions of intelligence, intelligence in intermolecular clouds or on the surface of a neutron star or in between the galaxies in giant things where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "On the one hand, yes, we should be very open minded about those things."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "On the other hand, all of us share the same laws of physics."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "There might be something about the laws of physics, even though we don't currently know exactly what that thing would be, that makes meters and years the right length and timescales for intelligent life."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "Maybe not, but we're made of atoms, atoms have a certain size, we orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "It's not impossible to me that there's a sweet spot for intelligent life that we find ourselves in."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "So I'm open minded either way, I'm open minded either being humble and there's all sorts of different kinds of life or no, there's a reason we just don't know it yet why life like ours is the kind of life that's out there."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Yeah, I'm of two minds too, but I often wonder if our brains is just designed to quite obviously to operate and see the world in these timescales and we're almost blind and the tools we've created for detecting things are blind to the kind of observation needed to see intelligent life at other scales."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "Well, I'm totally open to that, but so here's another argument I would make, we have looked for intelligent life, but we've looked at for it in the dumbest way we can, by turning radio telescopes to the sky."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "And why in the world would a super advanced civilization randomly beam out radio signals wastefully in all directions into the universe?"}, {"time": 1105, "text": "That just doesn't make any sense, especially because in order to think that you would actually contact another civilization, you would have to do it forever, you have to keep doing it for millions of years, that sounds like a waste of resources."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "If you thought that there were other solar systems with planets around them, where maybe intelligent life didn't yet exist, but might someday, you wouldn't try to talk to it with radio waves, you would send a spacecraft out there and you would park it around there and it would be like, from our point of view, it'd be like 2001, where there was a monolith."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "Monolith."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "There could be an artifact, in fact, the other way works also, right?"}, {"time": 1144, "text": "There could be artifacts in our solar system that have been put there by other technologically advanced civilizations and that's how we will eventually contact them."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "We just haven't explored the solar system well enough yet to find them."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "The reason why we don't think about that is because we're young and impatient, right?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Like, it would take more than my lifetime to actually send something to another star system and wait for it and then come back."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "So, but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands of years or million year time scales, that's clearly the right thing to do."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "Are you excited by the thing that Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX in general?"}, {"time": 1179, "text": "Space, but the idea of space exploration, even though your, or your species is young and impatient?"}, {"time": 1186, "text": "No, I do think that space travel is crucially important, long term."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "Even to other star systems."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty because they say, look, if you travel 1% the speed of light to another star system, we'll be dead before we get there, right?"}, {"time": 1204, "text": "And I think that it's much easier."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "And therefore, when they write their science fiction stories, they imagine we'd go faster than the speed of light because otherwise they're too impatient, right?"}, {"time": 1211, "text": "We're not gonna go faster than the speed of light, but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan gets extended to thousands of years."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "And once you do that, then the stars are much closer effectively, right?"}, {"time": 1221, "text": "And then what's a hundred year trip, right?"}, {"time": 1223, "text": "So I think that that's gonna be the future, the far future, not my lifetime once again, but baby steps."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "Unless your lifetime gets extended."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "Well, it's in a race against time, right?"}, {"time": 1234, "text": "A friend of mine who actually thinks about these things said, you know, you and I are gonna die, but I don't know about our grandchildren."}, {"time": 1243, "text": "That's, I don't know, predicting the future is hard, but that's at least a plausible scenario."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And so, yeah, no, I think that as we discussed earlier, there are threats to the earth, known and unknown, right?"}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Having spread humanity and biology elsewhere is a really important longterm goal."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "What kind of questions can science not currently answer, but might soon?"}, {"time": 1271, "text": "When you think about the problems and the mysteries before us that may be within reach of science."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "I think an obvious one is the origin of life."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "We don't know how that happened."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "There's a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically actually, you know, literally on earth, but starting life from non life is something I kind of think we're close to, right?"}, {"time": 1292, "text": "We're really."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "You really think so?"}, {"time": 1294, "text": "Like how difficult is it to start life?"}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Well, I've talked to people, including on the podcast about this."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "You know, life requires three things."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "Life as we know it."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "So there's a difference with life, which who knows what it is, and life as we know it, which we can talk about with some intelligence."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "So life as we know it requires compartmentalization."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "You need like a little membrane around your cell."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "Metabolism, you need to take in food and eat it and let that make you do things."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "And then replication, okay?"}, {"time": 1322, "text": "So you need to have some information about who you are that you pass down to future generations."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "In the lab, compartmentalization seems pretty easy."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "Not hard to make lipid bilayers that come into little cellular walls pretty easily."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Metabolism and replication are hard, but replication we're close to."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "People have made RNA like molecules in the lab that I think the state of the art is, they're not able to make one molecule that reproduces itself, but they're able to make two molecules that reproduce each other."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "So that's okay."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "That's pretty close."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "Metabolism is harder, believe it or not, even though it's sort of the most obvious thing, but you want some sort of controlled metabolism and the actual cellular machinery in our bodies is quite complicated."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "It's hard to see it just popping into existence all by itself."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "It probably took a while, but we're making progress."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "And in fact, I don't think we're spending nearly enough money on it."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "If I were the NSF, I would flood this area with money because it would change our view of the world if we could actually make life in the lab and understand how it was made originally here on earth."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And I'm sure it'd have some ripple effects that help cure disease and so on."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "I mean, just that understanding."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "So synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier where we're making cells."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "Right now, the best way to do that is to borrow heavily from existing biology, right?"}, {"time": 1403, "text": "Well, Craig Venter several years ago created an artificial cell, but all he did was, not all he did, it was a tremendous accomplishment, but all he did was take out the DNA from a cell and put in entirely new DNA and let it boot up and go."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "What about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth?"}, {"time": 1424, "text": "Again, we define intelligence, of course, but let's just even say Homo sapiens, the modern intelligence in our human brain."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "Do you have a sense of what's involved in that leap and how big of a leap that is?"}, {"time": 1440, "text": "So AI would count in this, or do you really want life?"}, {"time": 1443, "text": "Do you want really an organism in some sense?"}, {"time": 1446, "text": "AI would count, I think."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "Yeah, of course, of course AI would count."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "Well, let's say artificial consciousness, right?"}, {"time": 1453, "text": "So I do not think we are on the threshold of creating artificial consciousness."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "I think it's possible."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "I'm not, again, very educated about how close we are, but my impression is not that we're really close because we understand how little we understand of consciousness and what it is."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "So if we don't have any idea what it is, it's hard to imagine we're on the threshold of making it ourselves."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "But it's doable, it's possible."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "I don't see any obstacles in principle."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "So yeah, I would hold out some interest in that happening eventually."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "I think in general, consciousness, I think we would be just surprised how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "I think consciousness is a thing that's just something we all fake."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "Well, good."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "No, actually, I like this idea that in fact, consciousness is way less mysterious than we think because we're all at every time, at every moment, less conscious than we think we are, right?"}, {"time": 1504, "text": "We can fool things."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And I think that plus the idea that you not only have artificial intelligent systems, but you put them in a body, right, give them a robot body, that will help the faking a lot."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "Yeah, I think creating consciousness in artificial consciousness is as simple as asking a Roomba to say, I'm conscious, and refusing to be talked out of it."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "Could be, it could be."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "And I mean, I'm almost being silly, but that's what we do."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "That's what we do with each other."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "This is the kind of, that consciousness is also a social construct."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "And a lot of our ideas of intelligence is a social construct."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And so reaching that bar involves something that's beyond, that doesn't necessarily involve the fundamental understanding of how you go from electrons to neurons to cognition."}, {"time": 1562, "text": "No, actually, I think that is an extremely good point."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "And in fact, what it suggests is, so yeah, you referred to Kate Darling, who I had on the podcast, and who does these experiments with very simple robots, but they look like animals, and they can look like they're experiencing pain, and we human beings react very negatively to these little robots looking like they're experiencing pain."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "And what you wanna say is, yeah, but they're just robots."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "It's not really pain, right?"}, {"time": 1591, "text": "It's just some electrons going around."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "But then you realize, you and I are just electrons going around, and that's what pain is also."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "And so what I would have an easy time imagining is that there is a spectrum between these simple little robots that Kate works with and a human being, where there are things that sort of by some strict definition, Turing test level thing are not conscious, but nevertheless walk and talk like they're conscious."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "And it could be that the future is, I mean, Siri is close, right?"}, {"time": 1622, "text": "And so it might be the future has a lot more agents like that."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "And in fact, rather than someday going, aha, we have consciousness, we'll

by simplification."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "The first step is to simplify the code, have less code, have code that are less likely to go wrong."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "It's not by runtime testing

to make sure that when you want to express something, you can express it directly in code rather than going through endless loops and convolutions in your head before it gets down the code."},

it."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "Now, I can put all the rules for chiseling in marble."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "It doesn't mean that somebody who follows all of those rules can do a masterpiece by

opposite of that is code that is messy, code that smells, you know, when you see it."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "And I'm not sure you can describe it in words, except vaguely through guidelines and so on."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "Yes, it's easier to recognize ugly than to recognize beauty in code."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "And for the reason is that sometimes beauty comes from something that's innovative and unusual."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And you have to sometimes think reasonably hard to appreciate that."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "On the other hand, the messes have things that are in common."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "And you can have static checkers and dynamic checkers that find a large number of the most common mistakes."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "You can catch a lot of

represent a piece of code so that you can write a program that goes over that representation and look for things that are are right and not right."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "So, for instance, you can analyze a program to see if resources are leaked."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "That's one of my favorite problems."}, {"time": 2266, "text": "It's not actually all that hard and modern C++, but you can do it."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "If you are writing in the C level, you have to have a malloc and a free."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "And they have to match."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "If you have them in a single function, you can usually do it very easily."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "If there's a malloc here, there should be a free there."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "On the other hand, in between can be showing complete code and then it becomes impossible."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "If you pass that pointer to the memory out of a function and then want to make sure that the free is done somewhere else, now it gets really difficult."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "And so for static analysis, you can run through a program and you can try and figure out if there's any leaks."}, {"time": 2318, "text": "And what you will probably find is that you will find some leaks and you'll find quite a few places where your analysis can't be complete."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "It might depend on runtime."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "It might depend on the cleverness of your analyzer and it might take a long time."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "Some of these programs run for a long time."}, {"time": 2342, "text": "But if you combine such analysis with a set of rules that says how people could use it, you can actually see why the rules are violated."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "And that stops you from getting into the impossible complexities."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "You don't want to solve the halting problem."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "So static analysis is looking at the code without running the code."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "And thereby it's almost not a production code, but it's almost like an education tool of how the language should be used."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "It guides you like it at its best, right?"}, {"time": 2378, "text": "It would guide you in how you write future code as well."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "And you learn together."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "So basically you need a set of rules for how you use the language."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "Then you need a static analysis that catches your mistakes when you violate the rules or when your code ends up doing things that it shouldn't, despite the rules, because there is the language rules."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "We can go further."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "And again, it's back to my idea that I'd much rather find errors before I start running the code."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "If nothing else, once the code runs, if it catches an error at run times, I have to have an error handler."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "And one of the hardest things to write in code is error handling code, because you know something went wrong."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "Do you know really exactly what went wrong?"}, {"time": 2436, "text": "How can you recover when you don't know what the problem was?"}, {"time": 2436, "text": "You can't be 100% sure what the problem was in many, many cases."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "And this is part of it."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "So yes, we need good languages, we need good type systems, we need rules for how to use them, we need static analysis."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "And the ultimate for static analysis is of course program proof, but that still doesn't scale to the kind of systems we deploy."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "Then we start needing testing and the rest of the stuff."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "So C++ is an object oriented programming language that creates, especially with its newer versions, as we'll talk about, higher and higher levels of abstraction."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "So how do you design?"}, {"time": 2490, "text": "Let's even go back to the origin of C++."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "How do you design something with so much abstraction that's still efficient and is still something that you can manage, do static analysis on, you can have constraints on, they can be reliable, all those things we've talked about."}, {"time": 2510, "text": "To me, there's a slight tension between high level abstraction and efficiency."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "I could probably have a year's course just trying to answer it."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "Yes, there's a tension between efficiency and abstraction, but you also get the interesting situation that you get the best efficiency out of the best abstraction."}, {"time": 2533, "text": "And my main tool for efficiency for performance actually is abstraction."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "So let's go back to how C++ was got there."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "You said it was object oriented programming language."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "I actually never said that."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "It's always quoted, but I never did."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "I said C++ supports object oriented programming and other techniques."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "And that's important because I think that the best solution to most complex, interesting problems require ideas and techniques from things that has been called object oriented data abstraction, functional, traditional C style code, all of the above."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "And so when I was designing C++, I soon realized I couldn't just add features."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "If you just add what looks pretty or what people ask for or what you think is good, one by one, you're not going to get a coherent whole."}, {"time": 2604, "text": "What you need is a set of guidelines that that guides your decisions."}, {"time": 2612, "text": "Should this feature be in or should this feature be out?"}, {"time": 2620, "text": "How should a feature be modified before it can go in and such?"}, {"time": 2628, "text": "And in the book I wrote about that, the design evolution of C++, there's a whole bunch of rules like that."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "Most of them are not language technical."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "They're things like don't violate static type system because I like static type system for the obvious reason that I like things to be reliable on reasonable amounts of hardware."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "But one of these rules is the zero overhead principle."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "The what kind of principle?"}, {"time": 2662, "text": "The zero overhead principle."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "It basically says that if you have an abstraction, it should not cost anything compared to write the equivalent code at a lower level."}, {"time": 2678, "text": "So if I have, say, a matrix multiply, it should be written in such a way that you could not drop to the C level of abstraction and use arrays and pointers and such and run faster."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "And so people have written such matrix multiplications, and they've actually gotten code that ran faster than Fortran because once you had the right abstraction, you can eliminate temporaries and you can do loop fusion and other good stuff like that."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "That's quite hard to do by hand and in a lower level language."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "And there's some really nice examples of that."}, {"time": 2721, "text": "And the key here is that that matrix multiplication, the matrix abstraction, allows you to write code that's simple and easy."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "You can do that in any language."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "But with C++, it has the features so that you can also have this thing run faster than if you hand coded it."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "Now, people have given that lecture many times, I and others, and a very common question after the talk where you have demonstrated that you can outperform Fortran for dense matrix multiplication, people come up and says, yeah, but that was C++."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "If I rewrote your code in C, how much faster would it run?"}, {"time": 2757, "text": "The answer is much slower."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "This happened the first time actually back in the 80s with a friend of mine called Doug McElroy, who demonstrated exactly this effect."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "And so the principle is you should give programmers the tools so that the abstractions can follow the zero void principle."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Furthermore, when you put in a language feature in C++ or a standard library feature, you try to meet this."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "It doesn't mean it's absolutely optimal, but it means if you hand code it with the usual facilities in the language in C++ in C, you should not be able to better it."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "Usually you can do better if you use embedded assembler for machine code for some of the details to utilize part of a computer that the compiler doesn't know about."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "But you should get to that point before you beat to the abstraction."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "So that's a beautiful ideal to reach for."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "And we meet it quite often."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "Quite often."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "So where's the magic of that coming from?"}, {"time": 2834, "text": "There's some of it is the compilation process."}, {"time": 2834, "text": "So the implementation of C++, some of it is the design of the feature itself, the guidelines."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "So I think it's important that you think about the guidelines."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "So I've recently and often talked to Chris Latner, so Clang."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "What, just out of curiosity, is your relationship in general with the different implementations of C++ as you think about you and committee and other people in C++, think about the design of features or design of previous features."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "In trying to reach the ideal of zero overhead, does the magic come from the design, the guidelines, or from the implementations?"}, {"time": 2886, "text": "And not all."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "You go for programming technique, programming language features, and implementation techniques."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "You need all three."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "And how can you think about all three at the same time?"}, {"time": 2902, "text": "It takes some experience, takes some practice, and sometimes you get it wrong."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "But after a while, you sort of get it right."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "I don't write compilers anymore."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "But Brian Kernighan pointed out that one of the reasons C++ succeeded was some of the craftsmanship I put into the early compilers."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "And of course, I did the language assign."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "Of course, I wrote a fair amount of code using this kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "And I think most of the successes involve progress in all three areas together."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "A small group of people can do that."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "Two, three people can work together to do something like that."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "It's ideal if it's one person that has all the skills necessary."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "But nobody has all the skills necessary in all the fields where C++ is used."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "So if you want to approach my ideal in, say, concurrent programming, you need to know about algorithms from current programming."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "You need to know the trigger of lock free programming."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "You need to know something about compiler techniques."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "And then you have to know some of the application areas where this is, like some forms of graphics or some forms of what we call web server kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "And that's very hard to get into a single head."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "But small groups can do it too."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "So is there differences in your view, not saying which is better or so on, but differences in the different implementations of C++?"}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Why are there several sort of maybe naive questions for me?"}, {"time": 3013, "text": "GCC, clang, so on?"}, {"time": 3013, "text": "This is a very reasonable question."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "When I designed C++, most languages had multiple implementations."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "Because if you run on an IBM, if you run on a Sun, if you run on a Motorola, there was just many, many companies and they each have their own compilation structure and their own compilers."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "It was just fairly common that there was many of them."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "And I wrote C Front assuming that other people would write compilers with C++ if successful."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "And furthermore, I wanted to utilize all the backend infrastructures that were available."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "I soon realized that my users were using 25 different linkers."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "I couldn't write my own linker."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "Yes, I could, but I couldn't write 25 linkers and also get any work done on the language."}, {"time": 3080, "text": "And so it came from a world where there was many linkers, many optimizers, many compiler front ends, not to start, but many operating systems."}, {"time": 3087, "text": "The whole world was not an 86 and a Linux box or something, whatever is the standard today."}, {"time": 3096, "text": "In the old days, they set a VAX."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "So basically, I assumed there would be lots of compilers."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "It was not a decision that there should be many compilers."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "It was just a fact."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "That's the way the world is."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "And yes, many compilers emerged."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "And today, there's at least four front ends, Clang, GCC, Microsoft, and EDG, it is design group."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "They supply a lot of the independent organizations and the embedded systems industry."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "And there's lots and lots of backends."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "We have to think about how many dozen backends there are."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "Because different machines have different things, especially in the embedded world, the machines are very different, the architectures are very different."}, {"time": 3155, "text": "And so having a single implementation was never an option."}, {"time": 3163, "text": "Now, I also happen to dislike monocultures."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "Monocultures."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "They are dangerous."},

comfortable world for us."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "And who are you to mess with that?"}, {"time": 3195, "text": "So I really am very happy that there's four front ends for C++."}, {"time": 3195,

our engineers."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "And in this course, the very first homework assignment is to do lane finding on images."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And lane finding images for layman, what

is."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "And now what the students are doing, they would take machine learning."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "So instead of like writing these crazy rules for the lane marker,

its own rules, what lane markings are."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "And within 24 hours, now every student that's never done any programming before in this space can write a perfect lane finder as good

three years ago is incredible that that's a great example of system level thinking sort of just taking an entire course that teaches you how to solve the entire problem."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "I definitely recommend people."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "It's become super popular and it's become actually incredibly high quality really with Mercedes and various other companies in that space."},

into one room is really, really hard."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "And every professor listening here will know, they'll probably agree to that."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "And secondly, even if all the great universities just did this, which none so far has developed a curriculum in this field, it is just a few thousand students that can partake because all the great universities are super selective."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "So how about people in India?"}, {"time": 2598, "text": "How about people in China or in the Middle East or Indonesia or Africa?"}, {"time": 2603, "text": "Why should those be excluded from the skill of building self driving cars?"}, {"time": 2607, "text": "Are they any dumber than we are?"}, {"time": 2608, "text": "Are we any less privileged?"}, {"time": 2610, "text": "And the answer is we should just give everybody the skill to build a self driving car."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "Because if we do this, then we have like a thousand self driving car startups."}, {"time": 2620, "text": "And if 10% succeed, that's like a hundred, that means hundred countries now will have self driving cars and be safer."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "It's kind of

disciplines like deep learning and so on that Udacity is also teaching, but self driving cars, it's really, really interesting course."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "And then it came at the right moment."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "It came at a time when there were a bunch of Acqui hires."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "Acqui hire is a acquisition of a company, not for its technology or its products

amount of money."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "So I took Acqui hires like GM Cruise and Uber and others, and did the math and said, hey, how many people are there and how much money was paid?"}, {"time":

the world may be holding us back if what we should instead be doing in this robotic space, in this particular space of autonomous vehicles is using camera as a primary sensor and using computer vision

we do all these many, many things and we can often learn from a very small data set of experiences."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "Whereas machines still need very large data sets and things that will be very repetitive."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "Now that's still super impactful because almost everything we do is repetitive."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "So that's gonna really transform human labor but

that we can approach the question of what the implications of this for AI are is we can think about what's sufficient."}, {"time": 425, "text": "So you know, maybe a person is from birth very, very

actually one of the, you know, while that sounds an awful lot like what machine learning actually does, I think that for modern machine learning, it's actually a really big challenge to take this unstructured mass of experience and distill out something that looks like a common sense understanding of the world."}, {"time": 568, "text": "And perhaps part of that isn't, it's not because

would happen?"}, {"time": 727, "text": "And I know that nothing good would happen from that."}, {"time": 730, "text": "But if I have a bad understanding of the world, I might think that that's a good

stuff."}, {"time": 811, "text": "So perhaps it's okay, if you spend part of your day, just, you know, guided by your curiosity, reading interesting regions of your state space, but it's important for

outside of the strategies that have been working for you so far?"}, {"time": 875, "text": "Yeah, I think it's a very problem dependent kind of question."}, {"time": 878, "text": "And I think that

kind of rational AI agent, and then anything you do is in service to maximizing that utility."}, {"time": 908, "text": "But a very interesting kind of way to look at, I'm not necessarily saying this is the best way to look at it, but an interesting alternative way to look at these problems is as something where you first get to explore the world, however you please, and then afterwards you will be tasked with doing something."}, {"time": 926, "text": "And that might suggest a somewhat different solution."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And that you see that as the modern formulation of the

general."}, {"time": 983, "text": "What in your view is the big problem of robotics?"}, {"time": 986, "text": "And ridiculously philosophical high level questions."}, {"time": 991, "text": "I think that maybe there are two ways I can answer this question."}, {"time": 994, "text": "One is there's a very pragmatic problem, which is like what would make robots, what would sort of maximize the usefulness of robots?"}, {"time": 1004, "text": "And there the answer might be something like a system where a system that can perform whatever task a human user sets for it, within the physical constraints, of course."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "If you tell it to teleport to another planet, it probably can't do that."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "But if you ask it to do something that's within its physical capability, then potentially with a little bit of additional training or a little bit of additional trial and error, it ought to be able to figure it out in much the same way as like a human teleoperator ought to figure out how to drive the robot to do that."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "That's kind of the very pragmatic view of what it would take to kind of solve the robotics problem, if you will."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "But I think that there is a second answer, and that answer is a lot closer to why I want to work on robotics, which is that I think it's less about what it would take to do a really good job in the world of robotics, but more the other way around, what robotics can bring to the table to help us understand artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "So your dream fundamentally is to understand intelligence?"}, {"time": 1069, "text": "And I think that's the dream for many people who actually work in this space."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "I think that there's something very pragmatic and very useful about studying robotics, but I do think that a lot of people that go into this field actually, you know, the things that they draw inspiration from are the potential for robots to like help us learn about intelligence and about ourselves."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "So that's fascinating that robotics is basically the space by which you can get closer to understanding the fundamentals of artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "So what is it about robotics that's different from some of the other approaches?"}, {"time": 1105, "text": "So if we look at some of the early breakthroughs in deep learning or in the computer vision space and the natural language processing, there's really nice clean benchmarks that a lot of people competed on and thereby came up with a lot of brilliant ideas."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "What's the fundamental difference to you between computer vision purely defined and ImageNet and kind of the bigger robotics problem?"}, {"time": 1126, "text": "So there are a couple of things."}, {"time": 1128, "text": "One is that with robotics, you kind of have to take away many of the crutches."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "So you have to deal with both the particular problems of perception control and so on, but you also have to deal with the integration of those things."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "And you know, classically, we've always thought of the integration as kind of a separate problem."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "So a classic kind of modular engineering approach is that we solve the individual subproblems and then wire them together and then the whole thing works."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "And one of the things that we've been seeing over the last couple of decades is that, well, maybe studying the thing as a whole might lead to just like very different solutions than if we were to study the parts and wire them together."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "So the integrative nature of robotics research helps us see, you know, the different perspectives on the problem."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "Another part of the answer is that with robotics, it casts a certain paradox into very clever relief."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "This is sometimes referred to as Moravec's paradox, the idea that in artificial intelligence, things that are very hard for people can be very easy for machines and vice versa."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "Things that are very easy for people can be very hard for machines."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "So you know, integral and differential calculus is pretty difficult to learn for people."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "But if you program a computer, do it, it can derive derivatives and integrals for you all day long without any trouble."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "Whereas some things like, you know, drinking from a cup of water, very easy for a person to do, very hard for a robot to deal with."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And sometimes when we see such blatant discrepancies, that gives us a really strong hint that we're missing something important."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "So if we really try to zero in on those discrepancies, we might find that little bit that we're missing."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "And it's not that we need to make machines better or worse at math and better at drinking water, but just that by studying those discrepancies, we might find some new insight."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So that could be in any space, it doesn't have to be robotics."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "But you're saying, I mean, it's kind of interesting that robotics seems to have a lot of those discrepancies."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "So the Hans Marvak paradox is probably referring to the space of the physical interaction, like you said, object manipulation, walking, all the kind of stuff we do in the physical world."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "How do you make sense if you were to try to disentangle the Marvak paradox, like why is there such a gap in our intuition about it?"}, {"time": 1277, "text": "Why do you think manipulating objects is so hard from everything you've learned from applying reinforcement learning in this space?"}, {"time": 1285, "text": "Yeah, I think that one reason is maybe that for many of the other problems that we've studied in AI and computer science and so on, the notion of input output and supervision is much, much cleaner."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "So computer vision, for example, deals with very complex inputs."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "But it's comparatively a bit easier, at least up to some level of abstraction, to cast it as a very tightly supervised problem."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "It's comparatively much, much harder to cast robotic manipulation as a very tightly supervised problem."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "You can do it, it just doesn't seem to work all that well."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "So you could say that, well, maybe we get a labeled data set where we know exactly which motor commands to send, and then we train on that."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "But for various reasons, that's not actually such a great solution."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "And it also doesn't seem to be even remotely similar to how people and animals learn to do things, because we're not told by our parents, here's how you fire your muscles in order to walk."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "So we do get some guidance, but the really low level detailed stuff we figure out mostly on our own."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "And that's what you mean by tightly coupled, that every single little sub action gets a supervised signal of whether it's a good one or not."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "So while in computer vision, you could sort of imagine up to a level of abstraction that maybe somebody told you this is a car and this is a cat and this is a dog, in motor control, it's very clear that that was not the case."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "If we look at sort of the sub spaces of robotics, that, again, as you said, robotics integrates all of them together, and we get to see how this beautiful mess interplays."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "But so there's nevertheless still perception."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So it's the computer vision problem, broadly speaking, understanding the environment."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And there's also maybe you can correct me on this kind of categorization of the space, and there's prediction in trying to anticipate what things are going to do into the future in order for you to be able to act in that world."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And then there's also this game theoretic aspect of how your actions will change the behavior of others."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "In this kind of space, what, and this is bigger than reinforcement learning, this is just broadly looking at the problem of robotics, what's the hardest problem here?"}, {"time": 1422, "text": "Or is there, or is what you said true that when you start to look at all of them together, that's a whole nother thing, like you can't even say which one individually is harder because all of them together, you should only be looking at them all together."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "I think when you look at them all together, some things actually become easier."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "And I think that's actually pretty important."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "So we had back in 2014, we had some work, basically our first work on end to end reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation skills from vision, which at the time was something that seemed a little inflammatory and controversial in the robotics world."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "But other than the inflammatory and controversial part of it, the point that we were actually trying to make in that work is that for the particular case of combining perception and control, you could actually do better if you treat them together than if you try to separate them."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "And the way that we tried to demonstrate this is we picked a fairly simple motor control task where a robot had to insert a little red trapezoid into a trapezoidal hole."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "And we had our separated solution, which involved first detecting the hole using a pose detector and then actuating the arm to put it in."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "And then our intent solution, which just mapped pixels to the torques."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "And one of the things we observed is that if you use the intent solution, essentially the pressure on the perception part of the model is actually lower."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "Like it doesn't have to figure out exactly where the thing is in 3D space."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "It just needs to figure out where it is, you know, distributing the errors in such a way that the horizontal difference matters more than the vertical difference because vertically it just pushes it down all the way until it can't go any further."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "And their perceptual errors are a lot less harmful, whereas perpendicular to the direction of motion, perceptual errors are much more harmful."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "So the point is that if you combine these two things, you can trade off errors between the components optimally to best accomplish the task."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And the components can actually be weaker while still leading to better overall performance."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "It's a profound idea."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "I mean, in the space of pegs and things like that, it's quite simple."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "It almost is tempting to overlook, but that seems to be at least intuitively an idea that should generalize to basically all aspects of perception and control, that one strengthens the other."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "And we, you know, people who have studied sort of perceptual heuristics in humans and animals find things like that all the time."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "So one very well known example of this is something called the gaze heuristic, which is a little trick that you can use to intercept a flying object."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "So if you want to catch a ball, for instance, you could try to localize it in 3D space, estimate its velocity, estimate the effect of wind resistance, solve a complex system of differential equations in your head."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "Or you can maintain a running speed so that the object stays in the same position as in your field of view."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "So if it dips a little bit, you speed up."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "If it rises a little bit, you slow down."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "And if you follow the simple rule, you'll actually arrive at exactly the place where the object lands and you'll catch it."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "And humans use it when they play baseball, human pilots use it when they fly airplanes to figure out if they're about to collide with somebody, frogs use this to catch insects and so on and so on."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "So this is something that actually happens in nature."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "And I'm sure this is just one instance of it that we were able to identify just because all the scientists were able to identify because it's so prevalent, but there are probably many others."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "Do you have a, just so we can zoom in as we talk about robotics, do you have a canonical problem, sort of a simple, clean, beautiful representative problem in robotics that you think about when you're thinking about some of these problems?"}, {"time": 1636, "text": "We talked about robotic manipulation, to me that seems intuitively, at least the robotics community has converged towards that as a space that's the canonical problem."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "If you agree, then maybe do you zoom in in some particular aspect of that problem that you just like?"}, {"time": 1654, "text": "Like if we solve that problem perfectly, it'll unlock a major step towards human level intelligence."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "I don't think I have like a really great answer to that."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "And I think partly the reason I don't have a great answer kind of has to do with the, it has to do with the fact that the difficulty is really in the flexibility and adaptability rather than in doing a particular thing really, really well."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "So it's hard to just say like, oh, if you can, I don't know, like shuffle a deck of cards as fast as like a Vegas casino dealer, then you'll be very proficient."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "It's really the ability to quickly figure out how to do some arbitrary new thing well enough to like, you know, to move on to the next arbitrary thing."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "But the source of newness and uncertainty, have you found problems in which it's easy to generate new newnessnesses?"}, {"time": 1718, "text": "New types of newness."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "So a few years ago, so if you had asked me this question around like 2016, maybe I would have probably said that robotic grasping is a really great example of that because it's a task with great real world utility."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "Like you will get a lot of money if you can do it well."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "What is robotic grasping?"}, {"time": 1738, "text": "Picking up any object with a robotic hand."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "So you will get a lot of money if you do it well, because lots of people want to run warehouses with robots and it's highly non trivial because very different objects will require very different grasping strategies."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "But actually since then, people have gotten really good at building systems to solve this problem to the point where I'm not actually sure how much more progress we can make with that as like the main guiding thing."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "But it's kind of interesting to see the kind of methods that have actually worked well in that space because robotic grasping classically used to be regarded very much as kind of almost like a geometry problem."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "So people who have studied the history of computer vision will find this very familiar that it's kind of in the same way that in the early days of computer vision, people thought of it very much as like an inverse graphics thing."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "In robotic grasping, people thought of it as an inverse physics problem essentially."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "You look at what's in front of you, figure out the shapes, then use your best estimate of the laws of physics to figure out where to put your fingers on, you pick up the thing."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "And it turns out that works really well for robotic grasping instantiated in many different recent works, including our own, but also ones from many other labs is to use learning methods with some combination of either exhaustive simulation or like actual real world trial and error."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "And it turns out that those things actually work really well and then you don't have to worry about solving geometry problems or physics problems."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "What are, just by the way, in the grasping, what are the difficulties that have been worked on?"}, {"time": 1836, "text": "So one is like the materials of things, maybe occlusions on the perception side."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Why is it such a difficult, why is picking stuff up such a difficult problem?"}, {"time": 1845, "text": "Yeah, it's a difficult problem because the number of things that you might have to deal with or the variety of things that you have to deal with is extremely large."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "And oftentimes things that work for one class of objects won't work for other classes of objects."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "So if you, if you get really good at picking up boxes and now you have to pick up plastic bags, you know, you just need to employ a very different strategy."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "And there are many properties of objects that are more than just their geometry that has to do with, you know, the bits that are easier to pick up, the bits that are hard to pick up, the bits that are more flexible, the bits that will cause the thing to pivot and bend and drop out of your hand versus the bits that result in a nice secure grasp."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "Things that are flexible, things that if you pick them up the wrong way, they'll fall upside down and the contents will spill out."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "So there's all these little details that come up, but the task is still kind of can be characterized as one task."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "Like there's a very clear notion of you did it or you didn't do it."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "So in terms of spilling things, there creeps in this notion that starts to sound and feel like common sense reasoning."}, {"time": 1913, "text": "Do you think solving the general problem of robotics requires common sense reasoning, requires general intelligence, this kind of human level capability of, you know, like you said, be robust and deal with uncertainty, but also be able to sort of reason and assimilate different pieces of knowledge that you have?"}, {"time": 1938, "text": "What are your thoughts on the needs?"}, {"time": 1943, "text": "Of common sense reasoning in the space of the general robotics problem?"}, {"time": 1948, "text": "So I'm going to slightly dodge that question and say that I think maybe actually it's the other way around is that studying robotics can help us understand how to put common sense into our AI systems."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "One way to think about common sense is that, and why our current systems might lack common sense is that common sense is an emergent property of actually having to interact with a particular world, a particular universe, and get things done in that universe."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "So you might think that, for instance, like an image captioning system, maybe it looks at pictures of the world and it types out English sentences."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "So it kind of deals with our world."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "And then you can easily construct situations where image captioning systems do things that defy common sense, like give it a picture of a person wearing a fur coat and we'll say it's a teddy bear."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "But I think what's really happening in those settings is that the system doesn't actually live in our world."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "It lives in its own world that consists of pixels and English sentences and doesn't actually consist of having to put on a fur coat in the winter so you don't get cold."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "So perhaps the reason for the disconnect is that the systems that we have now simply inhabit a different universe."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "And if we build AI systems that are forced to deal with all of the messiness and complexity of our universe, maybe they will have to acquire common sense to essentially maximize their utility."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "Whereas the systems we're building now don't have to do that."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "They can take some shortcuts."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "You've a couple of times already sort of reframed the role of robotics in this whole thing."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "And for some reason, I don't know if my way of thinking is common, but I thought like we need to understand and solve intelligence in order to solve robotics."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And you're kind of framing it as, no, robotics is one of the best ways to just study artificial intelligence and build sort of like, robotics is like the right space in which you get to explore some of the fundamental learning mechanisms, fundamental sort of multimodal multitask aggregation of knowledge mechanisms that are required for general intelligence."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "It's really interesting way to think about it, but let me ask about learning."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "Can the general sort of robotics, the epitome of the robotics problem be solved purely through learning, perhaps end to end learning, sort of learning from scratch as opposed to injecting human expertise and rules and heuristics and so on?"}, {"time": 2100, "text": "I think that in terms of the spirit of the question, I would say yes."}, {"time": 2104, "text": "I mean, I think that though in some ways it's maybe like an overly sharp dichotomy, I think that in some ways when we build algorithms, at some point a person does something, a person turned on the computer, a person implemented a TensorFlow."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "But yeah, I think that in terms of the point that you're getting at, I do think the answer is yes."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "I think that we can solve many problems that have previously required meticulous manual engineering through automated optimization techniques."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "And actually one thing I will say on this topic is I don't think this is actually a very radical or very new idea."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "I think people have been thinking about automated optimization techniques as a way to do control for a very, very long time."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "And in some ways what's changed is really more the name."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "So today we would say that, oh, my robot does machine learning, it does reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "Maybe in the 1960s you'd say, oh, my robot is doing optimal control."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "And maybe the difference between typing out a system of differential equations and doing feedback linearization versus training a neural net, maybe it's not such a large difference."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "It's just pushing the optimization deeper and deeper into the thing."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "Well, it's interesting you think that way, but especially with deep learning that the accumulation of sort of experiences in data form to form deep representations starts to feel like knowledge as opposed to optimal control."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "So this feels like there's an accumulation of knowledge through the learning process."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "So I think that is a good point."}, {"time": 2205, "text": "That one big difference between learning based systems and classic optimal control systems is that learning based systems in principle should get better and better the more they do something."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "And I do think that that's actually a very, very powerful difference."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "So if we look back at the world of expert systems and symbolic AI and so on of using logic to accumulate expertise, human expertise, human encoded expertise, do you think that will have a role at some point?"}, {"time": 2233, "text": "The deep learning, machine learning, reinforcement learning has shown incredible results and breakthroughs and just inspired thousands, maybe millions of researchers."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "But there's this less popular now, but it used to be popular idea of symbolic AI."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "Do you think that will have a role?"}, {"time": 2255, "text": "I think in some ways the descendants of symbolic AI actually already have a role."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "So this is the highly biased history from my perspective."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "You say that, well, initially we thought that rational decision making involves logical manipulation."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "So you have some model of the world expressed in terms of logic."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "You have some query, like what action do I take in order for X to be true?"}, {"time": 2284, "text": "And then you manipulate your logical symbolic representation to get an answer."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "What that turned into somewhere in the 1990s is, well, instead of building kind of predicates and statements that have true or false values, we'll build probabilistic systems where things have probabilities associated and probabilities of being true and false."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "And that turned into Bayes nets."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "And that provided sort of a boost to what were really still essentially logical inference systems, just probabilistic logical inference systems."}, {"time": 2313, "text": "And then people said, well, let's actually learn the individual probabilities inside these models."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "And then people said, well, let's not even specify the nodes in the models, let's just put a big neural net in there."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "But in many ways, I see these as actually kind of descendants from the same idea."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "It's essentially instantiating rational decision making by means of some inference process and learning by means of an optimization process."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "So in a sense, I would say, yes, that it has a place."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "And in many ways that place is, it already holds that place."}, {"time": 2344, "text": "It's already in there."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "It's just quite different."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "It looks slightly different than it was before."}, {"time": 2350, "text": "But there are some things that we can think about that make this a little bit more obvious."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "Like if I train a big neural net model to predict what will happen in response to my robot's actions, and then I run probabilistic inference, meaning I invert that model to figure out the actions that lead to some plausible outcome, like to me, that seems like a kind of logic."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "You have a model of the world that just happens to be expressed by a neural net, and you are doing some inference procedure, some sort of manipulation on that model to figure out the answer to a query that you have."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "It's the interpretability."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "It's the explainability, though, that seems to be lacking more so because the nice thing about sort of expert systems is you can follow the reasoning of the system that to us mere humans is somehow compelling."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "It's just I don't know what to make of this fact that there's a human desire for intelligence systems to be able to convey in a poetic way to us why it made the decisions it did, like tell a convincing story."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "And perhaps that's like a silly human thing, like we shouldn't expect that of intelligence systems."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "I'm super happy that there is intelligence systems out there."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "But if I were to sort of psychoanalyze the researchers at the time, I would say expert systems connected to that part, that desire of AI researchers for systems to be explainable."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "I mean, maybe on that topic, do you have a hope that sort of inferences of learning based systems will be as explainable as the dream was with expert systems, for example?"}, {"time": 2455, "text": "I think it's a very complicated question because I think that in some ways the question of explainability is kind of very closely tied to the question of like performance, like, you know, why do you want your system to explain itself so that when it screws up, you can kind of figure out why it did it."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "But in some ways that's a much bigger problem, actually."}, {"time": 2477, "text": "Like your system might screw up and then it might screw up in how it explains itself."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "Or you might have some bug somewhere so that it's not actually doing what it was supposed to do."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "So, you know, maybe a good way to view that problem is really as a problem, as a bigger problem of verification and validation, of which explainability is sort of one component."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "I just see it differently."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "I see explainability, you put it beautifully, I think you actually summarize the field of explainability."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "But to me, there's another aspect of explainability, which is like storytelling that has nothing to do with errors or with, like, it uses errors as elements of its story as opposed to a fundamental need to be explainable when errors occur."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "It's just that for other intelligent systems to be in our world, we seem to want to tell each other stories."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "And that's true in the political world, that's true in the academic world."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "And that, you know, neural networks are less capable of doing that, or perhaps they're equally capable of storytelling and storytelling."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "Maybe it doesn't matter what the fundamentals of the system are."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "You just need to be a good storyteller."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "Maybe one specific story I can tell you about in that space is actually about some work that was done by my former collaborator, who's now a professor at MIT named Jacob Andreas."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "Jacob actually works in natural language processing, but he had this idea to do a little bit of work in reinforcement learning on how natural language can basically structure the internals of policies trained with RL."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "And one of the things he did is he set up a model that attempts to perform some task that's defined by a reward function, but the model reads in a natural language instruction."}, {"time": 2586, "text": "So this is a pretty common thing to do in instruction following."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "So you tell it like, you know, go to the red house and then it's supposed to go to the red house."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "But then one of the things that Jacob did is he treated that sentence, not as a command from a person, but as a representation of the internal kind of a state of the mind of this policy, essentially."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "So that when it was faced with a new task, what it would do is it would basically try to think of possible language descriptions, attempt to do them and see if they led to the right outcome."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "So it would kind of think out loud, like, you know, I'm faced with this new task."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "What am I going to do?"}, {"time": 2619, "text": "Let me go to the red house."}, {"time": 2620, "text": "Oh, that didn't work."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "Let me go to the blue room or something."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "Let me go to the green plant."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "And once it got some reward, it would say, oh, go to the green plant."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "That's what's working."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "I'm going to go to the green plant."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "And then you could look at the string that it came up with, and that was a description of how it thought it should solve the problem."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "So you could do, you could basically incorporate language as internal state and you can start getting some handle on these kinds of things."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "And then what I was kind of trying to get to is that also, if you add to the reward function, the convincingness of that story."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "So I have another reward signal of like people who review that story, how much they like it."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "So that, you know, initially that could be a hyperparameter sort of hard coded heuristic type of thing, but it's an interesting notion of the convincingness of the story becoming part of the reward function, the objective function of the explainability."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "That's in the world of sort of Twitter and fake news, that might be a scary notion that the nature of truth may not be as important as the convincingness of the, how convincing you are in telling the story around the facts."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "Well, let me ask the basic question."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "You're one of the world class researchers in reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, certainly in the robotic space."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "What is reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 2704, "text": "I think that what reinforcement learning refers to today is really just the kind of the modern incarnation of learning based control."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "So classically reinforcement learning has a much more narrow definition, which is that it's literally learning from reinforcement, like the thing does something and then it gets a reward or punishment."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "But really I think the way the term is used today is it's used to refer more broadly to learning based control."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "So some kind of system that's supposed to be controlling something and it uses data to get better."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "And what does control mean?"}, {"time": 2735, "text": "So this action is the fundamental element there."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "It means making rational decisions."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "And rational decisions are decisions that maximize a measure of utility."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "And sequentially, so you made decisions time and time and time again."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "Now like it's easier to see that kind of idea in the space of maybe games and the space of robotics."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "Do you see it bigger than that?"}, {"time": 2758, "text": "Is it applicable?"}, {"time": 2759, "text": "Like where are the limits of the applicability of reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 2764, "text": "Yeah, so rational decision making is essentially the encapsulation of the AI problem viewed through a particular lens."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "So any problem that we would want a machine to do, an intelligent machine, can likely be represented as a decision making problem."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "Learning images is a decision making problem, although not a sequential one typically."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Controlling a chemical plant is a decision making problem."}, {"time": 2790, "text": "Deciding what videos to recommend on YouTube is a decision making problem."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "And one of the really appealing things about reinforcement learning is if it does encapsulate the range of all these decision making problems, perhaps working on reinforcement learning is one of the ways to reach a very broad swath of AI problems."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "What is the fundamental difference between reinforcement learning and maybe supervised machine learning?"}, {"time": 2817, "text": "So reinforcement learning can be viewed as a generalization of supervised machine learning."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "You can certainly cast supervised learning as a reinforcement learning problem."}, {"time": 2825, "text": "You can just say your loss function is the negative of your reward."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "But you have stronger assumptions."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "You have the assumption that someone actually told you what the correct answer was, that your data was IID and so on."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "So you could view reinforcement learning as essentially relaxing some of those assumptions."}, {"time": 2840, "text": "Now that's not always a very productive way to look at it because if you actually have a supervised learning problem, you'll probably solve it much more effectively by using supervised learning methods because it's easier."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "But you can view reinforcement learning as a generalization of that."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "But they're fundamentally different."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "That's a mathematical statement."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "That's absolutely correct."}, {"time": 2858, "text": "But it seems that reinforcement learning, the kind of tools we bring to the table today of today."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "So maybe down the line, everything will be a reinforcement learning problem."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "Just like you said, image classification should be mapped to a reinforcement learning problem."}, {"time": 2873, "text": "But today, the tools and ideas, the way we think about them are different, sort of supervised learning has been used very effectively to solve basic narrow AI problems."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "Reinforcement learning kind of represents the dream of AI."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "It's very much so in the research space now in sort of captivating the imagination of people of what we can do with intelligent systems, but it hasn't yet had as wide of an impact as the supervised learning approaches."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "So my question comes from the more practical sense, like what do you see is the gap between the more general reinforcement learning and the very specific, yes, it's a question decision making with one step in the sequence of the supervised learning?"}, {"time": 2923, "text": "So from a practical standpoint, I think that one thing that is potentially a little tough now, and this is I think something that we'll see, this is a gap that we might see closing over the next couple of years, is the ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to effectively utilize large amounts of prior data."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "So one of the reasons why it's a bit difficult today to use reinforcement learning for all the things that we might want to use it for is that in most of the settings where we want to do rational decision making, it's a little bit tough to just deploy some policy that does crazy stuff and learns purely through trial and error."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "It's much easier to collect a lot of data, a lot of logs of some other policy that you've got, and then maybe if you can get a good policy out of that, then you deploy it and let it kind of fine tune a little bit."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "But algorithmically, it's quite difficult to do that."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "So I think that once we figure out how to get reinforcement learning to bootstrap effectively from large data sets, then we'll see very, very rapid growth in applications of these technologies."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "So this is what's referred to as off policy reinforcement learning or offline RL or batch RL."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "And I think we're seeing a lot of research right now that's bringing us closer and closer to that."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "Can you maybe paint the picture of the different methods?"}, {"time": 2997, "text": "So you said off policy, what's value based reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 3002, "text": "What's policy based?"}, {"time": 3003, "text": "What's model based?"}, {"time": 3004, "text": "What's off policy, on policy?"}, {"time": 3005, "text": "What are the different categories of reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 3008, "text": "So one way we can think about reinforcement learning is that it's, in some very fundamental way, it's about learning models that can answer kind of what if questions."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "So what would happen if I take this action that I hadn't taken before?"}, {"time": 3024, "text": "And you do that, of course, from experience, from data."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "And oftentimes you do it in a loop."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "So you build a model that answers these what if questions, use it to figure out the best action you can take, and then go and try taking that and see if the outcome agrees with what you predicted."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "So the different kinds of techniques basically refer to different ways of doing it."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "So model based methods answer a question of what state you would get, basically what would happen to the world if you were to take a certain action."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Value based methods, they answer the question of what value you would get, meaning what utility you would get."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "But in a sense, they're not really all that different because they're both really just answering these what if questions."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "Now unfortunately for us, with current machine learning methods, answering what if questions can be really hard because they are really questions about things that didn't happen."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "If you wanted to answer what if questions about things that did happen, you wouldn't need a learn model."}, {"time": 3075, "text": "You would just like repeat the thing that worked before."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "And that's really a big part of why RL is a little bit tough."}, {"time": 3083, "text": "So if you have a purely on policy kind of online process, then you ask these what if questions, you make some mistakes, then you go and try doing those mistaken things."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "And then you observe kind of the counter examples that will teach you not to do those things again."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "If you have a bunch of off policy data and you just want to synthesize the best policy you can out of that data, then you really have to deal with the challenges of making these counterfactual."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "First of all, what's a policy?"}, {"time": 3110, "text": "A policy is a model or some kind of function that maps from observations of the world to actions."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "So in reinforcement learning, we often refer to the current configuration of the world as the state."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "So we say the state kind of encompasses everything you need to fully define where the world is at the moment."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "And depending on how we formulate the problem, we might say you either get to see the state or you get to see an observation, which is some snapshot, some piece of the state."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "So policy just includes everything in it in order to be able to act in this world."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "And so what does off policy mean?"}, {"time": 3149, "text": "Yeah, so the terms on policy and off policy refer to how you get your data."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "So if you get your data from somebody else who was doing some other stuff, maybe you get your data from some manually programmed system that was just running in the world before that's referred to as off policy data."}, {"time": 3166, "text": "But if you got the data by actually acting in the world based on what your current policy thinks is good, we call that on policy data."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And obviously on policy data is more useful to you because if your current policy makes some bad decisions, you will actually see that those decisions are bad."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "Off policy data, however, might be much easier to obtain because maybe that's all the logged data that you have from before."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "So we talk about offline, talked about autonomous vehicles so you can envision off policy kind of approaches in robotic spaces where there's already a ton of robots out there, but they don't get the luxury of being able to explore based on a reinforcement learning framework."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "So how do we make, again, open question, but how do we make off policy methods work?"}, {"time": 3213, "text": "So this is something that has been kind of a big open problem for a while."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "And in the last few years, people have made a little bit of progress on that."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "You know, I can tell you about, and it's not by any means solved yet, but I can tell you some of the things that, for example, we've done to try to address some of the challenges."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "It turns out that one really big challenge with off policy reinforcement learning is that you can't really trust your models to give accurate predictions for any possible action."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "So if I've never tried to, if in my data set I never saw somebody steering the car off the road onto the sidewalk, my value function or my model is probably not going to predict the right thing if I ask what would happen if I were to steer the car off the road onto the sidewalk."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "So one of the important things you have to do to get off policy RL to work is you have to be able to figure out whether a given action will result in a trustworthy prediction or not."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "And you can use a kind of distribution estimation methods, kind of density estimation methods to try to figure that out."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "So you could figure out that, well, this action, my model is telling me that it's great, but it looks totally different from any action I've taken before, so my model is probably not correct."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "And you can incorporate regularization terms into your learning objective that will essentially tell you not to ask those questions that your model is unable to answer."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "What would lead to breakthroughs in this space, do you think?"}, {"time": 3294, "text": "Like what's needed?"}, {"time": 3295, "text": "Is this a data set question?"}, {"time": 3297, "text": "Do we need to collect big benchmark data sets that allow us to explore the space?"}, {"time": 3303, "text": "Is it a new kinds of methodologies?"}, {"time": 3308, "text": "Like what's your sense?"}, {"time": 3309, "text": "Or maybe coming together in a space of robotics and defining the right problem to be working on?"}, {"time": 3315, "text": "I think for off policy reinforcement learning in particular, it's very much an algorithms question right now."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "And this is something that I think is great because an algorithms question is that that just takes some very smart people to get together and think about it really hard, whereas if it was like a data problem or a hardware problem, that would take some serious engineering."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "So that's why I'm pretty excited about that problem because I think that we're in a position where we can make some real progress on it just by coming up with the right algorithms."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "In terms of which algorithms they could be, the problems at their core are very related to problems in things like causal inference."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "Because what you're really dealing with is situations where you have a model, a statistical model, that's trying to make predictions about things that it hadn't seen before."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "And if it's a model that's generalizing properly, that'll make good predictions."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "If it's a model that picks up on spurious correlations, that will not generalize properly."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "And then you have an arsenal of tools you can use."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "You could, for example, figure out what are the regions where it's trustworthy, or on the other hand, you could try to make it generalize better somehow, or some combination of the two."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "Is there room for mixing where most of it, like 90, 95% is off policy, you already have the data set, and then you get to send the robot out to do a little exploration?"}, {"time": 3396, "text": "What's that role of mixing them together?"}, {"time": 3399, "text": "I think that this is something that you actually described very well at the beginning of our discussion when you talked about the iceberg."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "This is the iceberg."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "The 99% of your prior experience, that's your iceberg."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "You'd use that for off policy reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "And then, of course, if you've never opened that particular kind of door with that particular lock before, then you have to go out and fiddle with it a little bit."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "And that's that additional 1% to help you figure out a new task."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "And I think that's actually a pretty good recipe going forward."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "Is this, to you, the most exciting space of reinforcement learning now?"}, {"time": 3432, "text": "Or is there, what's, and maybe taking a step back, not just now, but what's, to you, is the most beautiful idea, apologize for the romanticized question, but the beautiful idea or concept in reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 3447, "text": "In general, I actually think that one of the things that is a very beautiful idea in reinforcement learning is just the idea that you can obtain a near optimal control or near optimal policy without actually having a complete model of the world."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "This is, you know, it's something that feels perhaps kind of obvious if you just hear the term reinforcement learning or you think about trial and error learning."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "But from a controls perspective, it's a very weird thing because classically, you know, we think about engineered systems and controlling engineered systems as the problem of writing down some equations and then figuring out given these equations, you know, basically solve for X, figure out the thing that maximizes its performance."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "And the theory of reinforcement learning actually gives us a mathematically principled framework to think, to reason about, you know, optimizing some quantity when you don't actually know the equations that govern that system."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And I don't, to me, that's actually seems kind of, you know, very elegant, not something that sort of becomes immediately obvious, at least in the mathematical sense."}, {"time": 3520, "text": "Does it make sense to you that it works at all?"}, {"time": 3522, "text": "Well, I think it makes sense when you take some time to think about it, but it is a little surprising."}, {"time": 3529, "text": "Well, then taking a step into the more deeper representations, which is also very surprising of sort of the richness of the state space, the space of environments that this kind of approach can operate in, can you maybe say what is deep reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 3550, "text": "Well, deep reinforcement learning simply refers to taking reinforcement learning algorithms and combining them with high capacity neural net representations."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "Which is, you know, kind of, it might at first seem like a pretty arbitrary thing, just take these two components and stick them together."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "But the reason that it's something that has become so important in recent years is that reinforcement learning, it kind of faces an exacerbated version of a problem that has faced many other machine learning techniques."}, {"time": 3580, "text": "So if we go back to like, you know, the early two thousands or the late nineties, we'll see a lot of research on machine learning methods that have some very appealing mathematical properties like they reduce the convex optimization problems, for instance, but they require very special inputs."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "They require a representation of the input that is clean in some way."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "Like for example, clean in the sense that the classes in your multi class classification problems separate linearly."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "So they have some kind of good representation and we call this a feature representation."}, {"time": 3612, "text": "And for a long time, people were very worried about features in the world of supervised learning because somebody had to actually build those features so you couldn't just take an image and plug it into your logistic regression or your SVM or something."}, {"time": 3622, "text": "How to take that image and process it using some handwritten code."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "And then neural nets came along and they could actually learn the features and suddenly we could apply learning directly to the raw inputs, which was great for images, but it was even more great for all the other fields where people hadn't come up with good features yet."}, {"time": 3640, "text": "And one of those fields actually reinforcement learning because in reinforcement learning, the notion of features, if you don't use neural nets and you have to design your own features is very, very opaque."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "Like it's very hard to imagine, let's say I'm playing chess or go."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "What is a feature with which I can represent the value function for go or even the optimal policy for go linearly?"}, {"time": 3659, "text": "Like I don't even know how to start thinking about it."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "And people tried all sorts of things that would write down, you know, an expert chess player looks for whether the knight is in the middle of the board or not."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "So that's a feature is knight in middle of board."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "And they would write these like long lists of kind of arbitrary made up stuff."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "And that was really kind of getting us nowhere."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "And that's a little, chess is a little more accessible than the robotics problem."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "There's at least experts in the different features for chess, but still like the neural network there, to me, that's, I mean, you put it eloquently and almost made it seem like a natural step to add neural networks, but the fact that neural networks are able to discover features in the control problem, it's very interesting."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "It's hopeful."}, {"time": 3706, "text": "I'm not sure what to think about it, but it feels hopeful that the control problem has features to be learned."}, {"time": 3714, "text": "Like I guess my question is, is it surprising to you how far the deep side of deep reinforcement learning was able to like what the space of problems has been able to tackle from, especially in games with alpha star and alpha zero and just the representation power there and in the robotics space and what is your sense of the limits of this representation power and the control context?"}, {"time": 3746, "text": "I think that in regard to the limits that here, I think that one thing that makes it a little hard to fully answer this question is because in settings where we would like to push these things to the limit, we encounter other bottlenecks."}, {"time": 3764, "text": "So like the reason that I can't get my robot to learn how to like, I don't know, do the dishes in the kitchen, it's not because it's neural net is not big enough."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "It's because when you try to actually do trial and error learning, reinforcement learning, directly in the real world where you have the potential to gather these large, highly varied and complex data sets, you start running into other problems."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "Like one problem you run into very quickly, it'll first sound like a very pragmatic problem, but it actually turns out to be a pretty deep scientific problem."}, {"time": 3799, "text": "Take the robot, put it in your kitchen, have it try to learn to do the dishes with trial and error."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "It'll break all your dishes and then we'll have no more dishes to clean."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "Now you might think this is a very practical issue, but there's something to this, which is that if you have a person trying to do this, a person will have some degree of common sense."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "They'll break one dish, they'll be a little more careful with the next one, and if they break all of them, they're going to go and get more or something like that."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "So there's all sorts of scaffolding that comes very naturally to us for our learning process."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "Like if I have to learn something through trial and error, I have the common sense to know that I have to try multiple times."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "If I screw something up, I ask for help or I reset things or something like that."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "And all of that is kind of outside of the classic reinforcement learning problem formulation."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "There are other things that can also be categorized as kind of scaffolding, but are very important."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "Like for example, where do you get your reward function?"}, {"time": 3849, "text": "If I want to learn how to pour a cup of water, well, how do I know if I've done it correctly?"}, {"time": 3855, "text": "Now that probably requires an entire computer vision system to be built just to determine that, and that seems a little bit inelegant."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "So there are all sorts of things like this that start to come up when we think through what we really need to get reinforcement learning to happen at scale in the real world."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "And many of these things actually suggest a little bit of a shortcoming in the problem formulation and a few deeper questions that we have to resolve."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "I talked to David Silver about AlphaZero, and it seems like there's no, again, we haven't hit the limit at all in the context where there's no broken dishes."}, {"time": 3890, "text": "So in the case of Go, you can, it's really about just scaling compute."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "So again, like the bottleneck is the amount of money you're willing to invest in compute and then maybe the different, the scaffolding around how difficult it is to scale compute maybe, but there, there's no limit."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "And it's interesting, now we'll move to the real world and there's the broken dishes, there's all the, and the reward function, like you mentioned, that's really nice."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "So what, how do we push forward there?"}, {"time": 3919, "text": "Do you think there's, there's this kind of a sample efficiency question that people bring up of, you know, not having to break a hundred thousand dishes."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "Is this an algorithm question?"}, {"time": 3933, "text": "Is this a data selection like question?"}, {"time": 3938, "text": "How do we, how do we not break too many dishes?"}, {"time": 3942, "text": "Well, one way we can think about that is that maybe we need to be better at, at reusing our data, building that, that iceberg."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "And you know, the study of these kinds of questions typically falls under categories like multitask learning or meta learning, but they all fundamentally deal with the same general theme, which is use experience for doing other things to learn to do new things efficiently and quickly."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "So what do you think about if we just look at the one particular case study of a Tesla autopilot that has quickly approaching towards a million vehicles on the road where some percentage of the time, 30, 40% of the time is driven using the computer vision, multitask hydranet, right?"}, {"time": 4017, "text": "And then the other percent, that's what they call it, hydranet."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "The other percent is human controlled."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "In the human side, how can we use that data?"}, {"time": 4032, "text": "What's the signal?"}, {"time": 4033, "text": "Do you have ideas in this autonomous vehicle space when people can lose their lives?"}, {"time": 4037, "text": "You know, it's a safety critical environment."}, {"time": 4041, "text": "So how do we use that data?"}, {"time": 4043, "text": "So I think that actually the kind of problems that come up when we want systems that are reliable and that can kind of understand the limits of their capabilities, they're actually very similar to the kind of problems that come up when we're doing off policy reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 4061, "text": "So as I mentioned before, in off policy reinforcement learning, the big problem is you need to know when you can trust the predictions of your model, because if you're trying to evaluate some pattern of behavior for which your model doesn't give you an accurate prediction, then you shouldn't use that to modify your policy."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "It's actually very similar to the problem that we're faced when we actually then deploy that thing and we want to decide whether we trust it in the moment or not."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "So perhaps we just need to do a better job of figuring out that part, and that's a very deep research question, of course, but it's also a question that a lot of people are working on."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "So I'm pretty optimistic that we can make some progress on that over the next few years."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "What's the role of simulation in reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 4101, "text": "Like how essential is it?"}, {"time": 4103, "text": "It's been essential for the breakthroughs so far for some interesting breakthroughs."}, {"time": 4108, "text": "Do you think it's a crutch that we rely on?"}, {"time": 4111, "text": "I mean, again, this connects to our off policy discussion, but do you think we can ever get rid of simulation or do you think simulation will actually take over?"}, {"time": 4120, "text": "We'll create more and more realistic simulations that will allow us to solve actual real world problems, like transfer the models we learn in simulation to real world problems."}, {"time": 4151, "text": "In fact, this is a general thing."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "If your machine has any bottleneck that is built by humans and that doesn't improve from data, it will eventually be the thing that holds it back."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "And if you're entirely reliant on your simulator, that'll be the bottleneck."}, {"time": 4165, "text": "If you're entirely reliant on a manually designed controller, that's going to be the bottleneck."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "So simulation is very useful."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "It's very pragmatic, but it's not a substitute for being able to utilize real experience."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "To throw a brief wrench into our discussion, let me ask, do you think we're living in a simulation?"}, {"time": 4208, "text": "Oh, I have no idea."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "Do you think that's a useful thing to even think about, about the fundamental physics nature of reality?"}, {"time": 4218, "text": "Or another perspective, the reason I think the simulation hypothesis is interesting is to think about how difficult is it to create sort of a virtual reality game type situation that will be sufficiently convincing to us humans or sufficiently enjoyable that we wouldn't want to leave."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "I mean, that's actually a practical engineering challenge."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "And I personally really enjoy virtual reality, but it's quite far away."}, {"time": 4247, "text": "I kind of think about what would it take for me to want to spend more time in virtual reality versus the real world."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "And that's a sort of a nice clean question because at that point, if I want to live in a virtual reality, that means we're just a few years away where a majority of the population lives in a virtual reality."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "And that's how we create the simulation, right?"}, {"time": 4271, "text": "You don't need to actually simulate the quantum gravity and just every aspect of the universe."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "And that's an interesting question for reinforcement learning too, is if we want to make sufficiently realistic simulations that may blend the difference between sort of the real world and the simulation, thereby just some of the things we've been talking about, kind of the problems go away if we can create actually interesting, rich simulations."}, {"time": 4301, "text": "And it actually, I think your question casts your previous question in a very interesting light, because in some ways asking whether we can, well, the more kind of practical version is like, you know, can we build simulators that are good enough to train essentially AI systems that will work in the world?"}, {"time": 4322, "text": "And it's kind of interesting to think about this, about what this implies, if true, it kind of implies that it's easier to create the universe than it is to create a brain."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "And that seems like, put this way, it seems kind of weird."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "The aspect of the simulation most interesting to me is the simulation of other humans."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "That seems to be a complexity that makes the robotics problem harder."}, {"time": 4347, "text": "Now I don't know if every robotics person agrees with that notion."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "Just as a quick aside, what are your thoughts about when the human enters the picture of the robotics problem?"}, {"time": 4359, "text": "How does that change the reinforcement learning problem, the learning problem in general?"}, {"time": 4364, "text": "Yeah, I think that's a, it's a kind of a complex question."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "And I guess my hope for a while had been that if we build these robotic learning systems that are multitask, that utilize lots of prior data and that learn from their own experience, the bit where they have to interact with people will be perhaps handled in much the same way as all the other bits."}, {"time": 4388, "text": "So if they have prior experience of interacting with people and they can learn from their own experience of interacting with people for this new task, maybe that'll be enough."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "Now, of course, if it's not enough, there are many other things we can do and there's quite a bit of research in that area."}, {"time": 4402, "text": "But I think it's worth a shot to see whether the multi agent interaction, the ability to understand that other beings in the world have their own goals and tensions and thoughts and so on, whether that kind of understanding can emerge automatically from simply learning to do things with and maximize utility."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "That information arises from the data."}, {"time": 4426, "text": "You've said something about gravity, that you don't need to explicitly inject anything into the system."}, {"time": 4434, "text": "They can be learned from the data."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "And gravity is an example of something that could be learned from data, so like the physics of the world."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "What are the limits of what we can learn from data?"}, {"time": 4448, "text": "Do you really think we can?"}, {"time": 4450, "text": "So a very simple, clean way to ask that is, do you really think we can learn gravity from just data, the idea, the laws of gravity?"}, {"time": 4459, "text": "So something that I think is a common kind of pitfall when thinking about prior knowledge and learning is to assume that just because we know something, then that it's better to tell the machine about that rather than have it figured out on its own."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "In many cases, things that are important that affect many of the events that the machine will experience are actually pretty easy to learn."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "If every time you drop something, it falls down, yeah, you might get the Newton's version, not Einstein's version, but it'll be pretty good and it will probably be sufficient for you to act rationally in the world because you see the phenomenon all the time."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "So things that are readily apparent from the data, we might not need to specify those by hand."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "It might actually be easier to let the machine figure them out."}, {"time": 4510, "text": "It just feels like that there might be a space of many local minima in terms of theories of this world that we would discover and get stuck on, that Newtonian mechanics is not necessarily easy to come by."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "And in fact, in some fields of science, for example, human civilization is itself full of these local optima."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "So for example, if you think about how people tried to figure out biology and medicine for the longest time, the kind of rules, the kind of principles that serve us very well in our day to day lives actually serve us very poorly in understanding medicine and biology."}, {"time": 4550, "text": "We had kind of very superstitious and weird ideas about how the body worked until the advent of the modern scientific method."}, {"time": 4558, "text": "So that does seem to be a failing of this approach, but it's also a failing of human intelligence arguably."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "Maybe a small aside, but some, you know, the idea of self play is fascinating in reinforcement learning sort of these competitive, creating a competitive context in which agents can play against each other in a, sort of at the same skill level and thereby increasing each other skill level."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "It seems to be this kind of self improving mechanism is exceptionally powerful in the context where it could be applied."}, {"time": 4589, "text": "First of all, is that beautiful to you that this mechanism work as well as it does?"}, {"time": 4594, "text": "And also can we generalize to other contexts like in the robotic space or anything that's applicable to the real world?"}, {"time": 4603, "text": "I think that it's a very interesting idea, but I suspect that the bottleneck to actually generalizing it to the robotic setting is actually going to be the same as the bottleneck for everything else that we need to be able to build machines that can get better and better through natural interaction with the world."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "And once we can do that, then they can go out and play with, they can play with each other, they can play with people, they can play with the natural environment."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "But before we get there, we've got all these other problems we've got, we have to get out of the way."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "So there's no shortcut around that."}, {"time": 4638, "text": "You have to interact with a natural environment that."}, {"time": 4641, "text": "Well because in a, in a self play setting, you still need a mediating mechanism."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "So the, the reason that, you know, self play works for a

the nature of that mediating mechanism."}, {"time": 4659, "text": "So on the side of reward functions, that's coming up with good reward functions seems to be the thing that we associate with general

in the computational neuroscience community by folks like Carl Friston."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "And we've done some work recently that shows that you can actually learn pretty interesting skills by

might not by itself be the right answer, but perhaps we can figure out an objective for which discovering new things is actually the natural consequence."}, {"time": 4844, "text": "That's something

there ways to understand or anticipate unexpected unintended consequences of particular reward functions, sort of anticipate the kind of strategies that might be developed and try to avoid highly

human brain, that it's malleable, but let's, on the topic of Mother Nature, what do we start with?"}, {"time": 956, "text": "Like, how blank is the slate?"}, {"time": 958, "text": "Ah, so it's not actually a blank slate."}, {"time": 961, "text": "What it's, it's terrific engineering that's set up in there, but much of that engineering has to do with, okay, just make sure that things get to the right place."}, {"time": 970, "text": "For example, like the fibers from the eyes getting to the visual cortex, or all this very complicated machinery in the ear getting to the auditory cortex, and so on."}, {"time": 977, "text": "So things, first of all, there's that."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And then what we also come equipped with is the ability to absorb language and culture and beliefs, and so on."}, {"time": 987, "text": "So you're already set up for that."}, {"time": 988, "text": "So no matter what you're exposed to, you will absorb some sort of language."}, {"time": 992, "text": "That's the trick, is how do you engineer something just enough that it's then a sponge that's ready to take in and fill in the blanks?"}, {"time": 1000, "text": "How much of the malleability is hardware?"}, {"time": 1002, "text": "How much is software?"}, {"time": 1003, "text": "Is that useful at all in the brain?"}, {"time": 1005, "text": "So what are we talking about?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So there's neurons, there's synapses, and all kinds of different synapses, and there's chemical communication, like electrical signals, and there's chemical communication from the synapses."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "I would say the software would be the timing and the nature of the electrical signals, I guess, and the hardware would be the actual synapses."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "So here's the thing, this is why I really, if we can, I wanna get away from the hardware and software metaphor because what happens is, as activity passes through the system, it changes things."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "Now, the thing that computer engineers are really used to thinking about is synapses, where two neurons connect."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "Of course, each neuron connects with 10,000 of its neighbors, but at a point where they connect, what we're all used to thinking about is the changing of the strength of that connection, the synaptic weight."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "But in fact, everything is changing."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "All of these things are plastic."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "The reason that most people only talk about the synaptic weights is because that's really all we can measure well."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "And all this other stuff is really, really hard to see with our current technology."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "So essentially, that just gets ignored."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "But in fact, the system is plastic at all these different levels."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "And my way of thinking about this is an analogy to pace layers."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "So pace layers is a concept that Stewart Brand suggested about how to think about cities."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "So you have fashion, which changes rapidly in cities."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "You have governance, which changes more slowly."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "You have the structure, the buildings of a city, which changes more slowly, all the way down to nature."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "You've got all these different layers of things that are changing at different paces, at different speeds."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "I've taken that idea and mapped it onto the brain, which is to say you have some biochemical cascades that are just changing really rapidly when something happens, all the way down to things that are more and more cemented in there."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "And this actually allows us to understand a lot about particular kinds of things that happen."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "For example, one of the oldest, probably the oldest rule in neurology is called Ribot's Law, which is that older memories are more stable than newer memories."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "So when you get old and demented, you'll be able to remember things from your young life."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Maybe you'll remember this podcast, but you won't remember what you did a month ago or a year ago."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "And this is a very weird structure, right?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "No other system works this way, where older memories are more stable than newer memories."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "But it's because through time, things get more and more cemented into deeper layers of the system."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "And so this is, I think, the way we have to think about the brain, not as, okay, you've got neurons, you've got synaptic weights, and that's it."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So, yeah, so the idea of LiveWare and LiveWired is that it's like a, it's a gradual, yeah, it's a gradual spectrum between software and hardware."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "And so the metaphors completely doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Cause like when you talk about software and hardware, it's really hard lines."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "I mean, of course, software is unlike hard, but even hardware, but like, so there's two groups, but in the software world, there's levels of abstractions, right?"}, {"time": 1239, "text": "There's the operating system, there's machine code, and then it gets higher and higher levels."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "But somehow that's actually fundamentally different than the layers of abstractions in the hardware."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "But in the brain, it's all like the same."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And I love the city, the city metaphor."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "I mean, yeah, it's kind of mind blowing cause it's hard to know what to think about that."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "Like if I were to ask the question, this is an important question for machine learning is, how does the brain learn?"}, {"time": 1269, "text": "So essentially you're saying that, I mean, it just learns on all of these different levels at all different paces."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "And as a result, what happens is as you practice something, you get good at something, you're physically changing the circuitry, you're adapting your brain around the thing that is relevant to you."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "So let's say you take up, do you know how to surf?"}, {"time": 1296, "text": "So let's say you take up surfing now at this age."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "What happens is you'll be terrible at first, you don't know how to operate your body, you don't know how to read the waves, things like that."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "And through time you get better and better."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "What you're doing is you're burning that into the actual circuitry of your brain."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "You're of course conscious when you're first doing it, you're thinking about, okay, where am I doing?"}, {"time": 1312, "text": "What's my body weight?"}, {"time": 1313, "text": "But eventually when you become a pro at it, you are not conscious of it at all."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "In fact, you can't even unpack what it is that you did."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Think about riding a bicycle."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "You can't describe how you're doing it, you're just doing it, you're changing your balance when you come, you know, you do this to go to a stop."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "So this is what we're constantly doing is actually shaping our own circuitry based on what is relevant for us."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Survival, of course, being the top thing that's relevant."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "But interestingly, especially with humans, we have these particular goals in our lives, computer science, neuroscience, whatever."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "And so we actually shape our circuitry around that."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "I mean, you mentioned this gets slower and slower with age, but is there, like I think I've read and spoken offline, even on this podcast with a developmental neurobiologist, I guess would be the right terminology, is like looking at the very early, like from embryonic stem cells to the creation of the brain."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And like, that's mind blowing how much stuff happens there."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "So it's very malleable at that stage."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And then, but after that, at which point does it stop being malleable?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So that's the interesting thing is that it remains malleable your whole life."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "So even when you're an old person, you'll be able to remember new faces and names, you'll be able to learn new sorts of tasks."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And thank goodness, cause the world is changing rapidly in terms of technology and so on."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "I just sent my mother an Alexa and she figured out how to go on the settings and do the thing."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And I was really impressed that she was able to do it."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "So there are parts of the brain that remain malleable their whole life."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "The interesting part is that really your goal is to make an internal model of the world."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Your goal is to say, okay, the brain is trapped in silence and darkness, and it's trying to understand how the world works out there, right?"},

to actually throw a few sensors, figure out what the hell's going on."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "You know what I sometimes think about is that movie, The Martian with Matt Damon, the, I mean, it was written in a book, of course, but the movie poster shows Matt Damon all alone on the red planet."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "And I think, God, that's actually what it's like to be inside your head and my head and anybody's head is that you're essentially on your own planet in there."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "And I'm essentially on my own planet."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "And everyone's got their

you mean."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "But the experience, of course, might be vastly different for us."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "But anyway, yes."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "So the brain is trapped in silence and darkness, each one of us, and what it's trying to do, this is the important part, it's trying to make an internal model of what's going on out there, as in how do I function in the world?"}, {"time": 1498, "text": "How do I interact with other people?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "Do I say something nice and polite?"}, {"time": 1502, "text": "Do I say something aggressive and mean?"}, {"time": 1504, "text": "Do I, you know, all these things that it's putting together about the world."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "And I think what happens when people get older and older, it may not be that plasticity is diminishing."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "It may be that their internal model essentially has set itself up in a way where it says, okay, I've pretty much got a really good understanding of the world now, and I don't really need to change, right?"}, {"time": 1525, "text": "So when much older people find themselves in a situation where they need to change, they can actually are able to do it."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "It's just that I think this notion that we all have that plasticity diminishes as we grow older is in part because the motivation isn't there."},

{"time": 1563, "text": "If we could talk about brain computer interfaces and Neuralink, what are your thoughts about the efforts of Elon Musk, Neuralink, BCI in general in this regard, which is adding a machine, a computer, the capability of a computer to communicate with the brain and the brain to communicate with a computer at the very basic applications and then like the futuristic kind of thoughts."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "Yeah, first of all, it's terrific that people are jumping in and doing that because it's clearly the future."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "The interesting part is our brains have pretty good methods of interacting with technology."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "So maybe it's your fat thumbs on a cell phone or something, but, or maybe it's watching a YouTube video and getting into your eye that way."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "But we have pretty rapid ways of communicating with technology and getting data."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "So if you actually crack open the

wanna do it because there's always risk of death and infection on the table."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "And also it's not clear how many people would say, I'm gonna volunteer to get something in my head so that I can text faster, 20% faster."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "So I think it's, mother nature surrounds the brain with this armored bunker of the skull because it's a very delicate material."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And there's an expression in neurosurgery about the brain is, the person is never the same after you open up their skull."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "Now, whether or not that's true or whatever, who cares?"}, {"time": 1671, "text": "But it's a big deal to do an open head surgery."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "So what I'm interested in is how can we get information in and out of the brain without having to crack the skull open?"}, {"time": 1680, "text": "Without messing with the biological part, directly connecting or messing with the intricate biological thing that we got going on and it seems to be working."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "And by the way, where Neuralink is going, which is wonderful, is going to be in patient cases."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "It really matters for all kinds of surgeries that a person needs, whether for Parkinson's or epilepsy or whatever."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "It's a terrific new technology for essentially sewing electrodes in there and getting more higher density of electrodes."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "I just don't think as far as the future of BCI goes, I don't suspect that people will go in and say, yeah, drill a hole in my head and do this."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "Well, it's interesting because I think there's a similar intuition but say in the world of autonomous vehicles that folks know how hard it is and it seems damn impossible."}, {"time": 1731, "text": "The similar intuition about, I'm sticking on the Elon Musk thing is just a good, easy example."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "Similar intuition about colonizing Mars, it like, if you really think about it, it seems extremely difficult."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "And almost, I mean, just technically difficult to a degree where you wanna ask, is it really worth doing, worth trying?"}, {"time": 1754, "text": "And then the same is applied with BCI."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "But the thing about the future is it's hard to predict."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "So the exciting thing to me with, so once it does, once if successful, it's able to help patients, it may be able to discover something very surprising of our ability to directly communicate with the brain."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "So exactly what you're interested in is figuring out how to play with this malleable brain, but like help assist it somehow."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "I mean, it's such a compelling notion to me that we're now working on all these exciting machine learning systems that are able to learn from data."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "And then if we can have this other brain that's a learning system, that's live wired on the human side and them to be able to communicate, it's like a self play mechanism was able to beat the world champion at Go."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "So they can play with each other, the computer and the brain, like when you sleep."}, {"time": 1822, "text": "I mean, there's a lot of futuristic kind of things that it's just exciting possibilities, but I hear you, we understand so little about the actual intricacies of the communication of the brain that it's hard to find the common language."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "Well, interestingly, the technologies that have been built don't actually require the perfect common language."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "So for example, hundreds of thousands of people are walking around with artificial ears and artificial eyes, meaning cochlear implants or retinal implants."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "So this is, you take a essentially digital microphone, you slip an electrode strip into the inner ear and people can learn how to hear that way, or you take an electrode grid and you plug it into the retina at the back of the eye and people can learn how to see that way."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "The interesting part is those devices don't speak exactly the natural biological language, they speak the dialect of Silicon Valley."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "And it turns out that as recently as about 25 years ago, a lot of people thought this was never gonna work."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "They thought it wasn't gonna work for that reason, but the brain figures it out."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "It's really good at saying, okay, look, there's some correlation between what I can touch and feel and hear and so on, and the data that's coming in, or between I clap my hands and I have signals coming in there and it figures out how to speak any language."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "So like no matter if it's Neuralink, so directly communicating with the brain, or it's a smartphone or Google Glass, or the brain figures out the efficient way of communication."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "Well, exactly, exactly."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "And what I propose is the potato head theory of evolution, which is that all our eyes and nose and mouth and ears and fingertips, all this stuff is just plug and play."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "And the brain can figure out what to do with the data that comes in."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "And part of the reason that I think this is right, and I care so deeply about this, is when you look across the animal kingdom, you find all kinds of weird peripheral devices plugged in, and the brain figures out what to do with the data."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "And I don't believe that Mother Nature has to reinvent the principles of brain operation each time to say, oh, now I'm gonna have heat pits to detect infrared."}, {"time": 1954, "text": "Now I'm gonna have something to detect electroreceptors on the body."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "Now I'm gonna detect something to pick up the magnetic field of the earth with cryptochromes in the eye."}, {"time": 1963,

it?"}, {"time": 1968, "text": "Oh, great, I'm gonna mold myself around the data that's coming in."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "It's kind of fascinating to think that, we think of smartphones and all this new technology as novel."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "It's totally novel as outside of what evolution ever intended or like what nature ever intended."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "It's fascinating to think that like the entirety of the process of evolution is perfectly fine and ready for the smartphone and the internet."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "Like it's ready."}, {"time": 1995, "text": "It's ready to be valuable to that."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "And whatever comes to cyborgs, to virtual reality, we kind of think like, this is, you know, there's all these like books written about what's natural and we're like destroying our natural cells by like embracing all this technology."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "It's kind of, you know, probably not giving the brain enough credit."}, {"time":

learns what to do with it."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "So do you think, just to linger for a little bit more, do you think it's possible to co adjust?"}, {"time": 2062, "text": "Like we're kind of, you know, for the machine to adjust to the brain, for the brain to adjust to the machine."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "I guess that's what's already happening."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "Sure, that is what's happening."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "So for example, when you put electrodes in the motor cortex to control a robotic arm for somebody who's paralyzed, the engineers do a lot of work to figure out, okay, what can we do with the algorithm here so that we can detect what's going on from these cells and figure out how to best program the robotic arm to move given the data that we're measuring from these cells."}, {"time": 2091, "text": "But also the brain is learning too."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "So, you know, the paralyzed woman says, wait, I'm trying to grab this thing."}, {"time":

you know, our brain is able to adjust to so much."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "You know, so many things happened this year, 2020, that you think like, how are we ever going to deal with it?"}, {"time":

but what I would say briefly on it is, first of all, I saw a cover of Time Magazine some years ago and it was a big sagittal slice of the brain and it said something like, what makes us good and evil?"}, {"time": 3119, "text": "And there was a little spot pointing to it and there was a picture of Gandhi and there was a little spot that was pointing to Hitler."}, {"time": 3123, "text": "And these Time Magazine covers always make me mad because it's so goofy to think that we're gonna find some spot in the brain or something."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "Instead, the interesting part is because we're livewired, we are all about the world and the culture around us."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "So somebody like Adolf Hitler got all this positive feedback about what was going on and the crazier and crazier the ideas he had and he's like, let's set up death camps and murder a bunch of people and so on."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "Somehow he was getting positive feedback from that and all these other people, they're all spun each other up."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "And you look at anything like, I mean, look at the cultural revolution in China or the Russian revolution or things like this where you look at these things, my God, how do people all behave like this?"}, {"time": 3175, "text": "But it's easy to see groups of people spinning themselves up in particular ways where they all say, well, would I have thought this was right in a different circumstance?"}, {"time": 3184, "text": "I don't know, but Fred thinks it's right and Steve thinks it's right, everyone around me seems to think it's right."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "And so part of the maybe downside of having a livewired brain is that you can get crowds of people doing things as a group."}, {"time": 3197,

people."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "In other words, Hitler was just a representation of whatever was going on with that huge crowd that he was surrounded with."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "So I only bring that up to say that it's very difficult to say what it is about this person's brain or that person's brain."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "He obviously got feedback for what he was doing."},

part of this puzzle."}, {"time": 3248, "text": "So it turns out that we are very engineered to care about in groups versus out groups."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "And this seems to be like a really fundamental thing."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "So we did this experiment in my lab where we brought people and we stick them in the scanner."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "And we, I don't know if you noticed, but we show them on the screen six hands and the computer goes around randomly picks a hand."}, {"time": 3273, "text": "And then you see that hand gets stabbed with a syringe needle."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "So you actually see a syringe needle enter the hand and come out."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "And it's really, what that does is that triggers parts of the pain matrix, this areas in your brain that are involved in feeling physical pain."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "Now, the interesting thing is it's not your hand that was stabbed."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "So what you're seeing is empathy."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "This is you seeing someone else's hand gets stabbed."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "You feel like, oh God, this is awful, right?"}, {"time": 3297, "text": "We contrast that by the way, with somebody's hand getting poked as a Q tip, which is, you know, looks visually the same, but you don't have that same level of response."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "Now what we do is we label each hand with a one word label, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist, Scientologist, Hindu."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "And now the computer goes around, picks a hand, stabs the hand."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "And the question is, how much does your brain care about all the people in your out group versus the one label that happens to match you?"}, {"time": 3326, "text": "And it turns out for everybody across all religions, they care much more about their in group than their out group."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "And when I say they care, what I mean is you get a bigger response from their brain."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "Everything's the same."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "It's the same hands."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "It's just a one word label."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "You care much more about your in group than your out group."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "And I wish this weren't true, but this is how humans are."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "I wonder how fundamental that is, or if it's the emergent thing about culture."}, {"time": 3353, "text": "Like if we lived alone with like, if it's genetically built into the brain, like this longing for tribe."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "So I'll tell you, we addressed that."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "So here's what we did."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "There are two, actually there are two other things we did as part of this study that I think matter for this point."}, {"time": 3369, "text": "One is, so okay, so we show that you have a much bigger response."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "And by the way, this is not a cognitive thing."}, {"time": 3374, "text": "This is a very low level basic response to seeing pain in somebody, okay."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "Great study by the way."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "Thanks, thanks, thanks."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "What we did next is we next have it where we say, okay, the year is 2025 and these three religions are now in a war against these three religions."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "And it's all randomized, right?"}, {"time": 3391, "text": "But what you see is your thing and you have two allies now against these others."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "And now it happens over the course of many trials, you see everybody gets stabbed at different times."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "And the question is, do you care more about your allies?"}, {"time": 3403, "text": "And the answer is yes."}, {"time": 3404, "text": "Suddenly people who a moment ago, you didn't really care when they got stabbed."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "Now, simply with this one word thing that they're now your allies, you care more about them."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "But then what I wanted to do was look at how ingrained is this or how arbitrary is it?"}, {"time": 3417, "text": "So we brought new participants in and we said, here's a coin, toss the coin."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "If it's heads, you're an Augustinian."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "If it's a tails, you're a Justinian."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "These are totally made up."}, {"time": 3428, "text": "Okay, so they toss it, they get whatever."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "We give them a band that says Augustinian on it, whatever tribe they're in now, and they get in the scanner and they see a thing on the screen that says the Augustinians and Justinians are two warring tribes."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "Then you see a bunch of hands, some are labeled Augustinians, some are Justinian."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "And now you care more about whichever team you're on than the other team, even though it's totally arbitrary and you know it's arbitrary because you're the one who tossed the coin."}, {"time": 3452, "text": "So it's a state that's very easy to find ourselves in."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "In other words, just before walking in the door, they'd never even heard of Augustinian versus Justinian and now their brain is representing it simply because they're told they're on this team."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "You know, now I did my own personal study of this."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "So once you're an Augustinian, that tends to be sticky because I've been a Packers fan, grew to be a Packers fan my whole life."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "Now when I'm in Boston with like the Patriots, it's been tough going for my livewired brain to switch to the Patriots."},

want some of the data types in Java to reflect in the JavaScript."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "You're going to want the primitive types that Java unfortunately separated from objects."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "So at least some of them, double, let's call it in Java's terms from the C term for double precision floating point, or strings or Booleans and objects."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "And so right away there was this constraint that looking like Java meant kind of a C curly brace syntax but also some of the data types and objects."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "Like objects and so on, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "Comparison operator."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "Garbage collection, all that stuff."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "Even the bitwise operators and the shift operators including the unsigned right shift, which Java had because it didn't have unsigned integer types."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "It said, if you want to do unsigned operations, use an operator."}, {"time": 1705, "text": "And that turned out to be important much later."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "I'll tell that story five time."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "But JavaScript inherited a set of operators, the expression grammar, the statement grammar up to a point from Java."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "But I wanted a functional language."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "I wanted scheme, a little bit of scheme, even though it wasn't as clean as scheme."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "I wanted."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "So you had a love, sorry to interrupt."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "You had a love for scheme and list but that functional language landscape."}, {"time": 1729, "text": "Yes, I wanted first class functions because I saw the need for callbacks in the browser where it's a single threaded program."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "All the early browsers were single threaded and it's the right model for users."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "Most users weren't ready for mutual exclusion and threading."}, {"time": 1741, "text": "So in a single threaded world, you cannot block the user interface."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "So you have to use a callback and run later."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "And without getting too fancy and trying to capture the continuation like call CC does in scheme, I thought I'll just make it easy to have fun arcs."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "First class functions you pass downward and it can call back, it'd be called back."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "And Java didn't have that at the time."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "It took forever to get proper first class functions or lambdas now into Java, Java seven or eight, I think."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "It did have concurrency, right?"}, {"time": 1773, "text": "But you were thinking that the JavaScript in the browser would not have the luxury of being concurrent."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "And the reason was Java was gonna run in the plugins."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "So it could fork threads and go to town."}, {"time": 1784, "text": "But the main action in the browser was in the single threaded program, the single Unix process on Unix or Windows."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "And it was where you had to service the event loop and then go do things."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "Respond to the network layout, some HTML, render it, turn widths into heights by filling containers, boxes, the early, what became the CSS box model."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "And run scripts to make the thing livelier, respond to user input."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "And all that event driven programming was in part like HyperCard because HyperCard had this on event name syntax."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "And so that's why you have in JavaScript on click run together as the name of the event handler."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And there's some funny ones on mouse over and on mouse out, people still complain about those."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "But there were many more events now over the years standardized, but it was a mix of event driven single threaded programming because it had to run in the main thread of the browser where the action is and Java never got there."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "Which meant Java could not interact easily or quickly or in a nested way with the document, with the objects reflected from the HTML document, with the tables and forms and so on."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "And that is one of the reasons I think JavaScript survived and Java kind of died."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Java was in this plugin prison."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "It essentially was confined to a rectangle, the applet rectangle."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "And while we even built next year, Nick Thompson, a friend from SGI who was an intern grad student at CMU at the time, built the first version of Live Connect to glue Java and JavaScript together to deliver on that vision where you do have commerce between the data types in the heap."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "Did it work?"}, {"time": 1878, "text": "It worked, but Java was in charge."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "JavaScript was in charge and Java was just these components, these helper objects."},

who needs the plugin?"}, {"time": 1889, "text": "And in fact, Sun mismanaged Java as a plugin."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "They thought, oh, Netscape is giving us the distribution vehicle and we don't care about the browser."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "It's just about getting Java out there."}, {"time": 1899, "text": "And that was a big miscalculation."}, {"time": 1901, "text": "They then tried, because Microsoft's killing Netscape after years, they tried getting into Microsoft."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "And you may remember there was a Sun Microsoft deal which famously blew up."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "And Microsoft kicked Java out of Windows."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "And that's when they really pulled the trigger."}, {"time": 1916, "text": "I think they'd already evaluated it and liked it on Anders Helzberg's.NET and C Sharp and decided we're gonna just not have Java."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "We don't want any of that Sun stuff."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "We don't want the patent risk."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "We don't want, I'm not sure what all fights were about."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "There was some patent angle to it, I think."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "And up till then, Microsoft had been using Java components like in Outlook Web Access, which had a lot of JavaScript to be a webmail like Hotmail, like user interface."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "They had to call the mail server through HTTP and they used a Java object to do this."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "And when they gave the boot to Sun, suddenly the left hand gave the boot and the right hand said, we better do something else in Outlook Web Access."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "What are we gonna do?"}, {"time": 1960, "text": "And they said, let's just add an ActiveX component, which is their own native way of embedding things in languages and it'll be what became XML HTTP request, which is now a web standard for calling asynchronously."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "And it's been replaced by the fetch API in HTML5 or HTML living document."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "But this whole lineage goes back to Java being successfully the loser and getting kicked out."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And after Microsoft kicked it out, it was a plugin and you would find it required for like smart card banking in the Nordic countries where that was mandated by law, but really didn't get used much."},

languages paper that Alan Wiersbrock did with my help, he did a lot of the writing."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "I think it was the 10 days from like Thursday evening through to the following weeks, you know, the whole of that week and then into the Monday."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "You get sleep?"}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And I was really going fast because I had already used a lot of C compiler and front end compiler knowledge that I'd gained from undergraduate school."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "When I started getting into computing as a renegade physics major, people were formalizing more efficient bottom up grammars, parsers for bottom up languages, really LALR one was the big thing."}, {"time": 2479, "text": "And I studied all this and learned how to parse them."}, {"time": 2482,

2492, "text": "And I did that for JavaScript in a blazing hurry, mostly got it right."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "I didn't have precedence inversion problems or other bugs, but I copied a lot from Java and C.

2514, "text": "And then after that, I had internal early adopters and they were using JavaScript to match a number against a database field that had been stringized."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "And they said, oh, can we just have implicit conversion?"}, {"time": 2526, "text": "Like an idiot, I agreed."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "I gave them what they wanted."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "I was trying to please them and get adoption."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "And that broke what equivalence relation nature there was to the double equal."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "There's some edge cases with not a number that break that too, but it really broke it."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "Having an implicit conversions in the operator is something that people still roast me over."}, {"time": 2549,

you can."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "Making it sloppy."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "So what is the biggest thing you regret in those 10 days?"}, {"time": 2565, "text": "And what is the biggest thing you're proud of?"}, {"time": 2567, "text": "So that making it sloppy came after the 10 days."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "And my lesson there, which I've tweeted is when people come to you saying, can you please make it sloppy or add this cute feature?"}, {"time": 2576, "text": "The answer should be no."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "And I should have known that because I think Nicholas Viert, one of my heroes said, the essence of design is leaving things out."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "But during the 10 days, I also, like I said, I was in such a hurry, I left out garbage collection, came back to haunt me, but I got reference counting in in time that people weren't running out of memory right away on long lived JavaScript."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "What happens when you don't have garbage collection and you have objects?"}, {"time": 2598, "text": "Well, you just run out of memory."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And you know, at first you write a short script and the page doesn't last long

memory."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "And this was noticed in the summer of 1985 and people were like, what's going on?"}, {"time": 2615, "text": "Oh yeah, I better go back and do reference counting."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "And then the problem with reference counting is you're writing the language in the runtime in C, an unsafe language, and if you're reference counting and you overflow the counter, you mismanage it so it goes high, it gets stuck high, you leak memory again and you run out."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "If you underflow it, you pre memory that's still in use."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "And even then we knew what all the security hackers came to know that you therefore have potentially a remote code execution vulnerability."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "Cause this was before things like non executable heap memory and staff defenses against taking over memory."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "So if you can, from the remote side, write some HTML and JavaScript that just happens to exploit a bug in memory safety, like it causes JavaScript to underflow reference counter."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "And the script still has its hands on that object and it's trying to call a method on it and there's some kind of lookup function table in the object, but you've managed to stuff the heap with strings that forwards their own lookalike for the function table."},

right away."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "So Netscape 2 came out after my 10 days and after these follow on work to embed JavaScript better in the browser and to add garbage or collection through

ahead."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "He's like, we need graphics too."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "And I thought, okay, I can try to get somebody I knew at SGI, but he's a grad student at MIT."}, {"time":

gave, I mean, maybe you'll speak to that, but it gave the name to JavaScript of ECMA script."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "That was the standard name because Java was a trademark of Suns."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "They were so aggressive, they were sending cease and desist letters to people whose middle European heritage meant their surname was Javanko and they called their website javanko.com

sent some people who were pretty good."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "And then when they realized that I was there and Netscape was not gonna just bend over and do whatever they wanted, they sent somebody really good."}, {"time": 3437, "text": "And he was a smart guy."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "He did a lot of the work on the first draft of the spec."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "Sean Katzenberger, he's left Microsoft."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "He even did what I sort of did."}, {"time": 3445, "text": "He told his bosses, stop bugging me to do other things."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "I'm focused on this."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "Cause it took a lot of focused work to create the first draft of the spec."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "And I was still holding, I was spending almost all the plates."},

take as much time as Sean was to write the draft spec, but I had to participate because I was essentially helping write down what the language did and in areas where we didn't like what it did and

the time, Jan van der Bell, was quite a raconteur and a very fun guy."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "And he had us out for, you know, the great, you know, Fui de mer, the bouillabaisse and the...

Katzenberger, Microsoft, was actually mad."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "We need him."}, {"time": 3556, "text": "And when I got there, I saw that only he saw this sort of off by one bug in somewhere in the spec."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "And then I saw it too."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And I said, there's a fence post bug there."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "And then we kind of locked eyes and we realized we were on the same page."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "And we kind of, he wasn't mad anymore."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "What were the features that are being struggled over and debated and thought about?"}, {"time": 3575, "text": "It was mainly writing down what worked and what we thought should work in the edge cases that didn't interoperate or that seemed wrong."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "But we were already laying the groundwork for the future additions that I was already implementing."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "I was still trying to lead the standard by using the dominant market power to write the code that actually shipped."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "So the de facto standard would lead the de jure standard."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "And I was putting in the missing function forms that I didn't have time for in the 10 days."}, {"time": 3600, "text": "So this is the engineering mindset versus the theoretician."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "So you didn't want to create the perfect language, but one that was the popular and shipped and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "And you could say there was, I was standing on the shoulders of giants."},

days."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "So they came in 1996 and 97, and they came into the third edition of the standard, which was final finalized in 1999."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "But at that point,

Internet Explorer the default browser in Windows, which is called tying and antitrust law."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "And they were doing even more brutal things."}, {"time": 3657, "text": "There was a famous investor."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "He did very well on Google."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "So he's a billionaire, Ramshree Ram, and he was sales guy or head of sales at Netscape."}, {"time":

browser."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "So there is some bullying going on."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "It was totally immaterial in the antitrust case."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "But JavaScript escaped into the standard setting where there was fairly good cooperation."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "Microsoft had a really good guy on it and Guy Steele was there for a time and there was some good work."},

3760, "text": "But ES6, it's become this like reputable, like it fixed major pain points, I think."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "It added things to the language and added something that was already ES5 strict mode, but made it implicit in class bodies and module bodies."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "It was a big jump, but it accumulated some of the ES4 designs that we'd done with Adobe for what we hoped would be the fourth edition of ECMAScript that were supposed to fold in some of these old JavaScript 2 ideas that had come into ActionScript 3."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "So you look at the family tree and you see these forks and the main ones are the ones that go into Adobe Flash acquired from Macromedia and the one that went into the service side of Microsoft's stack, which kind of died."}, {"time": 3807, "text": "And then trying to bring them back into the standard and not quite succeeding, ES4 was mothballed, but all the good parts that everyone liked made it into ES6."},

is brilliant, because then you can start incrementally adding type annotations, getting warnings, learning how to use them."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "Microsoft's had to kind of look around corners at the standards body and guess how their version of modules or decorators should work."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "And the standards body then may change things a bit."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "So I think they're obligated with TypeScript either to carry their own version or to bring it back with incompatible changes towards the standard over time."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "And I think they've played generally fair there."}, {"time": 3965, "text": "There's some sentiment that, why don't they standardize TypeScript?"}, {"time": 3967, "text": "Well, they've been clear they don't want to."},

kind of dance partner to JavaScript, to the base JavaScript?"}, {"time": 3985, "text": "There's a hope that at some point, if they keep reconverging it and the standard doesn't break them and goes in a good direction, we will get at least the annotation syntax and some semantics around them."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "Because when you're talking about type annotations, they're generally on parameters and return values and variable declarations."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "They're cast operators."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "You want that syntax to be reserved and you want it to work the

4024, "text": "What do you think about the giant ecosystem of frameworks in JavaScript?"}, {"time": 4029, "text": "It feels like, because, I mean, this is a side effect of how many people use

integers."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "And if you use these operators, if a compiler emits them in the right places, you can then treat them as typed values, typed memory locations, and you can type

up using process isolation too."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "And that kind of weakened it."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "And in the end, it was like portable native client, okay, meet the new boss, same as the old boss."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "This is the Google Flash, right?"}, {"time": 4693, "text": "But when we did Asm.js and we showed Unreal Engine working, I think it was only a matter of time before Google threw in the towel."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "And in fact, everybody agreed in spring of 2015, we're gonna take what was proven by Asm.js and make a new syntax, a binary syntax, it's efficient, that loads into the same JavaScript VM that JavaScript loads into."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "So there'll be two source languages, one VM, very important, one garbage collector, one memory

of Fortuna."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "And in the, it's about the 97, I was loaned by Netscape to do due diligence for Sun in their acquisition of Anamorphic, which was David Unger and friends,

it."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "But it also means that you can commit a blunder that just."}, {"time": 5953, "text": "You don't get punished for it, you don't detect."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "You get

it just a browser?"}, {"time": 6832, "text": "Because it'll be simpler, it'll do one job well."}, {"time": 6835, "text": "And even then we can strip it down by having extensions."}, {"time": 6838,

based on this work, was sort of in charge of getting distribution deals."}, {"time": 7490, "text": "And he got Google toolbar and Google desktop search distribution."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "And if you remember those pieces of software, those were like desktop extensions, toolbars or operating system extensions for doing desktop search, searching your local files."}, {"time": 7503, "text": "Kind of like Mac OS Spotlight, right?"}, {"time": 7505, "text": "Sadly, it died."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "It all died."}, {"time": 7508, "text": "And there were some features that we still missed that didn't make it into Chrome."}, {"time": 7510, "text": "But Sundar got OEMs to bundle those."}, {"time": 7514, "text": "And then he got enough of those deals that by 2007 or eight, Google felt, well, if Bing, Microsoft does the worst and tries to force Bing, we can reach in and reset it with that point of presence."}, {"time": 7525, "text": "So that was good for Sundar's career and it was good for Google, but it never came to pass that they had to defend."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "Microsoft was still slow."}, {"time": 7532, "text": "And by the time they saw Chrome come out, then they did what would have been IE9."}, {"time": 7537, "text": "And then they said, we're gonna have a fast JavaScript engine to Chakra, Chakra core."}, {"time": 7541, "text": "And they did okay."}, {"time": 7543, "text": "They were another process isolated, fast JavaScript browser, tab browser."}, {"time": 7548, "text": "So it sounds like there's a deep fundamental coupling of search engine and browser that's mixing this whole thing up."}, {"time": 7555, "text": "And obviously Firefox doesn't have a search engine."}, {"time": 7559, "text": "That's like, I mean, you're partnering with somebody with a search engine."}, {"time": 7564, "text": "With Yahoo or with Google or so on."}, {"time": 7568, "text": "They tried Yahoo, that was unfortunate because I think even though Marissa Mayer talked about it, she never pulled it off."}, {"time": 7575, "text": "They never restored the search team that had been laid off."}, {"time": 7579, "text": "I believe Carol Bartz was running Yahoo when Carol said, I've got to get rid of one of the three expensive things."}, {"time": 7584, "text": "I'm gonna get rid of search."}, {"time": 7585, "text": "And those researchers went to Google and Microsoft and there was no way to put Yahoo search back together."}, {"time": 7592, "text": "So when Firefox tried switching all their users who'd stuck with a default from Google to Yahoo, it was like mid December, 2014, a bunch of users said, what just happened to my Firefox?"}, {"time": 7604, "text": "And others didn't notice right away, but over time they did."}, {"time": 7606, "text": "And so over the next year, the traffic just went away for Yahoo."}, {"time": 7611, "text": "And yet they were obliged, I understand it."}, {"time": 7614, "text": "I don't have inside knowledge, but this has leaked out and Danny Sullivan's written about it, search engine land."}, {"time": 7619, "text": "I think the deal was like fixed payments to Mozilla."}, {"time": 7621, "text": "So Mozilla was getting a bunch of money for traffic that wasn't staying because users were resetting their default."}, {"time": 7626, "text": "And this shows how defaults are important, but they have to be good enough that the user doesn't override them."}, {"time": 7632, "text": "And a lot of the commercial value in popular apps is what are the default settings?"}, {"time": 7638, "text": "What is the default search?"}, {"time": 7640,

that's where, I mean, we'll talk about brave browser."}, {"time": 7652, "text": "It feels like now we're in this third stage where there's a Chrome, Firefox, Edge, I guess it's called and brave."},

stuff."}, {"time": 7673, "text": "There's evolution again, especially on tracking protection."}, {"time": 7676, "text": "So privacy is this sort of global wave that's rising."}, {"time": 7682, "text":

you know what a cookie is, it's a little bit of storage in the browser indexed by the name of the site."}, {"time": 7773, "text": "And it's really only the main name of the site, like bofa.com or, you know, something like npr.org."}, {"time": 7783, "text": "Every site can store some information in a cookie."}, {"time": 7785, "text": "Every time it's contacted by the browser, the previous version is sent back."}, {"time": 7790, "text": "And in the response from the server, the cookie's updated."}, {"time": 7794, "text": "So it's this little bit of storage in the browser that the site can keep updating and it can store an encrypted version of your login credentials with a timestamp so you can stay logged in without having to retype your password every time you navigate, which is how it would be if you didn't have cookies."}, {"time": 7811, "text": "The web protocols, especially in the 90s, are so called stateless protocols."}, {"time": 7816, "text": "So you go to your bank, you log in, you go from your login confirmed page to your account view."}, {"time": 7822, "text": "If you didn't have a cookie, you'd be logging in again."}, {"time": 7824, "text": "Every time you type in the source."}, {"time": 7826, "text": "So that was the great thing about cookies."}, {"time": 7827, "text": "Luhmann truly did it in a hurry in 1994 before I joined Escape and he did it for really holding that kind of credential."}, {"time": 7834, "text": "But even then there was the image element embedded in the page and the image gets fetched possibly from a different server and that request carries the last cookie, which could be empty at first, and the response carries the updated cookie."}, {"time": 7847, "text": "So just by having images and cookies, you got tracking because that image server can be serving a little one by one pixel and they still use the word pixel in ad tech."}, {"time": 7856, "text": "And that pixel can be served from the same server, embedded differently with different URL spellings in the New York Times and ESPN."}, {"time": 7863, "text": "And as you go from one to the other, the image server can say, I haven't got a cookie for you."}, {"time": 7868, "text": "It's empty initially."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "I'm gonna assign you user number 1234."}, {"time": 7871, "text": "I'm gonna put a database entry in."}, {"time": 7873, "text": "And I see, by the way, I always fetch the name of the path part of the URL that I was in the New York Times."}, {"time": 7877, "text": "So you're a New York Times reader."}, {"time": 7878, "text": "And then you hit ESPN, same thing."}, {"time": 7880, "text": "And the database gets updated and the number user 1234 indexes in the database to a profile of you, you've been tracked."}, {"time": 7888, "text": "This was not intended."}, {"time": 7889, "text": "And it was too late to undo by the time I got the Netscape."}, {"time": 7892, "text": "I think Lou wanted to do Twinkies, he called them."}, {"time": 7895, "text":

solve the third party problem, but Tom Paquin, the engineering manager said, nope, no Twinkies, just cookies."}, {"time": 7908, "text": "You're done, son."}, {"time": 7909, "text": "And that's how a lot of that stuff was."}, {"time": 7911, "text": "That's how JavaScript got frozen like a flying Amber in some ways with that sloppy equality operator that I made because of the early adopters."},

"text": "By the time Netscape 3, I made that work."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "You can get a request with the last cookie value and the response updates it."}, {"time": 7931, "text": "That's a tracking mechanism."}, {"time": 7932, "text": "And that's why you don't even need images to track."}, {"time": 7934, "text": "Now you just use scripts."}, {"time": 7936, "text": "So this whole tracking economy

fundamental problem the world is facing now."}, {"time": 7959, "text": "They're looking at what social media has created and they're looking at, and like a world is looking at itself in the mirror and seeing that privacy is actually something as opposed to like a nice thing to have."}, {"time": 7973, "text": "It's something that is actually should be fundamental to the way we interact with the world as part of our tooling."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "And that's where the Brave browser comes in."}, {"time": 7983, "text": "And I suppose others as well are playing with this idea, but Brave is at the forefront of that."}, {"time": 7987, "text": "So maybe can you like describe what Brave is and what are its key principles and what's broken and what is it Brave trying to fix?"}, {"time": 7996, "text": "So when I realized that these accidents like the third party cookie, the image or script that's tracking you or the JavaScripts that can do an invisibly now, that all this stuff wasn't intended and that Firefox had supported extensions that block some of these things, I thought probably we should have browsers just block some of these things by default."}, {"time": 8017, "text":

"text": "So how do you tell the first from the third party?"}, {"time": 8044, "text": "And it's not easy."}, {"time": 8044, "text": "It's not a matter of just what's embedded from a different server because a lot of publishers use benign scripts from unrelated domains or apparently unrelated domains."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "So you end up having to develop a sort of human and machine learning practice around blocking."}, {"time": 8059, "text": "And at Brave, we did that from the start and built a research team to help drive it and automate it."}, {"time": 8065, "text": "We realized that protecting people needed machine learning and around 2017 spring, I talked to my friends at Apple about this too and they were also doing what they call intelligent tracking prevention, which uses local machine learning in the browser."}, {"time": 8079, "text": "And the funny thing is, great minds think alike, they were taking their third party cookie blocker that was in Safari from the old days and making it not have a big loophole."}, {"time": 8088, "text": "Because what they did was in 2003, when Safari came out, they said, we're gonna block cookies that are from those third party embedded elements where you've never visited that site before."}, {"time": 8099, "text": "So I'm gonna pick an ad company that got sold to AT&T, so I'm not picking on anybody unfairly, appnexus.com."}, {"time": 8105, "text": "Have you ever been to appnexus.com?"}, {"time": 8107, "text": "I've never been there, but I guarantee you 10 years ago, you probably had, if you were using Firefox, you had a cookie, third party cookie, because you were being tracked by them and they were using that cookie to build up a profile of you."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "In Safari, as long as the user never went to appnexus, that cookie would not be set."}, {"time": 8122, "text": "And that was a real move for privacy early on when jobs were still around in Safari."}, {"time": 8127, "text": "But it had this loophole that if you do go to appnexus, then why it's okay to be a third party cookie."}, {"time": 8132, "text": "And so appnexus did something very naughty."}, {"time": 8135, "text": "They took their ad partners to put the actual ad you click on."}, {"time": 8139, "text": "And they said, hey, add a little script so that when somebody clicks on the ad, before it goes to your landing page, redirect to appnexus and we'll redirect to the landing page."}, {"time": 8147, "text": "And by doing that, they set a first party cookie and they got whitelisted."}, {"time": 8149, "text": "So it was a loophole they exploited."}, {"time": 8151, "text": "Intelligent tracking prevention in Safari was sophisticated enough to counteract this and it did other things and it's evolved since they did it."}, {"time": 8159, "text": "And we've evolved brave too."}, {"time": 8160, "text": "And so when I say machine and human learning, there's a real set of techniques here."}, {"time":

of storage in the browser associated with a website, if the bad guy can get 32 websites, each one has a bit of storage, that's 32 bits."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "You can turn the bit on or off, you can make 4 billion numbers, you can make an identifier."}, {"time": 8182, "text": "It's called a super cookie sometimes."}, {"time": 8186, "text": "There are weaker ways that are statistical."}, {"time": 8188, "text": "They're called fingerprinting."}, {"time": 8189, "text": "You have to block all of them and you have to not only automate, you want to work in the web standards body to put privacy in by default, by design, from the get go, not add it as an afterthought or go hogwile with new web APIs to add a bunch more local storage or fingerprint surface area."}, {"time": 8207, "text": "And that's been a struggle too, because guess who's the new Microsoft in the standards body?"}, {"time": 8211, "text": "It's Google."}, {"time": 8212, "text": "And they're not in favor of privacy first."}, {"time": 8215, "text": "They want to do privacy their way, only under, I would say, market pressure."}, {"time": 8221, "text": "But with Apple and with Brave leading the way, we block third party cookies almost without exception."}, {"time": 8226, "text": "So we've just blocked them."}, {"time": 8227, "text": "And that gives us a very strong privacy benefit, but it also means some sites just don't work right."}, {"time": 8233, "text": "Embedded YouTube videos might not work right."}, {"time": 8235, "text": "So we're adapting in a similar way to Apple's done with ITP to make third party cookies blocked, but to sort of simulate what looks like a working third party cookie for the site."}, {"time": 8248, "text": "It essentially tries to partition each site and its third parties into its own sort of cookie jar."}, {"time": 8255, "text": "And so, like you said, is this both like a human fine tuning issue and a machine learning problem?"}, {"time": 8262, "text": "And as the humans learn, then they train the machine learning."}, {"time": 8266, "text": "But, you know, maybe Google aside or including Google, there's millions of dollars, if not B, billions of dollars to be made from fighting the ways of Brave."}, {"time": 8278, "text": "And it's been an interesting change from when we started in 2015."}, {"time": 8281, "text": "When we started, you know, ad blocking extensions, ad block plus was one of the big ones that started on Firefox in 2006, I believe, had gotten to a certain level of use around the world."}, {"time": 8291, "text": "And browsers like UC Web, UC Browser in Asia had some amount of ad blocking built in and on by default."}, {"time": 8297, "text": "So, a page fair was a startup and they measured ad blocking adoption."}, {"time": 8303, "text": "And they tried to say, hey publishers, you're, you know, 30% of the visitors to Pitchfork or Wire to Conda NAS properties are using ad blockers."}, {"time": 8312, "text": "If we can somehow convince them to lower their ad blocking for your site, that could be like a 43% lift, right?"}, {"time": 8319, "text": "And, you know, three sevenths."}, {"time": 8322, "text": "Well, that's easier said than done."}, {"time": 8324, "text": "And PageFair and others, SourcePoint, and many others tried to either smuggle ads through or cajole the user into letting, you know, ads appear."}, {"time": 8332, "text": "And it didn't really work."}, {"time": 8333, "text": "And meanwhile, the ad blocking adoption has just continued intelligent tracking prevention in Safari in 2017, Brave from 2016 on with very strong cookie blocking and other protections."}, {"time": 8344, "text": "And this is not going away."}, {"time": 8346, "text": "The publishers used to rage against it."}, {"time":

fingerprint us as an ad blocker and treat us as an enemy."}, {"time": 8366, "text": "But in 2015 or 16, it was like, nah, you're an ad blocker."}, {"time": 8369, "text": "Get out of here."}, {"time": 8370, "text": "I hate you."}, {"time": 8371, "text": "And by 2017 or 18, it's like something's happening."}, {"time": 8373, "text": "The ad blocking is not stopping and we're all getting sort of pulled on the Google's plantation through AMP, AMP."}, {"time": 8381, "text": "Or we're getting killed by the Google ad system we use because it's taking all the revenue or it's permitting or some other vendors we use are permitting ad fraud."}, {"time": 8390, "text": "And so a fake New York Times is getting paid by the marketer running an ad that a bot clicks on."}, {"time": 8397, "text": "And the real New York Times that's supposed to get the ad doesn't get it."}, {"time": 8400, "text": "And there's something really broken about that kind of system."}, {"time": 8402, "text": "And that fraud is mediated through Google's ad exchange, which is the biggest of them all."}, {"time": 8407, "text": "And Google takes a fee."}, {"time": 8409, "text": "There's a flip side of that, which is malware distribution, malvertising, where fake advertisers put malware payloads in or exploit hit loaders in JavaScript and they smuggle them in ads onto real publisher pages, the ad exchange takes the fee."}, {"time": 8424, "text": "Now, I'm not a lawyer."}, {"time": 8425, "text": "I'm not gonna say this is a RICO predicate, but why is the ad exchange facilitating fraud and malware distribution

632, "text": "We had an incredible respect and appreciation for what they were able to build in this really beautiful fashion and film."}, {"time": 651, "text": "But it was always like, one, it was virtual and two, it was like a story on rails that had no interactivity to it."}, {"time": 651, "text": "It was very fixed and it obviously had a magic to it, but where you really start to hit a different level of experiences when you're actually able to physically interact with a robot."}, {"time": 666, "text": "And then that was your idea with Anki, like the first product was the cars."}, {"time": 666, "text": "So basically you take a toy, you add intelligence into it in the same way you would add intelligence into AI systems within a video game, but you're not bringing it into the physical space."}, {"time": 683, "text": "So the idea is really brilliant, which is you're basically bringing video games to life."}, {"time": 689, "text": "We literally use that exact same phrase because in the case of Drive, this was a parallel of the racing genre."}, {"time": 689, "text": "And the goal was to effectively have a physical racing experience, but have a virtual state at all times that matches what's happening in the physical world."}, {"time": 707, "text": "And then you can have a video game off of that and you can have different characters, different traits for the cars, weapons and interactions and special abilities and all these sort of things that you think of virtually, but then you can have it physically."}, {"time": 720, "text": "And one of the things that we were really surprised by that really stood out and immediately led us to really accelerate the path towards Cosmo is that things that feel like they're really constrained and simple in the physical world, they have an amplified impact on people."}, {"time": 735, "text": "The exact same experience virtually would not have anywhere near the impact, but seeing it physically really stood out."}, {"time": 740, "text": "And so effectively with Drive, we were creating a video game engine for the physical world."}, {"time": 746, "text": "And then with Cosmo, we expanded that video game engine to create a character and kind of an animation and interaction engine on top of it that allowed us to start to create these much more rich experiences."}, {"time": 761, "text": "And a lot of those elements were almost like a proving ground for what would human robot interaction feel like in a domain that's much more forgiving, where you can make mistakes in a game."}, {"time": 771, "text": "It's okay if a car goes off the track or if Cosmo makes a mistake."}, {"time": 777, "text": "And what's funny is actually we were so worried about that."}, {"time": 780, "text": "In reality, we realized very quickly that those mistakes can be endearing, and if you make a mistake, as long as you realize you made a mistake and have the right emotional reaction to it, it builds even more empathy with the character."}, {"time": 791, "text": "So when the thing you're optimizing for is fun, you have so much more freedom to fail, to explore, and also in the toy space."}, {"time": 800, "text": "Like all of this is really brilliant, and I gotta ask you backtrack, it seems for a roboticist to take a jump into the direction of fun is a brilliant move."}, {"time": 813, "text": "Because one, you have the freedom to explore and to design all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 817, "text": "And you can also build cheap robots."}, {"time": 820, "text": "If you're not chasing perfection and toys, it's understood that you can go cheaper, which means a robot is still expensive, but it's actually affordable by a large number of people."}, {"time": 833, "text": "So it's a really brilliant space to explore."}, {"time": 836, "text": "And in fact, we realized pretty quickly that perfection is actually not fun."}, {"time": 840, "text": "Because in a traditional roboticist sense, the first kind of path planner, and this is the part that I worked on out of the gate, was a lot of the AI systems where you have these vehicles and cars racing, making optimal maneuvers to try to get ahead."}, {"time": 856, "text": "And you realize very quickly that that's actually not fun because you want the chaos from mistakes."}, {"time": 862, "text": "And so you start to kind of intentionally almost add noise to the system in order to kind of create more of a realism in the exact same way the human player might start really ineffective and inefficient and then start to kind of increase their quality bar as they progress."}, {"time": 877, "text": "And there is a really, really aggressive constraint that's forced on you by being a consumer product where the price point matters a ton, particularly in kind of an entertainment where you can't make a $1,000 product unless you're going to meet the expectations of a $1,000 product."}, {"time": 893, "text": "And so in order to make this work, your cost of goods had to be well under $100."}, {"time": 900, "text": "In the case of Cosmo, we got it under $50 end to end, fully packaged and delivered."}, {"time": 904, "text": "And it was under $200 cost at retail."}, {"time": 909, "text": "Okay, if we sit down like at the early stages, if we go back to that and you're sitting down and thinking about what Cosmo looks like from a design perspective and from a cost perspective, I imagine that was part of the conversation."}, {"time": 923, "text": "Well, first of all, what came first?"}, {"time": 923, "text": "Did you have a cost in mind?"}, {"time": 923, "text": "Is there a target you're trying to chase?"}, {"time": 930, "text": "Did you have a vision in mind, like size?"}, {"time": 930, "text": "Did you have, because there's a lot of unique qualities to Cosmo."}, {"time": 935, "text": "So for people who don't know, they should definitely check it out."}, {"time": 935, "text": "There's a display, there's eyes on the little display and those eyes can, it's pretty low resolution eyes, right?"}, {"time": 944, "text": "But they're still able to convey a lot of emotion."}, {"time": 947, "text": "And there's this arm, like that sort of lift stuff."}, {"time": 953, "text": "But there's something about arm movement that adds even more kind of depth."}, {"time": 959, "text": "It's like the face communicates emotion and sadness and disappointment and happiness."}, {"time": 966, "text": "And then the arms kind of communicates, I'm trying here."}, {"time": 971, "text": "I'm doing my best in this complicated world."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So it's interesting because like all of Cosmo is only four degrees of freedom and two of them are the two treads, which is for basic movement."}, {"time": 983, "text": "And so you literally have only a head that goes up and down, a lift that goes up and down, and then your two wheels."}, {"time": 989, "text": "And you have sound and a screen, a low resolution screen."}, {"time": 994, "text": "And with that, it's actually pretty incredible what you can come up with, where, like you said, it's a really interesting give and take because there's a lot of ideas far beyond that, obviously, as you can imagine, where, like you said, how big is it?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "How much degrees of freedom?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "What does he look like?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "What does he sound like?"}, {"time": 1006, "text": "How does he communicate?"}, {"time": 1011, "text": "It's a formula that actually scales way beyond entertainment."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "This is the formula for human kind of robot interface more generally, is you almost have this triangle between the physical aspects of it, the mechanics, the industrial design, what's mass producible, the cost constraints and so forth."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "You have the AI side of how do you understand the world around you, interact intelligently with it, execute what you want to execute."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "So perceive the environment, make intelligent decisions and move forward."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "And then you have the character side of it."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "Most companies have done anything in human robot interaction, really missed the mark or underinvest in the character side of it."}, {"time": 1050, "text": "They overinvest in the mechanical side of it and then varied results on the AI side of it."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And so the thinking is that you put more mechanical flexibility into it, you're going to do better."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "You don't necessarily, you actually create a much higher bar for a high ROI because now your price point goes up, your expectations go up."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "And if the AI can't meet it or the overall experience isn't there, you miss the mark."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So how did you, through those conversations, get the cost down so much and made it so simple?"}, {"time": 1073, "text": "There's a big theme here because you come from the mecca of robotics, which is Carnegie Mellon University, robotics."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "For all the people I've interacted with that come from there or just from the world experts at robotics, they would never build something like Cosmo."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "And so where did that come from?"}, {"time": 1099, "text": "The simplicity."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "It came from this combination of a team that we had."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "It was quite cool."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "And by the way, you ask anybody that's experienced in the toy entertainment space, you'll never sell a product over $99."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "That was fundamentally false and we believed it to be false."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "It was because experience had to meet the mark."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And so we pushed past that amount, but there was a pressure where the higher you go, the more seasonal you become and the tougher it becomes."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "And so on the cost side, we very quickly partnered up with some previous contacts that we worked with where, just as an example, our head of mechanical engineering was one of the earliest heads of engineering at Logitech and has a billion units of consumer products and circulation that he's worked on."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "So like crazy, low cost, high volume consumer product experience."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "We had a really great mechanical engineering team and just a very practical mindset where we were not going to compromise on feasibility in the market in order to chase something that would be an enabler."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "And we pushed a huge amount of expectations onto the software team where, yes, we're going to use cheap, noisy motors and sensors, but we're going to fix it on the software side."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Then we found on the design and character side, there was a faction that was more from like a game design background that thought that it should be very games driven, Cosmo, where you create a whole bunch of games experiences and it's all about like game mechanics."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "And then there was a faction which my cofather and I are the most involved in this, like really believed in, which was character driven."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And the argument is that you will never compete with what you can do virtually from a game standpoint, but you actually on a character side, put this into your wheelhouse and put it more towards your advantage because a physical character has a massively higher impact physically than virtually."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "Okay, can I just pause on that because this is so brilliant."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "For people who don't know, Cosmo plays games with you, but there's also a depth of character."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "And I actually, when I was playing with it, I wondered exactly what is the compelling aspect of this."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Because to me, obviously I'm biased, but to me the character, what I enjoyed most, honestly, or what got me to return to it is the character."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "But that's a fascinating discussion of, you're right, ultimately you cannot compete on the quality of the gaming experience."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "It's too restrictive."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "The physical world is just too restrictive and you don't have a graphics engine, it's like all this."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "But on the character side, and clearly we moved in that direction as the winning path and we partnered up with this, we immediately went towards Pixar and Carlos Bena had been at Pixar for nine years."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "He'd worked on tons of the movies, including WALLY and others, and just immediately spoke the language and it just clicked on how you think about that magic and drive."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "And then we built out a team with him as a really prominent driver of this with different types of backgrounds and animators and character developers where we put these constraints on the team, but then got them to really try to create magic despite that."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "And we converged on this system that was at the overlap of character and the character AI that where, if you imagine the dimensionality of emotions, happy, sad, angry, surprised, confused, scared, you think of these extreme emotions."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "We almost put this challenge to populate this library of responses on how do you show the extreme response that goes to the extreme spectrum on angry or frustrated or whatever."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "And so that gave us a lot of intuition and learnings and then we started parameterizing them where it wasn't just a fixed recording, but they were parameterized and had randomness to them where you could have infinite permutations of happy and surprised and so forth."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "And then we had a behavioral engine that took the context from the real world and would interpret it and then create probability mappings on what sort of responses you would have that actually made sense."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And so if Cosmo saw you for the first time in a day, he'd be really surprised and happy in the same way that the first time you walk in and your toddler sees you, they're so happy, but they're not going to be that happy for the entirety of your next two hours."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "But you have this spike in response or if you leave him alone for too long, he gets bored and starts causing trouble and nudging things off the table."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "Or if you beat him in a game, the most enjoyable emotions are him getting frustrated and grumpy to a point where our testers and our customers would be like, I had to let him win because I don't want him to be upset."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And so you start to create this feedback loop where you see how powerful those emotions are."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And just to give you an example, something as simple as eye contact, you don't think about it in a movie."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "It kind of happens like camera angles and so forth, but that's not really a prominent source of interaction."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "What happens when a physical character like Cosmo, when he makes eye contact with you, it built universal kind of connection, kids all the way through adults."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "And it was truly universal."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "It was not like people stopped caring after 10, 12 years old."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "And so we started doing experiments and we found something as simple as increasing the amount of eye contact, like the amount of times in a minute that he'll look over for your approval to make eye contact."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "Just by, I think, doubling it, we increased the playtime engagement by 40%."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "You see these sort of interactions where you build that empathy."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "And so we studied pets."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "We studied virtual characters."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "There's like a lot of times actually dogs are one of the most perfect influencers behind these sort of interactions."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "And what we realized is that the games were not there to entertain you."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "The games were to create context to bring out the character."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "And if you think about the types of games that you played, they're relatively simple, but they were always once to create scenarios of either tension or winning or losing or surprise or whatever the case might be."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And they were purely there to just like create context to where an emotion could feel intelligent and not random."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "And in the end, it was all about the character."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So yeah, there's so many elements to play with here."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "So you said dogs."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "What lessons do we draw from cats who don't seem to give a damn about you?"}, {"time": 1480, "text": "Is that just another character?"}, {"time": 1482, "text": "It's just another character."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "So you could almost like in the early explorations, we thought it would be really incredible if you had a diversity of characters where you almost help encourage which direction it goes, just like in a role playing game."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And you had like think of like the seven dwarves sort of."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And initially we even thought that it would be amazing if like the other like, you know, like their characters actually help them have strengths and weaknesses and some like whatever they end up doing."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "Like some are scared, some are, you know, arrogant, some are, you know, super warm and like kind of friendly."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "And in the end, we focused on one because it made it very clear that, hey, we got to build out enough depth here because you're kind of trying to expand."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "It's almost like how long can you maintain a fiction that this character is alive to where the person's explorations don't hit a boundary, which happens almost immediately with typical toys."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "And, you know, even with video games, how long can we create that immersive experience to where you expand the boundary?"}, {"time": 1543, "text": "And one of the things we realized is that you're just way more forgiving when something has a personality and it's physical."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "That is the key that unlocks robotics interacting in the physical world and more generally is that when you don't have a personality and you make a mistake as a robot, the stupid robot made a mistake."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Why is it not perfect?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "When you have a character and you make a mistake, you have empathy and it becomes endearing and you're way more forgiving."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "And that was the key that was like I think goes far, far beyond entertainment."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "It actually builds the depth of the personality, the mistakes."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "So let me ask the movie Her question then."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "How, so Cosmos seems, feels like the early days of something that will obviously be prevalent throughout society at a scale that we cannot even imagine."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "My sense is it seems obvious that these kinds of characters will permeate society and that we'll be friends with them."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "We'll be interacting with them in different ways."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "I mean, you don't think of it this way, but when you play video games, they're often cold and impersonal."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "But even then, you think about role playing games, you become friends with certain characters in that game."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "They don't remember much about you."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "They're just telling a story."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "It's exactly what you're saying."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "They exist in that virtual world."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "But if they acknowledge that you exist in this physical world, if the characters in the game remember that you exist, that you, like for me, like Lex, they understand that I'm a human being who has like hopes and dreams and so on."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "It seems like there's going to be like billions, if not trillions of Cosmos in the world."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "So if we look at that future, there's several questions to ask."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "How intelligent does that future Cosmo need to be to create fulfilling relationships like friendships?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And part of it is the recognition that it's going to take time to get there because it has to be a lot more intelligent because it was good enough to be a magical experience for an eight year old."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "It's a higher bar to do that, be like a pet in the home or to help with functional interface in an office environment or in a home and so forth."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "And the idea was that you build on that and you kind of get there and as technology becomes more prevalent and less expensive and so forth, you can start to kind of work up to it."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "At the end of the day, we almost equated it to how the touch screen created like this really novel interface to physical kind of devices like this."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "This is the extension of it where you have much richer physical interaction in the real world."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "This is the enabler for it."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "And it shows itself in a few kind of really obvious places."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "So just take something as simple as a voice assistant."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "You will never, most people will never tolerate an Alexa or a Google Home just starting a conversation proactively when you weren't kind of expecting it because it feels weird."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "It's like you were listening and like, and then now you're kind of, it feels intrusive."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "But if you had a character like a cat that touches you and gets your attention or toddler, like you never think twice about it."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "And what we found really kind of immediately is that these types of characters like Cosmo and they would like roam around and kind of get your attention."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And we had a future version that was always on kind of called Vector."}, {"time": 1753, "text": "People were way more forgiving."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "And so you could initiate interaction in a way that is not acceptable for machines."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "And in general, there's a lot of ways to customize it, but it makes people who are skeptical of technology much more comfortable with it."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "There was like, there were a couple of really, really prominent examples of this."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "So when we launched in Europe and so we were in I think like a dozen countries, if I remember correctly, but like we went pretty aggressively in launching in Germany and France and UK."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "And we were very worried in Europe because there's obviously like a really socially higher bar for privacy and security where you've heard about how many companies have had troubles on things that might've been okay in the US, but like are just not okay in Germany and France in particular."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "And so we were worried about this because you have Cosmo who's in our future product Vector, like where you have cameras, you have microphones, it's connected and like you're playing with kids and like in these experiences."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "And you're like, this is like ripe to be like a nightmare if you're not careful."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "And the journalists are like notoriously like really, really tough on these sorts of things."}, {"time": 1825, "text": "We were shocked and we prepared so much for what we would have to encounter."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "We were shocked in that not once from any journalists or customer did we have any complaints beyond like a really casual kind of question."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And it was because of the character where when the conversation came up, it was almost like, well, of course he has to see and hear."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "How else is he going to be alive and interacting with you?"}, {"time": 1851, "text": "And it completely disarmed this like fear of technology that enabled this interaction to be much more fluid."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "And again, like entertainment was a proving ground, but that is like, you know, there's like ingredients there that carry over to a lot of other elements down the road."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "That's hilarious that we're a lot less concerned about privacy if the thing has value and charisma."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "I mean, that's true for all of human to human interactions."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "It's an understanding of intent where like, well, he's looking at me, he can see me."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "If he's not looking at me, he can't see me."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "So it's almost like you're communicating intent."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "And with that intent, people are like kind of kind of a more understanding and calmer."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "It was just the earliest kind of version of starting to experiment with this."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "But it wasn't an enabler."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "And then you have like completely different dimensions where kids with autism had like an incredible connection with Cosmo that just went beyond anything we'd ever seen."}, {"time": 1903, "text": "And we have like these just letters that we would receive from parents."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "And we had some research projects kind of going on with some universities on studying this."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "But there's an interesting dimension there that got unlocked that just hadn't existed before that has these really interesting kind of links into society and a potential building block of future experience."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "So if you look out into the future, do you think we will have beyond a particular game, you know, a companion like her, like the movie Her or like a Cosmo that's kind of asks you how your day went to write, you know, like a friend."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "How many years away from that do you think we are?"}, {"time": 1951, "text": "So I think the idea of a different type of character, like more closer to like kind of a pet style companionship will come way faster."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "And there's a few reasons."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "One is like to do something like in her, that's like effectively almost general AI."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "And the bar is so high that if you miss it by a bit, you hit the uncanny valley where it just becomes creepy and like and not appealing."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "Because the closer you try to get to a human in form and interface and voice, the harder it becomes."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "Whereas you have way more flexibility on still landing a really great experience if you embrace the idea of a character."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "And that's why one of the other reasons why we didn't have a voice and also why like a lot of video game characters like Sims, for example, does not have a voice when you when you think about it, it was it wasn't just a cost savings like for them."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "It was actually for all of these purposes."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "It was because when you have a voice, you immediately narrow down the appeal to some particular demographic or age range or kind of style or gender."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "If you don't have a voice, people interpret what they want to interpret."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "And an eight year old might get a very different interpretation than a 40 year old, but you create a dynamic range."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And so you just you can lean into these advantages much more in

point."}, {"time": 2036, "text": "The chat interfaces are getting way more interesting and richer, but it's still a long way to go to kind of pass the test of, you know."}, {"time": 2044, "text":

compelling product that wants to provide a service to a lot of people."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "But let's go outside of that."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "You said characters."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "Yeah, it feels like and you also said that it requires general intelligence to be a successful participant in a relationship, which could explain why I'm single."}, {"time": 2071, "text":

successful."}, {"time": 2133, "text": "And so you can do that by having a very focused domain that you can operate in."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "For example, you're a customer support agent for a particular product and you create intelligence and a good interface around that."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "Or, you know, kind of in the personal companionship side, you can't be everything across the board."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "You kind of solve those constraints."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "And I think it's possible."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "My worry is right now I don't see anybody that has picked up on where Cosmo left off and is pushing on it in the same way."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "And so I don't know if it's a sort of thing where similar to like how, you know, in Dotcom there were all these concepts that we considered like, you know, that didn't work out or like failed or like were too early or whatnot."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And then 20 years later, you have these like incredible successes on almost the same concept."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "Like it might be that sort of thing where like there's another pass at it that happens in five years or in 10 years."},

hard to, I'm not aware of anywhere right now where like that same kind of aggressive drive with the value on the character is happening."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "And so to me, just a prediction, exactly as you said, something that looks awfully a lot like Cosmo, not in the actual physical form, but in the three legged stool, something like that in some number of years will be a trillion dollar company."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "Like, it's obvious to me that like character, not just as robotic companions, but in all our computers, they'll be there."}, {"time": 2230, "text": "It's like Clippy was like two legs of that stool or something like that."}, {"time": 2237, "text": "I mean, those are all different attempts."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "And what's really confusing to me is they're born these attempts and everybody gets excited and for some reason they die and then nobody else tries to pick it up."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "And then maybe a few years later, a crazy guy

mobile devices and computation is going to become more and more prevalent as well as cloud as a big tool to offload cost."}, {"time": 2296, "text": "AI is going to be a massive transformation compared to what we dealt with where everything from voice understanding to just kind of a broader contextual understanding and mapping of semantics and understanding scenes and so forth."}, {"time": 2315,

"And you have just the brilliance of the tapping and animation and these other areas where that was a big unlock in film, obviously."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And so I think, yeah, the pieces can reconnect and the building blocks are actually going to be way more impressive than they were five years ago."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "So in 2019, Anki, the company that created Cosmo, the company that you started, had to shut down."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "How did you feel at that time?"}, {"time": 2351, "text": "That was a really emotional stretch and it was a really tough year."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "I think about a year ahead of that was actually a pretty brutal stretch because we were kind of life or death on many, many moments just navigating these insane kind of just ups and downs and barriers."}, {"time": 2372, "text": "And the thing that made it, just sort of winding a tiny bit, what ended up being really challenging about it as a business is from a commercial standpoint and customer reception standpoint, there's a lot of things you could point to that were pretty big successes."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "Sold millions of units, got to pretty serious revenue, kind of close to 100 million annual revenue, number one kind of product in various categories."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "But it was pretty expensive."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "It ended up being very seasonal where something like 85% of our volume was in Q4 because it was a present and it was expensive to market it and explain it and so forth."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "And even though the volume was really sizable and the reviews were really fantastic, forecasting and planning for it and managing the cash operations was just brutal."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "It was absolutely brutal."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "You don't think about this when you're starting a company or when you have a few million in revenue because it's just your biggest costs are kind of just your headcount and operations and everything's ahead of you."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "But we got to a point where if you look at the entire year, you have to operate your company, pay all the people and so forth."}, {"time": 2445, "text": "You have to pay for the manufacturing, the marketing and everything else to do your sales in mostly November, December and then get paid in December, January by retailers."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And those swings were really rough and just made it so difficult because the more it successfully became, the more wild those swings became because you'd have to spend tens of millions of dollars on inventory, tens of millions of dollars on marketing and tens of millions of dollars on payroll and everything else."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "The bigger dip and then you're waiting for the Q4."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "And it's not a business that is recurring month to month and predictable."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "And then you're locking in your forecast in July, maybe August if you're lucky."}, {"time": 2485, "text": "And it's also very hit driven and seasonal where you don't have the sort of continued kind of slow growth like you do in some other consumer electronics industries."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "And so before then, hardware kind of went out of favor too."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "And so you had Fitbit and GoPro drop from 10 billion revenue to 1 billion revenue and hardware companies are getting valued at like 1x revenue oftentimes, which is tough."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "And so we effectively kind of got caught in the middle where we were trying to quickly evolve out of entertainment and move into some other categories."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "But you can't let go of that business because that's what you're valued on."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "That's what you're raising money on."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "But there is no path to kind of pure profitability just there because it was such specific type of price points and so forth."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "And so we tried really hard to make that transition."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "And we had a financing round that fell apart at the last second."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And effectively, there was just no path to kind of get through that and get to the next kind of holiday season."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And so we ended up selling some of the assets and kind of winding down the company."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "It was brutal."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "I was very transparent with the company and the team while we were going through it where actually, despite how challenging that period was, very few people left."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "I mean, people loved the vision, the team, the culture, the kind of chemistry and what we were doing."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "There was just a huge amount of pride there."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "And then we wanted to see it through."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "And we felt like we had a shot to kind of get through these checkpoints."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "And by brutal, I mean literally days of cash, like three, four different times runway in the year kind of before it where you're playing games of chicken on negotiating credit line timelines and repayment terms and how to get a bridge loan from an investor."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "There was a level of stress that as hard as things might be anywhere else, you'll never come close to that where you feel that responsibility for 200 plus people."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "And so we were very transparent during our fundraise on who we're talking to, the challenges that we have, how it's going and when things are going well, when things were tough."}, {"time": 2610, "text": "And so it wasn't a complete shock when it happened, but it was just very emotional where we announced it finally that we basically were just watching the runway and trying to kind of time it."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "And when we realized that we didn't have any more outs, we wanted to kind of wind it down, make sure that it was clean and we could kind of take care of people the best we could."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "But they broke down crying at the hands and somebody else had to step in for a bit and it was just very, very emotional."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "But the beautiful part is afterwards, everybody stayed at the office to two, three in the morning just drinking and hanging out and telling stories and celebrating."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "And it was just one of the best, for many people, it was the best kind of work experience that they had."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "And there was a lot of pride in what we did."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "And it wasn't anything obvious we could point to that like, hey, if only we had done that different, things would have been completely different."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "It was just like the physics didn't line up."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "And but the experience was pretty incredible, but it was hard."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "It had this feeling that there was this incredible beauty in both the technology and products and the team that there's a lot there that in the right context could have been pretty incredible, but it was emotional."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "Yeah, just thinking, I mean, just looking at this company, like you said, product and technology, but the vision, the implementation, you got the cost down very low and the compelling, the nature of the product was great."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "So many robotics companies failed at this."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "The robot was too expensive."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "It didn't have the personality."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "It didn't really provide any value, like a sufficient value to justify the price."}, {"time": 2714, "text": "So you succeeded where basically every single other robotics company or most of them that are like going the category of social robotics have kind of failed."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "And I mean, it's it's quite tragic."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "I remember reading that."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "I'm not sure if I talked to you before that happened or not, but I remember, you know, I'm distant from this."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "I remember being heartbroken reading that because, like, if if Cosmo is not going to succeed, what is going to succeed?"}, {"time": 2749, "text": "Because that to me was incredible."}, {"time": 2749, "text": "Like it was an incredible idea."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "Cost is down."}, {"time": 2755, "text": "The minimum that the it's just like the most minimal design in physical form that you could do."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "It's really compelling."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "The balance of games."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "So it's a fun toy."}, {"time": 2763, "text": "It's a great gift for all kinds of age groups."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "It's just it's compelling in every single way."}, {"time": 2771, "text": "And it seemed like it was a huge success and it failing was."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "There was heartbreak on many levels for me, just as an external observer."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "Is I was thinking, how hard is it to run a business?"}, {"time": 2787, "text": "That's that's what I was thinking."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "Like, if this failed, this must have failed because it's obviously not like, yeah, it's business."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "Maybe it's some aspect of the manufacturing and so on."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "But I'm now realizing it's also not just that it's."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "And sales, marketing, all those everything."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "Like, how do you explain something that's like a new category to people that like how all these positions."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "And so, like, you know, it had some of the hardest elements of if you were to pick a business, it had some of the hardest customer dynamics, because like to sell a hundred fifty dollar product, you got to convince both the child, the one it and the parents to agree that it's valuable."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "So you're having like this dual prong marketing challenge."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "You have manufacturing, you have like really high precision on the components that you need."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "You have the challenges."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "So there were a lot of tough elements."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "But is this feeling where like just really great alignment of unique strength across kind of like all these different areas, just an incredible like, you know, kind of character and animation team between this Carlos."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "And there's like a character director day that came on board and really great people there."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "The A.I."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "side, the the manufacturing, the you know, where like never missing a launch."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "And actually, you know, he kind of had that quality was."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "Yeah, it was heartbreaking."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "But here's one neat thing is like we we had so much like fan mail from kind of kids and parents like I actually like there was a bunch that collected in the end that I actually saved."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "And like I never it was too emotional to open it and I still haven't opened it."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "And so I actually have this giant envelope of like a stack this much of like letters from, you know, kids and families, just like every kind of permutation permutation you can imagine."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "And so planning to kind of I don't know, maybe like a five year, you know, five year, some year reunion, just inviting everybody over and we'll just like kind of dig into it and kind of bring back some memories."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "But, you know, good impact."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "And well, I think there will be companies, maybe Waymo and Google will be somehow involved that will carry this flag forward and will will make you proud whether you're involved or not."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "I think this is one of the greatest robotics companies in the history of robotics."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "So you should be proud."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "It's still tragic to know that, you know, because you read all the stories of Apple and let's see, SpaceX and like companies that were just on the verge of failure several times through that story."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "And they just it's almost like a roll of the dice."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "They succeeded."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "And here's a roll of the dice that just happened to go."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "And that's the appreciation that like when you really like talk to a lot of the founders, like everybody goes through those moments."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "And sometimes it really is a matter of like, you know, timing, a little bit of luck, like some things are just out of your control."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "And and you get a much deeper appreciation for just the dimensionality of that challenge."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "But the great thing is, is that like a lot of the team actually like stayed together."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "And so there were actually a couple of companies that we where we kind of kept big chunks of the team together and we actually kind of helped align this, you know, to to help people out as well."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "And one of them was Waymo, where a majority of the AI and robotics team actually had the exact background that you would look for."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "And like kind of AV space was a space that a lot of us like, you know, you know, worked on in grad school, were always passionate about and ended up, you know, maybe the time, you know, serendipitous timings from another perspective where like kind of landed in a really unique circumstances that should have been quite exciting, too."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "So it's interesting to ask you just your thoughts."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Cosmo still lives on under Dream Labs, I think."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Is that, are you tracking the progress there or is it too much pain?"}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Is it, are you, is that something that you're excited to see where that goes?"}, {"time": 3024, "text": "So keeping an eye on it, of course, just out of curiosity and obviously just kind of careful product line, I think it's deceptive how complex it is to manufacture and evolve that product line and the amount of experiences that are required to complete the picture and be able to move that forward."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "And I think that's going to make it pretty hard to do something really substantial with it."}, {"time": 3043, "text": "It would be cool if like even the product in the way it was was able to be manufactured."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "Which is the current goal, I suppose."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "Yeah, which will be neat."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "But I think it's deceptive how tricky that is on like everything from the quality control, the details and then like technology changes that forces you to reinvent and update certain things."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "So I haven't been super close to it, but just kind of keeping an eye on it."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "Yeah, it's really interesting how it's deceptively difficult, just as you're saying."}, {"time": 3073, "text": "For example, those same folks, and I've spoken with them, they're, they partner up with Rick and Morty creators to do the Butter Robot."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "I just recently, I kind of half ass watched Rick and Morty previously, but now I just watched like the first season."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "It's such a brilliant show."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "I like, I did not understand how brilliant that show is."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "And obviously I think in season one is where the Butter Robot comes along for just a few minutes or whatever, but I just fell in love with the Butter Robot."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "The sort of the, that particular character, just like you said, there's characters you can create, personalities you can create, and that particular robot who's doing a particular task realizes, you know, this like realizes, that's the existential question."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "The myth of Sisyphus question that Camus writes about, is this all there is?"}, {"time": 3132, "text": "He moves butter."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "But, you know, that realization, that's a beautiful little realization for a robot that my purpose is very limited to this particular task."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "It's humor of course, it's darkness, it's a beautiful mix."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "But so they want to release that Butter Robot, but something tells me that to do the same depth of personality as Cosmo had, the same richness, it would be on the manufacturing, on the AI, on the storytelling, on the design, it's going to be very, very difficult."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "It could be a cool sort of toy for Rick and Morty fans, but to create the same depth of existential angst that the Butter Robot symbolizes is really, that's the brave effort you succeeded at with Cosmo, but it's not easy."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "You can fail on almost any one of the kind of dimensions, and unique convergence of a lot of different skill sets to try to pull that off."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "On this topic, let me ask you for some advice, because as I've been watching Rick and Morty, I told myself, I have to build the Butter Robot, just as a hobby project."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "And so I got a nice platform for it with treads and there's a camera that moves up and down and so on."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "But the question I'd like to ask, there's obvious technical questions I'm fine with, communication, the personality, storytelling, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "I think I understand the process of that, but how do you know when you got it right?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "So with Cosmo, how did you know this is great?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Or something is off."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Is this brainstorming with the team?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Do you know it when you see it?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Is it like love at first sight?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "It's like, this is right."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "Or I guess if we think of it as an optimization space, is there Uncanny Valley where you're like, that's not right, or this is right, or are a lot of characters right?"}, {"time": 3268, "text": "Yeah, we stayed away from Uncanny Valley just by having such a different mapping where it didn't try to look like a dog or a human or anything like that."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "And so you avoided having a weird pseudo similarity, but not quite hitting the mark."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "But you could just fall flat where just a personality or a character emotion just didn't feel right."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "And so it actually mirrored very closely to the iterations that a character director at Pixar would have, where you're running through it and you can virtually see what it'll look like."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "We created a plugin to where we actually used Maya, the animation tools, and then we created a plugin that perfectly matched it to the physical one."}, {"time": 3300, "text": "And so you could test it out virtually and then push a button and see it physically play out."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And there's subtle differences."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And so you want to make sure that that feedback loop is super easy to be able to test it live."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "And then sometimes you would just feel it that it's right and intuitively know."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "And then we did user testing."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "But it was very, very often that if we found it magical, it would scale and be magical more broadly."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "There were not too many cases where we were pretty decent about not geeking out or getting too attached to something that was super unique to us, but trying to put a customer hat on and does it truly feel magical?"}, {"time": 3352, "text": "And so in a lot of ways, we just give a lot of autonomy to the character team to really think about the character board and mood boards and storyboards and what's the background of this character and how would they react."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "And they went through a process that's actually pretty familiar, but now had to operate under these unique constraints."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "The moment where it felt right kind of took a fairly similar journey than like as a character in an animated film."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "Actually, it's quite cool."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "Well, the thing that's really important to me and I wonder if it's possible."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "Well, I hope it's possible."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "Pretty sure it's possible is for me, even though I know how it works to make sure there's sufficient randomness in the process."}, {"time": 3394, "text":

"text": "Yeah, we made it intentionally so that there would be some surprise and a decent amount of variability in how he'd respond in certain circumstances."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "And so in the end, this isn't general AI."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "This is a giant spectrum and library of parameterized emotional responses and an emotional engine that would map your current state of the game, your emotions, the world, the people who are playing with you, so forth, to what's happening."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "But we could make it feel spontaneous by creating enough diversity and randomness, but still within the bounds of what felt like very realistic to make that work."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "And then what was really neat is that we could get statistics on how much of that space we were saturating and then add more animations and more diversity in the places that would get hit more often so that you stay ahead of the curve and maximize the chance that it stays feeling alive."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "But then when you combine it, the permutations and the combinations of emotions stitched together sometimes surprised us because you see them in isolation."},

3506, "text": "Yeah, when the system is sufficiently complex, there is something like emergent behavior and that's where the magic is."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "As a human being, you can still

something."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "It touches on the uncanny valley thing."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "So if you have legs and you're a big humanoid looking thing, you have very different

One?"}, {"time": 3904, "text": "What is Waymo Via?"}, {"time": 3904, "text": "Can you give an overview of the company and the vision behind the company?"}, {"time": 3920, "text": "Waymo, by the way, has been eye opening on just how incredible the people and the talent is and how in one company you almost have to create 30 companies worth of technology and capability to solve the full spectrum of it."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "So I've been at Waymo since 2019, so about two and a half years."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "So Waymo is focused on building what we call a driver, which is creating the ability to have autonomous driving across different environments, vehicle platforms, domains, and use cases."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "As you know, it got started in 2009."}, {"time": 3954, "text": "It was almost like an immediate successor to the Grand Challenge and Urban Challenges that were like incredible catalysts for this whole space."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "And so Google started this project and then eventually Waymo spun out."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "And so what Waymo is doing is creating the systems, both hardware, software, infrastructure, everything that goes into it to enable and to commercialize autonomous driving."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "This hits on consumer transportation and ride sharing and kind of vehicles and urban environments."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "And as you mentioned, it hits on autonomous trucking to transport goods."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "So in a lot of ways, it's transporting people and transporting goods."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "But at the end of the day, the underlying capabilities required to do that are surprisingly better aligned than one might expect, where it's the fundamentals of being able to understand the world around you, process it, make intelligent decisions, and prove that we are at a level of safety that enables large scale autonomy."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "So from a branding perspective, Waymo Driver is the system that's irrespective of a particular vehicle it's operating in."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "You have a set of sensors that perceive the world, can act in that world, and move whatever the vehicle is through the world."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "And so in the same way that you have a driver's license and your ability to drive is tied to a particular make and model of a car, and of course, there are special licenses for other types of vehicles, but the fundamentals of a human driver very, very largely carry over."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "And then there's uniquenesses related to a particular environment or domain or a particular vehicle type that kind of add some extra additive challenges."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "But that's exactly right."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "It's the underlying systems that enable a physical vehicle without a human driver to very successfully accomplish the task that previously wasn't possible without 100% human driving."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "And then there's Waymo One, which is the transporting people from a brand perspective."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "And just in case we refer to it so people know."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "And then there's Waymo Via, which is the trucking component."}, {"time": 4074, "text": "Why Via, by the way?"}, {"time": 4074, "text": "Is it just like a cool sounding name?"}, {"time": 4094, "text": "Is there an interesting story there?"}, {"time": 4094, "text": "It is a pretty cool sounding name."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "It's a cool sounding name."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "I mean, when you think about it, it's just like, well, we're going to transport it via this and that."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "So it's just kind of like an allusion to the mechanics of transporting something."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "And it is a pretty good grouping."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "And the interesting thing is that even the groupings kind of blur where Waymo One is like human transportation and there's a fully autonomous service in the Phoenix area that like every day is transporting people."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "And it's pretty incredible to like just see that operated reasonably large scale and just kind of happen."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "And then on the Via side, it doesn't even have to be like long haul trucking is a like a major focus of ours."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "But down the road, you can stitch together the vehicle transportation as well for local delivery."}, {"time": 4126, "text": "Also, and a lot of this requirements for local delivery overlap very heavily with consumer transportation."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "Obviously, given that you're operating on a lot of the same roads and navigating the same safety challenges."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "And Waymo very much is a multi product company that has ambitions in both."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "They have different challenges and both are tremendous opportunities."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "But the cool thing is, is that there's a huge amount of leverage and this kind of core technology stack now gets pushed on by both sides."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "And that adds its own unique challenges."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "But the success case is that the challenges that you push on, they get leveraged across all platforms and all."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "From an engineer perspective, the teams are integrated."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "It's a mix."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "So there's a huge amount of centralized kind of core teams that support all applications."}, {"time": 4187, "text": "And so you think of something like the hardware team that develops the lasers to compute integrates into vehicle platforms."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "This is an experience that carries over across, you know, any application that we'd have in a ebb and flow with both."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "Then there's like really unique perception challenges, planning challenges, like other types of challenges where there's a huge amount of leverage on a core tech stack."}, {"time": 4212, "text": "But then there's like dedicated teams that think of how do you deal with a unique challenge, for example, an articulated trailer with varying loads that completely changes the physical dynamics of a vehicle that doesn't exist on a car, but it becomes one of the most important kind of unique new challenges on a truck."}, {"time": 4228, "text": "So what's the long term dream of Waymo via the autonomous trucking effort that Waymo is doing?"}, {"time": 4237, "text": "Yeah, so we're starting with developing L4 autonomy for class 8 trucks."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "These are 53 foot trailers that capture like a pretty sizable percentage of the goods transportation in the country."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "Long term, the opportunity is obviously to expand to much more diverse types of vehicles, types of goods transportation and start to really expand in both the volume and the route feasibility that's possible."}, {"time": 4263, "text": "And so just like we did on the car side, you start with a single route with a very specific operating kind of domain and constraints that allow you to solve the problem."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "But then over time, you start to really try to push against those boundaries and open up deeper feasibility across routes, across surface streets, across environmental conditions, across the type of goods that you carry, the versatility of those goods and how little supervision is necessary to just start to scale this network."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "And long term, there's actually it's a pretty incredible enabler where today you have already a giant shortage of truck drivers."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "It's over 80,000 truck driver shortage that's expected to grow to hundreds of thousands in the years ahead."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "You have really, really quickly increasing demand from ecommerce and just distribution of where people are located."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "You have one of the deepest safety challenges of any profession in the US where there's a huge, huge, huge kind of challenge around fatigue and around kind of the long routes that are driven."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "And even beyond kind of the cost and necessity of it, there are fundamental constraints built into our logistics network that are tied to the type of human constraints and regulatory constraints that are tied to trucking today."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "For example, our limits on how long a driver can be driving in a single day before they're not allowed to drive anymore, which is a very important safety constraint."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "What that does is it enforces limitations on how far jumps with a single driver could be and makes you very subject to availability of drivers, which influences where warehouses are built, which influences how goods are transported, which influences costs."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "Yeah, I had to be published before this had a great conversation with Steve Vicelli, who we talked about the manual driving."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "He echoed many of the same things that you were talking about, but we talked about much of the fascinating human stories of truck drivers."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "He was also was a truck driver for a bit as a grad student to try to understand the depth of the problem."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "Fascinating lives."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "We have some drivers that have four million miles of lifetime driving experience."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "It's pretty incredible."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "And yeah, it's learning from them, like some of them are on the road for 300 days a year."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "It's a very unique type of lifestyle."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "So there's fascinating stuff there."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "Just like you said, there's a shortage of actually people, truck drivers taking the job, counter to what I think is publicly believed."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "So there's an excess of jobs and a shortage of people to take up those jobs."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "And just like you said, it's such a difficult problem."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "And these are experts at driving and solving this particular problem."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "And it's fascinating to learn from them to understand, you know, how hard is this problem?"}, {"time": 4461, "text": "And that's the question I want to ask you from a perception, from a robotics perspective."}, {"time": 4461, "text": "What's your sense of how difficult is autonomous trucking?"}, {"time": 4469, "text": "Maybe you can comment on which scenarios are super difficult, which are more manageable."}, {"time": 4469, "text": "Is there is there a way to kind of convert into words how difficult the problem is?"}, {"time": 4480, "text": "So there's and as you can expect, it's a mix."}, {"time": 4480, "text": "Some things become a lot easier or at least more flexible."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "Some things are harder."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And so, you know, on the things that are like the tailwinds, the benefits, a big focus of automating trucking, especially initially, is really focusing on the long haul freeway stretch of it, where that's where a majority of the value is captured."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "On a freeway, you have a lot more structure and a lot more consistency across freeways across the U.S. compared to surface streets where you have a way higher dimensionality of what can happen, lack of structure, lack of consistency and variability across cities."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "So you can leverage that consistency to tackle, at least in that respect, a more constrained problem, which has some benefits to it."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "You can itemize much more of the sort of things you might encounter and so forth."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "And so those are benefits."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "Is there a canonical freeway and city we should be thinking about?"}, {"time": 4537, "text": "Like, is there is there a standard thing that's brought up in conversation often?"}, {"time": 4546, "text": "Like, here's a stretch of road."}, {"time": 4546, "text": "What is it like when people talk about traveling across country, they'll talk about New York, San Francisco."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "Is that the route?"}, {"time": 4557, "text": "Like, is there a stretch of road that's like nice and clean and then there's like cities with difficulties in them that you kind of think of as the canonical problem to solve here?"}, {"time": 4569, "text": "So starting with the car side."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "Well, Waymo very intentionally picked the Phoenix area and the San Francisco area as a follow."}, {"time": 4578, "text": "Once we hit driverless, where when you think of consumer transportation and ride sharing kind of economy, a big percentage of that market is captured in the densest cities in the United States."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "And so really pushing out and solving San Francisco becomes a really huge opportunity and importance and places one dot on kind of like the spectrum of complexity."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "The Phoenix area, starting with Chandler and then expanding more broadly in the Phoenix metropolitan area, it's I believe the fastest growing city in the US."}, {"time": 4608, "text": "It's a kind of a higher medium sized city, but growing quickly and still captures a really wide range of kind of complexities."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "And so getting to driverless there actually exposes you to a lot of the building blocks you need for the more complicated environments."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "And so in a lot of ways, there's a thesis that if you start to kind of place a few of these kind of dots where San Francisco has these types of unique challenges, dense pedestrians, all this like complexity, especially when you get into the downtown areas and so forth."}, {"time": 4635, "text": "And Phoenix has like a really interesting kind of spectrum of challenges, maybe other ones like LA kind of add freeway focus and so forth."}, {"time": 4643, "text": "You start to kind of cover the full set of features that you might expect and it becomes faster and faster if you have the right systems and the right organization to then open up the fifth city and the 10th city and the 20th city."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "On trucking, there's similar properties where obviously there's uniquenesses and freeways when you get into really dense environments and then the real opportunity to then get even more valuous to think about how you expand with like some of the surface free challenges."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "But for example, right now we're looking we have a big facility that we're finishing building in Q1 in Dallas area."}, {"time": 4678, "text": "That'll allow us to do testing from the Dallas area on routes like Dallas to Houston, Dallas to Phoenix, going out east."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "Dallas to Austin."}, {"time": 4687, "text": "Austin to that triangle."}, {"time": 4689, "text": "Waymo should come to Austin."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "Well, Waymo the car side wasn't Austin for a while."}, {"time": 4694, "text": "Come back."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "But trucking is actually, Texas is one of the best places to start because of both volume, regulatory weather, there's a lot of benefits."}, {"time": 4703, "text": "On trucking, a huge opportunity is Port of LA going east."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "So in a lot of ways, a lot of the work is to start to stitch together a network and converge to Port of LA where you have the biggest port in the United States."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And the amount of goods going east from there is pretty tremendous."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And then obviously, there's, you know, kind of channels everywhere."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "And then you have extra complexities as you get into like snow and increment weather and so forth."}, {"time": 4728, "text": "But what's interesting about trucking is every single route segment that you add increases the value of the whole network."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "And so it has this kind of network effect and cumulative effect that's very unique."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "And so there's all these dimensions that we think about."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "And so in a lot of ways, Dallas is a really unique hub that opens up a lot of options has become a really valuable lever."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "So the million questions I could ask you, first of all, you mentioned level four."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "For people who totally don't know, there's these levels of automation that level four refers to kind of the first step that you could recognize as fully autonomous driving."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "Level five is really fully autonomous driving and level four is kind of fully autonomous driving."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "And then there are specific definitions, depending on who you ask what that actually means."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "But for you, what does the level four mean?"}, {"time": 4778, "text": "And you mentioned freeway."}, {"time": 4778, "text": "Let's say like there's three parts of long haul trucking."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "Maybe I'm wrong in this, but there's freeway driving."}, {"time": 4783, "text": "There's like truck stop."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "And then there's more urban type of area."}, {"time": 4794, "text": "So which of those do you want to tackle?"}, {"time": 4794, "text": "Which of them do you include under level four?"}, {"time": 4800, "text": "Like how do you think about this problem?"}, {"time": 4800, "text": "What do you focus on?"}, {"time": 4800, "text": "What is the biggest impact to be had in the short term?"}, {"time": 4805, "text": "So the goal is that we got to get to market as fast as we can, because the moment you get to market, you just learn so much and it influences everything that you do."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "And it is one of the experiences I carried over from before is that you add constraints."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "You figure out the right compromises."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "You do whatever it takes because getting to market is so critical."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "But here with autonomous driving, you can get to market in so many different ways."}, {"time": 4828, "text": "And so one of the simplifications that we intentionally have put on is using what we call transfer hubs, where you can imagine depots that are at the entry points to metropolitan areas, like let's say Dallas, like the hub that we're building, which does a few things that are very valuable."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "So from a first product standpoint, you can automate transfer hub to transfer hub."}, {"time": 4852, "text": "And that path from the transfer hub to the full freeway route can be a very intentional single route that you can select for the features that you feel you want to handle at that point in time."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "And you build the hub specifically designed for autonomous trucking."}, {"time": 4868, "text": "And that's what's going to happen, actually."}, {"time": 4868, "text": "And you need to come out in January and check it out because it's going to be really cool."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "Not only is it our main operating headquarters for our fleet there, but it will be the first fully ground up designed driverless hub for autonomous trucks in terms of where do they enter, where do they depart, how do you think about the flow of people, goods, everything."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "It's quite cool and it's really beautiful on how it's thought through."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "And so early on, it is totally reasonable to do the last five miles manually to get to the final kind of depot to avoid having to solve the general surface street problem, which is obviously very complex."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "Now, when the time comes and we are increasingly, already we're pushing on some of this, but we will increasingly be pushing on surface street capabilities to build out the value chain to go all the way depot to depot instead of transfer hub to transfer hub."}, {"time": 4917, "text": "And we have probably the best advantages in the world because of all the Waymo experience on surface streets, but that's not the highest ROI right now where the highest ROI is hub to hub and get the routes going."}, {"time": 4927, "text": "And so when you ask what's L4, L4 can be applied to any operating domain or scope, but it's effectively for the places where we say we're ready for autonomous operation."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "We are 100% operating as a self driving truck with no human behind the wheel."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "That is L4 autonomy."}, {"time": 4947, "text": "And it doesn't mean that you operate in every condition, it doesn't mean you operate on every road, but for a particularly well defined area, operating conditions, routes, kind of domain, you are fully autonomous."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "And that's the difference between L4 and L5."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "And most people would agree that at least anytime in the foreseeable future, L5 is just not even really worth thinking about because there's always going to be these extremes."}, {"time": 4970, "text": "And so it's a race and almost like a game where you think of what is the sequence of expanded capabilities that create the most value and teach us the most and create this feedback loop where we're building out and unlocking more and more capability over time."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "I gotta ask you, just curious."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "So first of all, I have to, when I'm allowed, visit the Dallas facility because it's super cool."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "It's like robot on the giving and the receiving end."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "The truck is a robot and the hub is a robot."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "Yeah, it's got to be very robot friendly."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "I will feel at home."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "What's the sensor suite like on the hub if you can just high level mention it?"}, {"time": 5002, "text": "Does the hub have like lidars?"}, {"time": 5002, "text": "Is the truck doing most of the intelligence or is the hub also intelligent?"}, {"time": 5020, "text": "Yeah, so most of it will be the truck and everything is like connected."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "So we have our servers where we know exactly where every truck is."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "We know exactly what's happening at a hub."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "And so you can imagine like a large backend system that over time starts to manage timings, goods, delivery, windows, all these sort of things."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "And so you don't actually need to, there might be special cases where that is valuable to equip some sensors in the hub, but a majority of the intelligence is going to be on the truck because whatever's relevant to the truck, relevant should be seen by the truck and can be relayed remotely for any sort of kind of cognizance or decision making."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "But there's a distinct type of workflow where do you check trucks?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "Where do you want them to enter?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "What if there's many operating at once?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "Where's the staging area to depart?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "How do you set up the flow of humans and human cars and traffic so that you minimize the interaction between humans and kind of self driving trucks?"}, {"time": 5078, "text": "And then how do you even intelligently select the locations of these transfer hubs that are both really great service locations for a metropolitan area?"}, {"time": 5078, "text": "And there could be over time, many of them for a metropolitan area while at the same time leaning into the path of least resistance to lean into your current capabilities and strengths so that you minimize the amount of work that's necessary to unlock the next kind of big bar."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "I have a million questions."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "So first, is the goal to have no human in the truck?"}, {"time": 5106, "text": "The goal is to have no human in the truck."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "Now, of course, right now we're testing with expert operators and so forth."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "But the goal is to... Now, there might be circumstances where it makes sense to have a human or... And obviously, these trucks can also be manually driven."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "So sometimes we talk with our fleet partners about how you can buy a Waymo equipped Dymor truck down the road and on the routes that are autonomous, it's autonomous."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "On the routes that are not, it's human driven."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "Maybe there's L2 functionality that adds safety systems and so forth."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "But as soon as they become, as soon as we expand in software, the availability of driverless routes, the hardware is forward compatible to just now start using them in real time."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "And so you can imagine this mixed use."}, {"time": 5151, "text": "But at the end of the day, the largest value proposition is where you're able to have no constraints on how you can operate this truck."}, {"time": 5151, "text": "And it's 100% autonomous with nobody inside."}, {"time": 5161, "text": "So the... Let me ask on the logistics front, because you mentioned that also opportunity to revamp or for build from scratch some of the ideas around logistics."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "I don't want to throw too much shade, but from talking to Steve, my understanding is logistics is not perhaps as great as it could be in the current trucking environment."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "I'm not, maybe you can break down why, but there's probably competing companies."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "There's just a mess."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "Maybe some of it is literally just, it's old school."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "Like they, it's just like, it's not computer, it's not computerized."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "Like truckers are almost like contractors."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "There's an independence and there's not a nice interface where they can communicate where they're going, where they're at, you know, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "And so there, it just feels like there's so much opportunity to digitize everything to where you could optimize the use of human time, optimize the use of all kinds of resources."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "How much are you thinking about that problem?"}, {"time": 5217, "text": "How fascinating is that problem?"}, {"time": 5223, "text": "How much opportunity is there to revolutionize the space of logistics in autonomous trucking, in trucking period?"}, {"time": 5229, "text": "It's pretty fascinating."}, {"time": 5229, "text": "It's one of the most motivating aspects of all this where like, yes, there's like a mountain of problems that are like you want to, you have to solve to get to like the first checkpoints and first drivers and so forth."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "And inevitably, like in a space like this, you plug in initially into the existing kind of system and start to kind of, you know, learn and iterate."}, {"time": 5247, "text": "But that opportunity is massive."}, {"time": 5247, "text": "And so, you know, a couple of the factors that play into it."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "So first of all, there's obviously just the physical constraints of driving time, driver availability."}, {"time": 5259, "text": "Some fleets have a 95% attrition rate, you know, right now because of just this demands and like, you know, kind of gaps in competition and so forth."}, {"time": 5268, "text": "And then it's also incredibly fragmented where you would be shocked at like when you look at industries, like when you think of the top 10 players, like the biggest fleets, like the Walmarts and FedExes and so forth."}, {"time": 5278, "text": "The percentage of the overall trucking market that's captured by the top 10 or 50 fleets is surprisingly small."}, {"time": 5284, "text": "The average kind of truck operation is like a one to five truck, you know, family business."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "And so and so there's just like a huge amount of like fragmentation, which makes for really interesting challenges in kind of stitching together through like bulletin boards and brokerages and some people run their own fleets."}, {"time": 5304, "text": "And this world's kind of like evolving, but it is one of the less digitized and optimized worlds that there is."}, {"time": 5314, "text": "And the part that is optimized is optimized to the constraints of today."}, {"time": 5318, "text": "And even within the constraints of today, this is a 900 billion dollar industry in the US and it's continuing to grow."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "It feels like from a business perspective, if I were to predict that while trying to solve the autonomous trucking problem, Waymo might solve first the logistics problem because that would already be a huge impact."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "So on the way to solving autonomous trucking, the human driven, like there's so much opportunity to significantly improve the human driven trucking, the timing, the logistics."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "So you use humans optimally."}, {"time": 5354, "text": "You use handoffs to like, you know, well, even you get really ambitious, you start to expand this beyond like how does the fulfillment center work and like how does the transfer hub work, how does the warehouse work?"}, {"time": 5369, "text": "I mean, there's a lot of opportunities to start to automate these chains."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "And a lot of the inefficiency today is because like you have a delay, like Port of LA has a bunch of ships right now waiting outside of it because they can't dock because there's not enough labor inside of the Port of LA."}, {"time": 5382, "text": "There's a big backlog of trucks, which means there's a big backlog of deliveries, which means the drivers aren't where they need to be."}, {"time": 5382, "text": "And so you have this like huge chain reaction and your feasibility of readjusting in this network is low because everything's tied to humans and manual kind of processes or distributed processes across a whole bunch of players."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "And so one of the biggest enablers is, yes, we have to solve autonomous trucking first."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "And that, by the way, that's not like an overnight thing."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "That's decades of continued kind of expansion and work."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "But the first checkpoint in the first route is like is not that far off."}, {"time": 5416, "text": "But once you start enabling and you start to learn about how the constraints of autonomous trucking, which are very, very different than the constraints of human trucking and again, strengths and weaknesses, how do you then start to leverage that and rethink a flow of goods more broadly?"}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And this is where like the learnings of like really partnering with some of the largest fleets in the US and the sort of learnings that they have about the industry and the sort of needs that they have."}, {"time": 5434, "text": "And what would change if you just like really broke this one constraint that like holds up the whole network?"}, {"time": 5450, "text": "Or what if you enable this other constraint?"}, {"time": 5450, "text": "That actually drives the roadmap in a lot of ways because this is not like an all or nothing problem."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "You start to kind of unlock more and more functionality over time, which functionality most enables this optimization ends up being kind of part of the discussion."}, {"time": 5467, "text": "But you're totally right."}, {"time": 5467, "text": "Like you fast forward to like five years, 10 years, 15 years, and you think about like very generalized capability of automation and logistics, as well as the ability to like poke into how those handoffs work."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "The efficiency goes far beyond just direct cost of today's like unit economics of a truck."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "They go towards reinventing the entire system in the same way that you see these other industries that like when you get to enough scale, you can really rethink how you build around your new set of capabilities, not the old set of capabilities."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "Yeah, use the analogy metaphor or whatever that autonomous trucking is like email versus mail."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "And then with email, you're still doing the communication, but it opens up all kinds of communities, varieties of communication that you didn't anticipate."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "Constraints are just completely different."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "And yeah, there's a definitely a property of that here."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "And we're also still learning about it because there is a lot of really fascinating and sometimes really elegant things that the industry has done where there's companies whose entire existence is around, despite the constraints, optimizing as much as they can out of it."}, {"time": 5536, "text": "And those lessons do carry over."}, {"time": 5536, "text": "But it's an interesting kind of merger of worlds to think about like, well, what if this was completely different?"}, {"time": 5536, "text": "How would we approach it?"}, {"time": 5545, "text": "And the interesting thing is that for a really, really, really long time, it's actually going to be the merger between how to use autonomy and how to use humans that leans into each of their strengths."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "And then we're back to Cosmo, human robot interaction."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "So and the interesting thing about Waymo is because there's the passenger vehicle, the human, the transportation of humans and transportation of goods, you could see over time, they may kind of meld together more because you'll probably have like zero occupancy vehicles moving around."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "So you have transportation of goods for short distances and then for slightly longer distances and then slightly longer and then there'll be this, then you just see the difference between a passenger vehicle and a truck is just size and you can have different sizes and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5591, "text": "And at the core, you can have a Waymo driver that doesn't, as long as you have the same sense of suite, you can just think of it as one problem."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "And that's why over time, these do kind of converge where in a lot of ways, a lot of the challenges we're solving are freeway driving, which are going to carry over very well to the vehicles, to the car side."}, {"time": 5608, "text": "But there are like then unique challenges like you have a very different dynamics in your vehicle where you have to see much further out in order to have the proper response time because you have an 80,000 pound fully loaded truck."}, {"time": 5621, "text": "That's a very, very different type of breaking profile than a car."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "You have a really interesting kind of dynamic limits because of the trailer where you actually, it's very, very hard to like physically like flip a car or do something like physically like most risk in a car is from just collisions."}, {"time": 5638, "text": "It's very hard to like in any normal operation to do something other than like unless you hit something to actually kind of like roll over something on a truck, you actually have to drive much closer to the physical bounds of the safety limits."}, {"time": 5650, "text": "But you actually have like real constraints because you could have really interesting interactions between the cabin and the trailer."}, {"time": 5660, "text": "There's something called jackknifing if you turn too quickly, you have roll risk and so forth."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "And so we spent a huge amount of time understanding those boundaries and those boundaries change based on the load that you have, which is also an interesting difference."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "You have to propagate that through the algorithm so that you're leveraging your dynamic range, but always staying within the safety bounds, but understanding what those safety bounds are."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "And so we have this like really cool test facility where we like take it to the max and actually imagine a truck with these giant training wheels on the back of the trailer and you're pushing it past the safety limits in order to like try to actually see where it rolls."}, {"time": 5695, "text": "And so you define this high dimensional boundary, which then gets captured in software to stay safe and actually do the right thing."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "But it's kind of fascinating the sort of kind of challenges you have there."}, {"time": 5706, "text": "But then all of these things drive really interesting challenges from perception to unique behavior prediction challenges."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "And obviously in Planner where you have to think about merging and creating gaps with a 53 foot trailer and so forth."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "And then obviously the platform itself is very different."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "We have different numbers of sensors, sometimes types of sensors, and you also have unique blind spots that you have because of the trailer, which you have to think about."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "And so it's a really interesting spectrum."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "And in the end, you try to capture these special cases in a way that is cleanly augmentations of the existing tech stack because a majority of what we're solving is actually generalizable to freeway driving and different platforms."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "And over time, they all start to kind of merge ideally where the things that are unique are as minimal as possible."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "And that's where you get the most leverage."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "And that's why Waymo can take on two trillion dollar opportunities and have been nowhere near 2x the cost or investment or size."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "In fact, it's much, much smaller than that because of the high degree of leverage."}, {"time": 5770, "text": "So what kind of sensor suite they can speak to that a long haul truck needs to have?"}, {"time": 5770, "text": "Lidar, vision, how many?"}, {"time": 5781, "text": "Yeah, so it's more than the car."}, {"time": 5781, "text": "So very loosely you can think of it as like 2x, but it varies depending on the sensor."}, {"time": 5787, "text": "And so we have like dozens of cameras, radar, and then multiple Lidar as well."}, {"time": 5793, "text": "You'll see one difference where the cars have a central main sensor pod on the roof in the middle and then some kind of hood sensors for blind spots."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "The truck moves to two main sensor pods on the outsides where you would typically have the mirrors next to the driver."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "They effectively go as far out as possible, kind of up to the front, kind of on the cabin, not all the way in the front, but like kind of where the mirrors for the driver would be."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "And so those are the main sensor pods."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "And the reason they're there is because if you had one in the middle, the trailer is higher than the cabin and you would be occluded with this like awkward wedge."}, {"time": 5828, "text": "Too much occlusion."}, {"time": 5829, "text": "And so then you would add a lot of complexity to the software to make up for that and just unnecessary complexity."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "There's so many probably fascinating design choices here."}, {"time": 5838, "text": "Because you can probably bring up a Lidar higher and have it in the center or something."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "You could have all kinds of choices to make the decisions here that ultimately probably will define the industry."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "But by having two on the side, there's actually multiple benefits."}, {"time": 5850, "text": "So one is like you're just beyond the trailer so you can see fully flush with the trailer."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "And so you eliminate most of your blind spot except for right behind the trailer, which is great because now the software carries over really well."}, {"time": 5863, "text": "And the same perception system you use on the car side, largely that architecture can carry over and you can retrain some models and so forth that you leverage it a lot."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "It also actually helps with redundancy where there's a really not nice built in redundancy for all the Lidar cameras and radar where you can afford to have any one of them fail and you're still OK. And at scale, every one of them will fail."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "And you will be able to detect when one of them fails because they don't because the redundancy that they're giving you the data that's inconsistent with the rest of that's right."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "And it's not just like they no longer give data."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "It could be like they're fouled or they stop giving data where some electrical thing gets cut or part of your compute goes down."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "So what's neat is that like you have way more sensors."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "Part of his field of view and occlusions, part of its redundancy and part of it is new use cases."}, {"time": 5910, "text": "So there's new types of sensors to optimize for long range and kind of the sensing horizon that we look for on our vehicles that is unique to trucks because it actually is like kind of much like further out than than a car."}, {"time": 5927, "text": "But a majority are actually used across both cars and trucks."}, {"time": 5927, "text": "And so we use the same compute, the same fundamental baseline sensors, cameras, radar, IMUs."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "And so you get a great leverage from all of the infrastructure and the hardware development as a result."}, {"time": 5941, "text": "So what about cameras?"}, {"time": 5941, "text": "What role does."}, {"time": 5941, "text": "So LIDAR is this rich set of information that has its strengths, has some weaknesses."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "Camera is this rich source of information that has some strengths, has its weaknesses."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "What role does LIDAR play?"}, {"time": 5956, "text": "What role does vision cameras play in this beautiful problem of autonomous trucking?"}, {"time": 5965, "text": "There's like so much that comes together."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "And how much and at which point do they come together?"}, {"time": 5971, "text": "So I'll start with LIDAR."}, {"time": 5971, "text": "So LIDAR has been like Waymo's, one of Waymo's big strengths and advantages where we developed our own LIDAR in house where many generations in both in cost and functionality."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "It is the best in this space."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "Which generation?"}, {"time": 5989, "text": "Because I know there's this there's this cool."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "I mean, I love versions that are increasing."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "Which version of the hardware stack is it currently, officially, publicly?"}, {"time": 6001, "text": "So some parts iterate more than others."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "I'm trying to remember on the sensor side."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "So the entire self driving system, which includes sensors and compute, is fifth generation."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "I can't wait until there's like iPhone style like announcements for like new versions of the Waymo hardware."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "Well, we try to be careful because, man, when you change the hardware, it takes a lot to like retrain the models and everything."}, {"time": 6024, "text": "So we just went through that and going from the Pacificus to the Jaguars."}, {"time": 6027, "text": "And so the Jaguars and then the trucks are, you know, have the same generation now."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "But yeah, the LIDAR is it's incredible."}, {"time": 6031, "text": "And so Waymo has leaned into that as a strength."}, {"time": 6036, "text": "And so a lot of the near range perception system that obviously kind of carries over a lot from the car side uses LIDAR as a very prominent kind of like primary sensor."}, {"time": 6046, "text": "But then obviously everything has its strengths and weaknesses."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "And so in the near range, LIDAR is a gigantic advantage and it has its weaknesses on when it comes to occlusions in certain areas, rain and weather, like things like that."}, {"time": 6061, "text": "But it's an incredible sensor and it gives you incredible density, perfect location precision and consistency, which is a very valuable property to be able to kind of apply ML approaches."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "Can you elaborate consistency?"}, {"time": 6075, "text": "When you have a camera, the position of the sun, the time of the day, various of the properties can have a big impact, whether there's glare, the field of view, things like that."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "So consistent in the face of a changing external environment, the signal."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "Daytime, nighttime."}, {"time": 6094, "text": "It's about 3D physical existence, in effect, like you're seeing beams of light that physically bounce off of something and come back."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "And so whatever the conditional conditions are, like the shape of a human sensor reading from a human or from a car or from an animal, like you have a reliability there, which ends up being valuable for kind of like the long tail of challenges."}, {"time": 6120, "text": "So LIDAR is the first sensor to drop off in terms of range and ours has a really good range, but at the end of the day, it drops off."}, {"time": 6147, "text": "Now, cameras have the incredible range where you get a high density, high resolution camera, you can get data, you know, well past a kilometer and it's like really potentially a huge value."}, {"time": 6160, "text": "Now, the signal drops off, the noise is higher, detecting is harder, classifying is harder and one that you may not think about localizing is harder because you can be off by like two meters and where something's located a kilometer away."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "And that's the difference between being on the shoulder and being in your lane."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "And so you have like interesting challenges there that you have to solve, which have a bunch of approaches that come into it."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "Radar is interesting because it also has longer range than LIDAR and it gives you speed information."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "So it becomes very, very useful for dynamic information of traffic flow, vehicle motions, animals, pedestrians, like just things that might be useful signals."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "And it helps with weather conditions where radar actually penetrates weather conditions in a better way than other sensors."}, {"time": 6210, "text": "And so it's kind of interesting where we've kind of started to converge towards not thinking about a problem as a LIDAR problem or a camera problem or radar problem, but it's a fusion problem where these are all like large scale ML problems where you put data into the system."}, {"time": 6226, "text": "And in many cases, you just look for the signals that might be present in the union of all of these and leave it to the system as much as possible to start to really identify how to how to extract that."}, {"time": 6226, "text": "And then there's places we have to intervene and actually include more."}, {"time": 6241, "text": "But no single sensor is in a great position to really solve this problem and then without a huge extra challenge."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "There's a question that's probably still an open question is at which point do you fuse them?"}, {"time": 6248, "text": "Do you solve the perception problem for each sensor suite individually, the LIDAR suite and the camera suite?"}, {"time": 6264, "text": "Or do you do some kind of heterogeneous fusion or do you fuse at the very beginning?"}, {"time": 6264, "text": "Is there a good answer or at least an inkling of intuitions you can come up with?"}, {"time": 6275, "text": "Yeah, so people refer to this as early fusion or late fusion."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "So late fusion might be that you have the camera pipeline, the LIDAR pipeline, and then you fuse them and when it gets to final semantics and classification and tracking, you fuse them together and figure out which one's best."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "There's more and more evidence that early fusion is important, and that is because late fusion does not allow you to pick up on the complementary strengths and weaknesses of the sensors."}, {"time": 6307, "text": "Weather is a great example where if you do early fusion, you have an incredibly hard problem for any single sensor in rain to solve that problem because you have reflections from the LIDAR, you have weird kind of noise from the camera, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "But the combination of all of them can help you filter and help you get to the real signal that then gets you as close as possible to the original stack."}, {"time": 6332, "text": "And be much more fluid about the strengths and weaknesses where your camera is much more susceptible to fouling on the actual lens from rain or random stuff, whereas you might be a little bit more resilient in other sensors."}, {"time": 6348, "text": "So there's an element of logic that always happens late in the game, but that fusion early on, especially as you move towards ML and large scale data driven approaches, just maximizes your ability to pull out the best signal you can out of each modality before you start making constraining decisions that end up being hard to unwind late in the stack."}, {"time": 6366, "text": "So how much of this is a machine learning problem?"}, {"time": 6366, "text": "What role does ML, machine learning, play in this whole problem of autonomous driving, autonomous trucking?"}, {"time": 6376, "text": "It's massive, and it's increasing over time."}, {"time": 6376, "text": "If you go back to the grand challenge days and the early days of AV development, there was ML, but it was not in the mass scale data style of ML."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "It was like learning models, but in a more structured kind of way."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "And it was a lot of heuristic and search based approaches and planning and so forth."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "You can make a lot of progress with these types of approaches kind of across the board and almost deceptive amount of progress."}, {"time": 6406, "text": "We can get pretty far, but then you start to really grind the further you get in some parts of the stack if you don't have an ability to absorb a massive amount of experience in a way that scales very sublinearly in terms of human labor and human attention."}, {"time": 6419, "text": "And so when you look at the stack, the perception side is probably the first to get really revolutionized by ML, and it goes back many years because ML for computer vision and these types of approaches kind of took off with a lot of the early kind of push in deep learning."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "And so there's always a debate on the spectrum between end to end ML, which is a little bit too far to how you architect it to where you have modules, but enough ability to think about long tail problems and so forth."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "And that has been one of the realizations as you drive tens of millions of miles and try to solve new expansions of domains without regressing your old ones, it becomes intractable for a human to approach that in the way that traditionally robotics has kind of approached some elements of the tech stack."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "So are you trying to create a data pipeline specifically for the trucking problem?"}, {"time": 6492, "text": "How much leveraging of the autonomous driving is there in terms of data collection?"}, {"time": 6492, "text": "And how unique is the data required for the trucking problem?"}, {"time": 6510, "text": "So we reuse all the same infrastructure, so labeling workflows, ML workflows, everything, so that actually carries over quite well."}, {"time": 6510, "text": "We heavily reuse the data even, where almost every model that we have on a truck, we started with the latest car model."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "So it's almost like a good back arm model."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "Yeah, it's like you can think of like, despite the different domain and different numbers of sensors and position of sensors, there's a lot of signals that carry over across driving."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "And so it's almost like pre training and getting a big boost out of the gate where you can reduce the amount of data you need by a lot."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "And it goes both ways, actually."}, {"time": 6543, "text": "And so we're increasingly thinking about our data strategy on how we leverage both of these."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "So you think about, you know, how other agents react to a truck."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "Yeah, it's a little bit different, but the fundamentals are actually like, what will other vehicles in the road do?"}, {"time": 6549, "text": "There's a lot of carry over that's possible."}, {"time": 6559, "text": "And in fact, just to give you an example, we're constantly kind of like adding more data from the trucking side."}, {"time": 6566, "text": "But as of right now, when we think of our, like one of our models, behavior prediction for other agents on the road, like vehicles, 85% of that data comes from cars."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "And a lot of that 85% comes from surface streets, because we just had so much of it, and it was really valuable."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "And so we're adding in more and more, particularly in the areas where we need more data, but you get a huge boost out of the gate."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "Just all different visual characteristics of roads, lane markings, pedestrians, all that that's still relevant."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "It's all still relevant."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "And then just the fundamentals of how, you know, you detect the car."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "Does it really change that much, whether you're detecting it from a car or a truck?"}, {"time": 6605, "text": "The fundamentals of how a person will walk around your vehicle is that it'll change a little bit."}, {"time": 6610, "text": "But the basics, like there's a lot of signal in there that as a starting point to a network can actually be very valuable."}, {"time": 6616, "text": "Now, we do have some very unique challenges where there's a sparsity of events on a freeway."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "The frequency of events happening on a freeway, whether it's interesting objects in the road or incidents or even like from a human benchmark, like how often does a human have an accident on a freeway is far more sparse than on a surface street."}, {"time": 6635, "text": "And so that leads to really interesting data problems where you can't just drive infinitely to encounter all the different permutations of things you might encounter."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "And so there you get into interesting tools like structure testing and data collection, data augmentation and so forth."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "And so there's really interesting kind of technical challenges that push some of the research that enables these new new suites of approaches."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "What role does simulation play?"}, {"time": 6659, "text": "Really good question."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "So Waymo simulates about a thousand miles for every mile it drives."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "So you think of in both."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "So across the board, across the board."}, {"time": 6666, "text": "So you think of, for example, well, if we've driven over 20 million miles, that's over 20 billion miles in simulation."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "Now, how do you use simulation?"}, {"time": 6678, "text": "It's a multipurpose."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "So you use it for basic development."}, {"time": 6685, "text": "So you want to do make sure you have regression, prevention and protection of everything you're doing."}, {"time": 6692, "text": "When you encounter something interesting in the world, let's say there was an issue with how the vehicle behaved versus an ideal human."}, {"time": 6698, "text": "You can play that back in simulation and start augmenting your system and seeing how you would have reacted to that scenario with this improvement or this new area."}, {"time": 6706, "text": "You can create scenarios that become part of your regression set after that point."}, {"time": 6711, "text": "Then you start getting into like really, really kind of hill climbing where you say, hey, I need to improve this system."}, {"time": 6718, "text": "I have these metrics are really correlated with final performance."}, {"time": 6718, "text": "How do I know how well I'm doing operation?"}, {"time": 6724, "text": "The actual physical driving is the least efficient form of testing and it's expensive."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "It's time consuming."}, {"time": 6728, "text": "So grabbing a large scale batch of historical data and simulating it to get a signal of over these last or just random sample of one hundred thousand miles."}, {"time": 6740, "text": "How has this metric changed versus where we are today?"}, {"time": 6740, "text": "You can do that far more efficiently in simulation than just driving with that new system on board."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "And then you go all the way to the validation phase where to actually see your human relative safety of like how well are you performing on the car side or the trucking side relative to a human."}, {"time": 6759, "text": "A lot of that safety case is actually driven by taking all of the physical operational driving, which probably includes a lot of interventions where the driver took over just in case."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "And then you simulate those forward and see if would anything have happened."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "And in most cases, the answer is no."}, {"time": 6779, "text": "But you can simulate it forward and you can even start to do really interesting things where you add virtual agents to create harder environments."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "You can fuzz the locations of physical agents."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "You can muck with the scene and stress test the scenario from a whole bunch of different dimensions."}, {"time": 6795, "text": "And effectively, you're trying to like more efficiently sample this like infinite dimensional space, but try to encounter the problems as fast as possible."}, {"time": 6803, "text": "Because what most people don't realize is the hardest problem in autonomous driving is actually the evaluation problem in many ways, not the actual autonomy problem."}, {"time": 6811, "text": "And so if you could, in theory, evaluate perfectly and instantaneously, you can solve that problem in a really fast feedback loop quite well."}, {"time": 6819, "text": "But the hardest part is being really smart about this suite of approaches on how can you get an accurate signal on how well you're doing as quickly as possible in a way that correlates to physical driving."}, {"time": 6831, "text": "Can you explain the evaluation problem?"}, {"time": 6831, "text": "Which metric are you evaluating towards?"}, {"time": 6831, "text": "Are we talking about safety?"}, {"time": 6831, "text": "What are the performance metrics that we're talking about?"}, {"time": 6840, "text": "So in the end, you care about end safety."}, {"time": 6840, "text": "That's what's deceptive where there's a lot of companies that have a great demo."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "The path from a really great demo to being able to go driverless can be deceptively long, even when that demo looks like it's driverless quality."}, {"time": 6858, "text": "And the difference is that the thing that keeps you from going driverless is not the stuff you encounter in a demo."}, {"time": 6863, "text": "It's the stuff that you encounter once at 100,000 miles or 500,000 miles."}, {"time": 6867, "text": "And so that is at the root of what is most challenging about going driverless because any issue you encounter, you can go and fix it."}, {"time": 6876, "text": "But how do you know you didn't create five other issues that you haven't encountered yet?"}, {"time": 6880, "text": "So those were painful learnings in Waymo's history that Waymo went through and led to us then finally being able to go driverless in Phoenix and now are at the heart of how we develop."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "Evaluation is simultaneously evaluating final kind of end safety of how ready are you to go driverless, which may be as direct as what is your collision, human relative kind of collision rate for all these types of scenarios and and severities to make sure that you're better than a human bar by a good amount."}, {"time": 6917, "text": "But that's not actually the most useful for development."}, {"time": 6919, "text": "For development, it's much more kind of analog metrics that are part of the art of finding how, what are the properties of driving that give you a way quicker signal that's more sensitive than a collision that can correlate to the quality you care about and push the feedback loop to all of your development?"}, {"time": 6940, "text": "A lot of these are, for example, comparisons to human drivers, like manual drivers."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "How do you do relative to a human driver in various dimensions of various circumstances?"}, {"time": 6949, "text": "Can I ask you a tricky question?"}, {"time": 6949, "text": "So if I brought you a truck, how would you test it?"}, {"time": 6955, "text": "Okay, Alan Turing came along and you said, This one can't tell if it's a human driver or autonomous driver."}, {"time": 6961, "text": "But not the human because, you know, humans are flawed."}, {"time": 6966, "text": "How do you actually know you're ready, basically?"}, {"time": 6966, "text": "How do you know it's good enough?"}, {"time": 6971, "text": "And by the way, this is the reason why Waymo released the safety framework for the car side, because one, it sets the bar so nobody cuts below it and does something bad for the field that causes an accident."}, {"time": 6982, "text": "And two, it's to start the conversation on framing what does this need to look like?"}, {"time": 6982, "text": "Same thing we'll end up doing for the trucking side."}, {"time": 6990, "text": "It ends up being different portfolio of approaches."}, {"time": 6990, "text": "There's easy things like, are you compliant with all these fundamental rules of the road?"}, {"time": 6999, "text": "Like you never drive above the speed limit."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "That's actually pretty easy."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "You can fundamentally prove that it's either impossible to violate that rule or that you can itemize the scenarios where that comes up and you can do a test and show that you pass that test and therefore you can handle that scenario."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "And so those are like traditional structure testing kind of system engineering approaches where you can just, like fault rates is another example where when something fails, how do you deal with it?"}, {"time": 7029, "text": "You're not going to drive and randomly wait for it to fail."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "You're going to force a failure and make sure that you can handle it and close courses and simulation or on the road and run through all the permutations of failures, which you can oftentimes for some parts of the system itemize like hardware."}, {"time": 7044, "text": "The hardest part is behavioral where you have just infinite situations that could in theory happen and you want to figure out the combinations of approaches that can work there."}, {"time": 7059, "text": "You can probably pass the Turing test pretty quickly, even if you're not like completely ready for driverless because the events that are really kind of like hard will not happen that often."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "Just to give you a perspective, a human has a serious accident on a freeway, like a truck driver on a freeway."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "There's a serious event happens once every 1.3 million miles and something that actually has like really serious injuries, 28 million miles."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "And so those are really rare."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "And so you could have a driver that looks like it's ready to go, but you have no signal on what happens there."}, {"time": 7091, "text": "And so that's where you start to get creative on combinations of sampling and statistical arguments, focused structured arguments where you can kind of simulate those scenarios and show that you can handle them and metrics that are correlated with what you care about, but you can measure much more quickly and get to a right answer."}, {"time": 7108, "text": "And that's what makes it pretty hard."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "And in the end, you end up borrowing a lot of properties from aerospace and like space shuttles and so forth where you don't get the chance to launch it a million times just to say you're ready because it's too expensive to fail."}, {"time": 7126, "text": "And so you go through a huge amount of kind of structured approaches in order to validate it."}, {"time": 7126, "text": "And then by thoroughness, you can make a strong argument that you're ready to go."}, {"time": 7138, "text": "This is actually a harder problem in a lot of ways, though, because you can think of a space shuttle as getting to a fixed point and then you kind of like or an airplane and you like freeze the software and then you like prove it and you're good to go."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "Here you have to get to a driverless quality bar, but then continue to aggressively change the software even while you're driverless."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "And also the full range of environment that you there's an external environment where the shuttle is you're basically testing the like the systems, the internal stuff."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "And you have a lot of control in the external stuff."}, {"time": 7168, "text": "And the hard part is how do you know you didn't get worse in something that you just changed?"}, {"time": 7172, "text": "And so so in a lot of ways, like the Turing test starts to fail pretty quickly because you start to feel driverless quality pretty early in that curve."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "And if you think about it, right, like in most most kind of, you know, really good A.V."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "demos, maybe you'll sit there for 30 minutes."}, {"time": 7190, "text": "So you've driven, you know, 15 miles or something like that to go driverless."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "Like what's the sort of rate of issues that you need to have?"}, {"time": 7197, "text": "You won't even encounter."}, {"time": 7201, "text": "So let's try something different then."}, {"time": 7201, "text": "Let's try a different version of the Turing test, which is like an IQ test."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "So there's these difficult questions of increasing difficulty."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "They're very they're they're designed."}, {"time": 7214, "text": "You don't know them ahead of time."}, {"time": 7214, "text": "Nobody knows the answer to them."}, {"time": 7218, "text": "And so is it possible to in the future orchestrate basically really difficult course almost of like."}, {"time": 7225, "text": "That maybe change every year."}, {"time": 7225, "text": "And that represent if you can pass these, they don't necessarily represent the full spectrum."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "They won't be conclusive, but you can at least get a really quick read and filter."}, {"time": 7238, "text": "Like you're able to."}, {"time": 7238, "text": "Because you didn't know them ahead of time."}, {"time": 7242, "text": "Probably like construction zones, failures or or driving anywhere in Russia."}, {"time": 7249, "text": "Snow, weather, cut ins, dense traffic, kind of merging, lane closures, animal foreign objects on a road that pop out on short notice, mechanical failures, sensor breaking, tire popped, weird behaviors by other vehicles like a heartbreak, something reckless that they've done, fouling of sensors like bugs or birds, you know, poop or something."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "So but yeah, like you have these like kind of like extreme conditions where like you have a nasty construction zone where everything shuts down and you have to like, you know, get pulled to the other side of the freeway with a temporary lane like that."}, {"time": 7285, "text": "Those are sort of conditions where we do that to ourselves."}, {"time": 7285, "text": "We itemize everything that could possibly happen to give you a starting point to how to think about what you need to develop."}, {"time": 7293, "text": "And at the end of the day, there's no substitute for real miles."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "Like if you think of traditional ML, like, you know how there's like a validation set where you hold out some data and like real world driving is the ultimate validation set."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "That's the in the end, like the cleanest signal."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "But you can do a really good job on creating an obstacle course."}, {"time": 7309, "text": "And you're absolutely right."}, {"time": 7309, "text": "Like at the end, if there was such a thing as automating and kind of a readiness, it would be these extreme conditions like a red light runner."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "A really reckless pedestrian that's jaywalking, a cyclist that, you know, makes like a really awkward maneuver."}, {"time": 7327, "text": "That's actually what keeps you from going driverless."}, {"time": 7327, "text": "Like in the end, that is the long tail."}, {"time": 7331, "text": "And it's interesting to think about that."}, {"time": 7331, "text": "That to me is the Turing test."}, {"time": 7331, "text": "Turing test means a lot of things."}, {"time": 7331, "text": "But to me, in driving, the Turing test is exactly this validation set that is handcrafted."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "There's a guy named Francois Chollet."},

validation set for him is handcrafted."}, {"time": 7353, "text": "And that it requires like human genius or ingenuity to create a really good test."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "And you hold, you truly hold it out."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "It's an interesting perspective on the validation set, which is like, make that as hard as possible."}, {"time": 7374, "text": "Not a generic representation of the data, but this is the hardest."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "The hardest."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "You know, it's like go."}, {"time": 7379, "text": "Like you'll never fully itemize like all the world states that you'll expand."}, {"time": 7385, "text": "And so you have to come up with different approaches."}, {"time": 7385, "text": "And this is where you start hitting the struggles of ML,

deal."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "But you do care about it on the driving side."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "And so typically like you'll never fully enumerate the world."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "And

you a tricky question."}, {"time": 7438, "text": "So to me, the two companies that are building at scale some of the most incredible robots ever built is Waymo and Tesla."}, {"time": 7455, "text": "So there's very distinct approaches technically, philosophically in these two systems."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "Let me ask you to play sort of devil's advocate and then the devil's advocate to the devil's advocate."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "It's a bit of a race."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "Of course, everyone can win."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "But if Waymo wins this race to level four, why would they win?"}, {"time": 7483, "text": "What aspect of the approach do you think would be the winning aspect?"}, {"time": 7483, "text": "And if Tesla wins, why would they win and which aspect of their approach would be the reason?"}, {"time": 7495, "text": "Just building some intuition, almost not from a business perspective, from any of that, just technically."}, {"time": 7501, "text": "And we could summarize, I think maybe you can correct me, one of the more distinct aspects is Waymo has a richer suite of sensors as LIDAR and vision."}, {"time": 7515, "text": "Tesla now removed radar."}, {"time": 7515, "text": "They do vision only."}, {"time": 7515, "text": "Tesla has a larger fleet of vehicles operated by humans."}, {"time": 7524, "text": "So it's already deployed on the field and it's a larger, what do you call it, operational domain."}, {"time": 7532, "text": "And then Waymo is more focused on a specific domain and growing it with fewer vehicles."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "So both are fascinating approaches."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "I think there's a lot of brilliant ideas."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "Nobody knows the answer."}, {"time": 7544, "text": "So I'd love to get your comments on this lay of the land."}, {"time": 7548, "text": "So maybe I'll start with Waymo."}, {"time": 7551, "text": "And you're right, both incredible companies and just a gigantic respect to everything Tesla has accomplished and how they pushed the field forward as well."}, {"time": 7560, "text": "So on the Waymo side, there is a fundamental advantage in the fact that it is focused and geared towards L4 from the very beginning."}, {"time": 7568, "text": "We've customized the sensor suite for it, the hardware, the compute, the infrastructure, the tech stack and all of the investment inside the company."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "That's deceptively important because there's like a giant spectrum of problems you have to solve in order to really do this from infrastructure to hardware to autonomy stack to the safety framework."}, {"time": 7588, "text": "And that's an advantage because there's a reason why it's the fifth generation hardware and why all of those learnings went into the Dimore program."}, {"time": 7596, "text": "It becomes such an advantage because you learn a lot as you drive and you optimize for the best information you have."}, {"time": 7603, "text": "But fundamentally, like there's a big, big jump, like every order of magnitude that you drive in numbers of miles and what you learn and the gap from really kind of like decent progress for L2 and so forth to what it takes to actually go L4."}, {"time": 7618, "text": "And at the end of the day, there's a feeling that Waymo has there's a long way to go."}, {"time": 7624, "text": "Nobody's won, but there's a lot of advantages in all of these buckets where it's the only company that has shipped a fully driverless service where you can go and you can use it and it's at a decently sizable scale."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "And those learnings can feed forward to how to solve the more general problems."}, {"time": 7643, "text": "And you see this process you've deployed in Chandler."}, {"time": 7646, "text": "You don't know the timeline exactly, but you could see the steps."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "They seem almost incremental."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "It's become more engineering than totally blind R&D."}, {"time": 7656, "text": "It works in one place and then you move to another place and you grow it this way."}, {"time": 7688, "text": "And so those learnings you just can't shortcut."}, {"time": 7690, "text": "And so that's an advantage."}, {"time": 7691, "text": "And so there's a lot of open challenges to kind of get through, technical, organizational, like how do you solve problems that are increasingly broad and complex like this, work on multiple products."}, {"time": 7700, "text": "But there's the feeling that, okay, like balls in our court, there's a head start there."}, {"time": 7705, "text": "Now we've got to go and solve it."}, {"time": 7706, "text": "And I think that focus on L4, it's a fundamentally different problem."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "If you think about it, like let's say we were designing an L2 truck that was meant to be safer and help a human."}, {"time": 7715, "text": "You could do that with far less sensors, far less complexity and provide value very quickly, arguably what we already have today just packaged up in a good product."}, {"time": 7725, "text": "But you would take a huge risk in having a gap from even the like compute and sensors, not to mention the software, to then jump from that system to an L4 system."}, {"time": 7735, "text": "So it's a huge risk basically."}, {"time": 7737, "text": "So again, allow me to be the person that plays the devil's advocate and argue for the Tesla approach."}, {"time": 7743, "text": "So what you just laid out makes perfect sense and is exactly right."}, {"time": 7748, "text": "I have some open questions here, which is it's possible that investing more in faster data collection, which is essentially what Tesla is doing, will get us there faster if the sensor suite doesn't matter as much and machine learning can do a lot of the work."}, {"time": 7770, "text": "My question is, how much is the thing you mentioned before, how much of driving can be end to end learned?"}, {"time": 7779, "text": "Obviously, the Waymo and the vision only machine learning approach will solve driving eventually, both."}, {"time": 7788, "text": "The question is of timeline, what's faster?"}, {"time": 7791, "text": "And what you mentioned, like if I were to make the opposite argument, like what puts Tesla in the strongest position, it's data."}, {"time": 7797, "text": "That is their superpower where they have an access to real world data effectively with a safety driver."}, {"time": 7805, "text": "They found a way to get paid by safety drivers versus safer safety drivers."}, {"time": 7814, "text": "But all joking aside, one, it is incredible that they've built a business that's incredibly successful that can now be a foundation and bootstrap really aggressive investment in the autonomy space."}, {"time": 7825, "text": "If you can do it, that's always like an incredible kind of advantage."}, {"time": 7828, "text": "And in the data aspect of it, it is a giant amount of data if you can use it the right way to then solve the problem."}, {"time": 7834, "text": "But the ability to collect and filter through to the things that matter at real world scale, like a large distribution, that is huge."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "Like it's a big advantage."}, {"time": 7845, "text": "And so then the question becomes, can you use it in the right way?"}, {"time": 7848, "text": "And do you have the right software systems and hardware systems in order to solve the problem?"}, {"time": 7853, "text": "And you're right that in the long term, there's no reason to believe that pure camera systems can't solve the problem that humans obviously are solving with vision systems."}, {"time": 7863, "text": "But it's a risk."}, {"time": 7866, "text": "So there's no argument that it's not a risk."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "And it's already such a hard problem."}, {"time": 7872, "text": "And so much of that problem, by the way, is even beyond the perception side, some of the hardest elements of the problem on the behavioral side and decision making and the long tail safety case."}, {"time": 7882, "text": "If you are adding risk and complexity on the input side from perception, you're now making a really, really hard problem, which on its own is still almost insurmountably hard, even harder."}, {"time": 7894, "text": "And so the question is just how much."}, {"time": 7896, "text": "And this is where you can easily get into a little bit of a kind of a trap where similar to how you how do you evaluate how good an AV company's product is."}, {"time": 7906, "text": "Like you go and you do a trial kind of a test run with them, a demo run, which they've kind of optimized like crazy and so forth and like and it feels good."}, {"time": 7913, "text": "Do you do you put any weight in that?"}, {"time": 7915, "text": "You know that that gap is kind of like, you know, pretty large still."}, {"time": 7919, "text": "Same thing on the like perception case, like the long tail of computer vision is really, really hard."}, {"time": 7924, "text": "And there's a lot of ways that that can come up."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "And even if it doesn't happen that often at all, when you think about the safety bar and what it takes to actually go full driverless, not like incredible assistance driverless, but full driverless, that bar gets crazy high."}, {"time": 7940, "text": "And not only do you have to solve it on the behavioral side, but now you have to push computer vision beyond arguably where it's ever been pushed."}, {"time": 7948, "text": "And so, you know, on top of the broader AV challenge, you have a really hard perception challenge as well."}, {"time": 7952, "text": "So there's perception, there's planning, there's human robot interaction."}, {"time": 7952, "text": "To me, what's fascinating about what Tesla is doing is in this march towards level four, because it's in the hands of so many humans, you get to see video, you get to see humans."}, {"time": 7968, "text": "I mean, forget companies, forget businesses."}, {"time": 7968, "text": "It's fascinating for humans to be interacting with robots."}, {"time": 7975, "text": "And they're actually helping kind of push it forward."}, {"time": 7978, "text": "And that is valuable, by the way, where even for us, a decent percentage of our data is human driving."}, {"time": 7984, "text": "We intentionally have humans drive higher percentage than you might expect because that creates some of the best signals to train the autonomy."}, {"time": 7984, "text": "And so that is on its own a value."}, {"time": 7994, "text": "So together, we're kind of learning about this problem in an applied sense, just like you had with Cosmo."}, {"time": 7994, "text": "When you're chasing an actual product that people are going to use, robot based product that people are going to use, you have to contend with the reality of what it takes to build a robot that successfully perceives the world and operates in the world."}, {"time": 8015, "text": "And what it takes to have a robot that interacts with other humans in the world."}, {"time": 8015, "text": "And that's like, to me, one of the most interesting problems humans have ever undertaken because you're in trying to create an intelligent agent that operates in a human world."}, {"time": 8029, "text": "You're also understanding the nature of intelligence itself."}, {"time": 8029, "text": "Like how hard is driving is still not answered to me."}, {"time": 8039, "text": "Yeah, I still don't understand the subtle cues, like even little things like your interaction with a pedestrian where you look at each other and just go, OK, go."}, {"time": 8048, "text": "Like that's hard to do without a human driver."}, {"time": 8048, "text": "And you're missing that dimension."}, {"time": 8048, "text": "How do you communicate that?"}, {"time": 8054, "text": "So there's like really, really interesting kind of like elements here."}, {"time": 8054, "text": "Now, here's what's beautiful."}, {"time": 8058, "text": "Can you imagine that like when autonomous driving is solved, how much of the technology foundation of that space can go and have like tremendous, just transformative impacts on other problem areas and other spaces that have subsets of these same problems?"}, {"time": 8076, "text": "Like, it's just incredible to think about that."}, {"time": 8078, "text": "It's both a pro and a con is with autonomous driving is so safety critical."}, {"time": 8078, "text": "So once you solve it, it's beautiful because there's so many applications that are a lot less safety critical."}, {"time": 8093, "text": "But it's also the con of that is it's so hard to solve."}, {"time": 8093, "text": "And the same journalists that you mentioned to get excited for a demo are the ones who write long articles about the failure of your company."}, {"time": 8107, "text": "If there's one accident that's based on a robot, it's just society is so tense and waiting for failure of robots."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "You're in such a high stake environment."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "Failure has such a high cost."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "And it slows down development."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "It slows down development."}, {"time": 8124, "text": "Yeah, like the team like definitely noticed that like once you go driverless, like we're driverless in Phoenix and you continue to iterate, your iteration pace slows down because your fear of regression forces so much more rigor that obviously you have to find a compromise on like, okay, well, how often do we release driverless builds?"}, {"time": 8145, "text": "Because every time you release a driverless build, you have to go through this like validation process, which is very expensive and so forth."}, {"time": 8150, "text": "So it is interesting."}, {"time": 8150, "text": "It is one of the hardest things."}, {"time": 8150, "text": "There's no other industry where like you wouldn't release products way, way quicker when you start to kind of provide even portions of the value that you provide."}, {"time": 8163, "text": "Healthcare maybe is the other one."}, {"time": 8166, "text": "But at the same time, right, like we've gotten there where you think of like surgery, right?"}, {"time": 8169, "text": "Like you have surgery, there's always a risk, but like it's really, really bounded."}, {"time": 8174, "text": "You know that there's an accident rate when you go out and drive your car today, right?"}, {"time": 8174, "text": "And you know what the fatality rate in the US is per year."}, {"time": 8206, "text": "At the end of the day, we have to be able to explain to society how do we quantify the risk and acknowledge that there is some nonzero risk, but it's far above a human relative safety."}, {"time": 8217, "text": "See, here's the thing, to push back a little bit and bring Cosmo back in the conversation, you said something quite brilliant at the beginning of this conversation that I think probably applies for autonomous driving, which is, you know, there's this desire to make autonomous cars more safer than human driven cars."}, {"time": 8234, "text": "But if you create a product that's really compelling and is able to explain both the leadership and the engineers and the product itself can communicate intent, then I think people may be able to be willing to put up with the thing that might be even riskier than humans because they understand the value of taking risks."}, {"time": 8257, "text": "You mentioned the speed limit."}, {"time": 8258, "text": "Humans understand the value of going over the speed limit."}, {"time": 8261, "text": "Humans

"text": "I mean, this is a much more tense topic of discussion, so this is just me talking."}, {"time": 8279, "text": "So with Cosmo's case, there was something about the way this particular robot communicated, the energy it brought, the intent it was able to communicate to the humans that you understood that of course it needs to have a camera."}, {"time": 8293, "text": "Of course it needs to have this information."}, {"time": 8295, "text": "And in that same way, to me, of course a car needs to take risks."}, {"time": 8300, "text": "Of course there's going to be accidents."}, {"time": 8303, "text": "If you want a car that never has an accident, have a car that just doesn't go anywhere."}, {"time": 8311, "text": "But that's tricky because that's not a robotics problem."}, {"time": 8317, "text": "Many accidents are not even due to you, obviously."}, {"time": 8321, "text": "So there's a big difference though."}, {"time": 8323, "text": "That's not a personal decision."}, {"time": 8327, "text": "You're also impacting obviously kind of the rest of the road and we're facilitating it."}, {"time": 8332, "text": "And so there's a higher kind of ethical moral bar, which obviously then translates into as a society and from a regulatory standpoint, kind of like what comes out of it where it's hard for us to ever see this even being a debate in the sense that you have to be beyond reproach from a safety standpoint because if you're wrong about this, you could set the entire field back a decade."}, {"time": 8357, "text": "See, this is me speaking."}, {"time": 8359, "text": "I think if we look into the future, there will be, I personally believe, this is me speaking, that there will be less and less focus on safety."}, {"time": 8370, "text": "It's still very, very high."}, {"time": 8372, "text": "Meaning like after autonomy is very common and accepted."}, {"time": 8376, "text": "Not so common as everywhere."}, {"time": 8378, "text": "But there has to be a transition because I think for innovation, just like you were saying to explore ideas, you have to take risks."}, {"time": 8386, "text": "And I think if autonomy in the near term is to become prevalent in society, I think people need to be more willing to understand the nature of risk, the value of risk."}, {"time": 8400, "text": "It's very difficult, you're right, of course, with driving, but that's the fascinating nature of it."}, {"time": 8406, "text": "It's a life and death situation that brings value to millions of people, so you have to figure out what do we value about this world?"}, {"time": 8416, "text": "How much do we value, how deeply do we want to avoid hurting other humans?"}, {"time": 8464, "text": "But ironically, the logic can actually help with the emotions."}, {"time": 8464, "text": "And just like any technology, there's early adopters and then there's kind of like a curve that happens after it."}, {"time": 8475, "text": "And eventually celebrities, you get the rock in a Waymo vehicle and then everybody just comes along."}, {"time": 8479, "text": "And then everybody calms down because the rock likes it."}, {"time": 8483, "text": "If you post the... And it's an open question on how this plays out."}, {"time": 8485, "text": "Maybe we're pleasantly surprised and people just realize that this is such an enabler of life and efficiency and cost and everything that there's a pull."}, {"time": 8497, "text": "At some point, I should fully believe that this will go from a thoughtful kind of movement and tiptoeing and kind of like a push to society realizes how wonderful of an enabler this could become and it becomes more of a pull."}, {"time": 8511, "text": "And hard to know exactly how that will play out."}, {"time": 8511, "text": "But at the end of the day, like both the goods transportation and the people transportation side of it has that property where it's not easy."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "There's a lot of open questions and challenges to navigate."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "And there's obviously the technical problems to solve as a kind of prerequisite."}, {"time": 8527, "text": "But they have such an opportunity that is on a scale that very few industries in the last 20, 30 years have even had a chance to tackle that I maybe we're pleasantly surprised by how much that tipping point like in a really short amount of time actually turns into a societal pull to kind of embrace the benefits of this."}, {"time": 8548, "text": "Yeah, I hope so."}, {"time": 8549, "text": "It seems like in the recent few decades, there's been tipping points for technologies where like overnight things change."}, {"time": 8549, "text": "It's like from taxis to ride sharing services, all that shift."}, {"time": 8560, "text": "I mean, there's just shift after shift after shift that requires digitization to end technology."}, {"time": 8565, "text": "I hope we're pleasantly surprising this."}, {"time": 8567, "text": "So there's millions of long haul trucks now in the United States."}, {"time": 8571, "text": "Do you see a future where there's millions of Waymo trucks and maybe just broadly speaking Waymo vehicles, just like

of those things that just feels so natural and then it becomes almost like this kind of interesting kind of oddity that we had none of it like, you know, kind of decades earlier."}, {"time": 8602,

most enabling technologies that we have in the world today."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "It'll feel like, you know, how is the world before the Internet?"}, {"time": 8619, "text": "How is the world before mobile phones?"}, {"time": 8620, "text": "Like it's going to have that sort of a feeling to it on both sides."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "It's hard to predict the future, but do you sometimes think about weird ways it might change the world, like surprising ways?"}, {"time": 8630, "text": "So obviously there's more direct ways where like there's increases efficiency."}, {"time": 8635, "text": "It will enable a lot of kind of logistics, optimizations kind of things."}, {"time": 8640, "text": "It will change probably our roadways and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 8647, "text": "But it could also change society in some kind of interesting ways."}, {"time": 8651, "text": "Do you ever think about how might change cities, how might change our lives, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 8656, "text": "You can imagine city where people live versus work becoming more distributed because the pain of commuting becomes different, just easier."}, {"time": 8663, "text": "And there's a lot of options that open up."}, {"time": 8666, "text": "The layout of cities themselves and how you think about car storage and parking obviously just enables a completely different type of experience in urban environments."}, {"time": 8679, "text": "I think there was like a statistic that something like 30 percent of the traffic in cities during rush hour is caused by pursuit of parking

greater automation through the whole kind of stack and how that supply chain, the ripples become much more agile versus like very grindy the way they are today where just the adaptation is like very tough and there's a lot of constraints that we have."}, {"time": 8734, "text": "I think it'll be great for the environment."}, {"time": 8736, "text": "It'll be great for safety where like probably about 95 percent of accidents today statistically are due to just attention or things that are preventable with the strengths of automation."}, {"time": 8749, "text": "Yeah, and it'll be one of those things where industries will shift, but the net creation is going to be massively positive."}, {"time": 8756, "text": "And then we just have to be thoughtful about the negative implications that will happen in local places and adjust for those."}, {"time": 8763, "text": "But I'm an optimist in general for the technology where you could argue a negative on any new technology, but you start to kind of see that if there is a big demand for something like this, in almost all cases, that like it's an enabling factor that's going to kind of propagate through society."}, {"time": 8780, "text": "And particularly as life expectancies get longer and so forth, like there's just a lot more need for a greater percentage of the population to kind of just be serviced with a high level of efficiency

"Every technology has negative consequences and positive consequences, and we tend to just focus on the negative a little bit too much."}, {"time": 8806, "text": "In fact, autonomous trucks are often brought up as an example of artificial intelligence and robots in general taking our jobs."}, {"time": 8817, "text": "And as we've talked about briefly here, we talk a lot with Steve."}, {"time": 8821, "text": "It is a concern that automation will take away certain jobs, it will create other jobs."}, {"time": 8829, "text": "There's temporary pain, hopefully temporary, but pain is pain and people suffer and that human suffering is really important to think about."}, {"time": 8838, "text": "But trucking is, I mean, there's a lot written on this is I would say far from the thing that will cause the most pain."}, {"time": 8848, "text": "Yeah, there's even more positive properties about trucking where not only is there just a huge shortage which is going to increase, the average age of truck drivers is getting closer to 50 because the younger people aren't wanting to come into it."}, {"time": 8859, "text": "They're trying to like incentivize, lower the age limit, like all these sort of things."}, {"time": 8864, "text": "And the demand is just going to increase."}, {"time": 8866, "text": "And the least favorable, I mean, it depends on the person, but in most cases, the least favorable types of routes are the massive long haul routes where you're on the road away from your family 300 plus days a year."}, {"time": 8876, "text": "Steve talked about the pain of those kinds of routes from a family perspective."}, {"time": 8880, "text": "You're basically away from family."}, {"time": 8883, "text": "It's not just hours, you work insane hours, but it's also just time away from family."}, {"time": 8889, "text": "Obesity rate is through the roof because you're just sitting all day."}, {"time": 8892, "text": "It's really, really tough."}, {"time": 8894, "text": "And that's also where like the biggest kind of safety risk is because of fatigue."}, {"time": 8898, "text": "And so when you think of the gradual evolution of how trucking comes in, first of all, it's not overnight."}, {"time": 8904, "text": "It's going to take decades to kind of phase in all the like, there's just a long, long, long road ahead."}, {"time": 8909, "text": "But the routes and the portions of trucking that are going to require humans the longest and benefit the most from humans are the short haul and most complicated kind of more urban routes, which are also the more pleasant ones, which are less continual driving time, more flexibility on like geography and location, and you get to kind of sleep at your own home."}, {"time": 8934, "text": "And very importantly, if you optimize the logistics, you're going to use humans much better and thereby pay them much better."}, {"time": 8945, "text": "Because like one of the biggest problems is truck drivers currently are paid by like how much they drive."}, {"time": 8951, "text": "So they really feel the pain of inefficient logistics because like if they're just sitting around for hours, which they often do not driving, waiting, they're not getting paid for that time."}, {"time": 8962, "text": "So like logistics has a significant impact on the quality of life of a truck driver."}, {"time": 8967, "text": "And a high percentage of trucks are like empty because of inefficiencies in the system."}, {"time": 8971, "text": "Yeah, it's one of those things where like, and the other thing is when you increase the efficiency of a system like this, the overall net like volume of the system tends to increase, right?"}, {"time": 8980, "text": "Like the entire market cap of trucking is going to go up when the efficiency improves and facilitates both growth in industries and better utilization of trucking."}, {"time": 9019, "text": "Yeah, so this is true for trucking, but if we zoom out broader, automation and AI does technology broadly, I would say."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "But you know, automation is a thing that has a potential in the next couple of decades to shift the kind of jobs available to humans."}, {"time": 9036, "text": "And so that results in, like I said, human suffering because people lose their jobs, there's economic pain there, and there's also a pain of meaning."}, {"time": 9046, "text": "So for a lot of people, work is a source of meaning, it's a source of identity, of pride, of pride in getting good at the job, pride in craftsmanship and excellence, which is what truck drivers talk about."}, {"time": 9065, "text": "But this is true for a lot of jobs."}, {"time": 9068, "text": "And is that something you think about as a sort of a roboticist zooming out from the trucking thing?"}, {"time": 9073, "text": "Like where do you think it would be harder to find activity and work that's a source of identity, a source of meaning in the future?"}, {"time": 9084, "text": "I do think about it because you want to make sure that you worry about the entire system, like not just like the part of the economy plays in it, but what are the ripple effects of it down the road."}, {"time": 9095, "text": "And on enough of a time window, there's a lot of opportunity to put in the right policies, the right opportunities to kind of reshape and retrain and find those openings."}, {"time": 9104, "text": "And so just to give you a few examples, both trucking and cars, we have remote assistance facilities that are there to interface with customers and monitor vehicles and provide like very focused kind of assistance on kind of areas where the vehicle may want to request help in understanding an environment."}, {"time": 9124, "text": "So those are jobs that kind of get created and supported."}, {"time": 9127, "text": "I remember like taking a tour of one of the Amazon facilities where you've probably seen the Kiva systems robots where you have these orange robots that have automated the warehouse, like kind of picking and collecting of items."}, {"time": 9139, "text": "And it's like really elegant and beautiful way."}, {"time": 9142, "text": "It's actually one of my favorite applications of robotics of all time."}, {"time": 9146, "text": "You know, like I think it kind of came across a company like 2006 was just amazing."}, {"time": 9150, "text": "And what was the warehouse robots that transport little things?"}, {"time": 9153, "text": "So basically, instead of a person going and walking around and picking the seven items in your order, these robots go and pick up a shelf and move it over in a row where like the seven shelves that contain the seven items are lined up in a laser or whatever points to what you need to get."}, {"time": 9168, "text": "And you go and pick it and you place it to fill the order."}, {"time": 9170, "text": "And so the people are fulfilling the final orders."}, {"time": 9173, "text": "What was interesting about that is that when I was asking them about like kind of the impact on labor when they transitioned that warehouse, the throughput increased so much that the jobs shifted towards the final fulfillment, even though the robots took over entirely the search of the items themselves."}, {"time": 9189, "text": "And the labor, the job stayed like nobody like that was actually the same amount of jobs, roughly they were necessary."}, {"time": 9196, "text": "But the throughput increased by I think over 2x or some amount."}, {"time": 9199, "text": "So you have these situations that are not zero sum games in this really interesting way."}, {"time": 9204, "text": "And the optimist in me thinks that there's these types of solutions in almost any industry where the growth that's enabled creates opportunities that you can then leverage."}, {"time": 9212, "text": "But you got to be intentional about finding those and really helping make those links because even if you make the argument that like there's a net positive, locally there's always tough hits that you got to be very careful about."}, {"time": 9224, "text": "You have to have an understanding of that link because there's a short period of time whether training is acquired or just mental transition or physical or whatever is acquired, that's still going to be short term pain."}, {"time": 9235, "text": "The uncertainty of it, there's families involved."}, {"time": 9240, "text": "It's exceptionally is difficult on a human level and you have to really think about that."}, {"time": 9249, "text": "You can't just look at economic metrics always, it's human beings."}, {"time": 9253, "text": "And you can't even just take it as like, okay, well, we need to like subsidize or whatever because like there is an element of just personal pride where majority of people, like people don't want to just be okay, but like they want to actually like have a craft like you said and have a mission and feel like they're having a really positive impact."}, {"time": 9271, "text": "And so my personal belief is that there's a lot of transferability and skill set that is possible, especially if you create a bridge and an investment to enable it."}, {"time": 9283, "text": "And to some degree, that's our responsibility as well in this process."}, {"time": 9288, "text": "You mentioned Kiva robots, Amazon."}, {"time": 9288, "text": "Let me ask you about the Astro robot, which is, I don't know if you've seen it, it's Amazon has announced that it's a home robot that they have a screen looks awfully a lot like Cosmo has I think different vision probably."}, {"time": 9306, "text": "What are your thoughts about like home robotics in this kind of space?"}, {"time": 9313, "text": "There's been quite a bunch of home robots, social robots that very unfortunately have closed their doors that for various reasons, perhaps it were too expensive, there's manufacturing challenges, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 9327, "text": "What are your thoughts about Amazon getting into this space?"}, {"time": 9330, "text": "Yeah, we had some signs that they're getting into it like long, long, long ago."}, {"time": 9334, "text": "Maybe they were a little bit too interested in Cosmo during our conversations, but they're also very good partners actually for us as we kind of just integrated a lot of shared technology."}, {"time": 9344, "text": "If I could also get your thoughts on, you could think of Alexa as a robot as well, Echo."}, {"time": 9353, "text": "Do you see those as fundamentally different just because you can move and look around?"}, {"time": 9358, "text": "Is that fundamentally different than the thing that just sits in place?"}, {"time": 9361, "text": "It opens up options, but my first reaction is I have my doubts that this one's going to hit the mark because I think for the price point that it's at and the kind of functionality and value propositions that they're trying to put out, it's still searching for the killer application that justifies I think it was like a $1,500 price point or kind of somewhere on there."}, {"time": 9430, "text": "I think that's in the end one of the biggest challenges for robotics, especially consumer robotics where you have to kind of meet that bar."}, {"time": 9437, "text": "It becomes very, very hard."}, {"time": 9440, "text": "And there's also the higher bar, just like you were saying with Cosmo, of a thing that can look one way and then turn around and look at you."}, {"time": 9450, "text": "That's either a super desirable quality or a super undesirable quality depending on how much you trust the thing."}, {"time": 9458, "text": "And so there's a problem of trust to solve there."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "There's a problem of personality."}, {"time": 9463, "text": "It's the quote unquote problem that Cosmo solved so well is that you trust the thing, and that has to do with the company, with the leadership, with the intent that's communicated by the device and the company and everything together."}, {"time": 9476, "text": "Yeah, exactly right."}, {"time": 9477, "text": "And I think they also have to retrace some of the learnings on the character side where, as usual, I think that's the place where a lot of companies are great at the hardware side of it and think about those elements."}, {"time": 9490, "text": "Thinking about the AI challenges, particularly with the advantage of Alexa, is a pretty huge boost for them."}, {"time": 9496, "text": "The character side of it for technology companies is pretty novel territory, and so that will take some iterations."}, {"time": 9503, "text": "But yeah, I mean, I hope this continued progress in the space and that thread doesn't kind of go dormant for too long, and it's going to take a while to kind of evolve into the ideal applications."}, {"time": 9530, "text": "And take risks."}, {"time": 9550, "text": "Is one way to put it."}, {"time": 9552, "text": "Yeah, so why is it so hard at a high level to build a robotics company?"}, {"time": 9560, "text": "A robotics company that lives for a long time."}, {"time": 9569, "text": "That to me was exceptionally successful vision and idea and implementation."}, {"time": 9593, "text": "And of course there's like Amazon, what they're doing is they're almost like taking risks so they can afford it because they have other sources of revenue."}, {"time": 9602, "text": "But outside of those examples, most robotics companies fail."}, {"time": 9610, "text": "Why is it so hard to run a robotics company?"}, {"time": 9612, "text": "iRobot's impressive because they found a really, really great fit of where the technology could satisfy a really clear use case and need, and they did it well, and they didn't try to overshoot from a cost to benefit standpoint."}, {"time": 9628, "text": "Robotics is hard because it like tends to be more expensive."}, {"time": 9632, "text": "It combines way more technologies than a lot of other types of companies do."}, {"time": 9636, "text": "If I were to like say one thing that is maybe the biggest risk in like a robotics company failing is that it can be either a technology in search of an application or they try to fight off a kind of an offering that has a mismatch in kind of price to function."}, {"time": 9656, "text": "And just the mass market appeal isn't there."}, {"time": 9659, "text": "And consumer products are just hard."}, {"time": 9662, "text": "It's just, I mean, after all the years and I'd like definitely kind of feel a lot of the battle scars because you have, not only do you have to like hit the function, but you have to educate and explain, get awareness up, deal with different types of consumers."}, {"time": 9675, "text": "There's a reason why a lot of technologies sometimes start in the enterprise space and then kind of continue forward in the consumer space, even like you see AR like starting to kind of make that shift with HoloLens and so forth in some ways."}, {"time": 9689, "text": "Consumers and price points that they're willing to kind of be attracted in a mass market way."}, {"time": 9694, "text": "And I don't mean like 10,000 enthusiasts bought it, but I mean like 2 million, 10 million, 50 million like mass market kind of interest have bought it."}, {"time": 9706, "text": "That bar is very, very high and typically robotics is novel enough and nonstandardized enough to where it pushes on price points so much that you can easily get out of range where the capabilities and today's technology or just the function that was picked just doesn't line up."}, {"time": 9720, "text": "And so that product market fit is very important."}, {"time": 9723, "text": "So the space of killer apps or rather super compelling apps is much smaller because it's easy to get outside of the price range for most consumers."}, {"time": 9733, "text": "And it's not constant, right?"}, {"time": 9733, "text": "And that's why we picked off entertainment because the quality was just so low in physical entertainment that we felt we could leapfrog that and still create a really compelling offering at a price point that was defensible and that proved out to be true."}, {"time": 9750, "text": "And over time, that same opportunity opens up in healthcare, in home applications and commercial applications and kind of broader, more generalized interface, but there's missing pieces in order for that to happen."}, {"time": 9764, "text": "And all of those have to be present for it to line up."}, {"time": 9767, "text": "And we see these sort of trends in technology where kind of technologies that start in one place evolve and kind of grow to another."}, {"time": 9775, "text": "Some things start in gaming."}, {"time": 9776, "text": "Some things start in space or aerospace and then kind of move into the consumer market."}, {"time": 9783, "text": "And sometimes it's just a timing thing, right, where how many stabs at what became the iPhone were there over the 20 years before that just weren't quite ready in the function relative to the kind of price point complexity."}, {"time": 9796, "text": "And sometimes it's a small detail of the implementation that makes all the difference, which is design is so important."}, {"time": 9803, "text": "Something, yeah, like the new generation UX, right?"}, {"time": 9807, "text": "And it's tough and oftentimes all of them have to be there and it has to be like a perfect storm."}, {"time": 9814, "text": "But yeah, history repeats itself in a lot of ways in a lot of these trends, which is pretty fascinating."}, {"time": 9820, "text": "Well, let me ask you about the humanoid form."}, {"time": 9822, "text": "What do you think about the Tesla bot and humanoid robotics in general?"}, {"time": 9825, "text": "So obviously, to me, autonomous driving Waymo and the other companies working in the space, that seems to be a great place to invest in potential revolutionary application robotics application folks application."}, {"time": 9840, "text": "What's the role of humanoid robotics?"}, {"time": 9842, "text": "Do you think Tesla bot is ridiculous?"}, {"time": 9845, "text": "Do you think it's super promising?"}, {"time": 9847, "text": "Do you think it's interesting, full of mystery, nobody knows?"}, {"time": 9850, "text": "What do you think about this thing?"}, {"time": 9852, "text": "Yeah, I think today humanoid form robotics is research."}, {"time": 9856, "text": "There's very few situations where you actually need a humanoid form to solve a problem."}, {"time": 9860, "text": "If you think about it, right, like wheels are more efficient than legs."}, {"time": 9863, "text": "There's joints and degrees of freedom beyond a certain point, just add a lot of complexity and cost."}, {"time": 9869, "text": "So if you're doing a humanoid robot, oftentimes it's in the pursuit of a humanoid robot, not in the pursuit of an application for the time being."}, {"time": 9876, "text": "Especially when you have like kind of the gaps in interface and, you know, kind of AI that we kind of talk about today."}, {"time": 9882, "text": "So anything you want does I'm interested in following."}, {"time": 9885, "text": "So there's there's an element of that world, no matter how crazy, how crazy it is."}, {"time": 9888, "text": "I just like, you know, I'll pay attention."}, {"time": 9888, "text": "I'm curious to see what comes out of it."}, {"time": 9891, "text": "So it's like you can't you can't ever, you know, ignore it."}, {"time": 9894, "text": "But, you know, it's definitely far afield from their kind of core business, obviously."}, {"time": 9899, "text": "What was interesting to me is I've disagreed with Elon a lot about this is to me, the compelling aspect of the humanoid form and a lot of kind of robots, Cosmo, for example, is a human robot interaction part."}, {"time": 9920, "text": "From Elon Musk's perspective, Tesla bot has nothing to do with the human."}, {"time": 9925, "text": "It's a form that's effective for the factory because the factory is designed for humans."}, {"time": 9931, "text": "But to me, the reason you might want to argue for the humanoid form is because, you know, at a party, it's a nice way to fit into the party."}, {"time": 9941, "text": "The humanoid form has a compelling notion to it in the same way that Cosmo is compelling."}, {"time": 9946, "text": "I would argue, if we were arguing about this, that it's cheaper to build a Cosmo like that form."}, {"time": 9955, "text": "But if you wanted to make an argument, which I have with Jim Keller about, you know, you could actually make a human robot for pretty cheap."}, {"time": 9963, "text": "And then the question is, all right, if you're using an application where it can be flawed, it can have a personality and be flawed in the same way that Cosmo is, then maybe it's interesting for integration to human society."}, {"time": 9978, "text": "That, to me, is an interesting application of a humanoid form because humans are drawn, like I mentioned to you, like robots, we're drawn to legs and limbs and body language and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 9987, "text": "And even a face, even if you don't have the facial features, which you might not want to have to reduce the creepiness factor, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 9998, "text": "But yeah, that, to me, the humanoid form is compelling."}, {"time": 10000, "text": "But in terms of that being the right form for the factory environment, I'm not so sure."}, {"time": 10006, "text": "Yeah, for the factory environment, like right off the bat, what are you optimizing for?"}, {"time": 10011, "text": "Is it strength?"}, {"time": 10011, "text": "Is it mobility?"}, {"time": 10011, "text": "Is it versatility, right?"}, {"time": 10013, "text": "Like that changes completely the look and feel of the robot that you create, you know, and almost certainly the human form is over designed for some dimensions and constrained for some dimensions."}, {"time": 10023, "text": "And so, like, what are you grasping?"}, {"time": 10023, "text": "Is it big?"}, {"time": 10023, "text": "Is it little, right?"}, {"time": 10027, "text": "So you would customize it and make it customizable for the different needs if that was the optimization, right?"}, {"time": 10034, "text": "And then, you know, for the other one, I could totally be wrong."}, {"time": 10038, "text": "You know, I still feel that the closer you try to get to a human, the more you're subject to the biases of what a human should be and you lose flexibility to shift away from your weaknesses and towards your strengths."}, {"time": 10052, "text": "And that changes over time, but there's ways to make really approachable and natural interfaces for robotic kind of characters and, you know, kind of deployments in these applications that do not at all look like a human directly, but that actually creates way more flexibility and capability and role and forgiveness and interface and everything else."}, {"time": 10083, "text": "Yeah, it's interesting, but I'm still confused by the magic I see in legged robots."}, {"time": 10089, "text": "Yeah, so there is a magic."}, {"time": 10089, "text": "So I'm absolutely amazed at it from a technical curiosity standpoint and like the magic that like the Boston Dynamics team can do from, you know, like from walking and jumping and so forth."}, {"time": 10104, "text": "Now, like there's been a long journey to try to find an application for that sort of technology."}, {"time": 10109, "text": "But wow, that's incredible technology, right?"}, {"time": 10112, "text": "So then you kind of go towards, OK, are you working back from a goal of what you're trying to solve?"}, {"time": 10117, "text": "Are you working forward from a technology and I'm looking for a solution?"}, {"time": 10119, "text": "And I think that's where it's a kind of a bi directional search oftentimes, but you got the two have to meet."}, {"time": 10125, "text": "And that's where humanoid robots is kind of close to that."}, {"time": 10129, "text": "And that like it is a decision about a form factor and a technology that it forces that doesn't have a clear justification on why that's the killer app for, you know, from the other end."}, {"time": 10140, "text": "But I think the core fascinating idea with the Tesla bot is the one that's carried by Waymo as well, is when you're solving the general robotics problem of perception control where there's the very clear applications of driving."}, {"time": 10154, "text": "It's as you get better and better at it when you have like Waymo driver."}, {"time": 10159, "text": "Yeah, the whole world starts to kind of start to look like a robotics problem."}, {"time": 10164, "text": "So it's very interesting for now."}, {"time": 10166, "text": "Detection, classification, segmentation, tracking, planning, like it's."}, {"time": 10171, "text": "So there's no reason."}, {"time": 10171, "text": "I mean, I'm not I'm not speaking for Waymo here, but, you know, moving goods."}, {"time": 10180, "text": "There's no reason transformer like this thing couldn't, you know, take the goods up an elevator, you know, like that, like slowly expand what it means to move goods and expand more and more of the world into a robotics problem."}, {"time": 10199, "text": "And you start to like think of it as an end end robotics problem from like loading from, you know, from everything else."}, {"time": 10205, "text": "And even like the truck itself, you know, today's generation is integrating into today's understanding of what a vehicle is, right?"}, {"time": 10213, "text": "The Pacifica Jaguar, the Freightliners from Daimler."}, {"time": 10217, "text": "There's nothing that stops these us from like down the road after like starting to get to scale to like expand these partnerships to really rethink what would the next generation of a truck look like that is actually optimized for autonomy, not for today's world."}, {"time": 10234, "text": "And maybe that means a very different type of trailer."}, {"time": 10237, "text": "Maybe that like there's a lot of things you could rethink on that front, which is on its own very, very exciting."}, {"time": 10242, "text": "Let me ask you, like I said, you went to the Mecca of robotics, which is CMU, Carnegie Mellon University."}, {"time": 10248, "text": "You got a PhD there."}, {"time": 10248, "text": "So maybe by way of advice and maybe by way of story and memories, what does it take to get a PhD in robotics at CMU?"}, {"time": 10263, "text": "And maybe you can throw in there some advice for people who are thinking about doing work in artificial intelligence and robotics and are thinking about whether to get a PhD."}, {"time": 10275, "text": "I actually went, I was at CMU for undergrad as well and didn't know anything about robotics coming in and was doing electrical computer engineering, computer science, and really got more and more into kind of AI and then fell in love with autonomous driving."}, {"time": 10288, "text": "And at that point, that was just by a big margin, such an incredible central spot of investment in that area."}, {"time": 10296, "text": "And so what I would say is that robotics, for all the progress that's happened, is still a really young field."}, {"time": 10301, "text": "There's a huge amount of opportunity."}, {"time": 10301, "text": "Now that opportunity shifted where something like autonomous driving has moved from being very research and academics driven to being commercial driven where you see the investments happening in commercial."}, {"time": 10313, "text": "Now there's other areas that are much younger and you see like kind of grasping and manipulation, making kind of the same sort of journey that like autonomy made and there's other areas as well."}, {"time": 10323, "text": "What I would say is the space moves very quickly."}, {"time": 10323, "text": "Anything you do a PhD in, like it is in most areas, will evolve and change as technology changes and constraints change and hardware changes and the world changes."}, {"time": 10335, "text": "And so the beautiful thing about robotics is it's super broad."}, {"time": 10335, "text": "It's not a narrow space at all and it could be a million different things in a million different industries."}, {"time": 10344, "text": "And so it's a great opportunity to come in and get a broad foundation on AI, machine learning, computer vision, systems, hardware, sensors, all these separate things."}, {"time": 10354, "text": "You do need to go deep and find something that you're really, really passionate about."}, {"time": 10354, "text": "Obviously, just like any PhD, this is like a five, six year kind of endeavor."}, {"time": 10366, "text": "And you have to love it enough to go super deep to learn all the things necessary to be super deeply functioning in that area and then contribute to it in a way that hasn't been done before."}, {"time": 10377, "text": "And in robotics, that probably means more breadth because robotics is rarely kind of like one particular kind of narrow technology."}, {"time": 10385, "text": "And it means being able to collaborate with teams where like one of the coolest aspects of like the experience that I kind of cherish in our PhD is that we actually had a pretty large AV project that for that time was like a pretty serious initiative where you got to like partner with a larger team."}, {"time": 10403, "text": "And you had the experts in perception and the experts in planning and the staff and the mechanical engineers."}, {"time": 10408, "text": "So I was working on a project called UPI back then, which was basically the off road version of the DARPA challenge."}, {"time": 10415, "text": "It was a DARPA funded project for basically like a large off road vehicle that you would like drop and then give it a waypoint 10 kilometers away and it would have to navigate a completely unstructured environment."}, {"time": 10424, "text": "In an off road environment."}, {"time": 10425, "text": "So like forests, ditches, rocks, vegetation, and so it was like a really, really interesting kind of a hard problem where like wheels would be off to my shoulders."}, {"time": 10425, "text": "It's like gigantic, right?"}, {"time": 10434, "text": "By the way, AV for people stands for autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 10436, "text": "Autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 10439, "text": "And so what I think is like the beauty of robotics, but also kind of like the expectation is that there's spaces in computer science where you can be very, very narrow and deep."}, {"time": 10449, "text": "Robotics, the necessity, but also the beauty of it is that it forces you to be excited about that breadth and that partnership across different disciplines that enable it."}, {"time": 10458, "text": "But that also opens up so many more doors where you can go and you can do robotics and almost any category where robotics isn't really an industry."}, {"time": 10467, "text": "It's like AI, right?"}, {"time": 10469, "text": "It's like the application of physical automation to all these other worlds."}, {"time": 10469, "text": "And so you can do robotic surgery, you can do vehicles, you can do factory automation, you can do health care, you can do like leverage the AI around the sensing to think about static sensors and scene understanding."}, {"time": 10487, "text": "So I think that's got to be the expectation and the excitement and it breeds people that are probably a little bit more collaborative and more excited about working in teams."}, {"time": 10498, "text": "If I could briefly comment on the fact that the robotics people I've met in my life from CMU and MIT, they're really happy people."}, {"time": 10510, "text": "Because I think it's the collaborative thing."}, {"time": 10513, "text": "I think I think you don't."}, {"time": 10516, "text": "You're not like sitting in like the fourth basement."}, {"time": 10519, "text": "Which when you're doing machine learning purely software, it's very tempting to just disappear into your own hole and never collaborate."}, {"time": 10529, "text": "And that breeds a little bit more of the silo mentality of like, I have a problem."}, {"time": 10536, "text": "It's almost like negative to talk to somebody else or something like that."}, {"time": 10539, "text": "But robotics folks are just very collaborative, very friendly."}, {"time": 10539, "text": "And there's also an energy of like you get to confront the physics of reality often, which is humbling and also exciting."}, {"time": 10553, "text": "So it's humbling when it fails and exciting when it finally works."}, {"time": 10557, "text": "It's like a purity of the passion."}, {"time": 10558, "text": "And you've got to remember that like right now, like robotics and AI is like just all the rage and autonomous vehicles and all this, like 15 years ago and 20 years ago, like it wasn't that deeply lucrative."}, {"time": 10571, "text": "People that went into robotics, they did it because they were like thought it was just the coolest thing in the world to like make physical things intelligent in the real world."}, {"time": 10578, "text": "And so there's like a raw passion where they went into it for the right reasons and so forth."}, {"time": 10582, "text": "And so it's really great space."}, {"time": 10582, "text": "And that organizational challenge, by the way, like when you think about the challenges in AV, we talk a lot about the technical

at the data."}, {"time": 701, "text": "And data doesn't lie, right?"}, {"time": 705, "text": "I mean, there's metrics, there's data can obscure the key insight if you're not careful."}, {"time": 714,

create something that doesn't obviously exist yet."}, {"time": 727, "text": "So, you know, measuring maybe why you left the app or measuring special moments of happiness that will make sure you return to the app or moments of happiness that are long lasting versus like dopamine short term, all of those things."}, {"time": 746, "text": "But I think I suppose in the beginning, you can just get away with just asking the question, which features are used a lot?"}, {"time": 755, "text": "Let's do more of that."}, {"time": 757, "text": "And how hard was the decision?"}, {"time": 760, "text": "And I

770, "text": "Like at whatever point Instagram became this feed of photos, that's quite brilliant."}, {"time": 778, "text": "Plus, I also don't know when this happened, but they're all shaped the same."}, {"time": 786, "text": "I have to tell you why, that's the interesting part."}, {"time": 790, "text": "So a couple of things."}, {"time": 791, "text": "One is data, like you're right."},

plane."}, {"time": 812, "text": "So don't stare at one metric."}, {"time": 813, "text": "Like it turns out you have to synthesize a bunch of metrics to know where to go."}, {"time": 817, "text": "But

people have trouble explaining how they actually feel."}, {"time": 842, "text": "So just, it's about synthesizing both of them."}, {"time": 845, "text": "So then Instagram, right?"}, {"time": 847, "text": "We were talking about revolutionary moment where the feed became square photos basically."}, {"time": 854, "text": "And photos first and then square photos."}, {"time": 859, "text": "It was clear to me that the biggest, so I believe the biggest companies are founded when enormous technical shifts happen."}, {"time": 870, "text": "And the biggest technical shift that happened right before

that almost had, like it wasn't that good."}, {"time": 884, "text": "But compared to everything else at the time, it was amazing."}, {"time": 888, "text": "And by the way, the first phone that had an incredible camera that could like do as well as the point and shoot you might carry around was the iPhone 4."}, {"time": 901, "text": "And that was right when Instagram launched."}, {"time": 902, "text": "And we looked around and we said, what will change?"}, {"time": 905, "text": "Because everyone has a camera in their pocket."}, {"time": 908, "text": "And it was so clear to me that the world

things."}, {"time": 945, "text": "So we wrote down those things, we circled photos and we said, I think we should invest in this."}, {"time": 950, "text": "But then we said, what sucks about photos?"}, {"time": 952, "text": "One, they look like crap, right?"}, {"time": 955, "text": "They just, at least back then."}, {"time": 957, "text": "Now my phone takes pretty great photos, right?"}, {"time": 961, "text": "Back then they were blurry, not so great, compressed, right?"}, {"time": 966, "text": "Two, it was really slow, like really slow to upload a photo."}, {"time": 972, "text": "And I'll tell a fun story about that and explain to you why they're all the same size and square as well."}, {"time": 978, "text": "And three, man, if you wanted to share a photo on different networks, you had to go to each of the individual apps and select all of them and upload individually."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And so we were like, all right, those are the pain points."}, {"time": 990, "text": "We're gonna focus on that."}, {"time": 991, "text": "So one, instead of, because they weren't beautiful, we were like, why don't we lean into the fact that they're not beautiful?"}, {"time":

cameras."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "I think they're produced in China at the time."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And I wanna say the original ones were like from the 70s or the 80s or something."},

and they kind of like light leaked into the side."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "And there was this whole resurgence where people looked at that and said, oh my God, this is a style, right?"}, {"time": 1036, "text": "And I remember using that in Florence and just saying, well, why don't we just like lean into the fact that these photos suck and make them suck more, but in an artistic way."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "And it turns out that had product market fit."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "People really liked that."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "They were willing to share their not so great photos if they looked not so great on purpose, okay?"}, {"time": 1055, "text": "The second part."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "That's where the filters come into picture."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "So computational modification of photos to make them look extra crappy to where it becomes art."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "And I mean, add light leaks, add like an overlay filter, make them more contrasty than they should be."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "The first filter we ever produced was called X Pro 2."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "And I designed it while I was in this small little bed and

like a week to reset."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "And that was on that trip worked on the first filter because I said, you know, I think I can do this."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And I literally

just shifted them slightly."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "It was in rocket science."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "And it turns out that actually made your photo look pretty cool."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "It just mapped from one color space to another color space."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "It was simple, but it was really slow."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "I mean, if you applied a filter, I think it used to take two or three seconds to render."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "Only eventually would I figure out how to do it on the GPU."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "And I'm not even sure it was a GPU, but it was using OpenGL."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "But anyway, I would eventually figure that out and then it would be instant, but it used to be really slow."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "By the way, anyone who's watching or listening, it's amazing what you can get away with in a startup as long as the product outcome is right for the user."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "Like you can be slow."},

question is just about compressing, making it more performant over time so that they get that product market fit instantly."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "So fascinating because there's some things where those three seconds would make or break the app, but some things you're saying not."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "It's hard to know when, it's the problem Spotify solved for making streaming like work."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "And like delays in listening to music is a huge negative, even like slight delays."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "But here you're saying, I mean, how do you know when those three seconds are okay or are you just gonna have to try it out?"}, {"time": 1203, "text": "Because to me, my intuition would be those three seconds would kill the app."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "Like I would try to do the OpenGL thing."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "Right, so I wish I were that smart at the time."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "I wasn't, I just knew how to do what I knew how to do."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "And I decided, okay, like, why don't I just iterate over the values and change them?"}, {"time": 1227, "text": "And what's interesting is that compared to the alternatives, no one else used OpenGL."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "So everyone else was doing it the dumb way."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And in fact, they were doing it at a high resolution."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "Now comes in the small resolution that we'll talk about in a second."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "By choosing 512 pixels by 512 pixels, which I believe it was at the time, we iterated over a lot fewer pixels than our competitors who were trying to do these enormous output like images."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "So instead of taking 20 seconds, I mean, three seconds feels pretty good, right?"}, {"time": 1263, "text": "So on a relative basis, we were winning like a lot."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "Okay, so that's answer number one."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "Answer number two is we actually focused on latency in the right places."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So we did this really wonderful thing when you uploaded."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "So the way it would work is you'd take your phone, you'd take the photo and then you'd go to the, you'd go to the edit screen where you would caption it."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "And on that caption screen, you'd start typing and you'd think, okay, like what's a clever caption?"}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And I said to Mike, hey, when I worked on the Gmail team, you know what they did?"}, {"time": 1297, "text": "When you typed in your username or your email address, even before you've entered in your password, like the probability once you enter in your username that you're going to actually sign in is extremely high."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "So why not just start loading your account in the background?"}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Not like sending it down to the desktop, that would be a security issue, but like loaded into memory on the server, like get it ready, prepare it."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "I always thought that was so fascinating and unintuitive."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "And I was like, Mike, why don't we just do that?"}, {"time": 1328, "text": "But like, we'll just upload the photo and like assume you're going to upload the photo."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "And if you don't, forget about it, we'll delete it, right?"}, {"time": 1337, "text": "So what ended up happening was people would caption their photo, they'd press done or upload and you'd see this little progress bar just go foop."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "It was lightning fast, okay?"}, {"time": 1350, "text": "We were no faster than anyone else at the time, but by choosing 512 by 512 and doing it in the background, it almost guaranteed that it was done by the time you captioned."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "And everyone when they used it was like, how the hell is this thing so fast?"}, {"time": 1367, "text": "But we were slow, we just hid the slowness."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "It wasn't like, these things are just like, it's a shell game, you're just hiding the latency."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "That mattered to people like a lot."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "And I think that, so you were willing to put up with a slow filter if it meant you could share it immediately."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "And of course we added sharing options which let you distribute it really quickly, that was the third part."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "So latency matters, but relative to what?"}, {"time": 1394, "text": "And then there's some like tricks, you get around to just hiding the latency."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Like I don't know if Spotify starts downloading the next song eagerly, I'm assuming they do."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "There are a bunch of ideas here that are not rocket science that really help."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And all of that was stuff you were explicitly having a discussion about, like those designs and you were having like arguments, discussions."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "I'm not sure it was arguments, I mean, I'm not sure if you've met my co founder Mike, but he's a pretty nice guy and he's very reasonable."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "And we both just saw eye to eye and we're like, yeah, it's like, make this fast or at least seem fast, it'll be great."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "Honestly, I think the most contentious thing and he would say this too initially, was I was on an iPhone 3G, so like the not so fast one."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "And he had a brand new iPhone 4, that was cheap."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And his feed loaded super smoothly, like when he would scroll from photo to photo, buttery smooth, right?"}, {"time": 1460, "text": "But on my phone, every time you got to a new photo, it was like, kachunk, kachunk, allocate memory, like all this stuff, right?"}, {"time": 1467, "text": "I was like, Mike, that's unacceptable."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "He's like, oh, come on, man, just like upgrade your phone."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "Basically, he didn't actually say that, he was nicer than that."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "But I could tell he wished like, I would just stop being cheap and just get a new phone."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "But what's funny is we actually sat there working on that little detail for a few days before launch."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And that polished experience, plus the fact that uploading seemed fast for all these people who didn't have nice phones, I think meant a lot because far too often, you see teams focus not on performance, they focus on what's the cool computer science problem they can solve, right?"}, {"time": 1505, "text": "Can we scale this thing to a billion users and they've got like a hundred, right?"}, {"time": 1512, "text": "You talked about loss function, so I want to come back to that."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "Like the loss function is like, do you provide a great, happy, magical, whatever experience for the consumer?"}, {"time": 1523, "text": "And listen, if it happens to involve something complex and technical, then great."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "But it turns out, I think most of the time, those experiences are just sitting there waiting to be built with like not that complex solutions."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "But everyone is just like so stuck in their own head that they have to overengineer everything and then they forget about the easy stuff."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "I mean, also, maybe to flip the loss function there is, you're trying to minimize the number of times there's unpleasant experience, right?"}, {"time": 1554, "text": "Like the one you mentioned where when you go to the next photo, it freezes for a little bit."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "So it's almost, as opposed to maximizing pleasure, it's probably easier to minimize the number of like, the friction."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "And as we all know, you just make the pleasure negative and then minimize everything, so."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "We're mapping this all back to neural networks."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "But actually, can I say one thing on that, which is I don't know a lot about machine learning, but I feel like I've tried studying a bunch."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "That whole idea of reinforcement learning and planning out more than the greedy single experience, I think is the closest you can get to like ideal product design thinking, where you're not saying, hey, like, can we have a great experience just this one time?"}, {"time": 1603, "text": "But like, what is the right way to onboard someone?"}, {"time": 1606, "text": "What series of experiences correlate most with them hanging on long term, right?"}, {"time": 1612, "text": "So not just saying, oh, did the photo load slowly a couple of times, or did they get a great photo at the top of their feed?"}, {"time": 1620, "text": "But like, what are the things that are gonna make this person come back over the next week, over the next month?"}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And as a product designer asking yourself, okay, I wanna optimize, not just minimize bad experiences in the short run, but like, how do I get someone to engage over the next month?"}, {"time": 1637, "text": "And I'm not gonna claim at all that I thought that way at all at the time, because I certainly didn't."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "But if I were going back and giving myself any advice, it would be thinking, what are those second order effects that you can create?"}, {"time": 1650, "text": "And it turns out having your friends on the service is an enormous win."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "So starting with a very small group of people that produce content that you wanted to see, which we did, we seeded the community very well, I think."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "Ended up mattering, and so."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Yeah, you said that community is one of the most important things."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "So it's from a metrics perspective, from maybe a philosophy perspective, building a certain kind of community within the app."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "See, I wasn't sure what exactly you meant by that when I first heard you say that."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "Maybe you can elaborate, but as I understand now, it can literally mean get your friends onto the app."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "Yeah, think of it this way."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "You can build an amazing restaurant or bar or whatever, right, but if you show up and you're the only one there, is it like, does it matter how good the food is?"}, {"time": 1704, "text": "The drinks, whatever?"}, {"time": 1705, "text": "No, these are inherently social experiences that we were working on."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "So the idea of having people there, like you needed to have that, otherwise it was just a filter out."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "But by the way, part of the genius, I'm gonna say genius, even though it wasn't really genius, was starting to be marauding as a filter app was awesome."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "The fact that you could, so we talk about single player mode a lot, which is like, can you play the game alone?"}, {"time": 1736, "text": "And Instagram, you could totally play alone."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "You could filter your photos, and a lot of people would tell me, I didn't even realize that this thing was a social network until my friend showed up."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "It totally worked as a single player game."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "And then when your friends showed up, all of a sudden it was like, oh, not only was this great alone, but now I actually have this trove of photos that people can look at and start liking, and then I can like theirs."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "And so it was this bootstrap method of how do you make the thing not suck when the restaurant is empty?"}, {"time": 1767, "text": "Yeah, but the thing is, when you say friends, we're not necessarily referring to friends in the physical space."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "So you're not bringing your physical friends with you."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "You're also making new friends."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "So you're finding new community."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "So it's not immediately obvious to me that it's almost like building any kind of community."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "And what we learned very early on was what made Instagram special and the reason why you would sign up for it versus say, just sit on Facebook and look at your friends photos."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "Of course we were live, and of course it was interesting to see what your friends were doing now."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "But the fact that you could connect with people who like took really beautiful photos in a certain style all around the world, whether they were travelers, it was the beginning of the influencer economy."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "It was these people who became professional Instagrammers way back when."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "But they took these amazing photos and some of them were photographers professionally."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And all of a sudden you had this moment in the day when you could open up this app and sure you could see what your friends were doing, but also it was like, oh my God, that's a beautiful waterfall or oh my God, I didn't realize there was that corner of England or like really cool stuff."}, {"time": 1838, "text": "And the beauty about Instagram early on was that it was international by default."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "You didn't have to speak English to use it, right?"}, {"time": 1846, "text": "You could just look at the photos, works great."}, {"time": 1849, "text": "We did translate, we had some pretty bad translations, but we did translate the app."}, {"time": 1854, "text": "And even if our translations were pretty poor, the idea that you could just connect with other people through their images was pretty powerful."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "So how much technical difficulties there with the programming?"}, {"time": 1867, "text": "Like what programming language you were talking about?"}, {"time": 1869, "text": "What was?"}, {"time": 1869, "text": "Zero, like maybe it was hard for us, but I mean, there was nothing."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "The only thing that was complex about Instagram at the beginning technically was making it scale."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "We were just plain old Objective C for the client."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "So it was iPhone only at first?"}, {"time": 1889, "text": "iPhone only, yep."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "As an Android person, I'm deeply offended, but go ahead."}, {"time": 1894,

"text": "But anyway, back to that moment, it was Objective C and then we were Python based, which is just like, this is before Python was really cool."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "Like now it's cool because it's all these machine learning libraries like support Python and right."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "Now it's super, now it's like cool to be Python."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "Back then it was like, oh, Google uses Python."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "Like maybe you should use Python."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "Facebook was PHP."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "Like I had worked at a small startup of some ex Googlers that used Python."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "So we used it and we used a framework called Django, still exists and people use for basically the backend."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "And then you threw a couple interesting things in there."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "I mean, we used Postgres, which was kind of fun."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "It was a little bit like Hipster database at the time, right?"}, {"time": 1954, "text": "Versus MySQL."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "MySQL, like everyone used MySQL."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "So like using Postgres was like an interesting decision."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "But we used it because it had a bunch of geo features built in because we thought we were gonna be a check and app, remember?"}, {"time": 1967, "text": "It's also super cool now."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "So you were into Python before it was cool and you were into Postgres before it was cool."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "Yeah, we were basically like, not only Hipster photo company, Hipster tech company, right?"}, {"time": 1980, "text": "We also adopted Redis early and like loved it."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "I mean, it solves so many problems for us and turns out that's still pretty cool."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "But the programming was very easy."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "It was like, sign up a user, have a feed."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "There was nothing, no machine learning at all, zero."}, {"time": 1997, "text": "Can you get some context?"}, {"time": 1998, "text": "How many users at each of these stages?"}, {"time": 2000, "text": "Are we talking about a hundred users, a thousand users?"}, {"time": 2004, "text": "So the stage I just described, I mean that technical stack lasted through probably 50 million users."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "I mean, seriously, like you can get away with a lot with a pretty basic stack."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "Like I think a lot of startups try to overengineer their solutions from the beginning to like really scale and you can get away with a lot."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "That being said, most of the first two years of Instagram was literally just trying to make that stack scale."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And it wasn't, it was not a Python problem."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "It was like literally just like, where do we put the data?"}, {"time": 2038, "text": "Like it's all coming in too fast."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "Like how do we store it?"}, {"time": 2041, "text": "How do we make sure to be up?"}, {"time": 2042, "text": "How do we like, how do we make sure we're on the right size boxes that they have enough memory?"}, {"time": 2049, "text": "Those were the issues, but."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "Can you speak to the choices you make at that stage when you're growing so quickly?"}, {"time": 2056, "text": "Do you use something like somebody else's computer infrastructure or do you build in house?"}, {"time": 2062, "text": "I'm only laughing because we, when we launched we had a single computer that we had rented in some color space in LA."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "I don't even remember what it was called."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "Cause I thought that's what you did."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "When I worked at a company called Odio that became Twitter."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "I remember visiting our space in San Francisco."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "You walked in, you had to wear the ear things."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "It was cold and fans everywhere, right?"}, {"time": 2086, "text": "And we had to, you know, plug one out, replace one."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "And I was the intern, so I just like held things."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "But I thought to myself, oh, this is how it goes."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "And then I remember being in a VC's office."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "I think it was a benchmarks office."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "And I think we ran into another entrepreneur and they were like, oh, how are things going?"}, {"time": 2103, "text": "We're like, ah, you know, try to scale this thing."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "And they were like, well, I mean can't you just add more instances?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "And I was like, what do you mean?"}, {"time": 2111, "text": "And they're like instances on Amazon."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "I was like, what are those?"}, {"time": 2115, "text": "And it was this moment where we realized how deep in it we were because we had no idea that AWS existed nor should we be using it."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "Anyway, that night we went back to the office and we got on AWS, but we did this really dumb thing."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "We're so sorry to people listening."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "But we brought up an instance, which was our database."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "It's gonna be a replacement for our database."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "But we had it talking over the public internet to our little box in LA that was our app server."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "That's how sophisticated we were."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "And obviously that was very, very slow."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "Didn't work at all."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "I mean, it worked, but didn't work."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "Only like later that night did we realize we had to have it all together."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "But at least like if you're listening right now and you're thinking, you know, I have no chance."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "I'm gonna start to start, but I have no chance."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "We did it and we made a bunch of really dumb mistakes initially."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "I think the question is how quickly do you learn that you're making a mistake?"}, {"time": 2173, "text": "And do you do the right thing immediately right after?"}, {"time": 2176, "text": "So you didn't pay for those mistakes by failure."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "So yeah, how quickly did you fix it?"}, {"time": 2183, "text": "I guess there's a lot of ways to sneak up to this question of how the hell do you scale the thing?"}, {"time": 2188, "text": "Other startups, if you have an idea, how do you scale the thing?"}, {"time": 2191, "text": "Is it just AWS and you try to write the kind of code that's easy to spread across a large number of instances, and then the rest is just put money into it?"}, {"time": 2205, "text": "Basically, I would say a couple of things."}, {"time": 2208, "text": "First off, don't even ask the question, just find product market fit, duct tape it together, right?"}, {"time": 2215, "text": "Like if you have to."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "I think there's a big caveat here, which I want to get to, but generally all that matters is product market fit."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "If people like your product, do not worry about when 50,000 people use your product because you will be happy that you have that problem when you get there."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "I actually can't name many startups where they go from nothing to something overnight and they can't figure out how to scale it."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "There are some, but I think nowadays, it's a, when I say a solved problem, like there are ways of solving it."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "The base case is typically that startups worry way too much about scaling way too early and forget that they actually have to make something that people like."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "That's the default mistake case."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "But what I'll say is once you start scaling, I mean, hiring quickly, people who have seen the game before and just know how to do it, it becomes a bit of like, yeah, just throw instances of the problem, right?"}, {"time": 2279, "text": "But the last thing I'll say on this that I think did save us, we were pretty rigorous about writing tests from the beginning."}, {"time": 2288, "text": "That helped us move very, very quickly when we wanted to rewrite parts of the product and know that we weren't breaking something else."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "Tests are one of those things where it's like, you go slow to go fast."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And they suck when you have to write them because you have to figure it out."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "And there are always those ones that break when you don't want them to break and they're annoying and it feels like you spent all this time."}, {"time": 2310, "text": "But looking back, I think that like longterm optimal, even with a team of four, it allowed us to move very, very quickly because anyone could touch any part of the product and know that they weren't gonna bring down the site, or at least in general."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "At which point do you know product market fit?"}, {"time": 2328, "text": "How many users would you say?"}, {"time": 2330, "text": "Is it all it takes is like 10 people?"}, {"time": 2332, "text": "Or is it a thousand?"}, {"time": 2333, "text": "Is it 50,000?"}, {"time": 2335, "text": "I don't think it is generally a question of absolute numbers."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "I think it's a question of cohorts and I think it's a question of trends."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "So, you know, it depends how big your business is trying to be, right?"}, {"time": 2374, "text": "I don't think it's an absolute number."}, {"time": 2376, "text": "I think it is, I guess you could call it a marginal number."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "So I spent a lot of time when I work with startups asking them like, okay, have you looked at that cohort versus this cohort, whether it's your clients or whether it's people signing up for the service?"}, {"time": 2392, "text": "But a lot of people think you just have to hit some mark, like 10,000 people or 50,000 people, but really seven ish billion people in the world."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "Most people forever will not know about your product."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "There are always more people out there to sign up."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "It's just a question of how you turn on the spigot, so."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "At that stage, early stage yourself, but also by way of advice, should you worry about money at all?"}, {"time": 2418, "text": "How this thing's gonna make money?"}, {"time": 2420, "text": "Or do you just try to find product market fit and get a lot of users to enjoy using your thing?"}, {"time": 2428, "text": "I think it totally depends."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "And that's an unsatisfying answer."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "I was talking with a friend today who, he was one of our earlier investors and he was saying, hey, like, have you been doing any angel investing lately?"}, {"time": 2441, "text": "I said, not really."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "I'm just like focused on what I wanna do next."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "And he said, the number of financings have just gone bonkers."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "Like people are throwing money everywhere right now."}, {"time": 2456, "text": "And I think the question is, do you have an inkling of how you're gonna make money?"}, {"time": 2464, "text": "Or are you really just like waving your hands?"}, {"time": 2467, "text": "I would not like to be an entrepreneur in the position of, well, I have no idea how this will eventually make money."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "That's not fun."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "If you are in an area, like let's say you wanted to start a social network, right?"}, {"time": 2482, "text": "Not saying this is a good idea, but if you did, there are only a handful of ways they've made money and really only one way they've made money in the past and that's ads."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "So, if you have a service that's amenable to that and then I wouldn't worry too much about that because if you get to the scale, you can hire some smart people and figure that out."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "I do think that is really healthy for a lot of startups these days, especially the ones doing like enterprise software, slacks of the world, et cetera, to be worried about money from the beginning, but mostly as a way of winning over clients and having stickiness."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "Of course you need to be worried about money, but I'm gonna also say this again, which is it's like longterm profitability."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "If you have a roadmap to that, then that's great."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "But if you're just like, I don't know, maybe never, like we're working on this metaverse thing, I think maybe someday, I don't know."}, {"time": 2542, "text": "Like that seems harder to me."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "So you have to be as big as Facebook to like finance that bet, right?"}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Do you think it's possible, you said, you're not saying it's necessarily a good idea to launch a social network."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "Do you think it's possible today, maybe you can put yourself in those shoes, to launch a social network that achieves the scale of a Facebook or a Twitter or an Instagram, and maybe even greater scale?"}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Yeah, if I knew, I'd probably be doing it right now and not sitting here."}, {"time": 2580, "text": "So, I mean, there's a lot of ways to ask this question."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "One is create a totally new product market fit, create a new market, create something like Instagram did, which is like create something kind of new, or literally out compete Facebook at its own thing, or I'll compete Twitter at its own thing."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "The only way to compete now, if you wanna build a large social network is to look for the cracks, look for the openings."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "No one competed, I mean, no one competed with the core business of Google."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "No one competed with the core business of Microsoft."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "You don't go at the big guys doing exactly what they're doing."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "Instagram didn't win, quote unquote, because it tried to be a visual Twitter."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "Like we spotted things that either Twitter wasn't going to do or refuse to do, images and feed for the longest time, right?"}, {"time": 2635, "text": "Or that Facebook wasn't doing or not paying attention to because they were mostly desktop at the time and we were purely mobile, purely visual."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "Often there are opportunities sitting there."}, {"time": 2647, "text": "You have to figure out like, I think like there's a strategy book, I can't remember the name, but talk about moats and just like the best place to play is where your competitor literally can't pivot because structurally they're set up not to be there."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "And that's where you win."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "And what's fascinating is like, do you know how many people were like, images, Facebook does that, Twitter does that."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "I mean, how wrong were they, really wrong?"}, {"time": 2677, "text": "And these are some of the smartest people in Silicon Valley, right?"}, {"time": 2680, "text": "But now Instagram exists for a while."}, {"time": 2682, "text": "How is it that Snapchat could then exist?"}, {"time": 2687, "text": "Like plenty of people would say, well, there's Facebook, no images."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "Okay, okay, Instagram, I'll give you that one."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "But wait, now another image based social network is gonna get really big."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "And then TikTok comes along."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "Like the prior, so you asked me, is it possible?"}, {"time": 2703, "text": "The only reason I'm answering yes is because my prior is that it's happened once every, I don't know, three, four or five years consistently."}, {"time": 2713, "text": "And I can't imagine there's anything structurally that would change that."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "So that's why I answer that way."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "Not because I know how, I just, when you see a pattern, you see a pattern and there's no reason to believe that's gonna stop."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "And it's subtle too, because like you said, Snapchat and TikTok, they're all doing the same space of things, but there's something fundamentally different about like a three second video and a five second video and a 15 second video and a one minute video and a one hour video, like fundamentally different."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "Fundamentally different."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "I mean, I think one of the reasons Snapchat exists is because Instagram was so focused on posting great, beautiful manicured versions of yourself throughout time."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "And there was this enormous demand of like, hey, I really like this behavior."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "I love using Instagram, but man, I just like wish I could share something going on in my day."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "Do I really have to put it on my profile?"}, {"time": 2770, "text": "Do I really have to make it last forever?"}, {"time": 2771, "text": "Do I really, and that opened up a door, it created a market, right?"}, {"time": 2776, "text": "And then what's fascinating is Instagram had an explore page for the longest time and it was image driven, right?"}, {"time": 2783, "text": "But there's absolutely a behavior where you open up Instagram and you sit on the explore page all day."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "That is effectively TikTok, but obviously focused on videos."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "And it's not like you could just put the explore page in TikTok form and it works."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "It had to be video, it had to have music."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "These are the hard parts about product development that are very hard to predict, but they're all versions of the same thing with varying, like if you line them up in a bunch of dimensions, they're just like kind of on, they're different values of the same dimensions, which is like, I guess, easy to say in retrospect."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "But like, if I were an entrepreneur going after that area, I'd ask myself like, where's the opening?"}, {"time": 2825, "text": "What needs to exist because TikTok exists now?"}, {"time": 2828, "text": "So I wonder how much things that don't yet exist and can exist is in the space of algorithms, in the space of recommender systems."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "So in the space of how the feed is generated."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "So we kind of talk about the actual elements of the content, that's what we've been talking, the difference between photos, between short videos, longer videos."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "I wonder how much disruption is possible in the way the algorithms work."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "Because a lot of the criticism towards social media is in the way the algorithms work currently."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "And it feels like, first of all, talking about product market fit, there's certainly a hunger for social media algorithms that do something different."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "I don't think anyone, everyone said complaining, this is hurting me and this is hurting society, but I keep doing it because I'm addicted to it."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "And they say, we want something different, but we don't know what."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "It feels like just different."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "It feels like there's a hunger for that, but that's in the space of algorithms."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "I wonder if it's possible to disrupt in that space."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "Absolutely, I have this thesis that the worst part about social networks is that they're, is the people."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "It's a line that sounds funny, right?"}, {"time": 2916, "text": "Because like, that's why you call it a social network."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "But what does social networks actually do for you?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "Like just think, like imagine you were an alien and you landed and someone says, hey, there's this site, it's a social network."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "We're not gonna tell you what it is, but just what does it do?"}, {"time": 2931, "text": "And you have to explain it to them."}, {"time": 2933, "text": "It does two things."}, {"time": 2934, "text": "One is that people you know and have social ties with distribute updates through whether it's photos or videos about their lives so that you don't have to physically be with them, but you can keep in touch with them."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "That's one, that's like a big part of Instagram."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "That's a big part of Snap."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "It is not part of TikTok at all."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "So there's another big part, which is there's all this content out in the world that's entertaining, whether you wanna watch it or you wanna read it."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "And matchmaking between content that exists in the world and people that want that content turns out to be like a really big business, right?"}, {"time": 2975, "text": "Search and discovery, which you?"}, {"time": 2977, "text": "Search and discovery, but my point is it could be video, it could be text, it could be websites, it could be, I mean, think back to like dig, right?"}, {"time": 2986, "text": "Or stumble upon or, right?"}, {"time": 2990, "text": "But like, what did those do?"}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Like they basically distributed interesting content to you, right?"}, {"time": 2997, "text": "I think the most interesting part or the future of social networks is going to be making them less social because I think people are part of the root cause of the problem."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "So for instance, often in recommender systems, we talk about two stages."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "There's a candidate generation step, which is just like of our vast trove of stuff that you might wanna see, what small subset should we pick for you, okay?"}, {"time": 3024, "text": "Typically that is grabbed from things your friends have shared, right?"}, {"time": 3028, "text": "Then there's a ranking step which says, okay, now given these 100, 200 things depends on the network, right?"}, {"time": 3034, "text": "Let's like be really good about ranking them and generally rank the things up higher that get the most engagement, right?"}, {"time": 3040, "text": "So what's the problem with that?"}, {"time": 3042, "text": "Step one is we've limited everything you could possibly see to things that your friends have chosen to share or maybe not friends, but influencers."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "What things do people generally want to share?"}, {"time": 3054, "text": "They wanna share things that are gonna get likes, that are gonna show up broadly."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "So they tend to be more emotionally driven."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "They tend to be more risque or whatever."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "So why do we have this problem?"}, {"time": 3065, "text": "It's because we show people things people have decided to share and those things self select to being the things that are most divisive."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "So how do you fix that?"}, {"time": 3075, "text": "Well, what if you just imagine for a second that why do you have to grab things from things your friends have shared?"}, {"time": 3083, "text": "Why not just like grab things?"}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And that's something I've been thinking a lot about."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "And just like, why is it that when you log onto Twitter, you're just sitting there looking at things from accounts that you've followed for whatever reason?"}, {"time": 3102, "text": "And TikTok I think has done a wonderful job here, which is like, you can literally be anyone."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "And if you produce something fascinating, it'll go viral."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "But like, you don't have to be someone that anyone knows."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "You don't have to have built up a giant following."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "You don't have to have paid for followers."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "You don't have to try to maintain those followers."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "You literally just have to produce something interesting."}, {"time": 3124, "text": "That is I think the future of social networking."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "That's the direction things will head."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And I think what you'll find is it's far less about people manipulating distribution and far more about what is like, is this content good?"}, {"time": 3139, "text": "And good is obviously a vague definition that we could spend hours on."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "But different networks I think will decide different value functions to decide what is good and what isn't good."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "And I think that's a fascinating direction."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "So that's almost like creating an internet."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "I mean, that's what Google did for web pages that did page rank search."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "So it's discovery, you don't follow anybody on Google when you use a search engine."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "You just discover web pages."}, {"time": 3166, "text": "And so what TikTok does is saying, let's start from scratch."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "Let's like start a new internet and have people discover stuff on that new internet within a particular kind of pool of people."}, {"time": 3179, "text": "But what's so fascinating about this is like the field of information retrieval."}, {"time": 3185, "text": "Like I always talked about as I was studying this stuff, it was used the word query and document."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "So I was like, why are they saying query and documents?"}, {"time": 3192, "text": "Like they're literally imagine, like if you just stop thinking about query as like literally a search query and a query could be a person."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "I mean, a lot of the way, I'm not gonna claim to know how Instagram or Facebook machine learning works today, but if you want to find a match for a query, the query is actually the attributes of the person, their age, their gender, where they're from, maybe some kind of summarization of their interests."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "And that's a query, right?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "And that matches against documents."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "And by the way, documents don't have to be texts."}, {"time": 3225, "text": "They can be videos, however long."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "I don't know what the limit is on TikTok these days."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "They keep changing it."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "My point is just, you've got a query, which is someone in search of something that they want to match and you've got the document and it doesn't have to be text."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "And how do you match make?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "And that's one of these like, I mean, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this and I don't claim to have mastered it at all, but I think it's so fascinating about where that will go with new social networks."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "See, what I'm also fascinated by is metrics that are different than engagement."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "So the other thing from an alien perspective, what social networks are doing is they, they in the short term, bring out different aspects of each human being."}, {"time": 3270, "text": "So first, let me say that an algorithm or a social network for each individual can bring out the best of that person or the worst of that person, or there's a bunch of different parts to us, parts we're proud of that we are, parts we're not so proud of."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "When we look at the big picture of our lives, when we look back 30 days from now, am I proud that I said those things or not?"}, {"time": 3297, "text": "Am I proud that I felt those things?"}, {"time": 3299, "text": "Am I proud that I experienced or read those things or thought about those things?"}, {"time": 3304, "text": "Just in that kind of self reflected kind of way."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "And so coupled with that, I wonder if it's possible to have different metrics that are not just about engagement, but are about long term happiness, growth of a human being, where they look back and say, I am a better human being for having spent 100 hours on that app."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "And that feels like it's actually strongly correlated with engagement in the long term."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "In the short term, it may not be, but in long term, it's like the same kind of thing where you really fall in love with the product."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "You fall in love with an iPhone, you fall in love with a car."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "That's what makes you fall in love is like really being proud and just in a self reflected way, understanding that you're a better human being for having used the thing."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "And that's what great relationships are made from."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "It's not just like you're hot and we like being together or something like that."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "It's more like I'm a better human being because I'm with you."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "And that feels like a metric that could be optimized for by the algorithms."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "But anytime I kind of talk about this with anybody, they seem to say, yeah, okay, that's going to get out competed immediately by the engagement if it's ad driven especially."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "I don't, I mean, a lot of it's just implementation."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "I'll say a couple of things."}, {"time": 3391, "text": "One is to pull back the curtain on daily meetings inside of these large social media companies."}, {"time": 3400, "text": "A lot of what management, or at least the people that are tweaking these algorithms spend their time on are trade offs."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "And there's these things called value functions, which are like, okay, we can predict the probability that you'll click on this thing or the probability that you'll share it, or the probability that you will leave a comment on it or the probability you'll dwell on it."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "Individual actions, right?"}, {"time": 3427, "text": "And you've got this neural network that basically has a bunch of heads at the end and all of them are between zero and one and great."}, {"time": 3434, "text": "They all have values, right?"}, {"time": 3435, "text": "Or they all have probabilities."}, {"time": 3439, "text": "And then in these meetings, what they will do is say, well, how much do we value a comment versus a click versus a share versus a, and then maybe even some downstream thing, right?"}, {"time": 3451, "text": "That has nothing to do with the item there, but like driving follows or something."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "And what typically happens is they will say, well, what are our goals for this quarter at the company?"}, {"time": 3462, "text": "Oh, we wanna drive sharing up, okay."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "Well, let's turn down these metrics and turn up these metrics."}, {"time": 3468, "text": "And they blend them right into a single scalar which they're trying to optimize."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "That is really hard because invariably you think you're solving for, I don't know, something called meaningful interactions, right?"}, {"time": 3482, "text": "This was the big Facebook pivot."}, {"time": 3484, "text": "And I don't actually have any internal knowledge."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "Like I wasn't in those meetings, but at least from what we've seen over the last month or so, it seems by actually trying to optimize for meaningful interactions, it had all these side effects of optimizing for these other things."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "And I don't claim to fully understand them, but what I will say is that trade offs abound."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "And as much as you'd like to solve for one thing, if you have a network of over a billion people, you're gonna have unintended consequences either way."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "And it gets really hard."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "So what you're describing is effectively a value model that says like, can we capture, this is the thing that I spent a lot of time thinking about, like, can you capture utility in a way that like actually measures someone's happiness that isn't just a, what do they call it?"}, {"time": 3536, "text": "A surrogate problem where you say, well, kind of think like the more you use the product, the happier you are."}, {"time": 3543, "text": "That was always the argument at Facebook, by the way."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "It was like, well, people use it more, so they must be more happy."}, {"time": 3549, "text": "Turns out there are like a lot of things you use more that make you less happy in the world."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "Not talking about Facebook, just let's think about whether it's gambling or whatever, like that you can do more of, but doesn't necessarily make you happier."}, {"time": 3560, "text": "So the idea that time equals happiness, obviously you can't map utility and time together easily."}, {"time": 3567, "text": "There are a lot of edge cases."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "So when you look around the world and you say, well, what are all the ways we can model utility?"}, {"time": 3572, "text": "That is like one of the, please, if you know someone smart doing this, introduce me because I'm fascinated by it."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "And it seems really tough."}, {"time": 3580, "text": "But the idea that reinforcement learning, like everyone interesting I know in machine learning, like I was really interested in recommender systems and supervised learning."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "And the more I dug into it, I was like, oh, literally everyone smart is working on reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "Like literally everyone."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "You just made people at OpenAI and DeepMind very happy, yes."}, {"time": 3600, "text": "But I mean, but what's interesting is like, it's one thing to train a game and like, I mean that paper where they just took Atari and they used a ConvNet to basically just like train simple actions, mind blowing, right?"}, {"time": 3615, "text": "Absolutely mind blowing, but it's a game, great."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "So now what if you're constructing a feed for a person, right?"}, {"time": 3624, "text": "Like how can you construct that feed in such a way that optimizes for a diversity of experience, a longterm happiness, right?"}, {"time": 3636, "text": "But that reward function, it turns out in reinforcement learning again, as I've learned, like reward design is really hard."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "And I don't know, like how do you design a scalar reward for someone's happiness over time?"}, {"time": 3651, "text": "I mean, do you have to measure dopamine levels?"}, {"time": 3653, "text": "Like, do you have to?"}, {"time": 3654, "text": "Well, you have to have a lot more signals from the human being."}, {"time": 3659, "text": "Currently it feels like there's not enough signals coming from the human being users of this algorithm."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "So for reinforcement learning to work well, you need to have a lot more data."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "Needs to have a lot of data."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "And that actually is a challenge for anyone who wants to start something, which is you don't have a lot of data."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "So how do you compete?"}, {"time": 3677, "text": "But I do think back to your original point, rethinking the algorithm, rethinking reward functions, rethinking utility, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "And I think that's an open opportunity for a company that figures it out."}, {"time": 3694, "text": "I have to ask about April, 2012, when Instagram, along with its massive employee base of 13 people was sold to Facebook for $1 billion."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "What was the process like on a business level, engineering level, human level?"}, {"time": 3712, "text": "What was that process of selling to Facebook like?"}, {"time": 3716, "text": "So I want to provide some context, which is I worked in corporate development at Google, which not a lot of people know, but corporate development is effectively the group that buys companies, right?"}, {"time": 3726, "text": "You sit there and you acquire companies."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "And I had sat through so many of these meetings with entrepreneurs."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "We actually, fun fact, we never acquired a single company when I worked in corporate development."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "So I can't claim that I had like a lot of experience, but I had enough experience to understand, okay, like what prices are people getting and what's the process?"}, {"time": 3747, "text": "And as we started to grow, we were trying to keep this thing running and we were exhausted and we were 13 people."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And I mean, we were trying to think back, it was probably 27, 37 now, so young on a relative basis, right?"}, {"time": 3768, "text": "And we're trying to keep the thing running."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "And then we go out to raise money and we're kind of like the hot startup at the time."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "And I remember going into a specific VC and saying, our terms we're looking for are, we're looking for a $500 million valuation."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "And I've never seen so many jaws drop all in unison, right?"}, {"time": 3790, "text": "And I was like, thanked and walked out the door very kindly after."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And then I got a call the next day from someone who was connected to them."}, {"time": 3798, "text": "And they said, we just wanna let you know that like it was pretty offensive that you asked for a $500 million valuation."}, {"time": 3805, "text": "And I can't tell if that was like just negotiating or what, but it's true, like no one offered us more, right?"}, {"time": 3812, "text": "So we were..."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "So can you clarify the number again?"}, {"time": 3815, "text": "You said how many million?"}, {"time": 3817, "text": "500 million."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "500 million, yeah, half a billion."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "So in my mind, I'm anchored like, okay, well, literally no one's biting at 500 million."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "And eventually we would get Sequoia and Greylock and others together at 500 million, basically, post."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "It was 450 pre, I think we raised $50 million."}, {"time": 3836, "text": "But just like no one was used to seeing a $500 million companies then."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "Like, I don't know if it was because we were just coming out of the hangover of 2008 and things were still on recovery mode."}, {"time": 3850, "text": "But then along comes Facebook."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "And after some negotiation, we've two X to the number from a half a billion to a billion."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Yeah, it seems pretty good."}, {"time": 3862, "text": "And I think Mark and I really saw eye to eye that this thing could be big."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "We thought we could... Their resources would help us scale it."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "And in a lot of ways it de risks."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "I mean, it de risks a lot of the employees lives for the rest of their lives, including me, including Mike, right?"}, {"time": 3881, "text": "I think I might've had like 10 grand in my bank account at the time, right?"}, {"time": 3884, "text": "Like we're working hard, we had nothing."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "So on a relative basis, it seems very high."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "And then I think the last company to exit for anywhere close to a billion was YouTube that I could think of."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "And thus began the giant long bull run of 2012 to all the way to where we are now, where I saw some stat yesterday about like how many unicorns exist and it's absurd."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "But then again, never underestimate technology and like the value it can provide."}, {"time": 3915, "text": "And man, costs have dropped and man scale has increased."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "And you can make businesses make a lot of money now."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "But on a fundamental level, I don't know, like how do you describe the decision to sell a company with 13 people for a billion dollars?"}, {"time": 3932, "text": "So first of all, like how did it take a lot of guts to sit at a table and say 500 million or 1 billion with Mark Zuckerberg?"}, {"time": 3941, "text": "It seems like a very large number with 13."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "Like, especially..."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "It doesn't seem, it is."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "They're all large numbers."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "Especially like you said before the unicorn parade."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "I like that, I'm gonna use that."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "The unicorn parade?"}, {"time": 3959, "text": "You were at the head of the unicorn parade."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "It's the, yeah, it's a massive unicorn parade."}, {"time": 3964, "text": "Okay, so no, I mean, we knew we were worth quote unquote a lot, but we didn't, I mean, there was no market for Instagram."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "I mean, it's not, you couldn't mark to market this thing in the public markets."}, {"time": 3978, "text": "You didn't quite understand what it would be worth or was worth at the time."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "So in a market, an illiquid market where you have one buyer and one seller and you're going back and forth, and well, I guess there were like VC firms who were willing to invest at a certain valuation."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "So I don't know, you just go with your gut."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "And at the end of the day, I would say the hardest part of it was not realizing, like when we sold, it was tough because like literally everywhere I go, restaurants, whatever, like for a good six months after, there was a lot of attention on the deal, a lot of attention on the product, a lot of attention, it was kind of miserable, right?"}, {"time": 4026, "text": "And you're like, wait, like I made a lot of money, but like, why is this not great?"}, {"time": 4030, "text": "And it's because it turns out, I don't know, like I don't really keep in touch with Mark, but I've got to assume his job right now is not exactly the most happy job in the world."}, {"time": 4039, "text": "It's really tough when you're on top and it's really tough when you're in the limelight."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "So the decision itself was like, oh, cool, this is great."}, {"time": 4047, "text": "How lucky are we, right?"}, {"time": 4049, "text": "So, okay, there's a million question I want to ask."}, {"time": 4050, "text": "Yeah, go, go, go."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "First of all, why is it hard to be on top?"}, {"time": 4057, "text": "Why did you not feel good?"}, {"time": 4059, "text": "Like, can you dig into that?"}, {"time": 4060, "text": "It always, I've heard like Olympic athletes say after they win gold, they get depressed."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "Is it something like that where it feels like it was kind of like a thing you were working towards?"}, {"time": 4077, "text": "Some loose definition of success."}, {"time": 4078, "text": "And this sure as heck feels like at least according to other startups, this is what success looks like."}, {"time": 4084, "text": "And now why don't I feel any better?"}, {"time": 4088, "text": "I'm still human, I still have all the same problems."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "Is that the nature?"}, {"time": 4091, "text": "Or is it just like negative attention of some kind?"}, {"time": 4096, "text": "But to be clear, there was a lot of happiness in terms of like, oh my God, this is great."}, {"time": 4100, "text": "Like we won the Super Bowl of startups, right?"}, {"time": 4105, "text": "Anyone who can get to a liquidity event of anything meaningful feels like, wow, this is what we started out to do."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "Of course we want to create great things that people love, but like we won in a big way."}, {"time": 4118, "text": "But yeah, there's this big like, oh, if we won, what's next?"}, {"time": 4123, "text": "So they call it the we have arrived syndrome, which I need to go back and look where I can quote that from."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "But I remember reading about it at the time."}, {"time": 4134, "text": "I was like, oh yeah, that's that."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "And I remember we had a product manager leave very early on when we got to Facebook."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "And he said to me, I just don't believe I can learn anything at this company anymore."}, {"time": 4145, "text": "It's like, it's hit its apex."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "We sold it great."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "I just don't have anything else to learn."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "So from 2012 all the way to the day I left in 2018, like the amount I learned and the humility with which I realized, oh, we thought we won."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "Billion dollars is cool, but like there are a hundred billion dollar companies."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "And by the way, on top of that, we had no revenue."}, {"time": 4169, "text": "We had, I mean, we had a cool product, but we didn't scale it yet."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "And there's so much to learn."}, {"time": 4174, "text": "And then competitors and how fun was it to fight Snapchat?"}, {"time": 4179, "text": "Like it was, it's like Yankees Red Sox."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "Like that's what you live for."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "You know, you win some, you lose some, but the amount you can learn through that process, what I've realized in life is that there is no, and there's always someone who has more, there's always more challenge, just at different scales."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "And it sounds like a little Buddhist, but everything is super challenging, whether you're like a small business or an enormous business."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "I say like choose the game you like to play, right?"}, {"time": 4217, "text": "You've got to imagine that if you're an amazing basketball player, you enjoy to some extent practicing basketball."}, {"time": 4222,

{"time": 4227, "text": "But you gotta love it."}, {"time": 4228, "text": "And the same thing with Instagram, which is we might've sold, but it was like, great."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "There's one Super Bowl title."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "Can we win five?"}, {"time": 4238, "text": "What else can we do?"}, {"time": 4240, "text": "Now I imagine you didn't ask this, but okay, so I left."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "There's a little bit of like, what do you do next, right?"}, {"time": 4246, "text": "Like, how do you top that thing?"}, {"time": 4249, "text": "It's the wrong question."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "The question is like, when you wake up every day, what is the hardest, most interesting thing you can go work on?"}, {"time": 4256, "text": "Because like at the end of the day, we all turn into dirt, it doesn't matter, right?"}, {"time": 4260, "text": "But what does matter is like, can we really enjoy this life?"}, {"time": 4265, "text": "Not in a hedonistic way, because that's those, it's like the reinforcement learning, learning like short term versus long term objectives."}, {"time": 4273, "text": "Can you wake up every day and truly enjoy what you're doing knowing that it's gonna be painful?"}, {"time": 4282, "text": "Knowing that like, no matter what you choose, it's gonna be painful."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "Whether you sit on a beach or whether you manage a thousand people or 10,000, it's gonna be painful."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "So choose something that's fun to have pain."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "But yes, there was a lot of, we have arrived and it's a maturation process you just have to go through."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "So no matter how much success there is, how much money you make, you have to wake up the next day and choose the hard life, whatever that means next, that's fun."}, {"time": 4313, "text": "The fun slash hard life, hard life that's fun."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "I guess what I'm trying to say is slightly different, which is just that no one realizes everything's gonna be hard."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "Even chilling out is hard."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "And then you just start worrying about stupid stuff."}, {"time": 4329, "text": "Like, I don't know, like did so and so forget to paint the house today or like did the gardener come or whatever?"}, {"time": 4336, "text": "Like, or, oh, I'm so angry and my

that even chilling, AKA meditation, is hard work."}, {"time": 4347, "text": "Yeah, and at least meditation is like productive chilling where you're like actually training yourself to calm down and be,

I'm on the, I'm still on the, I think the first half of life, knock on wood, and I've got a lot of years and what am I gonna do, sit around?"}, {"time": 4374, "text": "And the other way of looking at this, by the way, imagine you made one movie and it was great."}, {"time": 4382, "text": "Would you just like stop making movies?"}, {"time": 4385, "text": "No, generally you're like, wow, I really like making movies, let's make another one."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "A lot of times, by the way, the second one or the third one, not that great, but the fourth one, awesome."}, {"time": 4393,

like, man, that's something I didn't understand at all."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "And now I feel like I'm one 10th of the way there."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "And that feels like a big mountain to climb."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "So I distracted us from the original question."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "No, and we'll return to the machine learning cause I'd love to explore your interest there."}, {"time": 4426, "text": "But I mean, speaking of sort of challenges and hard things, is there a possible world where sitting in a room with Mark Zuckerberg with a $1 billion deal, you turn it

was the calculation that you were making?"}, {"time": 4448, "text": "Thus enters the world of counterfactuals and not really knowing."}, {"time": 4453, "text": "And if only we could run that experiment."}, {"time": 4455, "text": "Well, the universe exists, it's just running in parallel to our own."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "Yeah, it's so fascinating, right?"}, {"time": 4463, "text": "I mean, we're talking a lot about money, but the real question was, I'm not sure you'll believe me when I say this, but could we strap our little company onto the side of a rocket ship and like get out to a lot of people really, really quickly with the support, with the talent of a place like Facebook?"}, {"time": 4485, "text": "I mean, people often ask me what I would do differently at Instagram today."}, {"time": 4489, "text": "And I say, well, I'd probably hire more carefully because we showed up just like before I knew it, we had like a hundred people on the team and 200, then 300."},

4502, "text": "They were just like internal transfers, right?"}, {"time": 4505, "text": "So it's like relying on the Facebook hiring machine, which is quite sort of, I mean, it's an elaborate machine."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "It's great, by the way."}, {"time": 4512, "text": "They have really talented people there."}, {"time": 4515, "text": "But my point is the choice was like, take this thing, put it on the side of a rocket ship that you know is growing very quickly."}, {"time": 4525, "text": "Like I had seen what had happened when Ev sold Blogger to Google and then Google went public."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "Remember we sold before Facebook went public."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "There was a moment at which the stock price was $17, by the way, Facebook stock price was $17."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "I remember thinking, what the fuck did I just do, right?"}, {"time": 4543, "text": "Now at 320 ish, I don't know where we are today."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "But like, okay, like the best thing by the way is like when the stock is down, everyone calls you a dope."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "And then when it's up, they also call you a dope, but just for a different reason, right?"}, {"time": 4561, "text": "Like you can't win."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "Less than in there somewhere."}, {"time": 4564, "text": "So, but you know, the choice is to strap yourself to a rocket ship or to build your own."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "You know, Mr. Elon built his own literally with a rocket ship."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "That's a difficult choice because there's a world."}, {"time": 4578, "text": "Actually, I would say something different, which is Elon and others decided to sell PayPal for not that much."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "I mean, how much was it about a billion dollars?"}, {"time": 4588, "text": "I mean, it was early and, but it's worth a lot more now."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "To then build a new rocket ship."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "So this is the cool part, right?"}, {"time": 4594, "text": "If you are an entrepreneur and you own a controlling stake in the company, not only is it really hard to do something else with your life because all of the, you know, value is tied up in you as a personality attached to this company, right?"}, {"time": 4610, "text": "But if you sell it and you're getting yourself enough capital and you like have enough energy, you can do another thing or 10 other things or in Elon's case, like a bunch of other things."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "I don't know, like I lost count at this point."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "And it might've seemed silly at the time."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "And sure, like if you look back, man, PayPal is worth a lot now, right?"}, {"time": 4631, "text": "Like, do you think Elon like cares about like, are we gonna buy Pinterest or not?"}, {"time": 4635, "text": "Like, I just, he is, he created a massive capital that allowed him to do what he wants to do."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "That's more freeing than anything because when you are an entrepreneur attached to a company, you gotta stay at that company for a really long time."}, {"time": 4650,

Instagram."}, {"time": 4661, "text": "Yeah, I loved enough to like work for six years beyond the deal."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "Which is rare, which is very rare."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "You

4714, "text": "And plus I truly believed we were building such a great product and I loved, loved the game."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "It wasn't about money."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "It was about the game."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "Do you think you had the guts to say no?"}, {"time": 4726, "text": "Is that, so here's, I often think about this, like how hard is it for an entrepreneur to say no?"}, {"time": 4732, "text": "Because the peer pressure."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "So every, like basically the sea of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are gonna tell you, I mean, this is their dream."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "The thing you were sitting before is a dream."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "To walk away from that is really, it seems like nearly impossible."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "Because Instagram could in 10 years be, you could talk about Google."}, {"time": 4757, "text": "You could be making self driving cars and building rockets that go to Mars and compete with SpaceX."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "And so that's an interesting decision to say, am I willing to risk it?"}, {"time": 4771, "text": "And the reason I also say it's an interesting decision because it feels like per our previous discussion, if you're launching a social network company, there's going to be that meeting, whatever that number is."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "If you're successful, if you're on this rocket ship of success, there's going to be a meeting with one of the social media, social network companies that wanna buy you, whether it's Facebook or Twitter, but it could also very well be Google

entrepreneur to make that decision."}, {"time": 4813, "text": "How many have successfully made that decision?"}, {"time": 4815, "text": "I guess, this is a big question."}, {"time": 4818, "text":

people were really interested in them too."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "Like there are plenty of moments where people say no and we just forget that those things happen."}, {"time": 4888, "text": "We only focus on the ones where like they said yes and like, wow, like what if they had stayed independent?"}, {"time": 4897, "text": "I used to think a lot about this and now I just don't because I'm like, whatever."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "Things have gone pretty well."}, {"time": 4904, "text": "I'm ready for the next game."}, {"time": 4905, "text": "I mean, think about an athlete where, I

downward path and it's very possible to see a billion plus dollar deal at some stage, maybe like a year ago or half a year ago from Facebook, from Google."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "I think Facebook was flirting with that idea too."}, {"time": 4950, "text": "And I think a lot of companies probably were."}, {"time": 4954, "text": "I wish it was more public."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "There's not like a bad public story about them making the decision to walk away."}, {"time": 4963, "text": "We just don't hear about it."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "And then we get to see the results of that success or the failure, more often failure."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "So a couple of things, one is, I would not assume Clubhouse is down for the count at all."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "They're young, they have plenty of money, they're run by really smart people."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "I'd give them like a very fighting chance to figure it out."}, {"time": 4982, "text": "There are a lot of times when people call Twitter down for the count and they figure it out and they seem to be doing well, right?"}, {"time": 4988, "text": "So just backing up like, and not knowing anything about their internals, like there's a strong chance they will figure it out and that people are just down because they like being down about companies."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "They like assuming that they're gonna fail."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "So who knows, right?"}, {"time": 5001, "text": "But let's take the ones in the past where like we know how it played out."}, {"time": 5004, "text": "There are plenty of examples where people have turned down big offers and then you've just never heard from them again, but we never focus on the companies because you just forget that those were big."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "But inside your psyche, I think it's easy for someone with enough money to say money doesn't matter, which I think is like, it's bullshit."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "Of course, money matters to people, but at the moment, you just can't even grasp like the number of zeros that you're talking about."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "It just doesn't make sense, right?"}, {"time": 5036, "text": "So to think rationally in that moment is not something many people are equipped to do, especially not people where I think we had founded the company a year earlier, maybe two years earlier, like a year and a half, we were 13 people, but I will say, I still don't know if it was the right decision because I don't have that counterfactual."}, {"time": 5056, "text": "I don't know that other world."}, {"time": 5058, "text": "I'm just thankful that by and large, most people love Instagram, still do."}, {"time": 5063, "text": "By and large, people are very happy with like the time we had there and I'm proud of what we built."}, {"time": 5069, "text": "So like, I'm cool."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "Like now it's next shot, right?"}, {"time": 5075, "text": "Well, if we could just linger on this Yankees versus Red Sox, the fun of it, the competition over, I would say over the space of features."}, {"time": 5085, "text": "So there are a bunch of features, like there's photos, there's one minute videos on Instagram, there's IGTV, there's stories, there's reels, there's live."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "So that sounds like it's like a long list of too much stuff, but it's not because it feels like they're close together, but they're somehow, like what we're saying, fundamentally distinct, like each of the things I mentioned."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "Maybe can you describe the philosophies, the design philosophies behind some of these, how you were thinking about it during the historic war between Snapchat and Instagram or just in general, like this space of features that was discovered."}, {"time": 5130, "text": "There's this great book by Clay Christensen called, Competing Against Luck."}, {"time": 5136, "text": "It's like a terrible title, but within it, there's effectively an expression of this thing called jobs to be done theory."}, {"time": 5146, "text": "And it's unclear if like he came up with it or some of his colleagues, but there are a bunch of places you can find with people claiming to have come up with this jobs to be done theory."}, {"time": 5155, "text": "But the idea is if you like zoom out and you look at your product, you ask yourself, why are people hiring your product?"}, {"time": 5164, "text": "Like imagine every product in your life is effectively an employee, you know, you're CEO of your life and you hire products to be employees effectively."}, {"time": 5173, "text": "They all have roles and jobs, right?"}, {"time": 5176, "text": "Why are you hiring a product?"}, {"time": 5178, "text": "Why do you want that product to perform something in your life?"}, {"time": 5181, "text": "And like, what are the hidden reasons why you're in love with this product?"}, {"time": 5186, "text": "Instagram was about sharing your life with others visually, period, right?"}, {"time": 5191, "text": "Because you feel connected with them."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "You get to show off."}, {"time": 5195, "text": "You get to feel good and cared about, right?"}, {"time": 5198, "text": "With likes and it turns out that that will, I think forever define Instagram and any product that serves that job is going to do very well, okay?"}, {"time": 5212, "text": "Stories let's take as an example is very much serving that job."}, {"time": 5218, "text": "In fact, it serves it better than the original product because when you're large and have an enormous audience, you're worried about people seeing your stuff or you're worried about being permanent so that a college admissions person is going to see your photo of you doing something."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "And so it turns out that that is a more efficient way of performing that job than the original product was."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "The original product still has its value, but at scale, these two things together work really, really well."}, {"time": 5246, "text": "Now, I will claim that other parts of the product over time didn't perform that job as well."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "I think IGTV probably didn't, right?"}, {"time": 5255, "text": "Shopping is like completely unrelated to what I just described, but it might work."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "Products I think, products that succeed are products that all share this parent node of like this job to be done that is in common."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "And then they're just like different ways of doing it, right?"}, {"time": 5275, "text": "Apple, I think does a great job with this, right?"}, {"time": 5277, "text": "It's like managing your digital life and all the products just work together."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "They sync, they're like, it's beautiful, right?"}, {"time": 5286, "text": "Even if they require like silly specific cords to work, but they're all part of a system."}, {"time": 5292, "text": "It's when you leave that system and you start doing something weird that people start scratching their head and I think you are less successful."}, {"time": 5299, "text": "So I think one of the challenges Facebook has had throughout its life is that it has never fully, I think, appreciated the job to be done of the main product."}, {"time": 5308,

{"time": 5314, "text": "And then they're confused why it doesn't work."}, {"time": 5316, "text": "Like why doesn't it work?"}, {"time": 5317, "text": "It's because the people who show up for this don't want that, it's different."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "What's the purpose of Facebook?"}, {"time": 5324, "text": "So I remember I was a very early Facebook user."}, {"time": 5327, "text": "The reason I was personally excited about Facebook is because you can, first of all, use your real name."}, {"time": 5335, "text": "Like I can exist in this world."}, {"time": 5338, "text": "It can be like formally exist."}, {"time": 5340, "text": "I like anonymity for certain things, Reddit and so on, but I want it to also exist not anonymously so that I can connect with other friends of mine nonanonymously and there's a reliable way to know that I'm real and they're real and that we're connecting."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "And it's kind of like, I liked it for the reasons that people like LinkedIn, I guess."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "But like without the form, like not everybody is dressed up and being super polite, like more like with friends."}, {"time": 5374, "text": "But then it became something much bigger than that, I suppose, there's a feed."}, {"time": 5379, "text": "It became this, I mean, it became a place to discover content, to share content that's not just about connecting directly with friends."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "I mean, it became something else."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "I don't even know what it is really."}, {"time": 5396, "text": "So you said Instagram is a place where you visually share your life."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "What is Facebook?"}, {"time": 5403, "text": "Well, let's go back to the founding of Facebook and why it worked really well initially at Harvard and then Dartmouth and Stanford and I can't remember, probably MIT, there were like a handful of schools in that first tranche, right?"}, {"time": 5417, "text": "It worked because there are communities that exist in the world that want to transact."}, {"time": 5423, "text": "And when I say transact, I don't mean commercially, I just mean they want to share, they want to coordinate, they want to communicate, they want a space for themselves."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "And Facebook at its best, I think is that."}, {"time": 5436, "text": "And if actually you look at the most popular products that Facebook has built over time, if you look at things like groups, marketplace, groups is enormous."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "And groups is effectively like everyone can found their own little Stanford or Dartmouth or MIT, right?"}, {"time": 5453, "text": "And find each other and share and communicate about something that matters deeply to them."}, {"time": 5460, "text": "That is the core of what Facebook was built around."}, {"time": 5463, "text": "And I think today is where it stands most strongly."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "Yeah, it's brilliant."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "The groups, I wish groups were done better."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "It feels like it's not a first class citizen."}, {"time": 5476, "text": "I know I may be saying something without much knowledge, but it feels like it's kind of bolted on while being used a lot."}, {"time": 5486, "text": "It feels like there needs to be a little bit more structure in terms of discovery, in terms of like."}, {"time": 5492, "text": "I mean, look at Reddit."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "Like Reddit is basically groups of public and open and a little bit crazy, right?"}, {"time": 5498, "text": "In a good way."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "But there's clear product market fit for that specific use case."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "And it doesn't have to be a college, it can be anything."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "It can be a small group, a big group, it can be group messaging."}, {"time": 5510, "text": "Facebook shines, I think, when it leans into that."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "I think when there are other companies that just seem exciting and now all of a sudden the product shifts in some fundamental way to go try to compete with that other thing, that's when I think consumers get confused."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "Even if you can be successful, like even if you can compete with that other company, even if you can figure out how to bolt it on, eventually you come back and you look at the app and you're like, I just don't know why I opened this app."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "Like why, like too many things going on."}, {"time": 5543, "text": "And that was always a worry."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "I mean, you listed all the things at Instagram and it almost gave me a heart attack, like way too many things."}, {"time": 5550, "text": "But I don't know, entrepreneurs get bored."}, {"time": 5551, "text": "They want to add things."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "They want to like, right?"}, {"time": 5555, "text": "I don't have a good answer for it, except for that I think being true to your original use case and not even original use case, but sorry, actually not use case, original job."}, {"time": 5566, "text": "There are many use cases under that job."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "Being true to that and like being really good at it over time and morphing as needs change, I think that's how to make a company last forever."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "And I mean, honestly, like my main thesis about why Facebook is in the position it is today is if they have had a series of product launches that delighted people over time, I think they'd be in a totally different world."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "So just like imagine for a moment, and by the way, Apple's entering this, but like Apple for so long, just like product after product, you couldn't wait for it."}, {"time": 5606, "text": "You stood in line for it."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "You talked about it."}, {"time": 5608, "text": "You got excited."}, {"time": 5609, "text": "Amazon

way, Amazon, Apple have issues, right?"}, {"time": 5621, "text": "There are labor issues, whether it's here in the US or in China, there are environmental issues."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "But like when's the last time you heard like a large chorus being like, these companies better pay for what they're doing on these things, right?"}, {"time": 5636, "text": "I think Facebook's main issue today is like, you need to produce a hit."}, {"time": 5641, "text": "If you don't produce hits, it's really hard to keep consumers on your side."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "Then people just start picking on you for a variety of reasons, whether it's right or wrong."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "I'm not even going to place a judgment right here and right now."}, {"time": 5653, "text": "I'm just going to say that it is way better to be in a world where you are producing hits and consumers love what you're doing because then they're on your side."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "And I think that's, it's the past 10 years for Facebook has been fairly hard on this dimension."}, {"time": 5669, "text": "So, and by hits, it doesn't necessarily mean financial hits."}, {"time": 5673, "text": "It feels like to me, what you're saying is something that brings joy."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "A product that brings joy to some fraction of the population."}, {"time": 5680, "text": "Yeah, I mean, TikTok isn't just

"Like you have to be willing to say, well, maybe there's something there and wow, like I wanna go look into it and truly believe it in your gut."}, {"time": 7692, "text": "But if people look at you

don't know."}, {"time": 7731, "text": "So we'd have to have a much deeper, I think dive to understand where the blame lies."}, {"time": 7736, "text": "What's very unpleasant to me to consider, now, I don't know if this is true, but to consider the very fact that there might be some complicated games being played here."}, {"time": 7747, "text": "For example, as somebody, I really love psychology

affect the results."}, {"time": 7762, "text": "You can basically get any results you want."}, {"time": 7765, "text": "And so you have an internal Facebook study that asks some question of which we don't know the full details and there's some kind of analysis, but that's just the one little tiny slice into some much bigger picture."}, {"time": 7777, "text": "And so you can have thousands of employees at Facebook."}, {"time": 7780, "text": "One of them comes out and picks whatever narrative, knowing that they become famous, coupled with the other really uncomfortable thing I see in the

whistleblower and with this whole dynamic of journalism and so on, you know, with Social Dilemma being really popular, documentary, it's like, all right, my concern is there's deep flaws in human nature here in terms of things we need to deal with, like the nature of hate, of bullying, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 7856, "text": "And then there's people who are trying to use that

that."}, {"time": 7908, "text": "Well, you just, I think, very helpfully explained the nuance of the situation and why it's so hard to understand."}, {"time": 7916, "text": "But a couple of things."},

really feel like reliving a previous life, but wow."}, {"time": 7950, "text": "Like talk about challenging the idea of open culture and like what that does to Facebook internally."}, {"time": 7983,

inside of startups that value that."}, {"time": 7996, "text": "I think that it's a seminal moment and you can say, well, you should have nothing to hide, right?"}, {"time": 8002, "text": "But to your point, you can pick out documents that show anything, right?"}, {"time": 8008, "text": "What happens to transparency inside of startups and the culture that startups or companies in the future will grow, like the startup of the future that becomes the next Facebook will be locked down and what does that do, right?"}, {"time": 8022, "text": "So that's part one."}, {"time": 8024, "text": "Part two, like I don't think that you could design a more like a well orchestrated handful of events from the like 16 minutes to releasing the documents in the way that they were released at the right time."}, {"time": 8042, "text": "That takes a lot of planning and partnership."}, {"time": 8045, "text": "And it seems like she has a partner at some firm, right?"}, {"time": 8049, "text": "That

think the Occam's razor here is like someone thought they were doing something wrong and was like very, very courageous."}, {"time": 8094, "text": "And I don't know if courageous is the word, but

second."}, {"time": 8105, "text": "Then there are the documents themselves."}, {"time": 8107, "text": "They say what they say."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "To your point, a lot of the things that like

8288, "text": "But imagine that at massive scale."}, {"time": 8291, "text": "I mean, they've done resource planning for servers for peak load using reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 8297, "text": "I don't know if that was at Google or somewhere else, but like, okay, great, you do it for servers, but what if you could do it for just capacity and general energy capacity for cities and planning for traffic?"}, {"time": 8307, "text": "And of course there's all the self driving cars and I don't know, like I'm not gonna pontificate on like crazy ideas using reinforcement learning or machine learning."}, {"time": 8320, "text": "It's just so clear to me that humans don't think quickly enough."}, {"time": 8323, "text": "So it's interesting to think about machine learning helping a little bit at scale."}, {"time": 8329, "text": "So a little bit to a large number of people that has a huge impact."}, {"time": 8333, "text": "So if you optimize, say Google Maps, something like that, trajectory planning or what a map quest first."}, {"time": 8341, "text": "Getting here, I looked and it was like, here's the most energy efficient route."}, {"time": 8344, "text": "And I was like, I'm gonna be late."}, {"time": 8345, "text": "I need to take the fastest route."}, {"time": 8347, "text": "As opposed to unrolling the map."}, {"time": 8350, "text": "Like, and then that's going to be very inefficient no matter what."}, {"time": 8353, "text": "I was definitely the other day, like part of the Epsilon of Epsilon Greedy with Waze where like I was sent on like a weird route that I could tell they're like, we just need to collect data at this road."}, {"time": 8364, "text": "Like we just, Kevin's."}, {"time": 8366, "text": "You were the ant they sent out for exploration."},

"Oh, going through it, I was like, oh, this is fun."}, {"time": 8376, "text": "Like now they get data about this weird shortcut."}, {"time": 8378, "text": "And actually I hit all the green lights networked."}, {"time": 8380, "text": "I'm like, this is a problem."}, {"time": 8381, "text": "Bad data."}, {"time": 8382, "text": "Bad data, they're just gonna imagine."}, {"time": 8384, "text": "I could see you slowing down and stopping at a green light just to give them the right kind of data."}, {"time": 8390, "text": "But to answer your question, like I feel like that was fairly unsatisfying and it's easy to say climate change."}, {"time": 8395, "text": "But what I would say is at Instagram, everything we applied machine learning to got better for users and it got better for the company."}, {"time": 8404, "text": "I saw the power."}, {"time": 8406, "text": "I didn't fully understand it as an executive."}, {"time": 8408, "text": "And I think that's actually one of the issues that, and when I say understand, I mean the mathematics of it."}, {"time": 8414, "text": "Like I understand what it does."}, {"time": 8415, "text": "I understand that it helps."}, {"time": 8417, "text": "But there are a lot of executives now that talk about it in the way that they talk about the internet or they talked about the internet like 10 years ago."}, {"time": 8425, "text": "They're like, we're gonna build mobile."}, {"time": 8427, "text": "And you're like, what does that mean?"}, {"time": 8427, "text": "They're like, we're just gonna do mobile."}, {"time": 8429, "text": "And you're like, okay."}, {"time": 8431, "text": "So my sense is the next generation of leaders will have grown up having had classes in reinforcement learning, supervised learning, whatever."}, {"time": 8440, "text": "And they will be able to thoughtfully apply it to their companies and the places that it is needed most."}, {"time": 8446, "text": "And that's really cool."}, {"time": 8447, "text": "Cause I mean, talk about efficiency gains."}, {"time": 8453, "text": "That's what excites me the most about it."}, {"time": 8454, "text": "Yeah, so there's, it's interesting just to get a fundamental first principles understanding of certain concepts of machine learning."}, {"time": 8461, "text": "So supervised learning from an executive perspective, supervised learning, you have to have a lot of humans label a lot of data."}, {"time": 8468, "text": "So the question there is, okay, can we gather a large amount of data that can be labeled well?"}, {"time": 8474, "text": "And that's the question Tesla asked, like can we create a data engine that keeps sending an imperfect machine learning system out there, whenever it fails, it gives us data back."}, {"time": 8485, "text": "We label it by human and we send it back and forth to this way."}, {"time": 8488, "text": "Then there's Yann LeCun's excited about the self supervised learning where you do much less human labeling and there's some kind of mechanism for the system to learn it by itself on the human generated data."}, {"time": 8502, "text": "And then there's the reinforcement learning, which is like basically allowing, it's applying the alpha zero technology that allow through self play to learn how to solve the game of Go and achieve incredible levels at the game of chess."}, {"time": 8522, "text": "Can you formulate the problem you're trying to solve in a way that's amenable to reinforcement learning?"}, {"time": 8527, "text": "And can you get the right kind of signal at scale?"}, {"time": 8529, "text": "Cause you need a lot of signal."}, {"time": 8531, "text": "And that's kind of fascinating to see which part of a social network can you convert into reinforcement learning problem."}, {"time": 8539, "text": "The fascinating thing about reinforcement learning, I think, is that we now have learned to apply neural networks to guess the Q function, basically the values for any state in action."}, {"time": 8557, "text": "And that is fascinating cause we used to just like, I don't know, have like a linear regression, like hope it worked and that was the fanciest version of it."}, {"time": 8565, "text": "But now you look at it, I'm like trying to learn this stuff and I look at it and I'm like, there are like 17 different acronyms of different ways you can try to apply this."}, {"time": 8572, "text": "No one quite agrees, like what's the best."}, {"time": 8576, "text": "Generally, if you're trying to like build a neural network, there are pretty well trodden ways of doing that."}, {"time": 8582, "text": "You use Adam, you use ReLU, like there's just like general good ideas."}, {"time": 8587, "text": "And in reinforcement learning, I feel like the consensus is like, it totally depends."}, {"time": 8593, "text": "And by the way, it's really hard to get it to converge and it's noisy and it like, so there are all these really interesting ideas around building simulators."}, {"time": 8603, "text": "You know, like for instance, in self driving, right?"}, {"time": 8605, "text": "Like you don't want to like actually have someone getting in an accident to learn that an accident is bad."}, {"time": 8611, "text": "So you start simulating accidents, simulating aggressive drivers, just simulating crazy dogs that run into the street and, wow, fascinating, right?"}, {"time": 8621, "text": "Like my mind starts racing and then the question is, okay, forget about self driving cars."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "Let's talk about social networks."}, {"time": 8629, "text": "How can you produce a better, more thoughtful experience using these types of algorithms?"}, {"time": 8635, "text": "And honestly, in talking to some of the people that work at Facebook and old Instagrammers, most people are like, yeah, we tried a lot of things, didn't quite ever make it work."}, {"time": 8645, "text": "I mean, for the longest time, Facebook ads was effectively a logistic regression, okay?"}, {"time": 8650, "text": "I don't know what it is now, but like if you look at this paper that they published back in the day, it was literally just a logistic regression."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "Made a lot of money."}, {"time": 8658, "text": "So even at these like extremely large scales, if we are not yet touching what reinforcement learning can truly do, imagine what the next 10 years looks like."}, {"time": 8669, "text": "So I really liked the use of reinforcement learning as part of the simulation, for example, like with self driving cars, it's modeling pedestrians."}, {"time": 8677, "text": "So the nice thing about reinforcement learning, it can be used to learn agents within the world."}, {"time": 8685, "text": "So they can learn to behave properly."}, {"time": 8687, "text": "Like you can teach pedestrians to, like you don't hard code the way they behave, they learn how to behave."}, {"time": 8693, "text": "In that same way, I do have a hope, was it Jack Dorsey talks about healthy conversations."}, {"time": 8698, "text": "You talked about meaningful interactions, I believe."}, {"time": 8703, "text": "Like simulating interactions."}, {"time": 8706, "text": "So you can learn how to manage that, it's fascinating."}, {"time": 8709, "text": "So where most of your algorithm development happens in virtual worlds, and then you can really learn how to design the interface, how you design a bunch of aspects of the experience in terms of how you select what's shown in the feed, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 8726, "text": "It feels like if you can connect reinforcement learning to that, that's super exciting."}, {"time": 8730, "text": "Yep, and I think if you have a company and leadership that believe in doing the right things and can apply this technology in the right way, some really special stuff can happen."}, {"time": 8741, "text": "It is mostly likely going to be a group of people we've never heard about, start up from scratch, right?"}, {"time": 8749, "text": "And you asked if like new social networks could be built, I've got to imagine they will be."}, {"time": 8754, "text": "And whoever starts it, it might be some kids in a garage that took these classes from these people, you, right?"}, {"time": 8762, "text": "And they're building all of these things with this tech at the core."}, {"time": 8766, "text": "So I'm trying not to be someone who just like throws around reinforcement learning as a buzzword."}, {"time": 8771, "text": "I truly believe that it is the most cutting edge in what can happen in social networks."}, {"time": 8778, "text": "And I also believe it's super hard."}, {"time": 8780, "text": "Like it's super hard to make it work."}, {"time": 8782, "text": "It's super hard to do it at scale."}, {"time": 8784, "text": "It's super hard to find people that truly understand it."}, {"time": 8786, "text": "So I'm not gonna say that like, I think it'll be applied in social networks before we have true self driving."}, {"time": 8793, "text": "Yeah, we could argue about this for a long time, but yes, I agree with you."}, {"time": 8798, "text": "I think self driving is way harder than people realize."}, {"time": 8801, "text": "Let me ask you in terms of that kid in the garage or those couple of kids in the garage, what advice would you give to them if they wanna start a new social network or a business?"}, {"time": 8810, "text": "What advice would you give to somebody with a big dream and a young startup?"}, {"time": 8816, "text": "To me, you have to choose to do something that even if it fails, like it was so fun, right?"}, {"time": 8823, "text": "Like we never started Instagram knowing it was going to be big."}, {"time": 8827, "text": "We started Instagram because we loved photography."}, {"time": 8830, "text": "We loved social networks."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "I had seen what other social networks had done and I thought, hmm, maybe we did a spin on this, but like nowhere was our feet predestined."}, {"time": 8840, "text": "Like it wasn't like, it wasn't written out anywhere that everything was gonna go great."}, {"time": 8845, "text": "And I often think the counterfactual, like what if it had not gone well?"}, {"time": 8848, "text": "I would have been like, I don't know, that was fun."}, {"time": 8850, "text": "We raised some money, we learned some stuff and does it position you well for the next experience?"}, {"time": 8857, "text": "That's the advice that I would give to anyone wanting to start something today, which is like, does this meet with your ultimate goals?"}, {"time": 8865, "text": "Not wealth, not fame, none of that, because all of that, by the way, is bullshit."}, {"time": 8868, "text": "Like you can get super famous and super wealthy."}, {"time": 8872, "text": "And I think generally those are not things that, again, it's easy to say with like a lot of money that somehow like it's not good to have a lot of money."}, {"time": 8881, "text": "It's just, I think that complicates life enormously in a way that people don't fully comprehend."}, {"time": 8886, "text": "So I think it is way more interesting to shoot for, can I make something that people love, that provides value in the world, that I love building, that I love working on, right?"}, {"time": 8897, "text": "That's what I would do if I were starting from scratch."}, {"time": 8901, "text": "And by the way, like in some ways that I will do that personally, which is like choose the thing that you get up every morning and you're like, I love this, even when it's painful."},

some."}, {"time": 8920, "text": "I can't compete against myself."}, {"time": 8922, "text": "I can't give out ideas."}, {"time": 8924, "text": "No, but it's like high level."}, {"time": 8925, "text": "You can focus on community."}, {"time": 8930, "text": "I said that as a half joke."}, {"time": 8934, "text": "In all honesty, I think these things are so hard to build that like ideas are a dime a dozen, but."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "You have talked about keeping it simple."}, {"time": 8942, "text": "Can I tell you?"}, {"time": 8943, "text": "Which is a liberating idea."}, {"time": 8944, "text": "My model is it's three circles and they overlap."}, {"time": 8948, "text": "One circle is what do I have experience at?"}, {"time": 8951, "text": "Slash, what am I good at?"}, {"time": 8952, "text": "I don't like saying what am I good at because it just like seems like, what do I have experience in, right?"}, {"time": 8958, "text": "What can I bring to the table?"}, {"time": 8959, "text": "What am I excited about is the other circle."}, {"time": 8962, "text": "What gets it?"}, {"time": 8962, "text": "What's just super cool, right?"}, {"time": 8964, "text": "That I want to work on because even when this is hard, I think it's so cool."}, {"time": 8970, "text": "I want to stick with it."}, {"time": 8971, "text": "And the last circle is like, what does the world need?"}, {"time": 8974, "text": "And if that circle ain't there, it doesn't matter what you work on."}, {"time": 8977, "text": "Cause there are a lot of startups that exist that just no one needs or very small markets need."}, {"time": 8983, "text": "But if you want to be successful, I think if you're like, if you're good at it, you have, sorry, if you're good at it, you're passionate about it and the world needs it."}, {"time": 8991, "text": "I mean, this sounds simple, not enough people sit down and just think about those circles and think, do these things overlap?"}, {"time": 8998, "text": "And then can I get that middle section?"}, {"time": 8999, "text": "It's small, but can I get that middle section?"}, {"time": 9002, "text": "I think a lot about that personally."}, {"time": 9005, "text": "And then you have to be really honest about the circle that you're good at and really honest about the circle that the world needs."}, {"time": 9017, "text": "And as opposed to really honest about the passion, like what do you actually love?"}, {"time": 9022, "text": "As opposed to like some kind of dream of making money, all those kinds of stuff, like literally love doing."}, {"time": 9026, "text": "I had a former engineer who decided to start a startup and I was like, are you sure you want to start a company versus like join something else?"}, {"time": 9034, "text": "Because being a coach of an NBA team and playing basketball are two very, very different things."}, {"time": 9042, "text": "And like not everyone fully understands the difference."}, {"time": 9045, "text": "I think you can kind of do it both."}, {"time": 9050, "text": "And I don't know, jury's out on that one because like they're in the middle of it now."}, {"time": 9054, "text": "But it's really important to figure out what you're good at, not be full of yourself, like truly look at your track record."}, {"time": 9063, "text": "What's the saying like, it ain't bragging if you can do it."}, {"time": 9069, "text": "But too many people are delusional and like think they're better at things than they actually are, or think there's a bigger market than there actually is."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "When you confuse your passion for things with a big market, that's really scary, right?"}, {"time": 9083, "text": "Like just because you think it's cool doesn't mean that it's a big business opportunity."}, {"time": 9087, "text": "So like, what evidence do you have?"}, {"time": 9088, "text": "Again, I'm a fairly like, I'm a strict rationalist on this."}, {"time": 9092, "text": "And like sometimes people don't like working with me because I'm pretty pragmatic about things."}, {"time": 9097, "text": "Like I'm not Elon, like I don't sit and make bold proclamations about visiting Mars."}, {"time": 9104, "text": "Like that's just not how I work."}, {"time": 9106, "text": "I'm like, okay, I want to build this really cool thing that's fairly practical and I think we could do it."}, {"time": 9110, "text": "And it's in this way."}, {"time": 9112, "text": "And what's cool though is like, that's just my sweet spot."}, {"time": 9115, "text": "I'm not like, I just, I can't with a straight face talk about the metaphors."}, {"time": 9119, "text": "I can't, I just, it's not me."}, {"time": 9121, "text": "What do you think about the Facebook renaming itself to?"}, {"time": 9125, "text": "I didn't mean that as a dig."}, {"time": 9126, "text": "I just literally mean like, I'm fairly, I like to live in the next five years."}, {"time": 9131, "text": "And like, what things can I get out in a year that people will use at scale?"}, {"time": 9135, "text": "And so it's just, again, those circles I think are different for different people, but it's important to realize that like market matters, you being good at it matters and having passion for it matters."}, {"time": 9147, "text": "Your question, sorry."}, {"time": 9149, "text": "Well, on that last, on this topic in terms of funding, is there, by way of advice, was funding in your own journey helpful, unhelpful?"}, {"time": 9164, "text": "Like is there a right time to get funding, venture funding or anything, borrow some money from your parents?"},

includes yourself."}, {"time": 9190, "text": "And I'll talk about myself funding myself in a second, which is like, because I can fund myself doing whatever projects I can do, I don't really have another person putting pressure on me except for myself and that creates strange dynamics, right?"}, {"time": 9204, "text": "But let's like talk about people getting funding from a venture capitalist initially."}, {"time": 9210, "text": "We raised money from Matt Kohler at Benchmark."}, {"time": 9212, "text": "He's brilliant, amazing guy, very thoughtful."}, {"time": 9216, "text": "And he was very

just never had that."}, {"time": 9235, "text": "Matt was great."}, {"time": 9237, "text": "I think like capital these days is kind of a dime a dozen, right?"}, {"time": 9241, "text": "Like as long as you're fundable, like it seems like there's money out there is what I'm hearing."}, {"time": 9248, "text": "It's really important that you are aligned and that you think of raising money as hiring someone for your team rather than taking money if capital is plentiful, right?"}, {"time": 9258, "text": "It provides a certain amount of pressure to do the right thing that I think is healthy for any startup."}, {"time": 9264, "text": "And it keeps you real and honest because they don't wanna lose their money."}, {"time": 9267, "text": "They're paid to not lose their money."}, {"time": 9269,

was trying to figure out what I was doing after Instagram, right?"}, {"time": 9282, "text": "And I asked him something about like angel investing."}, {"time": 9284, "text": "And he looked at me with a straight face."}, {"time": 9286, "text": "He was like, why the F would I do that?"}, {"time": 9288, "text": "Like, why?"}, {"time": 9288, "text": "I was like, I don't know."}, {"time": 9290, "text":

the confidence."}, {"time": 9299, "text": "I was just like, what a novel idea."}, {"time": 9300, "text": "It's like, yeah, if you have money, like why not just put it against your bag and like enable

truth telling situation?"}, {"time": 9340, "text": "And that's part of why, by the way, I think someone like Jack, when you start Square, you have money, but you still, you bring on partners because I

little bit with language."}, {"time": 662, "text": "So with language, you develop sort of ideas, philosophies from Plato and so on."}, {"time": 667, "text": "And then you kind of leverage those

person we're communicating with is a person and they would communicate back to us."}, {"time": 721, "text": "And so we sort of hit a resonance point, right?"}, {"time": 725, "text": "When we actually agree on some concepts."}, {"time": 727, "text": "So there's a messiness to it and there's a fluidity to it."}, {"time": 730, "text": "With computing systems, when we express something to the computer and it's wrong, we just try again."}, {"time": 735, "text": "So we can basically live many virtual worlds of having failed at expressing ourselves to the computer until the one time we expressed ourselves right."}, {"time": 742, "text": "Then we kind of put in production and then discover that it's still wrong a few days down the road."}, {"time": 747, "text": "So I think the sophistication of things that we build with computing, one has to really pay attention to the difference between when an end user is expressing something onto a system that exists versus when they're extending the system to increase the system's capability for someone else to then interface with."}, {"time": 767, "text": "We happen to use the same language for both of those things in most cases, but it doesn't have to be that."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And Excel is actually a great example of this, of kind of a counterpoint to that."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Okay, so what about the idea of, you said messiness."}, {"time": 781, "text": "Wouldn't you put the software 2.0 idea, this idea of machine learning into the further and further steps into the world of messiness."}, {"time": 794, "text": "The same kind of beautiful messiness of human communication."}, {"time": 797, "text": "Isn't that what machine learning is?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "Is building on levels of abstraction that don't have messiness in them, that at the operating system level, then there's Python, the programming languages that have more and more power."}, {"time": 810, "text": "But then finally, there's neural networks that ultimately work with data."}, {"time": 818, "text": "And so the programming is almost in the space of data and the data is allowed to be messy."}, {"time": 822, "text": "Isn't that a kind of program?"}, {"time": 823, "text": "So the idea of software 2.0 is a lot of the programming happens in the space of data, so back to Excel, all roads lead back to Excel, in the space of data and also the hyperparameters of the neural networks."}, {"time": 837, "text": "And all of those allow the same kind of messiness that human communication allows."}, {"time": 844, "text": "It does, but my background is in physics."}, {"time": 847, "text": "I took like two CS courses in college."}, {"time": 849, "text": "So I don't have, now I did cram a bunch of CS in prep when I applied for grad school, but still I don't have a formal background in computer science."}, {"time": 859, "text": "But what I have observed in studying programming languages and programming systems and things like that is that there seems to be this triangle."}, {"time": 867, "text": "It's one of these beautiful little iron triangles that you find in life sometimes."}, {"time": 872, "text": "And it's the connection between the code correctness and kind of expressiveness of code, the semantics of the data, and then the kind of correctness or parameters of the underlying hardware compute system."}, {"time": 884, "text": "So there's the algorithms that you wanna apply, there's what the bits that are stored on whatever media actually represent, so the semantics of the data within the representation, and then there's what the computer can actually do."}, {"time": 899, "text": "And every programming system, every information system ultimately finds some spot in the middle of this little triangle."}, {"time": 907, "text": "Sometimes some systems collapse them into just one edge."}, {"time": 911, "text": "Are we including humans as a system in this?"}, {"time": 913, "text": "No, no, I'm just thinking about computing systems here."}, {"time": 915, "text": "And the reason I bring this up is because I believe there's no free lunch around this stuff."}, {"time": 920, "text": "So if we build machine learning systems to sort of write the correct code that is at a certain level of performance, so it'll sort of select with hyperparameters we can tune kind of how we want the performance boundary in SLA to look like for transforming some set of inputs into certain kinds of outputs."}, {"time": 939, "text": "That training process itself is intrinsically sensitive to the kinds of inputs we put into it."}, {"time": 945, "text": "It's quite sensitive to the boundary conditions we put around the performance."}, {"time": 949, "text": "So I think even as we move to using automated systems to build this transformation, as opposed to humans explicitly from a top down perspective, figuring out, well, this schema and this database and these columns get selected for this algorithm, and here we put a Fibonacci heap for some other thing."}, {"time": 964, "text": "Human design or computer design, ultimately what we hit, the boundaries that we hit with these information systems is when the representation of the data hits the real world is where there's a lot of slop and a lot of interpretation."}, {"time": 977, "text": "And that's where actually I think a lot of the work will go in the future is actually understanding kind of how to better in the view of these live data systems, how to better encode the semantics of the world for those things."}, {"time": 990, "text": "There'll be less of the details of how we write a particular SQL query."}, {"time": 993, "text": "Okay, but given the semantics of the real world and the messiness of that, what does the word correctness mean when you're talking about code?"}, {"time": 1000, "text": "There's a lot of dimensions to correctness."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "Historically, and this is one of the reasons I say that we're coming to the end of the era of software, because for the last 40 years or so, software correctness was really defined about functional correctness."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "I write a function, it's got some inputs, does it produce the right outputs?"}, {"time": 1017, "text": "If so, then I can turn it on, hook it up to the live database and it goes."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "And more and more now we have, I mean, in fact, I think the bright line in the sand between machine learning systems or modern data driven systems versus classical software systems is that the values of the input actually have to be considered with the function together to say this whole thing is correct or not."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And usually there's a performance SLA as well."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "Like did it actually finish making this?"}, {"time": 1043, "text": "What's SLA?"}, {"time": 1044, "text": "Sorry, service level agreement."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "So it has to return within some time."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "You have a 10 millisecond time budget to return a prediction of this level of accuracy, right?"}, {"time": 1052, "text": "So these are things that were not traditionally in most business computing systems for the last 20 years at all, people didn't think about it."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "But now we have value dependence on functional correctness."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "So that question of correctness is becoming a bigger and bigger question."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "What does that map to the end of software?"}, {"time": 1068, "text": "We've thought about software as just this thing that you can do in isolation with some test trial inputs and in a very sort of sandboxed environment."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "And we can quantify how does it scale?"}, {"time": 1080, "text": "How does it perform?"}, {"time": 1082, "text": "How many nodes do we need to allocate if we wanna scale this many inputs?"}, {"time": 1085, "text": "When we start

concrete?"}, {"time": 1124, "text": "Well, when I say cybernetic, I really do mean that the software itself is closing the observe, orient, decide, act loop by itself."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "So

of this, right?"}, {"time": 1151, "text": "I think everyone talking about MLAI, it's great."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "But really the thing we should be talking about is when we really enter the cybernetic era and all of the questions of ethics and governance and all correctness and all these things, they really are the most important questions."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Okay, can we just linger on this?"}, {"time": 1168, "text": "What does it mean for the human to be out of the loop in a cybernetic system, because isn't the cybernetic system that's ultimately accomplishing some kind of purpose that at the bottom, the turtles all the way down, at the bottom turtle is a human."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "Well, the human may have set some criteria, but the human wasn't precise."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "So for instance, I just read the other day that earlier this year, or maybe it was last year at some point, the Libyan army, I think, sent out some automated killer drones with explosives."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "And there was no human in the loop at that point."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "They basically put them in a geofenced area, said find any moving target, like a

lot of market microstructure, people doing all sorts of weird stuff that the market designers had never really thought about, contemplated or intended."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "So when we run these

more concerned about like the lobster being boiled?"}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So a gradual with us not noticing, collapse of civilization or a big explosion, like oops, kind of a big thing where

thing because one thing I do think we underappreciate sometimes is the fact that relationships have relationships."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "So it's not just individuals having relationships with each other."}, {"time": 3929, "text": "But if you have eight people seated around a table, right?"}, {"time": 3932, "text": "Each person has a relationship with each of the others and that's

time."}, {"time": 4315, "text": "Other people have to put up with your crap."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "Like there's just a lot of the stuff that you have to deal with if you are not so well balanced,

pretty poorly."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "And if you look at the gradient of power and money, what happens is the people closest to it will absolutely exploit their distance for personal financial

already doing this kind of thing."}, {"time": 4441, "text": "So in the future, we can have AI systems, but you're still gonna have to trust people to bridge the sense making gap to them."}, {"time":

the intellectual level."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "And that I think requires, there has to be a backstory."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "There has to be a personality."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "I

radar, right?"}, {"time": 4592, "text": "You think about how phased array radar works."}, {"time": 4594, "text": "It's just sensitivity."}, {"time": 4596, "text": "It's just radars, and then it's

things, it's a phased array of cybernetic systems that'll give the centralized intelligence much, much better, a much higher fidelity understanding of what's actually happening in the environment."},

though."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "It has no way of explaining why it's getting oxygen and sugar when it gets it."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "So you have to, each individual component has to be too

that time, we started getting called into more and more finance shops."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "They were adopting Python pretty heavily."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "I did some work on like a high frequency trading shop, working on some stuff."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "And then we worked together on some, at a couple of investment banks in Manhattan."}, {"time": 6579, "text": "And so we started seeing that there was a potential to take Python in the direction of business computing, more than just being this niche like MATLAB replacement for big vector computing."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "What we were seeing was, oh yeah, you could actually use Python as a Swiss army knife to do a lot of shadow data transformation kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "So that's when we realized the potential is much greater."}, {"time": 6600, "text": "And so we started Anaconda, I mean, it was called Continuum Analytics at the time, but we started in January of 2012 with a vision of shoring up the parts of Python that needed to get expanded to handle data at scale, to do web visualization, application development, et cetera."}, {"time": 6617, "text": "And that was that, yeah."},

"text": "Travis then left after a year to do his own thing, to do Quonsight, which was more oriented around some of the bootstrap years that we did at Continuum where it was open source and consulting."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "It wasn't sort of like gung ho product development."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "And it wasn't focused on, we accidentally stumbled into the package management problem at Anaconda, but we had a lot of other visions of other technology that we built in the open source."}, {"time": 6658, "text": "And Travis was really trying to push, again, the frontiers of numerical computing, vector computing, handling things like auto differentiation and stuff intrinsically in the open ecosystem."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "So I think that's kind of the direction he's working on in some of his work."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "We remain great friends and colleagues and collaborators, even though he's no longer day to day working at Anaconda, but he gives me a lot of

talk for a long time and then be on a conversation and be eye to eye on like 90% of things."}, {"time": 6726, "text": "And so he's someone who I believe no matter how much fog settles in over the ocean, his ship, my ship are pointed sort of in the same direction of the same star."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "Wow, that's a beautiful way to phrase it."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "No matter how much fog there is, we're pointed at the same star."}, {"time": 6740, "text": "Yeah, and I hope he feels the same way."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "I mean, I hope he knows that over the years now."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "We both care a lot about the community."}, {"time": 6747, "text": "For someone who cares so deeply, I would say this about Travis that's interesting."}, {"time": 6749, "text": "For someone who cares so deeply about the nerd details of like type system design and vector computing and efficiency of expressing this and that and the other, memory layouts and all that stuff, he cares even more about the people in the ecosystem, the community."}, {"time": 6765, "text": "And I have a similar kind of alignment."}, {"time": 6769, "text": "I care a lot about the tech, I really do."},

replicate this for humanity at scale?"}, {"time": 6785, "text": "What this open source collaboration was able to produce?"}, {"time": 6788, "text": "How can we be generative in human collaboration moving forward and create that as a civilizational kind of dynamic?"}, {"time": 6795, "text": "Like, can we seize this moment to do that?"}, {"time": 6797, "text": "Because like a lot of the other open source movements, it's all nerds nerding out on code for nerds."}, {"time": 6803, "text": "And this because it's scientists, because it's people working on data, that all of it faces real human problems."}, {"time": 6811, "text": "I think we have an opportunity to actually make a bigger impact."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "Is there a way for this kind of open source vision to make money?"}, {"time": 6820, "text": "To fund the people involved?"}, {"time": 6821, "text": "Is that an essential part of it?"}, {"time": 6823, "text": "It's hard, but we're trying to do that in our own way at Anaconda, because we know that business users, as they use more of the stuff, they have needs, like business specific needs around security, provenance."}, {"time": 6834, "text": "They really can't tell their VPs and their investors, hey, we're having, our data scientists are installing random packages from who knows where and running on customer data."}, {"time": 6844, "text": "So they have to have someone to talk to you."}, {"time": 6845, "text": "And that's what Anaconda does."}, {"time": 6847, "text": "So we are a governed source of packages for them, and that's great, that makes some money."}, {"time": 6852, "text": "We take some of that and we just take that as a dividend."}, {"time": 6856, "text": "We take a percentage of our revenues and write that as a dividend for the open source community."}, {"time": 6860, "text": "But beyond that, I really see the development of a marketplace for people to create notebooks, models, data sets, curation of these different kinds of things, and to really have a long tail marketplace dynamic with that."}, {"time": 6877, "text": "Can you speak about this problem that you stumbled into of package management, Python package management?"}, {"time": 6886, "text": "A lot of people speak very highly of Conda, which is part of Anaconda, which is a package manager."}, {"time": 6890, "text": "There's a ton of packages."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "So first, what are package managers?"}, {"time": 6895, "text": "And second, what was there before?"}, {"time": 6897, "text": "What is pip?"}, {"time": 6898, "text": "And why is Conda more awesome?"}, {"time": 6901, "text": "The package problem is this, which is that in order to do numerical computing efficiently with Python, there are a lot of low level libraries that need to be compiled, compiled with a C compiler or C++ compiler or Fortran compiler."}, {"time": 6919, "text": "They need to not just be compiled, but they need to be compiled with all of the right settings."}, {"time": 6923, "text": "And oftentimes those settings are tuned for specific chip architectures."}, {"time": 6927, "text": "And when you add GPUs to the mix, when you look at different operating systems, you may be on the same chip, but if you're running Mac versus Linux versus Windows on the same x86 chip, you compile and link differently."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "All of this complexity is beyond the capability of most data scientists to reason about."}, {"time": 6946, "text": "And it's also beyond what most of the package developers want to deal with too."}, {"time": 6951, "text": "Because if you're a package developer, you're like, I code on Linux."}, {"time": 6954, "text": "This works for me, I'm good."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "It is not my problem to figure out how to build this on an ancient version of Windows, right?"}, {"time": 6960, "text": "That's just simply not my problem."}, {"time": 6961, "text": "So what we end up with is we have a creator economy or create a very creative crowdsourced environment where people want to use this stuff, but they can't."}, {"time": 6971, "text": "And so we ended up creating a new set of technologies like a build recipe system, a build system and an installer system that is able to, well, to put it simply, it's able to build these packages correctly on each of these different kinds of platforms and operating systems, and make it so when people want to install something, they can, it's just one command."}, {"time": 6994, "text": "They don't have to set up a big compiler system and do all these things."}, {"time": 6998, "text": "So when it works well, it works great."}, {"time": 7000, "text": "Now, the difficulty is we have literally thousands of people writing code in the ecosystem, building all sorts of stuff and each person writing code, they may take a dependence on something else."}, {"time": 7010, "text": "And so you have all this web, incredibly complex web of dependencies."}, {"time": 7014, "text": "So installing the correct package for any given set of packages you want, getting that right subgraph is an incredibly hard problem."}, {"time": 7024, "text": "And again, most data scientists don't want to think about this."}, {"time": 7026, "text": "They're like, I want to install NumPy and pandas."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "I want this version of some like geospatial library."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "I want this other thing."}, {"time": 7033, "text": "Like, why is this hard?"}, {"time": 7034, "text": "These exist, right?"}, {"time": 7035, "text": "And it is hard because it's, well, you're installing this on a version of Windows, right?"}, {"time": 7040, "text": "And half of these libraries are not built for Windows or the latest version isn't available, but the old version was."}, {"time": 7046, "text": "And if you go to the old version of this library, that means you need to go to a different version of that library."}, {"time": 7050, "text": "And so the Python ecosystem, by virtue of being crowdsourced, we were able to fill a hundred thousand different niches."}, {"time": 7058, "text": "But then we also suffer this problem that because it's crowdsourced and no one, it's like a tragedy of the commons, right?"}, {"time": 7064, "text": "No one really needs, wants to support their thousands of other dependencies."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "So we end up sort of having to do a lot of this."}, {"time": 7072, "text": "And of course the conda forge community also steps up as an open source community that, you know, maintain some of these recipes."}, {"time": 7077, "text": "That's what conda does."}, {"time": 7078, "text": "Now, pip is a tool that came along after conda, to some extent, it came along as an easier way for the Python developers writing Python code that didn't have as much compiled, you know, stuff."}, {"time": 7092, "text": "They could then install different packages."}, {"time": 7095, "text": "And what ended up happening in the Python ecosystem was that a lot of the core Python and web Python developers, they never ran into any of this compilation stuff at all."}, {"time": 7104, "text": "So even we have, you know, on video, we have Guido van Rossum saying, you know what, the scientific community's packaging problems are just too exotic and different."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "I mean, you're talking about Fortran compilers, right?"}, {"time": 7115, "text": "Like you guys just need to build your own solution perhaps, right?"}, {"time": 7118, "text": "So the Python core Python community went and built its own sort of packaging technologies, not really contemplating the complexity of this stuff over here."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "And so now we have the challenge where you can pip install some things, some libraries, if you just want to get started with them, you can pip install TensorFlow and that works great."}, {"time": 7137, "text": "The instant you want to also install some other packages that use different versions of NumPy or some like graphics library or some OpenCV thing or some other thing, you now run into dependency hell because you cannot, you know, OpenCV can have a different version of libjpeg over here than PyTorch over here."}, {"time": 7154, "text": "Like they actually, they all have to use the, if you want to use GPU acceleration, they have to all use the same underlying drivers and same GPU CUDA things."}, {"time": 7160, "text": "So it's, it gets to be very gnarly and it's a level of technology that both the makers and the users don't really want to think too much about."}, {"time": 7168, "text": "And that's where you step in and try to solve this."}, {"time": 7170, "text": "We try to solve it."}, {"time": 7171, "text": "Subgraph problems."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "How much is that?"}, {"time": 7173, "text": "I mean, you said that you don't want to think, they don't want to think about it, but how much is it a little bit on the developer and providing them tools to be a little bit more clear of that subgraph of dependency that's necessary?"}, {"time": 7184, "text": "It is getting to a point where we do have to think about, look, can we pull some of the most popular packages together and get them to work on a coordinated release timeline, get them to build against the same test matrix, et cetera, et cetera, right?"}, {"time": 7197, "text": "And there is a little bit of dynamic around this, but again, it is a volunteer community."}, {"time": 7202, "text": "You know, people working on these different projects have their own timelines and their own things they're trying to meet."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "So we end up trying to pull these things together."}, {"time": 7211, "text": "And then it's this incredibly, and I would recommend just as a business tip, don't ever go into business where when your hard work works, you're invisible."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "And when it breaks because of someone else's problem, you get flagged for it."}, {"time": 7223, "text": "Because that's in our situation, right?"}, {"time": 7225, "text": "When something doesn't condensate all properly, usually it's some upstream issue, but it looks like condensate is broken."}, {"time": 7230, "text": "It looks like, you know, Anaconda screwed something up."}, {"time": 7232, "text": "When things do work though, it's like, oh yeah, cool."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "It's worked."}, {"time": 7235, "text": "Assuming naturally, of course, it's very easy to make that work, right?"}, {"time": 7238, "text": "So we end up in this kind of problematic scenario, but it's okay because I think we're still, you know, our heart's in the right place."}, {"time": 7246, "text": "We're trying to move this forward as a community sort of affair."}, {"time": 7249, "text": "I think most of the people in the community also appreciate the work we've done over the years to try to move these things forward in a collaborative fashion, so."}, {"time": 7257, "text": "One of the subgraphs of dependencies that became super complicated is the move from Python 2 to Python 3."}, {"time": 7265, "text": "So there's all these ways to mess with these kinds of ecosystems of packages and so on."}, {"time": 7271, "text": "So I just want to ask you about that particular one."}, {"time": 7273, "text": "What do you think about the move from Python 2 to 3?"}, {"time": 7278, "text": "Why did it take so long?"}, {"time": 7279, "text": "What were, from your perspective, just seeing the packages all struggle and the community all struggle through this process, what lessons do you take away from it?"}, {"time": 7289, "text": "Looking back, some people perhaps underestimated how much adoption Python 2 had."}, {"time": 7298, "text": "I think some people also underestimated how much, or they overestimated how much value some of the new features in Python 3 really provided."}, {"time": 7307, "text": "Like the things they really loved about Python 3 just didn't matter to some of these people in Python 2."}, {"time": 7312, "text": "Because this change was happening as Python, SciPy, was starting to take off really like past, like a hockey stick of adoption in the early data science era, in the early 2010s."}, {"time": 7322, "text": "A lot of people were learning and onboarding in whatever just worked."}, {"time": 7326, "text": "And the teachers were like, well, yeah, these libraries I need are not supported in Python 3 yet, I'm going to teach you Python 2."}, {"time": 7332, "text": "Took a lot of advocacy to get people to move over to Python 3."}, {"time": 7335, "text": "So I think it wasn't any particular single thing, but it was one of those death by a dozen cuts, which just really made it hard to move off of Python 2."}, {"time": 7345, "text": "And also Python 3 itself, as they were kind of breaking things and changing things around and reorganizing the standard library, there's a lot of stuff that was happening there that kept giving people an excuse to say, I'll put off till the next version."}, {"time": 7357, "text": "2 is working fine enough for me right now."}, {"time": 7359, "text": "So I think that's essentially what happened there."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "And I will say this though, the strength of the Python data science movement, I think is what kept Python alive in that transition."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "Because a lot of languages have died and left their user bases behind."}, {"time": 7376, "text": "If there wasn't the use of Python for data, there's a good chunk of Python users that during that transition, would have just left for Go and Rust and stayed."}, {"time": 7384, "text": "In fact, some people did."}, {"time": 7386, "text": "They moved to Go and Rust and they just never looked back."}, {"time": 7388, "text": "The fact that we were able to grow by millions of users, the Python data community, that is what kept the momentum for Python going."}, {"time": 7398, "text": "And now the usage of Python for data is over 50% of the overall Python user base."}, {"time": 7404, "text": "So I'm happy to debate that on stage somewhere, I don't know if they really wanna take issue with that statement, but from where I sit, I think that's true."}, {"time": 7412, "text": "The statement there, the idea is that the switch from Python 2 to Python 3 would have probably destroyed Python if it didn't also coincide with Python for whatever reason, just overtaking the data science community, anything that processes data."}, {"time": 7431, "text": "So like the timing was perfect that this maybe imperfect decision was coupled with a great timing on the value of data in our world."}, {"time": 7442, "text": "I would say the troubled execution of a good decision."}, {"time": 7444, "text": "It was a decision that was necessary."}, {"time": 7447, "text": "It's possible if we had more resources, we could have done in a way that was a little bit smoother, but ultimately, the arguments for Python 3, I bought them at the time and I buy them now, right?"}, {"time": 7457, "text": "Having great text handling is like a nonnegotiable table stakes thing you need to have in a language."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "So that's great, but the execution, Python is the, it's volunteer driven."}, {"time": 7473, "text": "It's like now the most popular language on the planet, but it's all literally volunteers."}, {"time": 7477, "text": "So the lack of resources meant that they had to really, they had to do things in a very hamstrung way."}, {"time": 7483, "text": "And I think to carry the Python momentum in the language through that time, the data movement was a critical part of that."}, {"time": 7489, "text": "So some of it is carrot and stick, I actually have to shamefully admit that it took me a very long time to switch from Python 2 and Python 3 because I'm a machine learning person."}, {"time": 7500, "text": "It was just for the longest time, you could just do fine with Python 2."}, {"time": 7504, "text": "But I think the moment where I switched everybody I worked with and switched myself for small projects and big is when finally, when NumPy announced that they're going to end support like in 2020 or something like that."}, {"time": 7523, "text": "So like when I realized, oh, this isn't going, this is going to end."}, {"time": 7528, "text": "So that's the stick, that's not a carrot."}, {"time": 7529, "text": "That's not, so for the longest time it was carrots."}, {"time": 7531, "text": "It was like all of these packages were saying, okay, we have Python 3 support now, come join us."}, {"time": 7537, "text": "We have Python 2 and Python 3, but when NumPy, one of the packages I sort of love and depend on said like, nope, it's over."}, {"time": 7547, "text": "That's when I decided to switch."}, {"time": 7550, "text": "I wonder if you think it was possible much earlier for somebody like NumPy or some major package to step into the cold and say like we're ending this."}, {"time": 7563, "text": "Well, it's a chicken and egg problem too, right?"}, {"time": 7565, "text": "You don't want to cut off a lot of users unless you see the user momentum going too."}, {"time": 7569, "text": "So the decisions for the scientific community for each of the different projects, you know, there's not a monolith."}, {"time": 7575, "text": "Some projects are like, we'll only be releasing new features on Python 3."}, {"time": 7578, "text": "And that was more of a sticky carrot, right?"}, {"time": 7581, "text": "A firm carrot, if you will, a firm carrot."}, {"time": 7586, "text": "A stick shaped carrot."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "But then for others, yeah, NumPy in particular, cause it's at the base of the dependency stack for so many things, that was the final stick."}, {"time": 7596, "text": "That was a stick shaped stick."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "People were saying, look, if I have to keep maintaining my releases for Python 2, that's that much less energy that I can put into making things better for the Python 3 folks or in my new version, which is of course going to be Python 3."}, {"time": 7609, "text": "So people were also getting kind of pulled by this tension."}, {"time": 7613, "text": "So the overall community sort of had a lot of input into when the NumPy core folks decided that they would end of life on Python 2."}, {"time": 7621, "text": "So as these numbers are a little bit loose, but there are about 10 million Python programmers in the world, you could argue that number, but let's say 10 million."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "That's actually where I was looking, said 27 million total programmers, developers in the world."}, {"time": 7637, "text": "You mentioned in a talk that changes need to be made for there to be 100 million Python programmers."}, {"time": 7644, "text": "So first of all, do you see a future where there's 100 million Python programmers?"}, {"time": 7648, "text": "And second, what kind of changes need to be made?"}, {"time": 7651, "text": "So Anaconda and Miniconda get downloaded about a million times a week."}, {"time": 7654, "text": "So I think the idea that there's only 10 million Python programmers in the world is a little bit undercounting."}, {"time": 7661, "text": "There are a lot of people who escape traditional counting that are using Python and data in their jobs."}, {"time": 7668, "text": "I do believe that the future world for it to, well, the world I would like to see is one where people are data literate."}, {"time": 7676, "text": "So they are able to use tools that let them express their questions and ideas fluidly."}, {"time": 7683, "text": "And the data variety and data complexity will not go down."}, {"time": 7686, "text": "It will only keep increasing."}, {"time": 7688, "text": "So I think some level of code or code like things will continue to be relevant."}, {"time": 7695, "text": "And so my hope is that we can build systems that allow people to more seamlessly integrate Python kinds of expressivity with data systems and operationalization methods that are much more seamless."}, {"time": 7711, "text": "And what I mean by that is, you know, right now you can't punch Python code into an Excel cell."}, {"time": 7715, "text": "I mean, there's some tools you can do to kind of do this."}, {"time": 7717, "text": "We didn't build a thing for doing this back in the day, but I feel like the total addressable market for Python users, if we do the things right, is on the order of the Excel users, which is, you know, a few hundred million."}, {"time": 7731, "text": "So I think Python has to get better at being embedded, you know, being a smaller thing that pulls in just the right parts of the ecosystem to run numerics and do data exploration, meeting people where they're already at with their data and their data tools."}, {"time": 7749, "text": "And then I think also it has to be easier to take some of those things they've written and flow those back into deployed systems or little apps or visualizations."}, {"time": 7759, "text": "I think if we don't do those things, then we will always be kept in a silo as sort of an expert user's tool and not a tool for the masses."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "You know, I work with a bunch of folks in the Adobe Creative Suite, and I'm kind of forcing them or inspired them to learn Python, to do a bunch of stuff that helps them."}, {"time": 7778, "text": "And it's interesting, because they probably wouldn't call themselves Python programmers, but they're all using Python."}, {"time": 7783, "text": "I would love it if the tools like Photoshop and Premiere and all those kinds of tools that are targeted towards creative people, I guess that's where Excel, Excel is targeted towards a certain kind of audience that works with data, financial people, all that kind of stuff, if there would be easy ways to leverage to use Python for quick scripting tasks."}, {"time": 7803, "text": "And you know, there's an exciting application of artificial intelligence in this space that I'm hopeful about, looking at open AI codecs with generating programs."}, {"time": 7848, "text": "So that to me is a really exciting possibility, because I think there's a friction to kind of, like how do I learn how to use Python in my life?"}, {"time": 7858, "text": "There's oftentimes you kind of start a class, you start learning about types, I don't know, functions."}, {"time": 7867, "text": "Like this is, you know, Python is the first language with which you start to learn to program."}, {"time": 7871, "text": "But I feel like that's going to take a long time for you to understand why it's useful."}, {"time": 7878, "text": "You almost want to start with a script."}, {"time": 7880, "text": "Well, you do, in fact."}, {"time": 7882, "text": "I think starting with the theory behind programming languages and types and all that, I mean, types are there to make the compiler writer's jobs easier."}, {"time": 7890, "text": "Types are not, I mean, heck, do you have an ontology of types or just the objects on this table?"}, {"time": 7895, "text": "So types are there because compiler writers are human and they're limited in what they can do."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "But I think that the beauty of scripting, like there's a Python book that's called \"'Automate the Boring Stuff,' which is exactly the right mentality."}, {"time": 7911, "text": "I grew up with computers in a time when I could, when Steve Jobs was still pitching these things as bicycles for the mind."}, {"time": 7919, "text": "They were supposed to not be just media consumption devices, but they were actually, you could write some code."}, {"time": 7925, "text": "You could write basic, you could write some stuff to do some things."}, {"time": 7929, "text": "And that feeling of a computer as a thing that we can use to extend ourselves has all but evaporated for a lot of people."}, {"time": 7937, "text": "So you see a little bit in parts in the current, the generation of youth around Minecraft or Roblox, right?"}, {"time": 7943, "text": "And I think Python, circuit Python, these things could be a renaissance of that, of people actually shaping and using their computers as computers, as an extension of their minds and their curiosity, their creativity."}, {"time": 7957, "text": "So you talk about scripting the Adobe Suite with Python in the 3D graphics world."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "Python is a scripting language that some of these 3D graphics suites use."}, {"time": 7968, "text": "And I think that's great."}, {"time": 7969, "text": "We should better support those kinds of things."}, {"time": 7971, "text": "But ultimately the idea that I should be able to have power over my computing environment."}, {"time": 7976, "text": "If I want these things to happen repeatedly all the time, I should be able to say that somehow to the computer, right?"}, {"time": 7982, "text": "Now, whether the operating systems get there faster by having some Siri backed with open AI with whatever."}, {"time": 7989, "text": "So you can just say, Siri, make this do this and this and every other Friday, right?"}, {"time": 7992, "text": "We probably will get there somewhere."}, {"time": 7994, "text": "And Apple's always had these ideas."}, {"time": 7995, "text": "There's the Apple script in the menu that no one ever uses, but you can do these kinds of things."}, {"time": 8001, "text": "But when you start doing that kind of scripting, the challenge isn't learning the type system or even the syntax of the language."}, {"time": 8007, "text": "The challenge is all of the dictionaries and all the objects of all their properties and attributes and parameters."}, {"time": 8012, "text": "Like who's got time to learn all that stuff, right?"}, {"time": 8015, "text": "So that's when then programming by prototype or by example becomes the right way to get the user to express their desire."}, {"time": 8023, "text": "So there's a lot of these different ways that we can approach programming."}, {"time": 8026, "text": "But I do think when, as you were talking about the Adobe scripting thing, I was thinking about, you know, when we do use something like NumPy, when we use things in the Python data and scientific, let's say, expression system, there's a reason we use that, which is that it gives us mathematical precision."}, {"time": 8044, "text": "It gives us actually quite a lot of precision over precisely what we mean about this data set, that data set, and it's the fact that we can have that precision that lets Python be powerful over as a duct tape for data."}, {"time": 8058, "text": "You know, you give me a TSV or a CSV, and if you give me some massively expensive vendor tool for data transformation, I don't know I'm gonna be able to solve your problem."}, {"time": 8068, "text": "But if you give me a Python prompt, you can throw whatever data you want at me."}, {"time": 8072, "text": "I will be able to mash it into shape."}, {"time": 8074, "text": "So that ability to take it as sort of this like, you know, machete out into the data jungle is really powerful."}, {"time": 8081, "text": "And I think that's why at some level, we're not gonna get away from some of these expressions and APIs and libraries in Python for data transformation."}, {"time": 8093, "text": "You've been at the center of the Python community for many years."}, {"time": 8098, "text": "If you could change one thing about the community to help it grow, to help it improve, to help it flourish and prosper, what would it be?"}, {"time": 8109, "text": "I mean, you know, it doesn't have to be one thing, but what kind of comes to mind?"}, {"time": 8115, "text": "Humility is one of the values that we have at Anaconda at the company, but it's also one of the values in the community."}, {"time": 8121, "text": "That it's been breached a little bit in the last few years, but in general, people are quite decent and reasonable and nice."}, {"time": 8129, "text": "And that humility prevents them from seeing the greatness that they could have."}, {"time": 8136, "text": "I don't know how many people in the core Python community really understand that they stand perched at the edge of an opportunity to transform how people use computers."}, {"time": 8150, "text": "And actually, PyCon, I think it's the last physical PyCon I went to, Russell Keith McGee gave a great keynote about very much along the lines of the challenges I have, which is Python, for a language that doesn't actually, that can't put an interface up, put an interface up on the most popular computing devices, it's done really well as a language, hasn't it?"}, {"time": 8171, "text": "You can't write a web front end with Python, really."}, {"time": 8173, "text": "I mean, everyone uses JavaScript."}, {"time": 8175, "text": "You certainly can't write native apps."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "So for a language that you can't actually write apps in any of those front end runtime environments, Python's done exceedingly well."}, {"time": 8186, "text": "And so that wasn't to pat ourselves on the back."}, {"time": 8188, "text": "That was to challenge ourselves as a community to say, we, through our current volunteer dynamic, have gotten to this point."}, {"time": 8194, "text": "What comes next and how do we seize, you know, we've caught the tiger by the tail."}, {"time": 8198, "text": "How do we make sure we keep up with it as it goes forward?"}, {"time": 8200, "text": "So that's one of the questions I have about sort of open source communities, is at its best, there's a kind of humility."}, {"time": 8208, "text": "Is that humility prevent you to have a vision for creating something like very new and powerful?"}, {"time": 8215, "text": "And you've brought us back to consciousness again."}, {"time": 8217, "text": "The collaboration is a swarm emergent dynamic."}, {"time": 8220, "text": "Humility lets these people work together without anyone trouncing anyone else."}, {"time": 8224, "text": "How do they, you know, in consciousness, there's the question of the binding problem."}, {"time": 8228, "text": "How does a singular, our attention, how does that emerge from billions of neurons?"}, {"time": 8233, "text": "So how can you have a swarm of people emerge a consensus that has a singular vision to say, we will do this."}, {"time": 8240, "text": "And most importantly, we're not gonna do these things."}, {"time": 8243, "text": "Emerging a coherent, pointed, focused leadership dynamic from a collaboration, being able to do that kind of, and then dissolve it so people can still do the swarm thing, that's a problem, that's a question."}, {"time": 8257, "text": "So do you have to have a charismatic leader?"}, {"time": 8260, "text": "For some reason, Linus Torvald comes to mind, but there's people who criticize."}, {"time": 8264, "text": "He rules with an iron fist, man."}, {"time": 8266, "text": "But there's still charisma to it."}, {"time": 8268, "text": "There is charisma, right?"}, {"time": 8269, "text": "There's a charisma to that iron fist."}, {"time": 8271, "text": "There's, every leader's different, I would say, in their success."}, {"time": 8276, "text": "So he doesn't, I don't even know if you can say he doesn't have humility, there's such a meritocracy of ideas that like, this is a good idea and this is a bad idea."}, {"time": 8290, "text": "There's a step function to it."}, {"time": 8291, "text": "Once you clear a threshold, he's open."}, {"time": 8293, "text": "Once you clear the bozo threshold, he's open to your ideas, I think, right?"}, {"time": 8297, "text": "But see, the interesting thing is obviously that will not stand in an open source community if that threshold that is defined by that one particular person is not actually that good."}, {"time": 8310, "text": "So you actually have to be really excellent at what you do."}, {"time": 8313, "text": "So he's very good at what he does."}, {"time": 8317, "text": "And so there's some aspect of leadership where you can get thrown out, people can just leave."}, {"time": 8322, "text": "That's how it works with open source, the fork."}, {"time": 8325, "text": "But at the same time, you want to sometimes be a leader like with a strong opinion, because people, I mean, there's some kind of balance here for this like hive mind to get like behind."}, {"time": 8337, "text": "Leadership is a big topic."}, {"time": 8338, "text": "And I didn't, I'm not one of these guys that went to MBA school and said, I'm gonna be an entrepreneur and I'm gonna be a leader."},

nerd who then really like nerded out on Python."}, {"time": 8353, "text": "And now I am entrepreneurial, right?"}, {"time": 8354, "text": "I saw a business opportunity around the use of Python for data."}, {"time": 8357, "text": "But for me, what has been interesting over this journey with the last 10 years is how much I started really enjoying the understanding, thinking deeper about organizational dynamics and leadership."}, {"time": 8371, "text": "And leadership does come down to a few core things."}, {"time": 8375, "text": "Number one, a leader has to create belief or at least has to dispel disbelief."}, {"time": 8384, "text": "Leadership also, you have to have vision, loyalty and experience."}, {"time": 8389, "text": "So can you say belief in a singular vision?"}, {"time": 8392, "text": "Like what does belief mean?"}, {"time": 8393, "text": "Yeah, belief means a few things."}, {"time": 8395, "text": "Belief means here's what we need to do and this is a valid thing to do and we can do it."}, {"time": 8401, "text": "That you have to be able to drive that belief."}, {"time": 8406, "text": "And every step of leadership along the way has to help you amplify that belief to more people."}, {"time": 8412, "text": "I mean, I think at a fundamental level, that's what it is."}, {"time": 8415, "text": "You have to have a vision."}, {"time": 8417, "text": "You have to be able to show people that, or you have to convince people to believe in the vision and to get behind you."}, {"time": 8425, "text": "And that's where the loyalty part comes in and the experience part comes in."}, {"time": 8428, "text": "There's all different flavors of leadership."}, {"time": 8430, "text": "So if we talk about Linus, we could talk about Elon Musk and Steve Jobs, there's Sunder Prachai."}, {"time": 8438, "text": "There's people that kind of put themselves at the center and are strongly opinionated."}, {"time": 8442, "text": "And some people are more like consensus builders."}, {"time": 8445, "text": "What works well for open source?"}, {"time": 8447, "text": "What works well in the space of programmers?"}, {"time": 8449, "text": "So you've been a programmer, you've led many programmers that are now sort of at the center of this ecosystem."}, {"time": 8455, "text": "What works well in the programming world would you say?"}, {"time": 8458, "text": "It really depends on the people."}, {"time": 8461, "text": "What style of leadership is best?"}, {"time": 8462, "text": "And it depends on the programming community."}, {"time": 8464, "text": "I think for the Python community, servant leadership is one of the values."}, {"time": 8468, "text": "At the end of the day, the leader has to also be the high priest of values, right?"}, {"time": 8474, "text": "So any collection of people has values of their living."}, {"time": 8479, "text": "And if you want to maintain certain values and those values help you as an organization become more powerful, then the leader has to live those values unequivocally and has to hold the values."}, {"time": 8493, "text": "So in our case, in this collaborative community around Python, I think that the humility is one of those values."}, {"time": 8502, "text": "Servant leadership, you actually have to kind of do the stuff."}, {"time": 8505, "text": "You have to walk the walk, not just talk the talk."}, {"time": 8509, "text": "I don't feel like the Python community really demands that much from a vision standpoint."}, {"time": 8513, "text": "And they should."}, {"time": 8514, "text": "And I think they should."}, {"time": 8516, "text": "This is the interesting thing is like so many people use Python, from where comes the vision?"}, {"time": 8524, "text": "You know, like you have a Elon Musk type character who makes bold statements about the vision for particular companies he's involved with."}, {"time": 8534, "text": "And it's like, I think a lot of people that work at those companies kind of can only last if they believe that vision."}, {"time": 8544, "text": "And some of it is super bold."}, {"time": 8546, "text": "So my question is, and by the way, those companies often use Python."}, {"time": 8552, "text": "How do you establish a vision?"}, {"time": 8553, "text": "Like get to 100 million users, right?"}, {"time": 8557, "text": "Get to where, you know, the Python is at the center of the machine learning and was it data science, machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence revolution, right?"}, {"time": 8571, "text": "Like in many ways, perhaps the Python community is not thinking of it that way, but it's leading the way on this."}, {"time": 8578, "text": "Like the tooling is like essential."}, {"time": 8581, "text": "Right, well, you know, for a while, PyCon people in the scientific Python and the PyData community, they would submit talks."}, {"time": 8589, "text": "Those are early 2010s, mid 2010s."}, {"time": 8592, "text": "They would submit talks for PyCon and the talks would all be rejected because there was the separate sort of PyData conferences."}, {"time": 8598, "text": "And like, well, these probably belong more to PyData."}, {"time": 8601, "text": "And instead there'd be yet another talk about, you know, threads and, you know, whatever, some web framework."}, {"time": 8606, "text": "And it's like, that was an interesting dynamic to see that there was, I mean, at the time it was a little annoying because we wanted to try to get more users and get more people talking about these things."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "And PyCon is a huge venue, right?"}, {"time": 8617, "text": "It's thousands of Python programmers."}, {"time": 8620, "text": "But then also came to appreciate that, you know, parallel, having an ecosystem that allows parallel innovation is not bad, right?"}, {"time": 8627, "text": "There are people doing embedded Python stuff."}, {"time": 8629, "text": "There's people doing web programming, people doing scripting, there's cyber uses of Python."}, {"time": 8633, "text": "I think the, ultimately at some point, if your slide mold covers so much stuff, you have to respect that different things are growing in different areas and different niches."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "Now, at some point that has to come together and the central body has to provide resources."}, {"time": 8647, "text": "The principle here is subsidiarity."}, {"time": 8649, "text": "Give resources to the various groups to then allocate as they see fit in their niches."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "That would be a really helpful dynamic."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "But again, it's a volunteer community."}, {"time": 8657, "text": "It's not like they had that many resources to start with."}, {"time": 8661, "text": "What was or is your favorite programming setup?"}, {"time": 8663, "text": "What operating system, what keyboard, how many screens are you listening to?"}, {"time": 8669, "text": "What time of day are you drinking coffee, tea?"}, {"time": 8672, "text": "Tea, sometimes coffee, depending on how well I slept."}, {"time": 8676, "text": "I used to have."}, {"time": 8677, "text": "How much sleep do you get?"}, {"time": 8678, "text": "Are you a night owl?"}, {"time": 8679, "text": "I remember somebody asked you somewhere, a question about work life balance."}, {"time": 8684, "text": "Not just work life balance, but like a family, you lead a company and your answer was basically like, I still haven't figured it out."}, {"time": 8694, "text": "Yeah, I think I've gotten to a little bit better balance."}, {"time": 8696, "text": "I have a really great leadership team now supporting me and so that takes a lot of the day to day stuff off my plate and my kids are getting a little older."}, {"time": 8705, "text": "So, and of course I have a wonderful wife who takes care of a lot of the things that I'm not able to take care of and she's great."}, {"time": 8711, "text": "I try to get to sleep earlier now because I have to get up every morning at six to take my kid down to the bus stop."}, {"time": 8717, "text": "So there's a hard thing."}, {"time": 8719, "text": "For a while I was doing polyphasic sleep, which is really interesting."}, {"time": 8722, "text": "Like I go to bed at nine, wake up at like 2 a.m., work till five, sleep three hours, wake up at eight."}, {"time": 8727, "text": "Like that was actually, it was interesting."}, {"time": 8729, "text": "It wasn't too bad."}, {"time": 8732, "text": "I didn't keep it up for years, but once I have travel, then it just, everything goes out the window, right?"}, {"time": 8737, "text": "Because then you're like time zones and all these things."}, {"time": 8739, "text": "Socially was it, except like were you able to live outside of how you felt?"}, {"time": 8743, "text": "Were you able to live normal society?"}, {"time": 8745, "text": "Oh yeah, because like on the nights that I wasn't out hanging out with people or whatever, going to bed at nine, no one cares."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "I wake up at two, I'm still responding to their slacks, emails, whatever, and you know, shitposting on Twitter or whatever at two in the morning is great, right?"}, {"time": 8759, "text": "And then you go to bed for a few hours and you wake up, it's like you had an extra day in the middle."}, {"time": 8764, "text": "And I'd read somewhere that humans naturally have biphasic sleep or something, I don't know."}, {"time": 8769, "text": "I read basically everything somewhere."}, {"time": 8771, "text": "So every option of everything."}, {"time": 8773, "text": "Every option of everything."}, {"time": 8774, "text": "I will say that that worked out for me for a while, although I don't do it anymore."}, {"time": 8778,

they're all on iPhone and a Mac and it's like, yeah, like what, there is a messiness to windows and a messiness to Linux that makes me feel like you're still in it."}, {"time": 8911, "text": "Well, the Linux stuff, windows subsystem for Linux is very tempting, but there's still the windows on the outside where I don't know where, and I've been, okay, I've used DOS since version 1.11 or 1.21 or

details behind something when something screws up as an invariably does and just things like changing group permissions on some shared folders and stuff, just everything seems a little bit more awkward, more clicks than it needs to be."}, {"time": 8946, "text": "Not to say that there aren't weird things like hidden attributes and all this other happy stuff on Mac, but for the most part, and well, actually, especially now with the new hardware coming out on Mac, it'll be very interesting with the new M1."}, {"time": 8960, "text": "There were some dark years in the last few years when I was like, I think maybe I have to move off of Mac as a platform, but this, I mean, like my keyboard was just not working."}, {"time": 8969, "text": "Like literally my keyboard just wasn't working, right?"}, {"time": 8971, "text": "I had this touch bar, didn't have a physical escape button like I needed to because I used Vim, and now I think we're back, so."}, {"time": 8977, "text": "So you use Vim and you have a, what kind of keyboard?"}, {"time": 8980, "text": "So I use a RealForce 87U, it's a mechanical, it's a Topre keyswitch."}, {"time": 8985, "text": "Like it's a weird shape, there's a normal shape, okay."}, {"time": 8988, "text": "Well, no, because I say that because I use a Kinesis, and you said some dark, you said you had dark moments."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "I recently had a dark moment, I was like, what am I doing with my life?"}, {"time": 8998, "text": "So I remember sort of flying in a very kind of tight space, and as I'm working, this is what I do on an airplane."},

who I am?"}, {"time": 9013, "text": "Is this what I'm becoming?"}, {"time": 9015, "text": "Will I be this person?"}, {"time": 9016, "text": "Because I'm on Emacs with this Kinesis keyboard, sitting like with everybody around."}, {"time": 9021, "text": "Emacs on Windows."}, {"time": 9023, "text": "On WSL, yeah."}, {"time": 9025, "text": "Yeah, Emacs on Linux on Windows."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "Yeah, on Windows."}, {"time": 9028, "text": "And like everybody around me is using their iPhone to look at TikTok."}, {"time": 9033, "text": "So I'm like in this land, and I thought, you know what?"}, {"time": 9036, "text": "Maybe I need to become an adult and put the 90s behind me, and use like a normal keyboard."}, {"time": 9043, "text": "And then I did some soul searching, and I decided

last code I wrote."}, {"time": 9093, "text": "Also, I wrote some code to do some cap table evaluation, waterfall modeling kind of stuff."}, {"time": 9099, "text": "What advice would you give to a

that about America, but America is a very stratified and classist society."}, {"time": 9194, "text": "There's some mobility, but it's really quite classist."}, {"time": 9197, "text": "And in America, unless you're in the upper middle class, you are headed into very choppy waters."}, {"time": 9203, "text": "So it is really, really good to think and understand the fundamentals of what you need to build a meaningful life for you, your loved ones, with your family."}, {"time": 9215, "text": "And almost all of the technology being created that's consumer facing is designed to own people, to take the four stack of people, to delaminate them, and to own certain portions of that stack."}, {"time": 9230, "text": "And so if you want to be an integral human being, if you want to have your agency and you want to find your own way in the world, when you're young would be a great time to spend time looking at some of the classics around what it means to live a good life, what it means to build connection with people."}, {"time": 9248, "text": "And so much of the status game, so much of the stuff, one of the things that I sort of talk about as we create more and more technology, there's a gradient of technology, and a gradient of technology always leads to a gradient of power."}, {"time": 9262, "text": "And this is Jacques Leleu's point to some extent as well."}, {"time": 9265, "text":

the world gets more and more technological, it will create more and more gradients where people will seize power, economic fortunes."}, {"time": 9288, "text": "And the way they make the people who are left behind okay with their lot in life is they create lottery systems."}, {"time": 9294, "text": "They make you take part in the narrative of your own being trapped in your own economic sort of

these are the things I would tell young people."}, {"time": 9312, "text": "It's a dark message, but it's realism."}, {"time": 9314, "text": "I mean, that's what I see."}, {"time": 9315, "text": "So after you gave some realism, you sit back."}, {"time": 9318, "text": "You sit back with your son."}, {"time": 9319, "text": "You're looking out at the sunset."}, {"time": 9321, "text": "What to him can you give as words of hope and to you from where do you derive hope for the future of our world?"}, {"time": 9332, "text": "So you said at the individual level, you have to have a pioneer mindset to go back to the classics, to understand what is in human nature you can find meaning."}, {"time": 9341, "text": "But at the societal level, what trajectory, when you look up possible trajectories, what gives you hope?"}, {"time": 9347, "text": "What gives me hope is that we have little tremors now shaking people out of the reverie of the fiction of modernity that they've been living in, kind of a late 20th century style modernity."}, {"time": 9360, "text": "That's good, I think."}, {"time": 9362, "text": "Because, and also to your point earlier, people are burning out on some of the social media stuff."}, {"time": 9368, "text": "They're sort of seeing the ugly side, especially the latest news with Facebook and the whistleblower, right?"}, {"time": 9372, "text": "It's quite clear these things are not all they're cracked up to be."}, {"time": 9376, "text": "Do you believe, I believe better social media can be built because they are burning out and it'll incentivize other competitors to be built."}, {"time": 9386, "text": "Well, the thing about it is that when you have extractive return on returns capital coming in and saying, look, you own a network, give me some exponential dynamics out of this network."}, {"time": 9399, "text": "What are you gonna do?"}, {"time": 9399, "text": "You're gonna just basically put a toll keeper at every single node and every single graph edge, every node, every vertex, every edge."}, {"time": 9408, "text": "But if you don't have that need for it, if no one's sitting there saying, hey, Wikipedia, monetize every character, every byte, every phrase, then generative human dynamics will naturally sort of arise, assuming we respect a few principles around online communications."}, {"time": 9423, "text": "So the greatest and biggest social network in the world is still like email, SMS, right?"}, {"time": 9428, "text": "So we're fine there."}, {"time": 9430, "text": "The issue with the social media, as we call it now, is they're actually just new amplification systems, right?"}, {"time": 9436, "text": "Now it's benefited certain people like yourself who have interesting content to be amplified."}, {"time": 9443, "text": "So it's created a creator economy, and that's cool."}, {"time": 9445, "text": "There's a lot of great content out there."}, {"time": 9446, "text": "But giving everyone a shot at the fame lottery, saying, hey, you could also have your, if you wiggle your butt the right way on TikTok, you can have your 15 seconds of micro fame."}, {"time": 9456, "text": "That's not healthy for society at large."}, {"time": 9458, "text": "So I think if we can create tools that help people be conscientious about their attention, spend time looking at the past, and really retrieving memory and calling, not calling, but processing and thinking about that, I think that's certainly possible, and hopefully that's what we get."}, {"time": 9477, "text": "So the bigger question that you're asking about what gives me hope is that these early shocks of COVID lockdowns and remote work and all these different kinds of things, I think it's getting people to a point where they're sort of no longer in the reverie."}, {"time": 9499, "text": "As my friend Jim Rutt says, there's more people with ears to hear now."}, {"time": 9503, "text": "With the pandemic and education, everyone's like, wait, wait, what have you guys been doing with my kids?"}, {"time": 9508, "text": "How are you teaching them?"}, {"time": 9510, "text": "What is this crap you're giving them as homework?"}, {"time": 9512, "text": "So I think these are the kinds of things that are getting, and the supply chain disruptions, getting more people to think about, how do we actually just make stuff?"}, {"time": 9520, "text": "This is all good, but the concern is that it's still gonna take a while for these things, for people to learn how to be agentic again, and to be in right relationship with each other and with the world."}, {"time": 9535, "text": "So the message of hope is still people are resilient, and we are building some really amazing technology."}, {"time": 9541, "text": "And I also, to me, I derive a lot of hope from individuals in that van."}, {"time": 9548, "text": "The power of a single individual to transform the world, to do positive things for the world is quite incredible."}, {"time": 9554, "text": "Now you've been talking about, it's nice to have as many of those individuals as possible, but even the power of one, it's kind of magical."}, {"time": 9562, "text": "We're in a mode now where we can do that."}, {"time": 9564, "text": "I think also, part of what I try to do is in coming to podcasts like yours, and then spamming with all this philosophical stuff that I've got going on, there are a lot of good people out there trying to put words around the current technological, social, economic crises that we're facing."}, {"time": 9583, "text": "And in the space of a few short years, I think there has been a lot of great content produced around this stuff."}, {"time": 9587, "text": "For people who wanna see, wanna find out more, or think more about this, we're popularizing certain kinds of philosophical ideas that move people beyond just the, oh, you're communist, oh, you're capitalist kind of stuff."}, {"time": 9598, "text": "Like it's sort of, we're way past that now."}, {"time": 9601, "text": "So that also gives me hope, that I feel like I myself am getting a handle on how to think about these things."}, {"time": 9608, "text": "It makes me feel like I can, hopefully affect
