[{"title": "Douglas Lenat: Cyc and the Quest to Solve Common Sense Reasoning in AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #221", "id": "3wMKoSRbGVs", "quotes": [{"time": 342, "text": "We'll run over that."}, {"time": 342, "text": "And so that was a safe thing for us to do."}, {"time": 347, "text": "Now, that's the kind of thing that's going to happen maybe once in your life."}, {"time": 352, "text": "But the point is that there's almost no telling what little bits of knowledge about the world you might actually need in some situations which were unforeseen."}, {"time": 361, "text": "But see, when you sit on that mountain or that ground that goes deep of knowledge in order to make a split second decision about fast food trash or random trash from the back of a trash truck, you need to be able to leverage that ground you stand on in some way."}, {"time": 386, "text": "It's not merely, you know, it's not enough to just have a lot of ground to stand on."}, {"time": 391, "text": "It's your ability to leverage it, to utilize in a split, like integrate it all together to make that split second decision."}, {"time": 398, "text": "And I suppose understanding isn't just having a common sense knowledge to access."}, {"time": 405, "text": "It's the act of accessing it somehow, like correctly filtering out the parts of the knowledge that are not useful, selecting only the useful parts and effectively making conclusive decisions."}, {"time": 422, "text": "So let's tease apart two different tasks really, both of which are incredibly important and even necessary."}, {"time": 430, "text": "If you're going to have this in a useful, usable fashion as opposed to say like library books sitting on a shelf and so on, where the knowledge might be there, but if a fire comes, the books are going to burn because they don't know what's in them and they're just going to sit there while they burn."}, {"time": 451, "text": "So there are two aspects of using the knowledge."}, {"time": 458, "text": "One is a kind of a theoretical, how is it possible at all?"}, {"time": 458, "text": "And then the second aspect of what you said is, how can you do it quickly enough?"}, {"time": 465, "text": "So how can you do it at all is something that philosophers have grappled with."}, {"time": 471, "text": "And fortunately, philosophers 100 years ago and even earlier developed a kind of formal language like English."}, {"time": 478, "text": "It's called predicate logic or first order logic or something like predicate calculus and so on."}, {"time": 490, "text": "So there's a way of representing things in this formal language which enables a mechanical procedure to sort of grind through and algorithmically produce all of the same logical entailments, all the same logical conclusions that you or I would from that same set of pieces of information that are represented that way."}, {"time": 521, "text": "So that sort of raises a couple questions."}, {"time": 521, "text": "One is, how do you get all this information from say observations and English and so on into this logical form?"}, {"time": 528, "text": "And secondly, how can you then efficiently run these algorithms to actually get the information you need?"}, {"time": 541, "text": "In the case I mentioned in a 10th of a second rather than say in 10 hours or 10,000 years of computation."}, {"time": 548, "text": "And those are both really important questions."}, {"time": 548, "text": "And like a corollary addition to the first one is, how many such things do you need to gather for it to be useful in certain contexts?"}, {"time": 562, "text": "So like what, in order, you mentioned philosophers, in order to capture this world and represent it in a logical way and with a form of logic, like how many statements are required?"}, {"time": 576, "text": "Is it five?"}, {"time": 576, "text": "Is it 10?"}, {"time": 576, "text": "Is it 10 trillion?"}, {"time": 576, "text": "Is it like that?"}, {"time": 576, "text": "That's as far as I understand is probably still an open question."}, {"time": 583, "text": "It may forever be an open question just to say like definitively about, to describe the universe perfectly."}, {"time": 590, "text": "How many facts do you need?"}, {"time": 594, "text": "I guess I'm going to disappoint you by giving you an actual answer to your question."}, {"time": 600, "text": "Well, no, this sounds exciting."}, {"time": 603, "text": "So now we have like three things to talk about."}, {"time": 609, "text": "We'll keep adding more."}, {"time": 610, "text": "Although it's okay."}, {"time": 610, "text": "The first and the third are related."}, {"time": 610, "text": "So let's leave the efficiency question aside for now."}, {"time": 616, "text": "So how does all this information get represented in logical form?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "So that these algorithms, resolution theorem proving and other algorithms can actually grind through all the logical consequences of what you said."}, {"time": 630, "text": "And that ties into your question about how many of these things do you need?"}, {"time": 637, "text": "Because if the answer is small enough, then by hand, you could write them out one at a time."}, {"time": 643, "text": "So in the early 1984, I held a meeting at Stanford where I was a faculty member there, where we assembled about half a dozen of the smartest people I know."}, {"time": 665, "text": "People like Alan Newell and Marvin Minsky and Alan Kay and a few others."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Was Feynman there by chance?"}, {"time": 675, "text": "Because he commented about your system, Eurisco, at the time."}, {"time": 680, "text": "No, he wasn't part of this meeting."}, {"time": 683, "text": "That's a heck of a meeting anyway."}, {"time": 685, "text": "I think Ed Feigenbaum was there."}, {"time": 685, "text": "I think Josh Lederberg was there."}, {"time": 685, "text": "So we have all these different smart people."}, {"time": 727, "text": "And I expected there would be an enormous divergence of opinion and computation."}, {"time": 727, "text": "But amazingly, everyone got an answer which was around a million."}, {"time": 734, "text": "And one person got the answer by saying, well, look, you can only burn into human long term memory a certain number of things per unit time, like maybe one every 30 seconds or something."}, {"time": 750, "text": "And other than that, it's just short term memory and it flows away like water and so on."}, {"time": 756, "text": "So by the time you're, say, 10 years old or so, how many things could you possibly have burned into your long term memory?"}, {"time": 762, "text": "And it's like about a million."}, {"time": 767, "text": "Another person went in a completely different direction and said, well, if you look at the number of words in a dictionary, not a whole dictionary, but for someone to essentially be considered to be fluent in a language, how many words would they need to know?"}, {"time": 780, "text": "And then about how many things about each word would you have to tell it?"}, {"time": 785, "text": "And so they got to a million that way."}, {"time": 790, "text": "Another person said, well, let's actually look at one single short, one volume desk encyclopedia article."}, {"time": 800, "text": "And so we'll look at what was like a four paragraph article or something."}, {"time": 807, "text": "I think about grebes."}, {"time": 807, "text": "Grebes are a type of waterfowl."}, {"time": 807, "text": "And if we were going to sit there and represent every single thing that was there, how many assertions or rules or statements would we have to write in this logical language and so on and then multiply that by all of the number of articles that there were and so on."}, {"time": 826, "text": "So all of these estimates came out with a million."}, {"time": 826, "text": "And so if you do the math, it turns out that like, oh, well, then maybe in something like 100 person years in one or two person centuries, we could actually get this written down by hand."}, {"time": 849, "text": "And a marvelous coincidence, an opportunity existed right at that point in time, the early 1980s."}, {"time": 859, "text": "There was something called the Japanese fifth generation computing effort."}, {"time": 859, "text": "Japan had threatened to do in computing and AI and hardware what they had just finished doing in consumer electronics and the automotive industry, namely resting control away from the United States and more generally away from the West."}, {"time": 876, "text": "And so America was scared and Congress did something."}, {"time": 876, "text": "That's how you know it was a long time ago because Congress did something."}, {"time": 884, "text": "Congress passed something called the National Cooperative Research Act, NCRA."}, {"time": 888, "text": "And what it said was, hey, all you big American companies, that's also how you know it was a long time ago because they were American companies rather than multinational companies."}, {"time": 899, "text": "Hey, all you big American companies, normally it would be an antitrust violation if you colluded on R&D, but we promise for the next 10 years, we won't prosecute any of you if you do that to help combat this threat."}, {"time": 913, "text": "And so overnight, the first two consortia, research consortia in America sprang up, both of them coincidentally in Austin, Texas."}, {"time": 920, "text": "One called Semitech focusing on hardware chips and so on, and then one called MCC, the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, focusing more on software, on databases and AI and natural language understanding and things like that."}, {"time": 941, "text": "And I got the opportunity, thanks to my friend Woody Bledsoe, who was one of the people who founded that, to come and be its principal scientist."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And he sent Admiral Bob Inman, who was the person running MCC, came and talked to me and said, look, professor, you're talking about doing this project, it's going to involve centuries of effort."}, {"time": 968, "text": "You've only got a handful of graduate students, you do the math, it's going to take you longer than the rest of your life to finish this project."}, {"time": 973, "text": "But if you move to the wilds of Austin, Texas, we'll put 10 times as many people on it and you'll be done in a few years."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And so that was pretty exciting."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And so I did that."}, {"time": 987, "text": "I took my leave from Stanford, I came to Austin, I worked for MCC."}, {"time": 994, "text": "And the good news and bad news, the bad news is that all of us were off by an order of magnitude."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "That it turns out what you need are tens of millions of these pieces of knowledge about every day, sort of like if you have a coffee cup with stuff in it and you turn it upside down, the stuff in it's going to fall out."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "So you need tens of millions of pieces of knowledge like that, even if you take trouble to make each one as general as it possibly could be."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "And so by now we've done that."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "And the good news is since you've waited 38 years just about to talk to me, we're about at the end of that process."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So most of what we're doing now is not putting in even what you would consider common sense, but more putting in domain specific application specific knowledge about health care in a certain hospital or about oil pipes getting clogged up or whatever the applications happen to be."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "Because that's one of the general pieces of knowledge you have in dealing with electronic equipment or software systems or things like that."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "Is there a basic principle like that?"}, {"time": 1146, "text": "Is it possible to encode something that generally captures this idea of turn it off and turn it back on and see if it fixes?"}, {"time": 1153, "text": "That's one of the things that Psych knows."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "That's actually one of the fundamental laws of nature, I believe."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "I wouldn't call it a law."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "It's more like a..."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "It seems to work every time."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "So it sure looks like a law."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "So that basically covered the resources needed."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And then we had to devise a method to actually figure out, well, what are the tens of millions of things that we need to tell the system?"}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And for that, we found a few techniques which worked really well."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "One is to take any piece of text almost, it could be an advertisement, it could be a transcript, it could be a novel, it could be an article."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "And don't pay attention to the actual type that's there, the black space on the white page."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "Pay attention to the complement of that, the white space, if you will."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So what did the writer of this sentence assume that the reader already knew about the world?"}, {"time": 1212, "text": "For instance, if they used a pronoun, why did they think that you would be able to understand what the intended referent of that pronoun was?"}, {"time": 1226, "text": "If they used an ambiguous word, how did they think that you would be able to figure out what they meant by that word?"}, {"time": 1231, "text": "The other thing we look at is the gap between one sentence and the next one."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "What are all the things that the writer expected you to fill in and infer occurred between the end of one sentence and the beginning of the other?"}, {"time": 1247, "text": "So if the sentence says, Fred Smith robbed the Third National Bank, period, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison, period."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Well, between the first sentence and the second, you're expected to infer things like Fred got caught, Fred got arrested, Fred went to jail, Fred had a trial, Fred was found guilty, and so on."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "If my next sentence starts out with something like, the judge, dot, dot, dot, then you assume it's the judge at his trial."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "If my next sentence starts out something like, the arresting officer, dot, dot, dot, you assume that it was the police officer who arrested him after he committed the crime and so on."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So those are two techniques for getting that knowledge."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "The other thing we sometimes look at is fake news or humorous onion headlines or headlines in the Weekly World News, if you know what that is, or the National Enquirer, where it's like, oh, we don't believe this, then we introspect on why don't we believe it."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "So there are things like, B17 lands on the moon."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "It's like, what do we know about the world that causes us to believe that that's just silly or something like that?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Or another thing we look for are contradictions, contradictions, things which can't both be true."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "And we say, what is it that we know that causes us to know that both of these can't be true at the same time?"}, {"time": 1333, "text": "For instance, in one of the Weekly World News editions, in one article, it talked about how Elvis was cited, even though he was getting on in years and so on."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "And another article in the same one talked about people seeing Elvis's ghost."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "So it's like, why do we believe that at least one of these articles must be wrong and so on?"}, {"time": 1359, "text": "So we have a series of techniques like that that enable our people."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "And by now, we have about 50 people working full time on this and have for decades."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "So we've put in the thousands of person years of effort."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "We've built up these tens of millions of rules."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "We constantly police the system to make sure that we're saying things as generally as we possibly can."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So you don't want to say things like, no mouse is also a moose."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "Because if you said things like that, then you'd have to add another one or two or three zeros onto the number of assertions you'd actually have to have."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "So at some point, we generalize things more and more and we get to a point where we say, oh, yeah, for any two biological taxons, if we don't know explicitly that one is a generalization of another, then almost certainly they're disjoint."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "A member of one is not going to be a member of the other and so on."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "And the same thing with the Elvis and the ghost."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "It has nothing to do with Elvis."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "It's more about human nature and the mortality and that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "In general, things are not both alive and dead at the same time."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "Unless special cats in theoretical physics examples."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "Well, that raises a couple important points."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "Well, that's the onion headline situation type of thing."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "But no, no."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "So what you bring up is this really important point of like, well, how do you handle exceptions and inconsistencies and so on?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And one of the hardest lessons for us to learn, it took us about five years to really grit our teeth and learn to love it, is we had to give up global consistency."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "So the knowledge base can no longer be consistent."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "So this is a kind of scary thought."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "I grew up watching Star Trek and anytime a computer was inconsistent, it would either freeze up or explode or take over the world or something bad would happen."}, {"time": 1473, "text": "Or if you come from a mathematics background, once you can prove false, you can prove anything."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "So that's not good."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "So that's why the old knowledge based systems were all very, very consistent."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "But the trouble is that by and large, our models of the world, the way we talk about the world and so on, there are all sorts of inconsistencies that creep in here and there that will sort of kill some attempt to build some enormous globally consistent knowledge base."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And so what we had to move to was a system of local consistency."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "So a good analogy is you know that the surface of the earth is more or less spherical globally, but you live your life every day as though the surface of the earth were flat."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "When you're talking to someone in Australia, you don't think of them as being oriented upside down to you."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "When you're planning a trip, even if it's a thousand miles away, you may think a little bit about time zones, but you rarely think about the curvature of the earth and so on."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "And for most purposes, you can live your whole life without really worrying about that because the earth is locally flat."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "In much the same way, the psych knowledge base is divided up into almost like tectonic plates, which are individual contexts."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "And each context is more or less consistent, but there can be small inconsistencies at the boundary between one context and the next one and so on."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "And so by the time you move say 20 contexts over, there could be glaring inconsistencies."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "So eventually you get from the normal modern real world context that we're in right now to something like roadrunner cartoon context where physics is very different."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "And in fact, life and death are very different because no matter how many times he's killed, the coyote comes back in the next scene and so on."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "So that was a hard lesson to learn."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "For instance, at one level of abstraction, you think of this table as a solid object, but down at the atomic level, it's mostly empty space and so on."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So then that's fascinating, but it puts a lot of pressure on context to do a lot of work."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So you say tectonic plates, is it possible to formulate contexts that are general and big that do this kind of capture of knowledge bases?"}, {"time": 1649, "text": "Or do you then get turtles on top of turtles, again, where there's just a huge number of contexts?"}, {"time": 1659, "text": "So it's good you asked that question because you're pointed in the right direction, which is you want context to be first class objects in your system's knowledge base, in particular, in psych's knowledge base."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And by first class object, I mean that we should be able to have psych think about and talk about and reason about one context or another context the same way it reasons about coffee cups and tables and people and fishing and so on."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "And so contexts are just terms in its language, just like the ones I mentioned."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "And so psych can reason about context, context can arrange hierarchically and so on."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "And so you can say things about, let's say, things that are true in the modern era, things that are true in a particular year would then be a subcontext of the things that are true in a broader, let's say, a century or a millennium or something like that."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "Things that are true in Austin, Texas are generally going to be a specialization of things that are true in Texas, which is going to be a specialization of things that are true in the United States and so on."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "And so you don't have to say things over and over again at all these levels."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "You just say things at the most general level that it applies to, and you only have to say it once, and then it essentially inherits to all these more specific contexts."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "To ask a slightly technical question, is this inheritance a tree or a graph?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Oh, you definitely have to think of it as a graph."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "So we could talk about, for instance, why the Japanese fifth generation computing effort failed."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "There were about half a dozen different reasons."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "One of the reasons they failed was because they tried to represent knowledge as a tree rather than as a graph."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "And so each node in their representation could only have one parent node."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "So if you had a table that was a wooden object, a black object, a flat object, and so on, you have to choose one, and that's the only parent it could have."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "When, of course, depending on what it is you need to reason about it, sometimes it's important to know that it's made out of wood, like if we're talking about a fire."}, {"time": 1797, "text": "Sometimes it's important to know that it's flat if we're talking about resting something on it, and so on."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "So one of the problems was that they wanted a kind of Dewey decimal numbering system for all of their concepts, which meant that each node could only have at most 10 children, and each node could only have one parent."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "And while that does enable the Dewey decimal type numbering of concepts, labeling of concepts, it prevents you from representing all the things you need to about objects in our world."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "And that was one of the things which they never were able to overcome, and I think that was one of the main reasons that that project failed."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "So we'll return to some of the doors you've opened, but if we can go back to that room in 1984 around there with Marvin Minsky and Stanford."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "By the way, I should mention that Marvin wouldn't do his estimate until someone brought him an envelope so that he could literally do a back of the envelope calculation to come up with his number."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "Well, because I feel like the conversation in that room is an important one."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "You know, this is how sometimes science is done in this way."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "A few people get together and plant the seed of ideas, and they reverberate throughout history."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "And some kind of dissipate and disappear, and some, you know, Drake equation, and, you know, they, you know, seems like a meaningless equation, somewhat meaningless, but I think it drives and motivates a lot of scientists."}, {"time": 1893, "text": "And when the aliens finally show up, that equation will get even more valuable because then we'll get, be able to, in the long arc of history, the Drake equation will prove to be quite useful, I think."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "And in that same way, a conversation of just how many facts are required to capture the basic common sense knowledge of the world."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "I want to distinguish between what you think of as facts and the kind of things that we represent."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "So we map to and essentially make sure that psych has the ability to, as it were, read and access the kind of facts you might find, say, in Wikidata or stated in a Wikipedia article or something like that."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "So what we're representing, the things that we need a small number of tens of millions of, are more like rules of thumb, rules of good guessing, things which are usually true and which help you to make sense of the facts that are sort of sitting off in some database or some other more static storage."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "So they're almost like platonic forms."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "So like when you read stuff on Wikipedia, that's going to be like projections of those ideas."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "You read an article about the fact that Elvis died, that's a projection of the idea that humans are mortal."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "And very few Wikipedia articles will write, humans are mortal."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "That's what I meant about ferreting out the unstated things in text."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "What are all the things that were assumed?"}, {"time": 1981, "text": "And so those are things like if you have a problem with something, turning it off and on often fixes it for reasons we don't really understand and we're not happy about."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "Or people can't be both alive and dead at the same time."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "Or water flows downhill."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "If you search online for water flowing uphill and water flowing downhill, you'll find more references for water flowing uphill because it's used as a kind of a metaphorical reference for some unlikely thing because of course, everyone already knows that water flows downhill."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So why would anyone bother saying that?"}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Do you have a word you prefer?"}, {"time": 2021, "text": "Because we said facts

it's one thing to use a machine learning system that says, I think you should get this operation and you say why and it says 0.83 and you say no, in more detail why and it says 0.831."}, {"time":

something they call knowledge graph, for example, which is sort of like a node and link diagram."}, {"time": 4037, "text": "So, you have these nodes that represent concepts or words or terms and then there are some arcs that connect them that might be labeled."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "And so, you might have a node with like one person that represents one person and let's say a husband link that

do a Google search that, just like you said, while there might be something that's called a Knowledge Graph, it really boils down to keyword search ranked by the quality estimate of the website,

the contents of the Wikipedia pages as part of the search process, and the Semantic Web says, let's try to come up with a way for the computer to be able to truly understand the contents of those pages."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "So, let me first give you an anecdote, and then I'll answer your question."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "So, there's a search engine you've probably never heard of called Northern Light, and it went out of business, but the way it worked, it was a kind of vampiric search engine, and what it did was it didn't index the internet at all."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "All it did was it negotiated and got access to data from the big search engine companies about what query was typed in, and where the user ended up being happy, and actually then they type in a completely different query, unrelated query and so on."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "So, it just went from query to the webpage that seemed to satisfy them eventually, and that's all."}, {"time": 4328, "text": "So, it had actual no understanding of what was being typed in, it had no statistical data other than what I just mentioned, and it did a fantastic job."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "It did such a good job that the big search engine company said, oh, we're not going to sell you this data anymore."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "So, then it went out of business because it had no other way of taking users to where they would want to go and so on."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "And of course, the search engines are now using that kind of idea."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "So, let's go back to what you said about the Semantic Web."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "So, the dream Tim Berners Lee and others dream about the Semantic Web at a general level is, of course, exciting and powerful, and in a sense, the right dream to have, which is to replace the kind of statistically mapped linkages on the internet into something that's more meaningful and semantic and actually gets at the understanding of the content and so on."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "And eventually, if you say, well, how can we do that?"}, {"time": 4403, "text": "There's sort of a low road, which is what the knowledge graphs are doing and so on, which is to say, well, if we just use the simple binary relations, we can actually get some fraction of the way toward understanding and do something where in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king kind of thing."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "And so, being able to even just have a toe in the water in the right direction is fantastically powerful."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "And so, that's where a lot of people stop."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "But then you could say, well, what if we really wanted to represent and reason with the full meaning of what's there?"}, {"time": 4444, "text": "For instance, about Romeo and Juliet with the reasoning about what Juliet believes that Romeo will believe that Juliet believed and so on."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "Or if you look at the news, what President Biden believed that the leaders of the Taliban would believe about the leaders of Afghanistan if they blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "So, in order to represent complicated sentences like that, let alone reason with them, you need something which is logically much more expressive than these simple triples, than these simple knowledge graph type structures and so on."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "And that's why kicking and screaming, we were led from something like the semantic web representation, which is where we started in 1984 with frames and slots with those kinds of triples, triple store representation."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "We were led kicking and screaming to this more and more general logical language, this higher order logic."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "So, first, we were led to first order logic, and then second order, and then eventually higher order."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "So, you can represent things like modals like believes, desires, intends, expects, and so on, and nested ones."}, {"time": 4518, "text": "You can represent complicated kinds of negation."}, {"time": 4524, "text": "You can represent the process you're going through in trying to answer the question."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "So, you can say things like, oh, yeah, if you're trying to do this problem by integration by parts, and you recursively get a problem that solved by integration by parts, that's actually okay."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "But if that happens a third time, you're probably off on a wild goose chase or something like that."}, {"time": 4554, "text": "So, being able to talk about the problem solving process as you're going through the problem solving process is called reflection."}, {"time": 4558, "text": "And so, that's another... It's important to be able to represent that."}, {"time": 4567, "text": "You need to be able to represent all of these things because, in fact, people do represent them."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "They do talk about them."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "They do try and teach them to other people."}, {"time": 4572, "text": "You do have rules of thumb that key off of them and so on."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "If you can't represent it, then it's sort of like someone with a limited vocabulary who can't understand as easily what you're trying to tell them."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "And so, that's really why I think that the general dream, the original dream of Semantic Web is exactly right on."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "But the implementations that we've seen are sort of these toe in the water, little tiny baby steps in the right direction."}, {"time": 4604, "text": "You should just dive in."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "And if no one else is diving in, then yes, taking a baby step in the right direction is better than nothing."}, {"time": 4616, "text": "But it's not going to be sufficient to actually get you the realization of the Semantic Web dream, which is what we all want."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "From a flip side of that, I always wondered...

plausible scenarios of what might happen and what might happen based on that and what might happen based on that and so on."}, {"time": 5593, "text": "So you generate this ever expanding sphere, if you will, of possible future things to worry about or think about."}, {"time": 5599, "text": "And in some cases, those are intelligence agencies doing possible terrorists scenarios so that we can defend against terrorist threats before we see the first one."}, {"time": 5615, "text": "Sometimes they are computer security attacks so that we can actually close loopholes and vulnerabilities before the very first time someone actually exploits those and so on."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "Sometimes they are scenarios involving more positive things involving our plans like, for instance, what college should we go to?"}, {"time": 5639, "text": "What career should we go into?"}, {"time": 5639, "text": "What professional training should I take on?"}, {"time": 5644, "text": "That sort of thing."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "So there are all sorts of useful scenarios that can be generated that way of cause and effect and cause and effect that go out."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "And many of the linkages in those scenarios, many of the steps involve understanding and reasoning about human motivations, human needs, human emotions, what people are likely to react to in something that you do and why and how and so on."}, {"time": 5680, "text": "So that was always a very important part of the knowledge that we had to represent in the system."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "So I talk a lot about love."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "So I gotta ask, do you remember off the top of your head how psych is able to represent various aspects of love that are useful for understanding human nature and therefore integrating into this whole knowledge base of common sense?"}, {"time": 5706, "text": "We try to tease apart concepts that have enormous complexities to them and variety to them down to the level where you don't need to tease them apart further."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "So love is too general of a term."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "It's not useful."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "So when you get down to romantic love and sexual attraction, you get down to parental love, you get down to filial love, and you get down to love of doing some kind of activity or creating."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "So eventually, you get down to maybe 50 or 60 concepts, each of which is a kind of love."}, {"time": 5749, "text": "They're interrelated and then each one of them has idiosyncratic things about it."}, {"time": 5758, "text": "And you don't have to deal with love to get to that level of complexity, even something like in, X being in Y, meaning physically in Y."}, {"time": 5764, "text": "We may have one English word in to represent that, but it's useful to tease that apart because the way that the liquid is in the coffee cup is different from the way that the air is in the room, which is different from the way that I'm in my jacket, and so on."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "And so there are questions like, if I look at this coffee cup, well, I see the liquid."}, {"time": 5795, "text": "If I turn it upside down, will the liquid come out?"}, {"time": 5801, "text": "If I have, say, coffee with sugar in it, if I do the same thing, the sugar doesn't come out, right?"}, {"time": 5808, "text": "It stays in the liquid because it's dissolved in the liquid and so on."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "So by now, we have about 75 different kinds of in in the system and it's important to distinguish those."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "So if you're reading along an English text and you see the word in, the writer of that was able to use this one innocuous word because he or she was able to assume that the reader had enough common sense and world knowledge to disambiguate which of these 75 kinds of in they actually meant."}, {"time": 5843, "text": "And the same thing with love."}, {"time": 5843, "text": "You may see the word love, but if I say, I love ice cream, that's obviously different than if I say, I love this person or I love to go fishing or something like that."}, {"time": 5855, "text": "So you have to be careful not to take language too seriously because people have done a kind of parsimony, a kind of terceness where you have as few words as you can because otherwise you'd need half a million words in your language, which is a lot of words."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "That's like 10 times more than most languages really make use of and so on."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "Just like we have on the order of about a million concepts in psych because we've had to tease apart all these things."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "And so when you look at the name of a psych term, most of the psych terms actually have three or four English words in a phrase which captures the meaning of this term because you have to distinguish all these types of love."}, {"time": 5909, "text": "You have to distinguish all these types of in and there's not a single English word which captures most of these things."}, {"time": 5915, "text": "And it seems like language when used for communication between humans almost as a feature has some ambiguity built in."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "It's not an accident because like the human condition is a giant mess."}, {"time": 5929, "text": "And so it feels like nobody wants two robots like very precise formal logic conversation on a first date."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "There's some dance of uncertainty of wit, of humor, of push and pull and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "If everything is made precise, then life is not worth living I think in terms of the human experience."}, {"time": 5950, "text": "And we've all had this experience of creatively misunderstanding."}, {"time": 5956, "text": "One of my favorite stories involving Marvin Minsky is when I asked him about how he was able to turn out so many fantastic PhDs, so many fantastic people who did great PhD theses."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "How did he think of all these great ideas?"}, {"time": 5980, "text": "What he said is he would generally say something that didn't exactly make sense."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "He didn't really know what it meant."}, {"time": 5987, "text": "But the student would figure like, oh my God, Minsky said this, it must be a great idea."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "And he'd swear he or she would work on work and work until they found some meaning in this sort of Chauncey Gardner like utterance that Minsky had made."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "And then some great thesis would come out of it."}, {"time": 6011, "text": "I love this so much because there's young people come up to me and I'm distinctly made aware that the words I say have a long lasting impact."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "I will now start doing the Minsky method of saying something cryptically profound and then letting them actually make something useful and great out of that."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "You have to become revered enough that people will take as a default that everything you say is profound."}, {"time": 6040, "text": "I love Marvin Minsky so much."}, {"time": 6040, "text": "I've heard this interview with him where he said that the key to his success has been to hate everything he's ever done like in the past."}, {"time": 6053, "text": "He has so many good one liners or also to work on things that nobody else is working on because he's not very good at doing stuff."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "Oh, I think that was just false."}, {"time": 6069, "text": "Well, but see, I took whatever he said and I ran with it and I thought it was profound because it's Marvin Minsky."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "But a lot of behavior is in the eye of the beholder and a lot of the meaning is in the eye of the beholder."}, {"time": 6080, "text": "One of Minsky's early programs was begging program."}, {"time": 6085, "text": "Are you familiar with this?"}, {"time": 6085, "text": "So this is back in the day when you had job control cards at the beginning of your IBM card deck that said things like how many CPU seconds to allow this to run before it got kicked off because computer time was enormously expensive."}, {"time": 6098, "text": "And so he wrote a program and all it did was it said, give me 30 seconds of CPU time."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "And all it did was it would wait like 20 seconds and then it would print out on the operator's console teletype, I need another 20 seconds."}, {"time": 6119, "text": "So the operator would give it another 20 seconds, it would wait, it says, I'm almost done, I need a little bit more time."}, {"time": 6124, "text": "So at the end he'd get this printout and he'd be charged for like 10 times as much computer time as his job control card."}, {"time": 6130, "text": "And he'd say, look, I put 10 seconds, 30 seconds here, you're charging me for five minutes, I'm not going to pay for this."}, {"time": 6135, "text": "And the poor operator would say, well, the program kept asking for more time and Marvin would say, oh, it always does that."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "If you could just linger on it for a little bit, is there something you've learned from your interaction with Marvin Minsky about artificial intelligence, about life?"}, {"time": 6158, "text": "But I mean, he's, again, like your work, his work is, you know, he's a seminal figure in this very short history of artificial intelligence research and development."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "What have you learned from him as a human being, as an AI intellect?"}, {"time": 6180, "text": "I would say both he and Ed Feigenbaum impressed on me the realization that our lives are finite, our research lives are finite."}, {"time": 6190, "text": "We're going to have limited opportunities to do AI research projects."}, {"time": 6196, "text": "So you should make each one count."}, {"time": 6196, "text": "Don't be afraid of doing a project that's going to take years or even decades."}, {"time": 6202, "text": "And don't settle for bump on a log projects that could lead to some published journal article that five people will read and pat you on the head for and so on."}, {"time": 6223, "text": "So one bump on a log after another is not how you get from the earth to the moon by slowly putting additional bumps on this log."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "The only way to get there is to think about the hard problems and think about novel solutions to them."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "And if you do that, and if you're willing to listen to nature, to empirical reality, willing to be wrong, it's perfectly fine because if occasionally

networks and all ideas until they are."}, {"time": 6296, "text": "So why do you think people say that, first of all?"}, {"time": 6305, "text": "And second of all, did you feel that ever throughout your journey?"}, {"time": 6305, "text": "And did you ever consider quitting on this mission?"}, {"time": 6313, "text": "We keep a very low profile."}, {"time": 6313, "text": "We don't attend very many

stuff you're doing."}, {"time": 6352, "text": "Well, I think it's time for us to keep a higher profile now that we're far enough along that other people can begin to help us with the final N%."},

willing to, if they're interested in it."}, {"time": 6378, "text": "Retirees who have enormous amounts of time and would like to leave some kind of legacy to the world, people because of the pandemic who have more time at home or for one reason or another to be online and contribute."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "If we can raise awareness of how far our project has come and how close to being primed the knowledge pump is, then we can begin to harness this untapped amount of humanity."}, {"time": 6407, "text": "I'm not really that concerned about professional colleagues opinions of our project."}, {"time": 6416, "text": "I'm interested in getting as many people in the world as possible actively helping and contributing to get us from where we are to really covering all of human knowledge and different human opinion including contrasting opinion that's worth representing."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "So I think that's one reason."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "A, I don't think there was ever a time where I thought about quitting."}, {"time": 6444, "text": "There are times where I've become depressed a little bit about how hard it is to get funding for the system."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "Occasionally there are AI winters and things like that."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "Occasionally there are AI what you might call summers where people have said, why in the world didn't you sell your company to company X for some large amount of money when you had the opportunity and so on."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "Company X here are like old companies maybe you've never even heard of like Lycos or something like that."}, {"time": 6512, "text": "So five years ago almost all of our money came from the government."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Now virtually none of it comes from the government."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Almost all of it is from companies that are actually using it for something, hospital chains using it for medical reasoning about patients and energy companies using it and various other manufacturers using it to reason about supply chains and things like that."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "So there's so many questions I want to ask."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "So one of the ways that people can help is by adding to the knowledge base and that's really basically anybody if the tooling is right."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "And the other way, I kind of want to ask you about your thoughts on this."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "So you've had like you said in government and you had big clients, you had a lot of clients but most of it is shrouded in secrecy because of the nature of the relationship of the kind of things you're helping them with."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "So that's one way to operate and another way to operate is more in the open where it's more consumer facing."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "And so you know hence something like open cycle is born at some point or there's... No that's a misconception."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "Oh well this let's go there."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "So what is open cycle and how is it born?"}, {"time": 6589, "text": "Two things I want to say and I want to say each of them before the other so it's going to be difficult."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "But we'll come back to open cycle in a minute."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "But one of the terms of our contracts with all of our customers and partners is knowledge you have that is genuinely proprietary to you."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "We will respect that, we'll make sure that it's marked as proprietary to you in the psych knowledge base."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "No one other than you will be able to see it if you don't want them to and it won't be used in inferences other than for you and so on."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "However, any knowledge which is necessary in building any applications for you and with you which is publicly available general human knowledge is not going to be proprietary."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "It's going to just become part of the normal psych knowledge base and it will be openly available to everyone who has access to psych."}, {"time": 6642, "text": "So that's an important constraint that we never went back on even when we got pushback from companies which we often did who wanted to claim that almost everything they were telling us was proprietary."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "So there's a line between very domain specific company specific stuff and the general knowledge that comes from that."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "Yes or if you imagine say it's an oil company there are things which they would expect any new petroleum engineer they hired to already know and it's not okay for them to consider that that is proprietary and there sometimes a company will say well we're the first ones to pay you to represent that in psych and our attitude is some polite form tough."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "The deal is this take it or leave it and in a few cases they've left it and in most cases they'll see our point of view and take it because that's how we've built the psych system by essentially tacking with the funding wins where people would fund a project and half of it would be general knowledge that would stay permanently as part of psych."}, {"time": 6719, "text": "So always with these partnerships it's not like a distraction from the main psych development."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "It's a small distraction."}, {"time": 6724, "text": "It's a small but it's not a complete one so you're adding to the knowledge base."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "Yes absolutely and we try to stay away from projects that would not have that property."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "So let me go back and talk about open psych for a second."}, {"time": 6743, "text": "So I've had a lot of trouble expressing and convincing other AI researchers how important it is to use an expressive representation language like we do this higher order logic rather than just using some triple store knowledge graph type representation."}, {"time": 6761, "text": "And so as an attempt to show them why they needed something more we said oh well we'll represent this unimportant projection or shadow or subset of psych that just happens to be the simple binary relations, the relation argument one argument two triples and so on."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "And then you'll see how much more useful it is if you had the entire psych system."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "So it's all well and good to have the taxonomic relations between terms like person and night and sleep and bed and house and eyes and so on."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "But think about how much more useful it would be if you also had all the rules of thumb about those things like people sleep at night, they sleep lying down, they sleep with their eyes closed, they usually sleep in beds in our country, they sleep for hours at a time, they can be woken up, they don't like being woken up and so on and so on."}, {"time": 6835, "text": "So it's that massive amount of knowledge which is not part of open psych and we thought that all the researchers would then immediately say oh my god of course we need the other 90% that you're not giving us, let's partner and license psych so that we can use it in our research."}, {"time": 6855, "text": "But instead what people said is oh even the bit you've released is so much better than anything we had, we'll just make do with this."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "But there's two parts to open psych."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "So one is convincing people on the idea and the power of this general kind of representation of knowledge and the value that you hold in having acquired that knowledge and built it and continue to build it."}, {"time": 6902, "text": "And the other is the code base."}, {"time": 6902, "text": "This is the code side of it."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "So my sense of the code base that psych or psych is operating with, I mean it has the technical debt of the three decades plus right."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "This is the exact same problem that Google had to deal with with the early version of TensorFlow."}, {"time": 6923, "text": "It's still dealing with that."}, {"time": 6923, "text": "They had to basically break compatibility with the past several times and that's only over a period of a couple years."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "But they I think successfully opened up, it's very risky, very gutsy move to open up TensorFlow and then PyTorch on the Facebook side."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "And what you see is there's a magic place where you can find a community, where you could develop a community that builds on the system without taking away any of, not any, but most of the value."}, {"time": 6957, "text": "So most of the value that Google has is still a Google."}, {"time": 6965, "text": "Most of the value that Facebook has still Facebook even though some of this major machine learning tooling is released into the open."}, {"time": 6970, "text": "My question is not so much on the knowledge, which is also a big part of open psych, but all the different kinds of tooling."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "So there's the kind of, all the kinds of stuff you can do on the knowledge graph, knowledge base, whatever we call it."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "There's the inference engines."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "So there could be some, there probably are a bunch of proprietary stuff you want to kind of keep secret."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "And there's probably some stuff you can open up completely and then let the community build up enough community where they develop stuff on top of it."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "Yes, there will be those publications and academic work and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "And also the tooling of adding to the knowledge base, right?"}, {"time": 7011, "text": "Like developing, you know, there's incredible amount, like there's so many people that are just really good at this kind of stuff in the open source community."}, {"time": 7020, "text": "So my question for you is like, have you struggled with this kind of idea that you have so much value in your company already?"}, {"time": 7026, "text": "You've developed so many good things."}, {"time": 7026, "text": "You have clients that really value your relationships."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "And then there's this dormant giant open source community that as far as I know, you're not utilizing."}, {"time": 7037, "text": "There's so many things to say there, but there could be magic moments where the community builds up large enough to where the artificial intelligence field that is currently 99.9% machine learning is dominated by machine learning, has a face shift towards like, or at least in part towards more like what you might call symbolic AI."}, {"time": 7065, "text": "This whole place where psych is like at the center of, and then as you know, that requires a little bit leap of faith because you're now surfing and there'll be obviously competitors that will pop up and start making you nervous and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7079, "text": "So do you think about the space of open sourcing some parts and not others, how to leverage the community, all those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 7090, "text": "And I think you phrased it the right way, which is we're constantly struggling with the question of what to open source, what to make public, what to even publicly talk about."}, {"time": 7103, "text": "And there are enormous pluses and minuses to every alternative."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "And it's very much like negotiating a very treacherous path."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "Partly the analogy is like if you slip, you could make a fatal mistake, give away something which essentially kills you or fail to give away something which failing to give it away hurts you and so on."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "So it is a very tough, tough question."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "Usually what we have done with people who've approached us to collaborate on research is to say we will make available to you the entire knowledge base and executable copies of all of the code, but only very, very limited source code access if you have some idea for how you might improve something or work with us on something."}, {"time": 7169, "text": "So let me also get back to one of the very, very first things we talked about here, which was separating the question of how could you get a computer to do this at all versus how could you get a computer to do this efficiently enough in real time."}, {"time": 7190, "text": "And so one of the early lessons we learned was that we had to separate the epistemological problem of what should the system know, separate that from the heuristic problem of how can the system reason efficiently with what it knows."}, {"time": 7205, "text": "And so instead of trying to pick one representation language which was the sweet spot or the best tradeoff point between expressiveness of the language and efficiency of the language, if you had to pick one, knowledge graphs would probably be, associative triples would probably be about the best you could do."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "And that's why we started there."}, {"time": 7231, "text": "But after a few years, we realized that what we could do is we could split this and we could have one nice, clean, epistemological level language, which is this higher order logic, and we could have one or more grubby but efficient heuristic level modules that opportunistically would say, oh, I can make progress on what you're trying to do over here."}, {"time": 7260, "text": "I have a special method that will contribute a little bit toward a solution."}, {"time": 7265, "text": "Of course, some subset of that knowledge."}, {"time": 7269, "text": "So by now, we have over a thousand of these heuristic level modules, and they function as a kind of community of agents."}, {"time": 7274, "text": "And there's one of them, which is a general theorem prover."}, {"time": 7274, "text": "And in theory, that's the only one you need."}, {"time": 7280, "text": "But in practice, it always takes so long that you never want to call on it."}, {"time": 7289, "text": "You always want these other agents to very efficiently reason through it."}, {"time": 7289, "text": "It's sort of like if you're balancing a chemical equation."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "You could go back to first principles, but in fact, there are algorithms which are vastly more efficient."}, {"time": 7299, "text": "Or if you're trying to solve a quadratic equation, you could go back to first principles of mathematics."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "But it's much better to simply recognize that this is a quadratic equation and apply the binomial formula and snap, you get your answer right away and so on."}, {"time": 7318, "text": "So think of these as like a thousand little experts that are all looking at everything the site gets asked and looking at everything that every other little agent has contributed, almost like notes on a blackboard, notes on a whiteboard, and making additional notes when they think they can be helpful."}, {"time": 7339, "text": "And gradually, that community of agents gets an answer to your

do is talk to one of the human experts and say, here's the set of reasoning steps that Psych went through."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "You can see why it took it a long time to get the answer."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "How is it that you were able to answer that question in two seconds?"}, {"time": 7370, "text": "And occasionally, you'll get an expert who just says, well, I just know it."},

says, well, let me introspect on that."}, {"time": 7382, "text": "Yes, here is a special representation we use just for aqueous chemistry equations, or here's a special representation and a special technique, which we can now apply to things in this special representation and so on."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "And then you add that as the 1001st HL heuristic level module."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "And from then on, in any application, if it ever comes up again, it'll be able to contribute and so on."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "So that's pretty much one of the main ways in which Psych has recouped this loss deficiency."}, {"time": 7415, "text": "A second important way is meta reasoning."}, {"time": 7423, "text": "So you can speed things up by focusing on removing knowledge from the system till all it has left is minimal knowledge needed."}, {"time": 7432, "text": "But that's the wrong thing to do, right?"}, {"time": 7438, "text": "That would be like in a human extirpating part of their brain or something."}, {"time": 7438, "text": "That's really bad."}, {"time": 7442, "text": "So instead, what you want to do is give it meta level advice, tactical and strategic advice, that enables it to reason about what kind of knowledge is going to be relevant to this problem, what kind of tactics are going to be good to take in trying to attack this problem."}, {"time": 7455, "text": "When is it time to start trying to prove the negation of this thing, because I'm knocking myself out trying to prove it's true, and maybe it's false."}, {"time": 7466, "text": "And if I just spend a minute, I can see that it's false or something."}, {"time": 7470, "text": "So it's like dynamically pruning the graph to only like, based on the particular thing you're trying to infer."}, {"time": 7477, "text": "And so by now, we have about 150 of these sort of like breakthrough ideas that have led to dramatic speed ups in the inference process, where one of them was this ELHL split and lots of HL modules."}, {"time": 7493, "text": "Another one was using meta and meta level reasoning to reason about the reasoning that's going on and so on."}, {"time": 7499, "text": "And 150 breakthroughs may sound like a lot, but if you divide by 37 years, it's not as impressive."}, {"time": 7512, "text": "So there's these kind of heuristic modules that really help improve the inference."}, {"time": 7512, "text": "How hard, in general, is this?"}, {"time": 7521, "text": "Because you mentioned higher order logic."}, {"time": 7521, "text": "In the general theorem prover sense, it's intractable, very difficult problem."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "So how hard is this inference problem when we're not talking about if we let go of the perfect and focus on the good?"}, {"time": 7537, "text": "I would say it's half of the problem in the following empirical sense, which is over the years, about half of our effort, maybe 40% of our effort has been our team of inference programmers."}, {"time": 7554,

program."}, {"time": 7568, "text": "They have degrees in things like philosophy and so on."}, {"time": 7572, "text": "So it's almost like the..."}, {"time": 7572, "text": "I love to hang out with those people actually."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "Oh yes, it's wonderful."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "But it's very much like the Eloy and the Morlocks in H.G."}, {"time": 7582, "text": "Wells Time Machine."}, {"time": 7582, "text": "So you have the Eloy who only program in the epistemological higher order logic language."}, {"time": 7589, "text": "And then you have the Morlocks who are under the ground figuring out what the machinery is that will make this efficiently operate and so on."}, {"time": 7596, "text": "And so, you know, occasionally they'll toss messages back to each other and so on."}, {"time": 7603, "text": "But it really is almost this 50 50 split between finding clever ways to recoup efficiency when you have an expressive language and putting in the content of what the

of its system has moved on."}, {"time": 7637, "text": "Like everybody respects Lisp, but many of the systems are not written in Lisp anymore."}, {"time": 7644, "text": "But Syke, as far as I understand, maybe you can correct me, there's a bunch of Lisp in it."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "So it's based on Lisp code that we produced."}, {"time": 7657, "text": "Most of the programming is still going on in a dialect of Lisp."}, {"time": 7657, "text": "And then for efficiency reasons, that gets automatically translated into things like Java or C. Nowadays, it's almost all translated into Java because Java has gotten good enough that that's really all we need to do."}, {"time": 7678, "text": "So it's translated into Java, and then Java is compiled down to bytecode."}, {"time": 7683, "text": "Okay, so that's sort of that's a that that that's a, you know, it's a process that probably has to do with the fact that when Syke was originally written, and you build up a powerful system, like there is some technical depth you have to deal with, as is the case with most powerful systems that span years."}, {"time": 7702, "text": "Have you ever considered this, this would help me understand, because my perspective, so much of the value of everything you've done with Syke and Cycorp is the is the is the knowledge."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "Have you ever considered just like throwing away the code base and starting from scratch, not really throwing away, but sort of moving it to like throwing away that technical debt, starting with a more updated programming language?"}, {"time": 7733, "text": "Is that throwing away a lot of value or no?"}, {"time": 7739, "text": "How much of the value is in the silly software engineering aspect, and how much of the value is in the knowledge?"}, {"time": 7747, "text": "So development of programs in Lisp proceeds, I think, somewhere between a thousand and fifty thousand times faster than development in any of what you're calling modern or improved computer languages."}, {"time": 7770, "text": "Well, there's other functional languages like, you know, Clojure and all that."}, {"time": 7770, "text": "But I mean, I'm with you."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "I like Lisp."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "I just wonder how many great programmers there are."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "There's still like..."}, {"time": 7780, "text": "So it is true when a new inference programmer comes on board, they need to learn some of Lisp."}, {"time": 7788, "text": "And in fact, we have a subset of Lisp, which we call cleverly Sub L, which is really all they need to learn."}, {"time": 7795, "text": "And so the programming actually goes on in Sub L, not in full Lisp."}, {"time": 7795, "text": "And so it does not take programmers very long at all to learn Sub L. And that's something which can then be translated efficiently into Java."}, {"time": 7808, "text": "And for some of our programmers who are doing, say, user interface work, then they never have to even learn Sub L. They just have to learn APIs into the basic psych engine."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "So you're not necessarily feeling the burden of like, it's extremely efficient."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "That's not a problem to solve."}, {"time": 7831, "text": "The other thing is, remember that we're talking about hiring programmers to do inference, who are programmers interested in effectively automatic theorem proving."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "And so those are people already predisposed to representing things in logic and so on."}, {"time": 7843, "text": "And Lisp really was the programming language based on logic that John McCarthy and others who developed it basically took the formalisms that Alonzo Church and other philosophers, other logicians, had come up with and basically said, can we basically make a programming language which is effectively logic?"}, {"time": 7872, "text": "And so since we're talking about reasoning about expressions written in this epistemological language and we're doing operations which are effectively like theorem proving type operations and so on, there's a natural impedance match between Lisp and the knowledge, the way it's represented."},

that."}, {"time": 7906, "text": "Okay, thank you."}, {"time": 7907, "text": "So I'll probably use that in the future without credit."}, {"time": 7913, "text": "But no, I think the point is that the language you program in isn't really that important."}, {"time": 7921, "text": "It's more that you have to be able to think in terms of, for instance, creating new helpful HL modules and how they'll work with each other and looking at things that are taking a long time and coming up with new specialized data structures that will make this efficient."}, {"time": 7940, "text": "So let me just give you one very simple example, which is when you have a transitive relation like larger than, this is larger than that, which is larger than that, which is larger than that."}, {"time": 7950, "text": "So the first thing must be larger than the last thing."}, {"time": 7953, "text": "Whenever you have a transitive relation, if you're not careful, if I ask whether this thing over here is larger than the thing over here, I'll have to do some kind of graph walk or theorem proving that might involve like five or 10 or 20 or 30 steps."}, {"time": 7968, "text": "But if you store, redundantly store the transitive closure, the cleanly star of that transitive relation, now you have this big table."}, {"time": 7978, "text": "But you can always guarantee that in one single step, you can just look up whether this is larger than that."}, {"time": 7986, "text": "And so there are lots of cases where storage is cheap today."}, {"time": 7992, "text": "And so by having this extra redundant data structure, we can answer this commonly occurring type of question very, very efficiently."}, {"time": 8002, "text": "Let me give you one other analogy, analog of that, which is something we call rule macro predicates, which is we'll see this complicated rule and we'll notice that things very much like it syntactically come up again and again and again."}, {"time": 8021, "text": "So we'll create a whole brand new relation or predicate or function that captures that and takes maybe not two arguments, takes maybe three, four or five arguments and so on."}, {"time": 8034, "text": "And now we have effectively converted some complicated if then rule that might have to have inference done on it into some ground atomic formula, which is just the name of a relation and a few arguments and so on."}, {"time": 8053, "text": "And so converting commonly occurring types or schemas of rules into brand new predicates, brand new functions, turns out to enormously speed up the inference process."}, {"time": 8067, "text": "So now we've covered about four of the 150 good ideas I said."}, {"time": 8072, "text": "So that idea in particular is like a nice compression that turns out to be really useful."}, {"time": 8078, "text": "I mean, this whole thing is just fascinating from a philosophical."}, {"time": 8080, "text": "There's part of me, I mean, it makes me a little bit sad because your work is both from a computer science perspective fascinating and the inference engine from a epistemological philosophical aspect fascinating, but you know, it is also you're running a company and there's some stuff that has to remain private and it's sad."}, {"time": 8103, "text": "Well here's something that may make you feel better, a little bit better."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "We've formed a not for profit company called the Knowledge Axe Immunization Institute, NAX, KNAX."}, {"time": 8117, "text": "And I have this firm belief with a lot of empirical evidence to support it that the education that people get in high schools, in colleges, in graduate schools and so on is almost completely orthogonal to, almost completely irrelevant to how good they're going to be at coming up to speed in doing this kind of ontological engineering and writing these assertions and rules and so on in psych."}, {"time": 8149, "text": "And so very often we'll interview candidates who have their PhD in philosophy, who've taught logic for years and so on, and they're just awful."}, {"time": 8159, "text": "But the converse is true."}, {"time": 8160, "text": "So one of the best ontological engineers we ever had never graduated high school."}, {"time": 8200, "text": "And if we could do that, that would create an enormous number of relatively very high paying jobs for people who currently

SACOR."}, {"time": 8316, "text": "Another is if you're able to introspect."}, {"time": 8318, "text": "So very often, we'll give someone a simple question and we'll say like, why is this?"}, {"time":

one of the questions I often ask is I'll point to a sentence with a pronoun in it and I'll say, the referent of that pronoun is obviously this noun over here."}, {"time": 8347, "text": "How would you or I or an AI or a five year old, 10 year old child know that that pronoun refers to that noun over here?"}, {"time": 8358, "text": "And often the people who are going to be good at ontological engineering will give me some causal explanation or will refer to some things that are true in the world."}, {"time": 8370, "text": "So if you imagine a sentence like, the horse was led into the barn while its head was still wet."}, {"time": 8376, "text": "And so its head refers to the horse's head."}, {"time": 8378, "text": "But how do you know that?"}, {"time": 8380, "text": "And so some people will say, I just know it."}, {"time": 8382, "text": "Some people will say, well, the horse was the subject of the sentence."}, {"time": 8385, "text": "And I'll say, okay, well, what about the horse was led into the barn while its roof was still wet?"}, {"time": 8391, "text": "Now, its roof obviously refers to the barn."}, {"time": 8394, "text": "And so then they'll say, oh, well, that's because it's the closest noun."}, {"time": 8398, "text": "And so basically, if they try to give me answers which are based on syntax and grammar and so on, that's a really bad sign."}, {"time": 8407, "text":

essentially teach our future AI overlords how to reason deeply about this world and how to understand it, that requires that you think deeply about the world."}, {"time": 8468, "text": "So I'll tell you a sad story about mathcraft, which is why is that not widely used in schools today?"}, {"time": 8476, "text": "We're not really trying to make big profit on it or anything like that."}, {"time": 8480, "text": "When we've gone to schools, their attitude has been, well, if a student spends 20 hours going through this mathcraft program from start to end and so on, will it improve their score on

their understanding more."}, {"time": 8507, "text": "And their attitude is, well, if it doesn't increase their score on this test, then we're not going to adopt it."}, {"time": 8516, "text": "I mean, that's a whole another three, four hour conversation about the education system."}, {"time": 8521, "text": "But let me ask you, let me go super philosophical, as if we weren't already."}, {"time": 8526, "text": "So in 1950, Alan Turing wrote the paper that formulated the Turing test."}, {"time": 8532, "text": "And he opened the paper with the question, can machines think?"}, {"time": 8541,

solution decision and so on."}, {"time": 8558, "text": "So of course machines can think."}, {"time": 8562, "text": "I think that there was a lot of damage done by people misunderstanding Turing's imitation game and focus on trying to get a chat bot to fool other people into thinking it was human and so on."}, {"time": 8586, "text": "That's not a terrible test in and of itself, but it shouldn't be your one and only test for intelligence."}, {"time": 8593, "text": "In terms of tests of intelligence, you know, with the Lobner Prize, which is a very kind of, you want to say a more strict formulation of the Turing test as originally formulated."}, {"time": 8605, "text": "And then there's something like Alexa Prize, which is more, I would say a more interesting formulation of the test, which is like, ultimately the metric is how long does a human want to talk to the AI system?"}, {"time": 8618, "text": "So it's like if the goal is you want it to be 20 minutes, it's basically not just have a convincing conversation, but more like a compelling one or a fun one or an interesting one."}, {"time": 8633, "text": "And that seems like more to the spirit maybe of what Turing was imagining."}, {"time": 8641, "text": "But what for you do you think in the space of tests is a good test?"}, {"time": 8646, "text": "When you see a system based on psych that passes that test, you'd be like, damn, we've created something special here."}, {"time": 8657, "text": "The test has to be something involving depth of reasoning and recursiveness of reasoning, the ability to answer repeated why questions about the answer you just gave."}, {"time": 8670, "text": "How many why questions in a row can you keep answering?"}, {"time": 8676, "text": "Just have like a young curious child and an AI system and how long will an AI system last before it wants to quit?"}, {"time": 8684, "text": "And again, that's not the only test."}, {"time": 8685, "text": "Another one has to do with argumentation."}, {"time": 8688, "text": "In other words, here's a proposition, come up with pro and con arguments for it and try and give me convincing arguments on both sides."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "And so that's another important kind of ability that the system needs to be able to exhibit in order to really be intelligent, I think."}, {"time": 8712, "text": "So there's certain, I mean, if you look at IBM Watson and like certain impressive accomplishments for very specific tests, almost like a demo, right?"}, {"time": 8724, "text": "There's some, like I talked to the guy who led the Jeopardy effort, and there's some kind of hard coding heuristics tricks that you try to pull it all together to make the thing work in the end for this thing, right?"}, {"time": 8743, "text": "That seems to be one of the lessons with AI is like, that's the fastest way to get a solution that's pretty damn impressive."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "So here's what I would say is that as impressive as that was, it made some mistakes, but more importantly, many of the mistakes it made were mistakes which no human would have made."}, {"time": 8767, "text": "And so part of the new or augmented Turing tests would have to be, and the mistakes you make are ones which humans don't basically look at and say, what?"}, {"time": 8784, "text": "So for example, there was a question about which 16th century Italian politician, blah, blah, blah, and Watson said Ronald Reagan."}, {"time": 8797, "text": "So most Americans would have gotten that question wrong, but they would never have said Ronald Reagan as an answer because among the things they know is that he lived relatively recently and people don't really live 400 years and things like that."}, {"time": 8813, "text": "So that's, I think, a very important thing, which is if it's making mistakes which no normal sane human would have made, then that's a really bad sign."}, {"time": 8825, "text": "And if it's not making those kinds of mistakes, then that's a good sign."}, {"time": 8830, "text": "And I don't think it's any one very, very simple test."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "I think it's all of the things you mentioned, all the things I mentioned is really a battery of tests, which together, if it passes almost all of these tests, it'd be hard to argue that it's not intelligent."}, {"time": 8845, "text": "And if it fails several of these tests, it's really hard to argue that it really understands what it's doing and that it really is generally intelligent."}, {"time": 8853, "text": "So to pass all of those tests, we've talked a lot about psych and knowledge and reasoning."}, {"time": 8860, "text": "Do you think this AI system would need to have some other human like elements, for example, a body or a physical manifestation in this world?"}, {"time": 8872, "text": "And another one which seems to be fundamental to the human experience is consciousness."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "The subjective experience of what it's like to actually be you."}, {"time": 8884, "text": "Do you think it needs those to be able to pass all of those tests and to achieve general intelligence?"}, {"time": 8890, "text": "I think in the case of a body, no, I know there are a lot of people like Penrose who would have disagreed with me and others, but no, I don't think it needs to have a body in order to be intelligent."}, {"time": 8904, "text": "I think that it needs to be able to talk about having a body and having sensations and having emotions and so on."}, {"time": 8913, "text": "It doesn't actually have to have all of that, but it has to understand it in the same way that Helen Keller was perfectly intelligent and able to talk about colors and sounds and shapes and so on, even though she didn't directly experience all the same things that the rest of us do."}, {"time": 8935, "text": "So knowledge of it and being able to correctly make use of that is certainly an important facility, but actually having a body, if you believe that that's just a kind of religious or mystical belief, you can't really argue for or against it, I suppose."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "It's just something that some people believe."}, {"time": 8959, "text": "What about an extension of the body, which is consciousness?"}, {"time": 8964, "text": "It feels like something to be here."}, {"time": 8968, "text": "But what does that really mean?"}, {"time": 8970, "text": "It's like, well, if I talk to you, you say things which make me believe that you're conscious."}, {"time": 8975, "text": "I know that I'm conscious, but you're just taking my word for it now."}, {"time": 9006, "text": "If we want to call that consciousness, then yes, psych is already conscious."}, {"time": 9011, "text": "But I don't think that I would ascribe anything mystical to that."}, {"time": 9015, "text": "Again, some people would, but I would say that other than our own personal experience of consciousness, we're just treating everyone else in the world, so to speak, at their word about being conscious."}, {"time": 9029, "text": "And so if a computer program, if an AI is able to exhibit all the same kinds of response as you would expect of a conscious entity, then doesn't it deserve the label of consciousness just as much?"}, {"time": 9047, "text": "So there's another burden that comes with this whole intelligence thing that humans got is the extinguishing of the light of consciousness, which is kind of realizing that we're going to be dead someday."}, {"time": 9062, "text": "And there's a bunch of philosophers like Ernest Becker, who
