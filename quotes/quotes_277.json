[{"title": "Joe Rogan: Comedy, Controversy, Aliens, UFOs, Putin, CIA, and Freedom | Lex Fridman Podcast #300", "id": "gk4tEO4jDUM", "quotes": [{"time": 272, "text": "And there's beauty in that, there really is."}, {"time": 275, "text": "And there's so much inspiration to be gathered from other people if you're a charitable person, if you're charitable and compassionate and you can look at people, even people that I don't like, I try to look at the best aspects of how they live their life and recognize those aspects, admire them, give them credit for it."}, {"time": 300, "text": "There's something that we can all get out of watching the way other people live their lives."}, {"time": 305, "text": "So I got a chance to see you walk through the fire a little bit privately and publicly this year in January."}, {"time": 314, "text": "I gotta ask you about that."}, {"time": 315, "text": "So there's like generic conversations about sort of cancel culture and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 320, "text": "But as a human being, this to me is fascinating."}, {"time": 324, "text": "Sort of there's the N word highlight video, there's the criticism of the different guests, whatever the side is on the COVID pandemic."}, {"time": 333, "text": "And you, I mean, there's a mass amount of attack on you."}, {"time": 341, "text": "Outside of being a public persona, outside of being a comedian, podcaster, you're also a human being."}, {"time": 347, "text": "So how did you survive that?"}, {"time": 350, "text": "How did you sort of walk through that fire?"}, {"time": 354, "text": "Because you seem to do it with grace."}, {"time": 358, "text": "I used mushrooms."}, {"time": 361, "text": "That was one way I did it."}, {"time": 364, "text": "What's your, as Andrew Huberman would say, what was your protocol?"}, {"time": 367, "text": "I took, it was probably less than a gram every day."}, {"time": 373, "text": "And I did a lot of like really hard working out."}, {"time": 380, "text": "But also, I mean, there's a great benefit to going through anything difficult."}, {"time": 388, "text": "And if you're aware, like in advance and during, like anything that's gonna happen that's very difficult and troubling, the great benefit is it gives you an opportunity to grow, gives you an opportunity to express yourself under pressure, to show your character, to show who you truly are."}, {"time": 410, "text": "And it gives you an opportunity to see how you handle a very difficult situation."}, {"time": 416, "text": "It also was fascinating as a person that's involved in media, right?"}, {"time": 423, "text": "Because what we're doing right now is media, even though it seems, like podcasts seem like we're just having a conversation, right?"}, {"time": 432, "text": "And they are, and in that sense, it's kind of the purest form of media because what you're doing is you're doing it without any fanfare, you're doing it without any, there's no executives looming over your head or network or big meetings about ratings or any of that stuff, but it is media."}, {"time": 455, "text": "But what I got to see is the wiring under the machine of how the rest of media would try to take me out."}, {"time": 463, "text": "And like when CNN would just be playing things over and over and back and forth, it was wild to watch."}, {"time": 470, "text": "What was also wild to watch was people's responses because I gained two million subscribers during that time."}, {"time": 480, "text": "Like the podcast never got bigger."}, {"time": 482, "text": "It just kept growing, it had never been bigger than it had been at the end of all of it."}, {"time": 489, "text": "It just made it bigger."}, {"time": 490, "text": "And ultimately, if you've fucked up in the past or made mistakes or done something wrong, that gives you an opportunity to discuss those things and to say, to apologize if you feel the need to apologize and also to just address it."}, {"time": 509, "text": "And so people under that kind of pressure, it's an opportunity for them to understand how you think about things honestly, how you actually honestly think about things."}, {"time": 519, "text": "And there's no more honesty that you get out of a person than when that person is under extreme duress."}, {"time": 525, "text": "So I think in that sense, I mean, it's horrible to say that it's a benefit, that it's a good thing that it happened, but it was a benefit."}, {"time": 532, "text": "Can you see how it can break a person?"}, {"time": 535, "text": "I've gotten the chance to experience small attacks here and there, ones that get to the core of things."}, {"time": 541, "text": "Like even just talking about Russia and Ukraine, to Stephen Calkin or Oliver Stone, looking at different perspectives, you gain, for me, feeling like a sizable number of people who really don't like you and say things about you that may be cut deep for a reason I don't understand why."}, {"time": 566, "text": "It's just my own psychology."}, {"time": 568, "text": "Well, it's also because you can't defend yourself because they're saying it and you're not there and you don't have any opportunity for a rebuttal."}, {"time": 577, "text": "And if you do have a rebuttal, you're doing it publicly and you're opening it up to the whole world to chime in."}, {"time": 583, "text": "And there's a general tendency that people have towards negativity when they're interacting with strangers online, especially about controversial subjects."}, {"time": 593, "text": "And even if it's only 10% of the people, it's one out of 10."}, {"time": 597, "text": "That's a lot of negativity when you're dealing with thousands and thousands of tweets."}, {"time": 602, "text": "Yeah, and I think, maybe I'm just a very self critical person, but I hear their words and I probably, somewhere deep inside, see the truth in the criticism, in some aspect of the criticism, and that's why it hurts."}, {"time": 617, "text": "But it's in one aspect of you."}, {"time": 621, "text": "But when you're reading it, it's so, it's boiled down to this one thing, as if that one thing defines you totally."}, {"time": 631, "text": "Like if you've made a mistake, if you've said something that you shouldn't have said, or if you said something and maybe you should have considered it more carefully, given the gravity of the situation, that's just a part of being a person."}, {"time": 647, "text": "And it's also part of being a person where you're communicating with things publicly in real time, thinking out loud, which is what we do."}, {"time": 656, "text": "It's complex and most people don't do it."}, {"time": 658, "text": "And you're gonna have these, you're gonna have genuine hot takes where people just see what you said and go, why did he say that?"}, {"time": 668, "text": "Fuck him."}, {"time": 669, "text": "He doesn't know anything about, he doesn't live in Ukraine."}, {"time": 673, "text": "It's like, there's people that are gonna have takes on that in that way."}, {"time": 677, "text": "And then there's also gonna be these disingenuous people who just use any kind of controversial topic or subject as an opportunity for them to get clicks or views."}, {"time": 686, "text": "But the number of those people can be quite large."}, {"time": 689, "text": "Quite large."}, {"time": 690, "text": "And so, going back to, do you think it can destroy a person?"}, {"time": 695, "text": "Because I kind of worry about this."}, {"time": 696, "text": "And you're, in many ways, but in this way, an inspiration that it didn't seem to have destroyed you."}, {"time": 702, "text": "But is that?"}, {"time": 703, "text": "I kept doing shows, I kept doing standup."}, {"time": 706, "text": "I ignored everything."}, {"time": 707, "text": "I didn't read any of it."}, {"time": 709, "text": "So it is possible to just?"}, {"time": 714, "text": "I ignored it all."}, {"time": 715, "text": "But you have like."}, {"time": 715, "text": "I knew it was there."}, {"time": 716, "text": "Like your family didn't bring it up."}, {"time": 718, "text": "My family was very aware of it."}, {"time": 720, "text": "My wife was aware of it."}, {"time": 721, "text": "What was the conversation like?"}, {"time": 722, "text": "If your wife is aware of it, is there like a rule?"}, {"time": 726, "text": "Pretend it's not happening."}, {"time": 729, "text": "Well, I tell her, don't ever read."}, {"time": 730, "text": "Past the green beans."}, {"time": 732, "text": "I don't ever let her like read negative articles to me."}, {"time": 736, "text": "You know, I don't want them."}, {"time": 737, "text": "I don't, he care."}, {"time": 738, "text": "I go, that's a person's opinion."}, {"time": 740, "text": "You take a person's opinion, you write it down."}, {"time": 742, "text": "Doesn't give it any more relevance."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Like that person, you know, could have had that opinion in silence."}, {"time": 747, "text": "They could have had it with some friends at dinner."}, {"time": 749, "text": "They don't like me, whatever."}, {"time": 750, "text": "I don't want to read it."}, {"time": 751, "text": "I don't want to absorb it."}, {"time": 752, "text": "I don't even know them, especially if I'm not there."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And especially if it's some biased and it's it's not an objective opinion of me."}, {"time": 761, "text": "It's this, you know, they have a narrative and they want to stick to that narrative and they want to write an article and they piece it all together, make you a piece of shit."}, {"time": 770, "text": "And that's their prerogative."}, {"time": 771, "text": "They're completely out to do that."}, {"time": 773, "text": "But I know I shouldn't absorb that."}, {"time": 775, "text": "I shouldn't take that in."}, {"time": 776, "text": "You're not supposed to be taking in the opinion of the world."}, {"time": 780, "text": "You're supposed to be taking in the opinion of small groups of people that you encounter so that you get an understanding of how you make them feel."}, {"time": 789, "text": "And then maybe you say to yourself, maybe I come across too rude or maybe I come across too insensitive or maybe maybe I could do better in this way or that way."}, {"time": 801, "text": "That's how we sort of shape our personalities and it's how we we develop our social skills."}, {"time": 806, "text": "But when the people don't know you and they have this like distorted narrative of you and, you know, there's fucking millions of people."}, {"time": 815, "text": "There's so many people."}, {"time": 816, "text": "You can't be saying, you know, actually, I mean, millions of people that are like communicating about something like during the height of the, you know, the attempt to cancel me or whatever that is."}, {"time": 827, "text": "I don't know how many people were involved in that."}, {"time": 830, "text": "People take this kind of stuff seriously."}, {"time": 831, "text": "But the problem is the false narratives take hold and then you have meetings, you have groups, you have it builds on top of each other and there's this outrage and then it reaches you at some point and it can just have these destructive effects."}, {"time": 845, "text": "It can, but it also sometimes doesn't."}, {"time": 850, "text": "And in my case, it didn't."}, {"time": 852, "text": "What lessons did you draw from that?"}, {"time": 855, "text": "Mushrooms, exercise."}, {"time": 857, "text": "Mushrooms and exercise, exercise is critical."}, {"time": 860, "text": "So I don't think the mushrooms by themselves would have worked."}, {"time": 862, "text": "But that's the thing that I use for everything is the brutal exercise."}, {"time": 867, "text": "Like my exercise routines are horrible."}, {"time": 870, "text": "And because of that, everything else is easier."}, {"time": 873, "text": "I create my own bullshit and my own bullshit is so much harder."}, {"time": 877, "text": "And it's not just that."}, {"time": 878, "text": "It's also sauna and cold plunge and these torture sessions."}, {"time": 883, "text": "They in enduring those when you endure those, it makes enduring other things much easier."}, {"time": 890, "text": "And it's also an understanding of what's happening."}, {"time": 893, "text": "Like you have to know, like media, you have to understand, like what the hot take, you know, YouTube, social media, podcast, ecosphere is doing."}, {"time": 905, "text": "Like if they're talking about, you know, Lex Friedman said this and we have to comment on that and, you know, Lex gets canceled in all capital letters on a YouTube clip."}, {"time": 915, "text": "And if you you watch that, you're fucking crazy."}, {"time": 917, "text": "What are you doing, absorbing all this negativity?"}, {"time": 919, "text": "It's not good for you."}, {"time": 920, "text": "You are you, you know, you and you know, generally, if you've made a mistake, you know, generally, if people are upset with you."}, {"time": 927, "text": "You posted this awesome video on your Instagram of a woman who was being interviewed in 19, late 1920s, maybe."}, {"time": 938, "text": "And she's close to 100 years old."}, {"time": 940, "text": "So she's lived through the Civil War, through World War One."}, {"time": 944, "text": "She was at the time living through the early days of the Great Depression."}, {"time": 948, "text": "So I was just looking back, you know, what have we as a human civilization in recent times survived, especially in the United States?"}, {"time": 956, "text": "You're talking about the two world wars in the 20th century, the Great Depression, the Spanish food, the pandemic at the beginning of the 20th century."}, {"time": 964, "text": "What do we do in the United States?"}, {"time": 967, "text": "9 11."}, {"time": 967, "text": "If you think of what are the traumatic events that shook our world, it's 9 11."}, {"time": 975, "text": "It made us rethink our place in the world."}, {"time": 979, "text": "The pandemic pandemic is a huge one is one of the bigger ones, because it also accelerated and exacerbated our anxiety, which people have a certain level of anxiety already, especially sedentary people."}, {"time": 992, "text": "They have a very high level of anxiety already because I don't think they're they're giving their body what it what it needs."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "I don't think they're you know, your body has certain requirements in terms of movement."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "And when you deny your body those requirements, I think there's like a general level of anxiety that exists in almost everyone."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And then you have people obviously that have mental health issues and that also exacerbates the anxiety."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "The lockdown exacerbated the anxiety, losing loved ones to the pandemic, exacerbated anxiety."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "And then there was the the division that the different schools of thought, the people that were never going to get vaccinated no matter what."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "I ain't trusting it."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "People thought there was microchips in there."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "People that thought that, you know, Fauci's the demon and there's there was a lot."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "And there's also like political leanings."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "The right wing people tended to not want to be vaccinated, whereas the left wing people, for whatever reason, all of a sudden are trusting pharmaceutical companies like explicitly."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "It was a weird time."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "And I think over time, as it's going to as it gets analyzed and we break it down, it's going to be one of the weirder moments for shaping human culture."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And unfortunately for throwing gasoline on this already burning fire of, you know, of conflict between the various factions of of thought in this country."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "Just it's already a weird time, you know, post Trump, like the Trump era is also going to be one of the weirder times."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "When when people look back historically about the division in this country, he's such a polarizing figure that so many people felt like."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "They could abandon their own ethics and morals and principles just to attack him and anybody who supports him because he is an existential threat to democracy itself."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "But don't you think it's not a cause, but maybe like a symptom, like it's going to get you said it got real weird."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "Maybe it's going to get weirder."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "Yeah, I think it's going to get weirder."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "He's going to run again."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "You think he wins?"}, {"time": 1132, "text": "Well, he's running against a dead man."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "You know, I mean, Biden shakes hands with people that aren't even there when he gets off stage."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "I think he's seeing ghosts."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "You see him on Jimmy Kimmel the other day?"}, {"time": 1141, "text": "Well, he was just rambling."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "I mean, he's if he was anyone else, if he was a Republican, if that was Donald Trump doing that, every fucking talk show would be screaming for him to be off the air."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "And by the way, I'm not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "I've had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "I've said no every time."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "I don't want to help him."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "I'm not interested in helping."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "We'll see if I have him on the night is still young."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "I think I'll have him on."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "I think you'll have him on."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Because you'll have Putin on."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "And you're competitive as fuck."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "No, I think ultimately, I mean, you had you've had a lot of people that I think you might you may otherwise be skeptical."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "Would I have a good conversation, which I think is your metric."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "You don't care about politics."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "So can I have a good conversation?"}, {"time": 1200, "text": "And I think you had like people like Kanye on, for example, and you had a great conversation with him."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "I think you I think he is an artist, but Kanye doing well or not doing well doesn't change the course of our country."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "Yeah, but, you know, do you really bear the responsibility of the course of our country based on a conversation?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "I think you can revitalize and rehabilitate someone's image in a way that is pretty shocking."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Look at the way people look at Alex Jones now, because Alex Jones has been on my podcast a few times."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "How do they which direction?"}, {"time": 1243, "text": "The people that have watched those podcasts think he's hilarious."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And they think that he definitely fucked up with that whole Sandy Hook thing."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "But he's right more than he's wrong."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "And he's not an evil guy."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "He's just a guy who's had some psychotic breaks in his life."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "He's had some genuine mental health issues that he's addressed."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "He's had some serious bouts of alcoholism, some serious bouts of substance abuse, and they've contributed to some very poor thinking."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "But if you know the guy, if you get to know him like I have, I've known him for more than 20 years."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "And if you know him on podcasts, you realize like he is genuinely trying to unearth some things that are genuinely disturbing for most people."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "Like this is a guy that was telling me about Epstein's Island fucking decade ago."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "At least he was telling me about I was like, what you're telling me?"}, {"time": 1303, "text": "There's a place where they bring elites to compromise them with underage girls and they film them."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "Cut the fuck out here."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Like, no, President Clinton's been there."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Everyone's been there."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "Like, but it sounds like nonsense."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And not only is it true, but people keep getting fucking murdered for it."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Did you see that latest Clinton adviser that got murdered about it?"}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Hung with an extension cord, shot himself in the chest 30 miles from his house, and they're calling it a suicide."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "And now even Elon Musk is asking, where's the clientele list?"}, {"time": 1337, "text": "Yeah, we should we should probably see who's been to that island."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "Yeah, we should probably see who's been to that island."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "And there's probably more of those kind of things out there that haven't been exposed."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "Yeah, but sort of to push back in you, you had those conversations with Alex Jones."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "Wouldn't you be able to have the same kind of conversation with Donald Trump?"}, {"time": 1360, "text": "Reveal."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "No, it's not the problem."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "You revealed that Alex Jones is a human being."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "Yeah, he's fucked up."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "He has demons in his head."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "He's obviously chaotic all over the place, but there's some wisdom to the perspective he takes on the world."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Even though he is often full of shit, he is able to predict certain things that very few people are willing to bring up."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "So isn't Trump the same way?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "Fucked up person, egomaniac, whatever personality things you can talk about."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "Isn't it worthwhile to lay it out?"}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Like, who's going to, if you listen to interviews of Trump, who has the balls to call him out on this bullshit?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "Chris Wallace did."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "No, calling out somebody on their bullshit is easy when you're just being adversarial."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "But as a person who is genuinely and pathetically trying to understand, I think you're really good at that."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "Like, you pull them in."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "I don't know if he would genuinely be there."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "Like, I think he would be putting on a performance."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "You don't think he can break through that in like 30 minutes?"}, {"time": 1422, "text": "I'd need more time than that."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "And he doesn't do any drugs."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "That's the thing about Alex."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "You can get Alex high, get him drunk, and he'll start talking about interdimensional child molesters."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "You know, and then you get the real Alex."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "Or maybe you have somebody else on as well to introduce chaos, like Alex."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "You have to be one of them."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "I would have to be just me and him."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "I would have to, that would be a focused thing."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "I would have to, like, really take time with Trump."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "But also, I'm not well versed enough politically to know all of the corruption that's been alleged and to understand what the whole Russiagate stuff, what's real."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "Like, how much of it, it's clear that there is more than one organization that's involved in communicating with Russia before the 2016 election."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "So it's pretty clear that the Clinton administration was involved."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "It's pretty clear that the Trump administration had some communication with some people in Russia."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "It's pretty clear that Hunter Biden had some very suspicious dealings in Ukraine."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "And there's a lot going on there, man."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "And it's hard for anybody to parse."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "It's really hard for anybody, and especially to have an objective assessment of exactly what's going on."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And then to be able to do that and broadcast it publicly."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "That's quite a project."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "And I think if you really want to do that correctly, it's something that I would have to research for a long time."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "And to really, really, and I don't have that kind of time."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "Not for, maybe for certain people that you're really curious about."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "Like, you have that kind of time for Bob Lazar."}, {"time":

tell the difference."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "Yeah, CNN, watch them talk."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "Well, I mean, on the UFO topic, there's certain individuals that are like, okay, they're just like using this."}, {"time": 2418, "text": "In fact, like people who are not full of shit are often very quiet, which is why, you know, even Bob Lazar is an interesting story because he was trying to be quiet for the longest time."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "Well, he was worried about his own life, according to Bob, and that's why he went public with it."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "And initially,

trustworthy."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "I mean, if you're not, then people shy away from you."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "And there are people like that, too, that are really successful, but that are what I call islands."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "I've talked to other comics about that, like you don't want to be an island because there's these people that aren't attached to the rest of the
