[{"title": "Melanie Mitchell: Concepts, Analogies, Common Sense & Future of AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #61", "id": "ImKkaeUx1MU", "quotes": [{"time": 390, "text": "At a high level, if you look at the founding of the field of McCarthy and Searle and so on, are we closer to having a better sense of that line between narrow, weak AI and strong AI?"}, {"time": 410, "text": "Yes, I think we're closer to having a better idea of what that line is."}, {"time": 418, "text": "Early on, for example, a lot of people thought that playing chess would be, you couldn't play chess if you didn't have sort of general human level intelligence."}, {"time": 431, "text": "And of course, once computers were able to play chess better than humans, that revised that view."}, {"time": 438, "text": "And people said, okay, well, maybe now we have to revise what we think of intelligence as."}, {"time": 445, "text": "And so that's kind of been a theme throughout the history of the field is that once a machine can do some task, we then have to look back and say, oh, well, that changes my understanding of what intelligence is because I don't think that machine is intelligent, at least that's not what I wanna call intelligence."}, {"time": 465, "text": "So do you think that line moves forever or will we eventually really feel as a civilization like we've crossed the line if it's possible?"}, {"time": 474, "text": "It's hard to predict, but I don't see any reason why we couldn't in principle create something that we would consider intelligent."}, {"time": 483, "text": "I don't know how we will know for sure."}, {"time": 487, "text": "Maybe our own view of what intelligence is will be refined more and more until we finally figure out what we mean when we talk about it."}, {"time": 497, "text": "But I think eventually we will create machines in a sense that have intelligence."}, {"time": 504, "text": "They may not be the kinds of machines we have now."}, {"time": 508, "text": "And one of the things that that's going to produce is making us sort of understand our own machine like qualities that we in a sense are mechanical in the sense that like cells, cells are kind of mechanical."}, {"time": 527, "text": "They have algorithms, they process information by and somehow out of this mass of cells, we get this emergent property that we call intelligence."}, {"time": 541, "text": "But underlying it is really just cellular processing and lots and lots and lots of it."}, {"time": 550, "text": "Do you think we'll be able to, do you think it's possible to create intelligence without understanding our own mind?"}, {"time": 556, "text": "You said sort of in that process we'll understand more and more, but do you think it's possible to sort of create without really fully understanding from a mechanistic perspective, sort of from a functional perspective how our mysterious mind works?"}, {"time": 572, "text": "If I had to bet on it, I would say, no, we do have to understand our own minds at least to some significant extent."}, {"time": 582, "text": "But I think that's a really big open question."}, {"time": 587, "text": "I've been very surprised at how far kind of brute force approaches based on say big data and huge networks can take us."}, {"time": 597, "text": "I wouldn't have expected that."}, {"time": 599, "text": "And they have nothing to do with the way our minds work."}, {"time": 603, "text": "So that's been surprising to me, so it could be wrong."}, {"time": 606, "text": "To explore the psychological and the philosophical, do you think we're okay as a species with something that's more intelligent than us?"}, {"time": 616, "text": "Do you think perhaps the reason we're pushing that line further and further is we're afraid of acknowledging that there's something stronger, better, smarter than us humans?"}, {"time": 629, "text": "Well, I'm not sure we can define intelligence that way because smarter than is with respect to what, computers are already smarter than us in some areas."}, {"time": 642, "text": "They can multiply much better than we can."}, {"time": 645, "text": "They can figure out driving routes to take much faster and better than we can."}, {"time": 651, "text": "They have a lot more information to draw on."}, {"time": 654, "text": "They know about traffic conditions and all that stuff."}, {"time": 657, "text": "So for any given particular task, sometimes computers are much better than we are and we're totally happy with that, right?"}, {"time": 667, "text": "I'm totally happy with that."}, {"time": 668, "text": "It doesn't bother me at all."}, {"time": 670, "text": "I guess the question is which things about our intelligence would we feel very sad or upset that machines had been able to recreate?"}, {"time": 684, "text": "So in the book, I talk about my former PhD advisor, Douglas Hofstadter, who encountered a music generation program."}, {"time": 692, "text": "And that was really the line for him, that if a machine could create beautiful music, that would be terrifying for him because that is something he feels is really at the core of what it is to be human, creating beautiful music, art, literature."}, {"time": 716, "text": "He doesn't like the fact that machines can recognize spoken language really well."}, {"time": 725, "text": "He personally doesn't like using speech recognition, but I don't think it bothers him to his core because it's like, okay, that's not at the core of humanity."}, {"time": 735, "text": "But it may be different for every person what really they feel would usurp their humanity."}, {"time": 745, "text": "And I think maybe it's a generational thing also."}, {"time": 747, "text": "Maybe our children or our children's children will be adapted, they'll adapt to these new devices that can do all these tasks and say, yes, this thing is smarter than me in all these areas, but that's great because it helps me."}, {"time": 766, "text": "Looking at the broad history of our species, why do you think so many humans have dreamed of creating artificial life and artificial intelligence throughout the history of our civilization?"}, {"time": 777, "text": "So not just this century or the 20th century, but really throughout many centuries that preceded it?"}, {"time": 786, "text": "That's a really good question, and I have wondered about that."}, {"time": 789, "text": "Because I myself was driven by curiosity about my own thought processes and thought it would be fantastic to be able to get a computer to mimic some of my thought processes."}, {"time": 806, "text": "I'm not sure why we're so driven."}, {"time": 808, "text": "I think we want to understand ourselves better and we also want machines to do things for us."}, {"time": 820, "text": "But I don't know, there's something more to it because it's so deep in the kind of mythology or the ethos of our species."}, {"time": 829, "text": "And I don't think other species have this drive."}, {"time": 832, "text": "So I don't know."}, {"time": 833, "text": "If you were to sort of psychoanalyze yourself in your own interest in AI, are you, what excites you about creating intelligence?"}, {"time": 847, "text": "You said understanding our own selves?"}, {"time": 849, "text": "Yeah, I think that's what drives me particularly."}, {"time": 853, "text": "I'm really interested in human intelligence, but I'm also interested in the sort of the phenomenon of intelligence more generally."}, {"time": 868, "text": "And I don't think humans are the only thing with intelligence, or even animals."}, {"time": 874, "text": "But I think intelligence is a concept that encompasses a lot of complex systems."}, {"time": 883, "text": "And if you think of things like insect colonies or cellular processes or the immune system or all kinds of different biological or even societal processes have as an emergent property some aspects of what we would call intelligence."}, {"time": 902, "text": "They have memory, they process information, they have goals, they accomplish their goals, et cetera."}, {"time": 908, "text": "And to me, the question of what is this thing we're talking about here was really fascinating to me."}, {"time": 917, "text": "And exploring it using computers seem to be a good way to approach the question."}, {"time": 923, "text": "So do you think kind of of intelligence, do you think of our universe as a kind of hierarchy of complex systems?"}, {"time": 930, "text": "And then intelligence is just the property of any, you can look at any level and every level has some aspect of intelligence."}, {"time": 939, "text": "So we're just like one little speck in that giant hierarchy of complex systems."}, {"time": 944, "text": "I don't know if I would say any system like that has intelligence, but I guess what I wanna, I don't have a good enough definition of intelligence to say that."}, {"time": 956, "text": "So let me do sort of a multiple choice, I guess."}, {"time": 959, "text": "So you said ant colonies."}, {"time": 962, "text": "So are ant colonies intelligent?"}, {"time": 964, "text": "Are the bacteria in our body intelligent?"}, {"time": 969, "text": "And then going to the physics world molecules and the behavior at the quantum level of electrons and so on, are those kinds of systems, do they possess intelligence?"}, {"time": 982, "text": "Like where's the line that feels compelling to you?"}, {"time": 988, "text": "I mean, I think intelligence is a continuum."}, {"time": 990, "text": "And I think that the ability to, in some sense, have intention, have a goal, have some kind of self awareness is part of it."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "So I'm not sure if, you know, it's hard to know where to draw that line."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "I think that's kind of a mystery."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "But I wouldn't say that the planets orbiting the sun is an intelligent system."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "I mean, I would find that maybe not the right term to describe that."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "And there's all this debate in the field of like what's the right way to define intelligence?"}, {"time": 1032, "text": "What's the right way to model intelligence?"}, {"time": 1035, "text": "Should we think about computation?"}, {"time": 1036, "text": "Should we think about dynamics?"}, {"time": 1038, "text": "And should we think about free energy and all of that stuff?"}, {"time": 1043, "text": "And I think that it's a fantastic time to be in the field because there's so many questions and so much we don't understand."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "There's so much work to do."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "So are we the most special kind of intelligence in this kind of, you said there's a bunch of different elements and characteristics of intelligence systems and colonies."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "Is human intelligence the thing in our brain?"}, {"time": 1073, "text": "Is that the most interesting kind of intelligence in this continuum?"}, {"time": 1077, "text": "Well, it's interesting to us because it is us."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "I mean, interesting to me, yes."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "And because I'm part of, you know, human."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "But to understanding the fundamentals of intelligence, what I'm getting at, is studying the human, is sort of, if everything we've talked about, what you talk about in your book, what just the AI field, this notion, yes, it's hard to define, but it's usually talking about something that's very akin to human intelligence."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Yeah, to me it is the most interesting because it's the most complex, I think."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "It's the most self aware."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "It's the only system, at least that I know of, that reflects on its own intelligence."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And you talk about the history of AI and us, in terms of creating artificial intelligence, being terrible at predicting the future with AI, with tech in general."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "So why do you think we're so bad at predicting the future?"}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Are we hopelessly bad?"}, {"time": 1139, "text": "So no matter what, whether it's this decade or the next few decades, every time we make a prediction, there's just no way of doing it well, or as the field matures, we'll be better and better at it."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "I believe as the field matures, we will be better."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "And I think the reason that we've had so much trouble is that we have so little understanding of our own intelligence."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "So there's the famous story about Marvin Minsky assigning computer vision as a summer project to his undergrad students."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And I believe that's actually a true story."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Yeah, no, there's a write up on it."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "Everyone should read."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "It's like a, I think it's like a proposal that describes everything that should be done in that project."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "It's hilarious because it, I mean, you could explain it, but from my recollection, it describes basically all the fundamental problems of computer vision, many of which still haven't been solved."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "Yeah, and I don't know how far they really expect it to get."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "But I think that, and they're really, Marvin Minsky is a super smart guy and very sophisticated thinker."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "But I think that no one really understands or understood, still doesn't understand how complicated, how complex the things that we do are because they're so invisible to us."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "To us, vision, being able to look out at the world and describe what we see, that's just immediate."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "It feels like it's no work at all."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "So it didn't seem like it would be that hard, but there's so much going on unconsciously, sort of invisible to us that I think we overestimate how easy it will be to get computers to do it."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And sort of for me to ask an unfair question, you've done research, you've thought about many different branches of AI through this book, widespread looking at where AI has been, where it is today."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "If you were to make a prediction, how many years from now would we as a society create something that you would say achieved human level intelligence or superhuman level intelligence?"}, {"time": 1283, "text": "That is an unfair question."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "A prediction that will most likely be wrong."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "But it's just your notion because."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "Okay, I'll say more than 100 years."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "More than 100 years."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "And I quoted somebody in my book who said that human level intelligence is 100 Nobel Prizes away, which I like because it's a nice way to sort of, it's a nice unit for prediction."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "And it's like that many fantastic discoveries have to be made."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And of course there's no Nobel Prize in AI, not yet at least."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "That would be my guess."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "I think that in the sort of going along in the narrow AI that the current approaches will get better."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "I think there's some fundamental limits to how far they're gonna get."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "I might be wrong, but that's what I think."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "And there's some fundamental weaknesses that they have that I talk about in the book that just comes from this approach of supervised learning requiring sort of feed forward networks and so on."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "It's just, I don't think it's a sustainable approach to understanding the world."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "Yeah, I'm personally torn on it."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Sort of everything you read about in the book and sort of what we're talking about now, I agree with you, but I'm more and more, depending on the day, first of all, I'm deeply surprised by the success of machine learning and deep learning in general."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "From the very beginning, when I was, it's really been my main focus of work."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "I'm just surprised how far it gets."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And I'm also think we're really early on in these efforts of these narrow AI."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "So I think there'll be a lot of surprise of how far it gets."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "I think we'll be extremely impressed."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "Like my sense is everything I've seen so far, and we'll talk about autonomous driving and so on, I think we can get really far."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "But I also have a sense that we will discover, just like you said, is that even though we'll get really far in order to create something like our own intelligence, it's actually much farther than we realize."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "I think these methods are a lot more powerful than people give them credit for actually."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "So that of course there's the media hype, but I think there's a lot of researchers in the community, especially like not undergrads, right?"}, {"time": 1486, "text": "But like people who've been in AI, they're skeptical about how far deep learning can get."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "And I'm more and more thinking that it can actually get farther than they'll realize."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "It's certainly possible."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "One thing that surprised me when I was writing the book is how far apart different people in the field are on their opinion of how far the field has come and what is accomplished and what's gonna happen next."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "What's your sense of the different, who are the different people, groups, mindsets, thoughts in the community about where AI is today?"}, {"time": 1522, "text": "Yeah, they're all over the place."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "So there's kind of the singularity transhumanism group."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "I don't know exactly how to characterize that approach, which is sort of the sort of exponential, exponential progress where we're on the sort of almost at the hugely accelerating part of the exponential."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "And in the next 30 years, we're going to see super intelligent AI and all that, and we'll be able to upload our brains and that."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "So there's that kind of extreme view that most, I think most people who work in AI don't have."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "They disagree with that."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "But there are people who are, maybe aren't singularity people, but they do think that the current approach of deep learning is going to scale and is going to kind of go all the way basically and take us to true AI or human level AI or whatever you wanna call it."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "And there's quite a few of them."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And a lot of them, like a lot of the people I've met who work at big tech companies in AI groups kind of have this view that we're really not that far."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Just to linger on that point, sort of if I can take as an example, like Yann LeCun, I don't know if you know about his work and so his viewpoints on this."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "He believes that there's a bunch of breakthroughs, like fundamental, like Nobel prizes that are needed still."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "But I think he thinks those breakthroughs will be built on top of deep learning."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "And then there's some people who think we need to kind of put deep learning to the side a little bit as just one module that's helpful in the bigger cognitive framework."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "Right, so I think somewhat I understand Yann LeCun is rightly saying supervised learning is not sustainable."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "We have to figure out how to do unsupervised learning, that that's gonna be the key."}, {"time": 1654, "text": "And I think that's probably true."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "I think unsupervised learning is gonna be harder than people think."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "I mean, the way that we humans do it."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "Then there's the opposing view, there's the Gary Marcus kind of hybrid view where deep learning is one part, but we need to bring back kind of these symbolic approaches and combine them."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "Of course, no one knows how to do that very well."}, {"time": 1686, "text": "Which is the more important part to emphasize and how do they fit together?"}, {"time": 1692, "text": "What's the foundation?"}, {"time": 1693, "text": "What's the thing that's on top?"}, {"time": 1695, "text": "What's the cake?"}, {"time": 1696, "text": "What's the icing?"}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Then there's people pushing different things."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "There's the people, the causality people who say, deep learning as it's formulated today completely lacks any notion of causality."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "And that's, dooms it."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "And therefore we have to somehow give it some kind of notion of causality."}, {"time": 1721, "text": "There's a lot of push from the more cognitive science crowd saying, we have to look at developmental learning."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "We have to look at how babies learn."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "We have to look at intuitive physics, all these things we know about physics."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "And as somebody kind of quipped, we also have to teach machines intuitive metaphysics, which means like objects exist."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "Causality exists."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "These things that maybe we're born with."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "I don't know that they don't have the, machines don't have any of that."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "They look at a group of pixels and maybe they get 10 million examples, but they can't necessarily learn that there are objects in the world."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "So there's just a lot of pieces of the puzzle that people are promoting and with different opinions of like how important they are and how close we are to being able to put them all together to create general intelligence."}, {"time": 1794, "text": "Looking at this broad field, what do you take away from it?"}, {"time": 1797, "text": "Who is the most impressive?"}, {"time": 1799, "text": "Is it the cognitive folks, the Gary Marcus camp, the on camp, unsupervised and their self supervised."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "There's the supervisors and then there's the engineers who are actually building systems."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "You have sort of the Andrej Karpathy at Tesla building actual, it's not philosophy, it's real like systems that operate in the real world."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "What do you take away from all this beautiful variety?"}, {"time": 1823, "text": "I don't know if, these different views are not necessarily mutually exclusive."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "And I think people like Yann LeCun agrees with the developmental psychology of causality, intuitive physics, et cetera."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "But he still thinks that it's learning, like end to end learning is the way to go."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "Will take us perhaps all the way."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "Yeah, and that we don't need, there's no sort of innate stuff that has to get built in."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "This is, it's because it's a hard problem."}, {"time": 1862, "text": "I personally, I'm very sympathetic to the cognitive science side, cause that's kind of where I came in to the field."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "I've become more and more sort of an embodiment adherent saying that without having a body, it's gonna be very hard to learn what we need to learn about the world."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "That's definitely something I'd love to talk about in a little bit."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "To step into the cognitive world, then if you don't mind, cause you've done so many interesting things."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "If you look to copycat, taking a couple of decades step back, you, Douglas Hofstadter and others have created and developed copycat more than 30 years ago."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "That's painful to hear."}, {"time": 1910, "text": "So what is it?"}, {"time": 1911, "text": "What is copycat?"}, {"time": 1914, "text": "It's a program that makes analogies in an idealized domain, idealized world of letter strings."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "So as you say, 30 years ago, wow."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "So I started working on it when I started grad school in 1984."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "Wow, dates me."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And it's based on Doug Hofstadter's ideas about that analogy is really a core aspect of thinking."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "I remember he has a really nice quote in the book by himself and Emmanuel Sandor called Surfaces and Essences."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "I don't know if you've seen that book, but it's about analogy and he says, without concepts, there can be no thought and without analogies, there can be no concepts."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "So the view is that analogy is not just this kind of reasoning technique where we go, shoe is to foot as glove is to what, these kinds of things that we have on IQ tests or whatever, but that it's much deeper, it's much more pervasive in every thing we do, in our language, our thinking, our perception."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "So he had a view that was a very active perception idea."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "And so copycat was trying to do that, kind of simulate that kind of idea where you have these agents, it's kind of an agent based system and you have these agents that are picking things to look at and deciding whether they were interesting or not and whether they should be looked at more and that would influence other agents."}, {"time": 2055, "text": "Now, how do they interact?"}, {"time": 2057, "text": "So they interacted through this global kind of what we call the workspace."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "So it's actually inspired by the old blackboard systems where you would have agents that post information on a blackboard, a common blackboard."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "This is like very old fashioned AI."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "Is that, are we talking about like in physical space?"}, {"time": 2076, "text": "Is this a computer program?"}, {"time": 2077, "text": "It's a computer program."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "So agents posting concepts on a blackboard kind of thing?"}, {"time": 2081, "text": "Yeah, we called it a workspace."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "And the workspace is a data structure."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "The agents are little pieces of code that you could think of them as little detectors or little filters that say, I'm gonna pick this place to look and I'm gonna look for a certain thing and is this the thing I think is important, is it there?"}, {"time": 2103, "text": "So it's almost

about it or whatever, you do some kind of mental simulation that allows you to predict what's gonna happen, to develop expectations of what's gonna happen."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "So that's the kind of structure I think we need, is that kind of mental model that, and in our brains, somehow these mental models are very much interconnected."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "Again, so a lot of stuff

least."}, {"time": 3601, "text": "It's easy to criticize them."}, {"time": 3605, "text": "Well, look, like exactly what you're saying, mental models sort of almost put a psychology hat on, say, look, these networks are clearly not able to achieve what we humans do with forming mental models, analogy making and so on."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "But that doesn't mean that they fundamentally cannot do that."}, {"time": 3623, "text": "Like it's very difficult to say that."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "I mean, at least to me, do you have a notion that the learning approach is really, I mean, they're going to not only are they limited today, but they will forever be limited in being able to construct such mental models."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "I think the idea of the dynamic perception is key here."}, {"time": 3647, "text": "The idea that moving your eyes around and getting feedback."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "And that's something that, you know, there's been some models like that."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "There's certainly recurrent neural networks that operate over several time steps."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "But the problem is that the actual, the recurrence is, you know, basically the feedback is at the next time step is the entire hidden state of the network, which is, it turns out that that doesn't work very well."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "But see, the thing I'm saying is mathematically speaking, it has the information in that recurrence to capture everything, it just doesn't seem to work."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "So like, you know, it's like, it's the same Turing machine question, right?"}, {"time": 3704, "text": "Yeah, maybe theoretically, computers, anything that's Turing, a universal Turing machine can be intelligent, but practically, the architecture might be very specific."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "Kind of architecture to be able to create it."}, {"time": 3724, "text": "So just, I guess it sort of asks almost the same question again is how big of a role do you think deep learning needs, will play or needs to play in this, in perception?"}, {"time": 3740, "text": "I think that deep learning as it's currently, as it currently exists, you know, will place, that kind of thing will play some role."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "But I think that there's a lot more going on in perception."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "But who knows, you know, the definition of deep learning, I mean, it's pretty broad."}, {"time": 3761, "text": "It's kind of an umbrella for a lot of different things."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "So what I mean is purely sort of neural networks."}, {"time": 3765, "text": "Yeah, and a feed forward neural networks."}, {"time": 3768, "text": "Essentially, or there could be recurrence, but sometimes it feels like, for instance, I talked to Gary Marcus, it feels like the criticism of deep learning is kind of like us birds criticizing airplanes for not flying well, or that they're not really flying."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "Do you think deep learning, do you think it could go all the way?"}, {"time": 3792, "text": "Like Yann LeCun thinks."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "Do you think that, yeah, the brute force learning approach can go all the way?"}, {"time": 3801, "text": "I don't think so, no."}, {"time": 3803, "text": "I mean, I think it's an open question, but I tend to be on the innateness side that there's some things that we've been evolved to be able to learn, and that learning just can't happen without them."}, {"time": 3824, "text": "So one example, here's an example I had in the book that I think is useful to me, at least, in thinking about this."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "So this has to do with the Deep Minds Atari game playing program, okay?"}, {"time": 3839, "text": "And it learned to play these Atari video games just by getting input from the pixels of the screen, and it learned to play the game Breakout 1,000% better than humans, okay?"}, {"time": 3858, "text": "That was one of their results, and it was great."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "And it learned this thing where it tunneled through the side of the bricks in the breakout game, and the ball could bounce off the ceiling and then just wipe out bricks."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "Okay, so there was a group who did an experiment where they took the paddle that you move with the joystick and moved it up two pixels or something like that."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "And then they looked at a deep Q learning system that had been trained on Breakout and said, could it now transfer its learning to this new version of the game?"}, {"time": 3895, "text": "Of course, a human could, and it couldn't."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "Maybe that's not surprising, but I guess the point is it hadn't learned the concept of a paddle."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "It hadn't learned the concept of a ball or the concept of tunneling."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "It was learning something, you know, we looking at it kind of anthropomorphized it and said, oh, here's what it's doing in the way we describe it."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "But it actually didn't learn those concepts."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "And so because it didn't learn those concepts, it couldn't make this transfer."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "Yes, so that's a beautiful statement, but at the same time, by moving the paddle, we also anthropomorphize flaws to inject into the system that will then flip how impressed we are by it."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "What I mean by that is, to me, the Atari games were, to me, deeply impressive that that was possible at all."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "So like I have to first pause on that, and people should look at that, just like the game of Go, which is fundamentally different to me than what Deep Blue did."}, {"time": 3959, "text": "Even though there's still a tree search, it's just everything DeepMind has done in terms of learning, however limited it is, is still deeply surprising to me."},

interesting."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "Is moving the board just another thing that needs to be learned?"}, {"time": 3984, "text": "So like we've been able to, maybe, maybe, been able to, through the current neural networks, learn very basic concepts that are not enough to do this general reasoning, and maybe with more data."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "I mean, the interesting thing about the examples that you talk about beautifully is it's often flaws of the data."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "Well, that's the question."}, {"time": 4009, "text": "I mean, I think that is the key question, whether it's a flaw of the data or not."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "Because the reason I brought up this example was because you were asking, do I think that learning from data could go all the way?"}, {"time": 4021, "text": "And this was why I brought up the example, because I think, and this is not at all to take away from the impressive work that they did, but it's to say that when we look at what these systems learn, do they learn the things that we humans consider to be the relevant concepts?"}, {"time": 4045, "text": "And in that example, it didn't."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "Sure, if you train it on moving, you know, the paddle being in different places, maybe it could deal with, maybe it would learn that concept."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "I'm not totally sure."}, {"time": 4062, "text": "But the question is, you know, scaling that up to more complicated worlds, to what extent could a machine that only gets this very raw data learn to divide up the world into relevant concepts?"}, {"time": 4078, "text": "And I don't know the answer, but I would bet that without some innate notion that it can't do it."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "Yeah, 10 years ago, I 100% agree with you as the most experts in AI system, but now I have a glimmer of hope."}, {"time": 4099, "text": "Okay, I mean, that's fair enough."}, {"time": 4101, "text": "And I think that's what deep learning did in the community is, no, no, if I had to bet all my money, it's 100% deep learning will not take us all the way."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "But there's still other, it's still, I was so personally sort of surprised by the Atari games, by Go, by the power of self play of just game playing against each other that I was like many other times just humbled of how little I know about what's possible in this approach."}, {"time": 4129, "text": "Yeah, I think fair enough."}, {"time": 4131, "text": "Self play is amazingly powerful."}, {"time": 4133, "text": "And that goes way back to Arthur Samuel, right, with his checker plane program, which was brilliant and surprising that it did so well."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "So just for fun, let me ask you on the topic of autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "It's the area that I work at least these days most closely on, and it's also area that I think is a good example that you use as sort of an example of things we as humans don't always realize how hard it is to do."}, {"time": 4168, "text": "It's like the constant trend in AI, but the different problems that we think are easy when we first try them and then realize how hard it is."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "Okay, so you've talked about autonomous driving being a difficult problem, more difficult than we realize."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "Humans give it credit for it."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "Why is it so difficult?"}, {"time": 4187, "text": "What are the most difficult parts in your view?"}, {"time": 4191, "text": "I think it's difficult because of the world is so open ended as to what kinds of things can happen."}, {"time": 4199, "text": "So you have sort of what normally happens, which is just you drive along and nothing surprising happens, and autonomous vehicles can do, the ones we have now evidently can do really well on most normal situations as long as the weather is reasonably good and everything."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "But if some, we have this notion of edge cases or things in the tail of the distribution, we call it the long tail problem, which says that there's so many possible things that can happen that was not in the training data of the machine that it won't be able to handle it because it doesn't have common sense."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "Right, it's the old, the paddle moved problem."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "Yeah, it's the paddle moved problem, right."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "And so my understanding, and you probably are more of an expert than I am on this, is that current self driving car vision systems have problems with obstacles, meaning that they don't know which obstacles, which quote unquote obstacles they should stop for and which ones they shouldn't stop for."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "And so a lot of times I read that they tend to slam on the brakes quite a bit."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "And the most common accidents with self driving cars are people rear ending them because they were surprised."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "They weren't expecting the machine, the car to stop."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "Yeah, so there's a lot of interesting questions there."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "Whether, because you mentioned kind of two things."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "So one is the problem of perception, of understanding, of interpreting the objects that are detected correctly."}, {"time": 4311, "text": "And the other one is more like the policy, the action that you take, how you respond to it."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "So a lot of the car's braking is a kind of notion of, to clarify, there's a lot of different kind of things that are people calling autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "But the L4 vehicles with a safety driver are the ones like Waymo and Cruise and those companies, they tend to be very conservative and cautious."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "So they tend to be very, very afraid of hurting anything or anyone and getting in any kind of accidents."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "So their policy is very kind of, that results in being exceptionally responsive to anything that could possibly be an obstacle, right?"}, {"time": 4353, "text": "Right, which the human drivers around it, it behaves unpredictably."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "Yeah, that's not a very human thing to do, caution."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "That's not the thing we're good at, especially in driving."}, {"time": 4366, "text": "We're in a hurry, often angry and et cetera, especially in Boston."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "And then there's sort of another, and a lot of times, machine learning is not a huge part of that."}, {"time": 4377, "text": "It's becoming more and more unclear to me how much sort of speaking to public information because a lot of companies say they're doing deep learning and machine learning just to attract good candidates."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "The reality is in many cases, it's still not a huge part of the perception."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "There's LiDAR and there's other sensors that are much more reliable for obstacle detection."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "And then there's Tesla approach, which is vision only."}, {"time": 4407, "text": "And there's, I think a few companies doing that, but Tesla most sort of famously pushing that forward."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "And that's because the LiDAR is too expensive, right?"}, {"time": 4415, "text": "Well, I mean, yes, but I would say if you were to for free give to every Tesla vehicle, I mean, Elon Musk fundamentally believes that LiDAR is a crutch, right, famously said that."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "That if you want to solve the problem of machine learning, LiDAR should not be the primary sensor is the belief."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "The camera contains a lot more information."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "So if you want to learn, you want that information."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "But if you want to not to hit obstacles, you want LiDAR, right?"}, {"time": 4453, "text": "Sort of it's this weird trade off because yeah, sort of what Tesla vehicles have a lot of, which is really the thing, the fallback, the primary fallback sensor is radar, which is a very crude version of LiDAR."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "It's a good detector of obstacles except when those things are standing, right?"}, {"time": 4477, "text": "The stopped vehicle."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "Right, that's why it had problems with crashing into stop fire trucks."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "Stop fire trucks, right."}, {"time": 4484, "text": "So the hope there is that the vision sensor would somehow catch that."}, {"time": 4489, "text": "And for, there's a lot of problems with perception."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "They are doing actually some incredible stuff in the, almost like an active learning space where it's constantly taking edge cases and pulling back in."}, {"time": 4506, "text": "There's this data pipeline."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "Another aspect that is really important that people are studying now is called multitask learning, which is sort of breaking apart this problem, whatever the problem is, in this case driving, into dozens or hundreds of little problems that you can turn into learning problems."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "So this giant pipeline, it's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 4530, "text": "I've been skeptical from the very beginning, but become less and less skeptical over time how much of driving can be learned."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "I still think it's much farther than the CEO of that particular company thinks it will be, but it's constantly surprising that through good engineering and data collection and active selection of data, how you can attack that long tail."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "And it's an interesting open question that you're absolutely right."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "There's a much longer tail and all these edge cases that we don't think about, but it's a fascinating question that applies to natural language and all spaces."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "How big is that long tail?"}, {"time": 4572, "text": "And I mean, not to linger on the point, but what's your sense in driving in these practical problems of the human experience?"}, {"time": 4584, "text": "Can it be learned?"}, {"time": 4586, "text": "So the current, what are your thoughts of sort of Elon Musk thought, let's forget the thing that he says it'd be solved in a year, but can it be solved in a reasonable timeline or do fundamentally other methods need to be invented?"}, {"time": 4601, "text": "So I don't, I think that ultimately driving, so it's a trade off in a way, being able to drive and deal with any situation that comes up does require kind of full human intelligence."}, {"time": 4619, "text": "And even in humans aren't intelligent enough to do it because humans, I mean, most human accidents are because the human wasn't paying attention or the humans drunk or whatever."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "And not because they weren't intelligent enough."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "And not because they weren't intelligent enough, right."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "Whereas the accidents with autonomous vehicles is because they weren't intelligent enough."}, {"time": 4645, "text": "They're always paying attention."}, {"time": 4646, "text": "Yeah, they're always paying attention."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "So it's a trade off, you know, and I think that it's a very fair thing to say that autonomous vehicles will be ultimately safer than humans because humans are very unsafe."}, {"time": 4659, "text": "It's kind of a low bar."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "But just like you said, I think humans got a better rap, right."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "Because we're really good at the common sense thing."}, {"time": 4670, "text": "Yeah, we're great at the common sense thing."}, {"time": 4672, "text": "We're bad at the paying attention thing."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "Paying attention thing, right."}, {"time": 4674, "text": "Especially when we're, you know, driving is kind of boring and we have these phones to play with and everything."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "But I think what's going to happen is that for many reasons, not just AI reasons, but also like legal and other reasons, that the definition of self driving is going to change or autonomous is going to change."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "It's not going to be just, I'm going to go to sleep in the back and you just drive me anywhere."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "It's going to be more certain areas are going to be instrumented to have the sensors and the mapping and all of the stuff you need for, that the autonomous cars won't have to have full common sense and they'll do just fine in those areas as long as pedestrians don't mess with them too much."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "That's another question."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "But I don't think we will have fully autonomous self driving in the way that like most, the average person thinks of it for a very long time."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "And just to reiterate, this is the interesting open question that I think I agree with you on, is to solve fully autonomous driving, you have to be able to engineer in common sense."}, {"time": 4759, "text": "I think it's an important thing to hear and think about."}, {"time": 4763, "text": "I hope that's wrong, but I currently agree with you that unfortunately you do have to have, to be more specific, sort of these deep understandings of physics and of the way this world works and also the human dynamics."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "Like you mentioned, pedestrians and cyclists, actually that's whatever that nonverbal communication as some people call it, there's that dynamic that is also part of this common sense."}, {"time": 4791, "text": "And we humans are pretty good at predicting what other humans are going to do."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "And how our actions impact the behaviors of this weird game theoretic dance that we're good at somehow."}, {"time": 4805, "text": "And the funny thing is, because I've watched countless hours of pedestrian video and talked to people, we humans are also really bad at articulating the knowledge we have."}, {"time": 4817, "text": "Which has been a huge challenge."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "So you've mentioned embodied intelligence."}, {"time": 4823, "text": "What do you think it takes to build a system of human level intelligence?"}, {"time": 4827, "text": "Does it need to have a body?"}, {"time": 4829, "text": "I'm not sure, but I'm coming around to that more and more."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "And what does it mean to be, I don't mean to keep bringing up Yann LeCun."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "He looms very large."}, {"time": 4842, "text": "Well, he certainly has a large personality."}, {"time": 4846, "text": "He thinks that the system needs to be grounded, meaning he needs to sort of be able to interact with reality, but doesn't think it necessarily needs to have a body."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "So when you think of..."}, {"time": 4857, "text": "So what's the difference?"}, {"time": 4858, "text": "I guess I want to ask, when you mean body, do you mean you have to be able to play with the world?"}, {"time": 4864, "text": "Or do you also mean like there's a body that you have to preserve?"}, {"time": 4871, "text": "I haven't really thought about that, but I think both, I would guess."}, {"time": 4875, "text": "Because I think intelligence, it's so hard to separate it from our desire for self preservation, our emotions, all that non rational stuff that kind of gets in the way of logical thinking."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "Because the way, if we're talking about human intelligence or human level intelligence, whatever that means, a huge part of it is social."}, {"time": 4915, "text": "We were evolved to be social and to deal with other people."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "And that's just so ingrained in us that it's hard to separate intelligence from that."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "I think AI for the last 70 years or however long it's been around, it has largely been separated."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "There's this idea that there's like, it's kind of very Cartesian."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "There's this thinking thing that we're trying to create, but we don't care about all this other stuff."}, {"time": 4950, "text": "And I think the other stuff is very fundamental."}, {"time": 4954, "text": "So there's idea that things like emotion can get in the way of intelligence."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "As opposed to being an integral part of it."}, {"time": 4962, "text": "Integral part of it."}, {"time": 4963, "text":

the limits of the human mind, which is emotion and fear and all those kinds of things are integral to intelligence."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "Could you elaborate on that?"}, {"time": 5027, "text":

speak, what do you think about natural language in general and the messiness of our human world, about trying to express difficult things?"}, {"time": 1215, "text": "So the idea of literate programming is really to try to understand something better by seeing it from at least two perspectives, the formal and the informal."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "If we're trying to understand a complicated thing, if we can look at it in different ways."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "And so this is in fact the key to technical writing, a good technical writer trying not to be obvious about it,

that better for the writer or the reader or both?"}, {"time": 1261, "text": "Well, the writer just tries to understand the reader."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "That's the goal of a writer, is to have a good mental image of the reader and to say what the reader expects next and to impress the reader with what has impressed the writer why something is interesting."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So when you have a computer program, we try to, instead of looking at it as something that we're just trying to give instruction to the computer, what we really wanna be is giving insight to the person who's gonna be maintaining this program or to the programmer himself when he's debugging it as to why this stuff is being done."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "And so all the techniques of exposition that a teacher uses or a book writer uses make you a better programmer if your program is gonna be not just a one shot deal."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "So how difficult is that?"}, {"time": 1324, "text": "Do you see hope for the combination of informal and formal for the programming task?"}, {"time": 1332, "text": "Yeah, I'm the wrong person to ask, I guess, because I'm a geek, but I think for a geek it's easy."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "Some people have difficulty writing and that might be because there's something in their brain structure that makes it hard for them to write or it might be something

think that writing is half of my life and so I put it together in a literate program."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "Even when I'm writing a one shot program, I write it in a literate way because I get it

how difficult is it to design a system where much of the programming is done informally?"}, {"time": 1399, "text": "Informally?"}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Yeah, informally."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "I think whatever works to make it understandable is good, but then you have to also understand how informal is."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "You have to know the limitations."}, {"time": 1415, "text":

an example."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "There's a puzzle that's self referential."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "It's called a Japanese arrow puzzle."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "And you're given a bunch of boxes."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "Each one points north, east, south, or west."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And at the end, you're supposed to fill in each box with the number of distinct numbers that it points to."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "So if I put a three in a box, that means that, and it's pointing to five other boxes, that means that there's gonna be three different numbers in those five boxes."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "And those boxes are pointing, one of them might be pointing to me, one of them might be pointing the other way."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "But anyway, I'm supposed to find a set of numbers that obeys this complicated condition that each number counts how many distinct numbers it points to."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And so a guy sent me his solution to this problem where he presents formal statements that say either this is true or this is true or this is true."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "And so I try to render that formal statement informally and I try to say, I contain a three and the guys I'm pointing to contain the numbers one, two, and six."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "So by putting it informally and also I convert it into a dialogue statement, that helps me understand the logical statement that he's written down as a string of numbers in terms of some abstract variables that he had."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "So maybe an extension of that, there has been a resurgence in computer science and machine learning and neural networks."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "So using data to construct algorithms."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "So it's another way to construct algorithms, really."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "If you can think of it that way."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "So as opposed to natural language to construct algorithms, use data to construct algorithms."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "So what's your view of this branch of computer science where data is almost more important than the mechanism of the algorithm?"}, {"time": 1578, "text": "It seems to be suited to a certain kind of non geek, which is probably why it's taken off."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "It has its own community that really resonates with that."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "But it's hard to trust something like that because nobody, even the people who work with it, they have no idea what has been learned."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "That's a really interesting thought that it makes algorithms more accessible to a different community, a different type of brain."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "And that's really interesting because just like literate programming perhaps could make programming more accessible to a certain kind of brain."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "There are people who think it's just a matter of education and anybody can learn to be a great programmer."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "Anybody can learn to be a great skier."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "I wish that were true, but I know that there's a lot of things that I've tried to do and I was

elevator summary."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "Elevator, that's great."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "But depending how many floors there are in the building."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "The first volume called Fundamental Algorithms talks about something that you can't, the stuff you can't do without."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "You have to know the basic concepts of what is a program, what is an algorithm."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And it also talks about a low level machine so you can have some kind of an idea what's going on."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "And it has basic concepts of input

thing that makes my book different from a lot of others is that I try to, not only present the algorithm, but I try to analyze them, which means quantitatively I say, not only does it work, but it works this fast."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "Okay, and so I need math for that."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "And then there's the standard way to structure data inside and represent information in the computer."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "So that's all volume one."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "Volume two talks, it's called Seminumerical Algorithms."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "And here we're writing programs, but we're also dealing with numbers."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "Algorithms deal with any kinds of objects, but specific when there's objects or numbers, well then we have certain special paradigms that apply to things that involve numbers."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "And so there's arithmetic on numbers and there's matrices full of numbers, there's random numbers, and there's power series full of numbers."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "There's different algebraic concepts that have numbers in structured ways."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "And arithmetic in the way a computer would think about arithmetic, so floating point."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "Floating point arithmetic, high precision arithmetic, not only addition, subtraction, multiplication, but also comparison of numbers."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "So then volume three talks about."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "I like that one, sorting and search."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "Sorting and search."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "I love sorting."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "Right, so here we're not dealing necessarily with numbers because you sort letters and other objects and searching we're doing all the time with Google nowadays, but I mean, we have to find stuff."}, {"time": 1869, "text": "So again, algorithms that underlie all kinds of applications."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "None of these volumes is about a particular application, but the applications are examples of why people want to know about sorting, why people want to know about random numbers."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "So then volume four goes into combinatorial algorithm."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "This is where we have zillions of things to deal with and here we keep finding cases where one good idea can make something go more than a million times faster."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "And we're dealing with problems that are probably never gonna be solved efficiently, but that doesn't mean we give up on them and we have this chance to have good ideas and go much, much faster on them."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "So that's combinatorial algorithms and those are the ones that are, I mean, you said sorting is most fun for you."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "It's true, it's fun, but combinatorial algorithms are the ones that I always enjoyed the most because that's when my skillet programming had most payoff."}, {"time": 1942, "text": "The difference between an obvious algorithm that you think up first thing and an interesting, subtle algorithm that's not so obvious, but run circles around the other one, that's where computer science really comes in."}, {"time": 1963, "text": "And a lot of these combinatorial methods were found first in applications to artificial intelligence or cryptography."}, {"time": 1972,

"Graphs are great because they're terrific models of so many things in the real world and you throw numbers on a graph, you got a network and so there you have many more things."}, {"time": 1998, "text": "But combinatorial in general is any arrangement of objects that has some kind of higher structure, nonrandom structure and is it possible to put something together satisfying all these conditions?"}, {"time": 2019, "text": "Like I mentioned arrows a minute ago, is there a way to put these numbers on a bunch of boxes that are pointing to each other?"}, {"time": 2027, "text": "Is that gonna be possible at all?"}, {"time": 2028, "text": "That's volume four."}, {"time": 2032, "text": "What does the future hold?"}, {"time": 2032, "text": "Volume four A was part one."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "And what happened was in 1962, when I started writing down a table of contents, it wasn't gonna be a book about computer programming in general, it was gonna be a book about how to write compilers."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "And I was asked to write a book explaining how to write a compiler."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "And at that time, there were only a few dozen people in the world who had written compilers and I happened to be one of them."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "And I also had some experience writing for like the campus newspaper and things like that."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "So I said, okay, great."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "I'm the only person I know who's written a compiler but hasn't invented any new techniques for writing compilers."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "And all the other people I knew had super ideas but I couldn't see that they would be able to write a book that would describe anybody else's ideas with their own."}, {"time": 2095, "text": "So I could be the journalist and I could explain what all these cool ideas about compiler writing were."}, {"time": 2104, "text": "And then I started putting down, well, yeah, you need to have a chapter about data structures."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "You need to have some introductory material."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "I wanna talk about searching because a compiler writer has to look up the variables in a symbol table and find out which, when you write the name of a variable in one place, it's supposed to be the same as the one you put somewhere else."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "So you need all these basic techniques and I kinda know some arithmetic and stuff."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "So I threw in these chapters and I threw in a chapter on combinatorics because that was what I really enjoyed programming the most but there weren't many algorithms known about combinatorial methods in 1962."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "So that was a kind of a short chapter but it was sort of thrown in just for fun."}, {"time": 2158, "text": "And chapter 12 was gonna be actual compilers, applying all the stuff in chapters one to 11 to make compilers."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "Well, okay, so that was my table of contents from 1962."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "And during the 70s, the whole field of combinatorics went through a huge explosion."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "People talk about a combinatorial explosion and they usually mean by that that the number of cases goes up, you know, you change end to end plus one and all of a sudden your problem has gotten more than 10 times harder."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "But there was an explosion of ideas about combinatorics in the 70s to the point that like take 1975, I bet you more than half of all the journals of computer science were about combinatorial methods."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "What kind of problems were occupying people's minds?"}, {"time": 2212, "text": "What kind of problems in combinatorics?"}, {"time": 2214, "text": "Was it satisfiability, graph theory?"}, {"time": 2217, "text": "Yeah, graph theory was quite dominant."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "I mean, but all of the NP hard problems that you have like Hamiltonian path."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "Travel salesman."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "Going beyond graphs, you had operation research whenever there was a small class of problems that had efficient solutions and they were usually associated with matron theory, special mathematical construction."}, {"time": 2244, "text": "But once we went to things that involve three things at a time instead of two, all of a sudden things got harder."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So we had satisfiability problems where if you have clauses, every clause has two logical elements in it, then we can satisfy it in linear time."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "We can test for satisfiability in linear time, but if you allow yourself three variables in the clause, then nobody knows how to do it."}, {"time": 2272, "text": "So these articles were about trying to find better ways to solve cryptography problems and graph theory problems."}, {"time": 2281, "text": "We have lots of data, but we didn't know how to find the best subsets of the data."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "Like with sorting, we could get the answer."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "Didn't take long."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "So how did it continue to change from the 70s to today?"}, {"time": 2296, "text": "Yeah, so now there may be half a dozen conferences whose topic is combinatorics, a different kind, but fortunately I don't have to rewrite my book every month like I had to in the 70s."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "But still there's huge amount of work being done and people getting better ideas on these problems that don't seem to have really efficient solutions, but we still do a lot more with them."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "And so this book that I'm finishing now is, I've got a whole bunch of brand new methods that as far as I know, there's no other book that covers this particular approach."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "And so I'm trying to do my best of exploring the tip of the iceberg and I try out lots of things and keep rewriting as I find better method."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "So what's your writing process like?"}, {"time": 2358, "text": "What's your thinking and writing process like every day?"}, {"time": 2364, "text": "What's your routine even?"}, {"time": 2366, "text": "Yeah, I guess it's actually the best question because I spend seven days a week doing it."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "You're the most prepared to answer it."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "So the chair I'm sitting in is where I do..."}, {"time": 2385, "text": "It's where the magic happens."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "Well, reading and writing, the chair is usually sitting over there where I have other books, some reference books, but I found this chair which was designed by a Swedish guy anyway."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "It turns out this is the only chair I can really sit in for hours and hours and not know that I'm in a chair."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "But then I have the standup desk right next to us and so after I write something with pencil and eraser, I get up and I type it and revise and rewrite."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "I'm standing up."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "The kernel of the idea is first put on paper."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "And I'll write maybe five programs a week, of course, literate programming."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "And these are, before I describe something in my book, I always program it to see how it's working and I try it a lot."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "So for example, I learned at the end of January, I learned of a breakthrough by four Japanese people who had extended one of my methods in a new direction."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And so I spent the next five days writing a program to implement what they did."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "And then they had only generalized part of what I had done so then I had to see if I could generalize more parts of it."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "And then I had to take their approach and I had to try it out on a couple of dozen of the other problems I had already worked out with my old methods."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "And so that took another couple of weeks."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "And then I started to see the light and I started writing the final draft and then I would type it up, involve some new mathematical questions."}, {"time": 2494, "text": "And so I wrote to my friends who might be good at solving those problems and they solved some of them."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "So I put that in as exercises."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "And so a month later, I had absorbed one new idea that I learned and I'm glad I heard about it in time."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "Otherwise, I wouldn't put my book out before I'd heard about the idea."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "On the other hand, this book was supposed to come in at 300 pages and I'm up to 350 now."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "That added 10 pages to the book."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "But if I learn about another one, my publisher is gonna shoot me."}, {"time": 2531, "text": "Well, so in that process, in that one month process, are some days harder than others?"}, {"time": 2539, "text": "Are some days harder than others?"}, {"time": 2540, "text": "Well, yeah, my work is fun, but I also work hard and every big job has parts that are a lot more fun than others."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "And so many days I'll say, why do I have to have such high

we may not get to a place in a hundred years where we view it as wrong to, you know, eat or otherwise, you know, use animals for our own purposes is because historically we've always protected those

I meant by equality, is bad."}, {"time": 907, "text": "And then, because I'm connecting that to robots and I'm wondering whether mortality, so the killing act is what makes something, that's the fundamental first right."}, {"time": 914, "text": "So I am currently allowed to take a shotgun and shoot a Roomba."}, {"time": 921, "text": "I think, I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure it's not

mortality a critical thing here?"}, {"time": 936, "text": "I think here again, like the animal analogy is really useful because you're also allowed to shoot your dog, but people won't be happy about it."}, {"time": 949, "text": "So we give, we do give animals certain protections from like, you're not allowed to torture your dog and set it on fire, at least in most states and countries, but you're

can train and that we should be doing that."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "But some people disagree."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "So the interesting thing, you've heard, you know, raising kids sort of

advocate argument there?"}, {"time": 1198, "text": "The devil's advocate argument is that if you are the type of person who has abusive tendencies or needs to get some sort of like behavior like that out, needs an outlet for it, that it's great to have a robot that you can scream at so that you're not screaming at a person."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "And we just don't know whether that's true, whether it's an outlet for people or whether it just kind of, as my friend once said, trains their cruelty muscles and makes them more cruel in other situations."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "And that

think that there are some interesting questions that become salient when you talk about, you know, sex with robots."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "See what I think would happen when people get sex robots, like if it's some guys, okay, guys get female sex robots."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "What I think there's an opportunity for is an actual, like, like they'll actually interact."}, {"time": 1323,

right, who pray, pay a prostitute and then end up just talking to her the whole time."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "So I feel like there's an opportunity."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "It's like most guys and people in general joke about this, the sex act, but really people are just lonely inside and they're looking for connection."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "Many of them."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "And it'd be unfortunate if that connection is established through the sex industry."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "I feel like it should go into the front door of like, people are lonely and they want a connection."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "Well, I also feel like we should kind of de, you know, de stigmatize the sex industry because, you know, even prostitution, like there are prostitutes that specialize in disabled people who don't have the same kind of opportunities to explore their sexuality."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So it's, I feel like we should like de stigmatize all of that generally."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "But yeah, that connection and that loneliness is an interesting topic that you bring up because while people are constantly worried about robots replacing humans and oh, if people get sex robots and the sex is really good, then they won't want their, you know, partner or whatever."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "But we rarely talk about robots actually filling a hole where there's nothing and what benefit that can provide to people."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "Yeah, I think that's an exciting, there's a whole giant, there's a giant hole that's unfillable by humans."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "It's asking too much of your, of people, your friends and people you're in a relationship with in your family to fill that hole."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "There's,

connection with robots."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "I just feel like we're complex as humans and we're capable of lots of different types of relationships."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "So whether that's, you know, with family members, with friends, with our pets, or with robots, I feel like there's space for all of that and all of that can provide value in a different way."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "So I'm jumping around."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "Currently most of my work is in autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "So the most popular topic among the general public is the trolley

problem and what it was meant to show us, which is that there is no right answer."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "And that sometimes our moral intuition that comes to us instinctively is not actually what we should follow if we care about creating systematic rules that apply to everyone."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "So I think that as a philosophical concept, it could teach us at least that, but that's not how people are using it right now."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "These are friends of mine and I love them dearly and their project adds a lot of value."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "But if we're viewing the moral machine project as what we can learn from the trolley problems, the moral machine is, I'm sure you're familiar, it's this website that you can go to and it gives you different

person?"}, {"time": 1570, "text": "Do you choose the person who's jaywalking?"}, {"time": 1605, "text": "So how do we encode these ethical choices in interaction with robots?"}, {"time": 1605, "text":

oncoming traffic or no, just in a different lane can cause significant harm to others, but it's possible that it causes less harm to you."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "So that's a difficult ethical question."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "Do you have a hope that like the trolley problem is not supposed to have a right answer, right?"}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Do you hope that when we have robots at the table, we'll be able to discover the right answer for some of these questions?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "Well, what's happening right now, I think, is this question that we're facing of what ethical rules should we be programming into the machines is revealing to us that our ethical rules are much less programmable than we probably thought before."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "And so that's a really valuable insight, I think, that these issues are very complicated and that in a lot of these cases, it's you can't really make that call, like not even as a legislator."}, {"time": 1699,

to do?"}, {"time": 1734, "text": "No, I mean when robots are part of the ethical decisions."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "So no, no, no, not they help us."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "Oh, you mean when

{"time": 2172, "text": "And that's, that one is not even designed to like make you do that."}, {"time": 2175, "text": "So I think that some of the cases where it's maybe a little bit concerning that anthropomorphism is happening is when you have something that's supposed to function like a tool and people are using it in the wrong way."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "And one of the concerns is military robots where, so gosh, 2000, like early 2000s, which is a long time ago, iRobot, the Roomba company made this robot called the Pacbot that was deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan with the bomb disposal units that were there."}, {"time": 2211, "text": "And the soldiers became very emotionally attached to the robots."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "And that's fine until a soldier risks his life to save a robot, which you really don't want."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "But they were treating them like pets."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "Like they would name them, they would give them funerals with gun salutes, they would get really upset and traumatized when the robot got broken."}, {"time": 2237, "text": "So in situations where you want a robot to be a tool, in particular, when it's supposed to like do a dangerous job that you don't want a person doing, it can be hard when people get emotionally attached to it."}, {"time": 2246, "text": "That's maybe something that you would want to discourage."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "Another case for concern is maybe when companies try to leverage the emotional attachment to exploit people."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "So if it's something that's not in the consumer's interest, trying to like sell them products or services or exploit an emotional connection to keep them paying for a cloud service for a social robot or something like

gets in the way sometimes, like you mentioned."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "But what do you think it takes to create a system where we sense that it has a human level intelligence?"}, {"time": 3240, "text": "So something that, probably something conversational, human level intelligence."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "How hard do you think that problem is?"}, {"time": 3251, "text": "It'd be

3281, "text": "If you set up people's expectations to think that they're communicating with, what was it, a 13 year old boy from the Ukraine?"}, {"time": 3292, "text": "Then they're not going to expect perfect English, they're not going to expect perfect, you know, understanding of concepts or even like being on the same wavelength in terms of like conversation flow."}, {"time": 3300, "text":

that we definitely have, so we treat physical things with more social agency, because we're very physical creatures."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "I think a body can be useful."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "Does it get in the way?"}, {"time": 3329, "text": "Is there a negative aspects like... Yeah, there can be."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "So if you're trying to create a body that's too similar to something that people are familiar with, like I have this robot cat at home that has robots."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "I have a robot cat at home that has roommates."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "And it's very disturbing to watch because I'm constantly assuming that it's going to move like a real cat and it doesn't because it's like a $100 piece of technology."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "So it's very like disappointing and it's very hard to treat it like it's alive."}, {"time":

dinosaur looks like."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "So you can actually get away with a lot more."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "So what do you think about consciousness and mortality being displayed in a robot?"}, {"time": 3406, "text": "So not actually having consciousness, but having these kind of human elements that are much more than just the interaction, much more than just, like you mentioned

seen that done in robotics?"}, {"time": 3436, "text": "What do you think about doing that?"}, {"time": 3436, "text": "Is that a powerful good thing?"}, {"time": 3444, "text": "Well, I think it can be

violation of sort of these companies crossing a line?"}, {"time": 3552, "text": "It's a great area, but crossing a line, they shouldn't in terms of manipulating, like we're talking about and manipulating our emotion, manipulating our behavior, using tactics that are not so savory."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "It's really difficult because we are starting to create technology that relies on data collection to provide functionality."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "And there's not a lot of incentive, even on the consumer side, to curb that because the other problem is that the harms aren't tangible."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "They're not really apparent to a lot of people because they kind of trickle down on a societal level."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "And then suddenly we're living in

the gray area is the removing ourselves from consideration of like, of explicitly defining objectives and more saying, well, we want to maximize engagement in our social network."}, {"time": 3664,

it?"}, {"time": 3697, "text": "You mean the problem of capitalism?"}, {"time": 3697, "text": "It's like, because the problem is that the companies are acting in the company's interests and not in

much faster than it was, and things are getting very complex."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "And you need people who understand the technology, but also people who understand what the societal

get around the copyright."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "So that's not a lot of protection."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "Then you can patent software, but that's kind of, I mean, getting a patent costs, I

been something crazy."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "It's insane the cost of getting a patent."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "And so this idea of protecting the inventor in their own garage who came up with a great idea is kind of, that's the thing of the past."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "It's all just companies trying to protect things and it costs a lot of money."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "And then with code, it's oftentimes by the time the patent is issued, which can take like five years, probably your code is obsolete at that point."}, {"time": 4105, "text": "So it's a very, again, a very blunt

Maradona is better than Messi because he basically carried the team and won the World Cup with a team that wouldn't otherwise win the World Cup."}, {"time": 549, "text": "And then Messi was only

3702, "text": "So the natural question is if they're curious about it, how would you recommend they get started?"}, {"time": 3707, "text": "Maybe like, what do you recommend the first day, week, month, year, first couple of years look like?"}, {"time": 3714, "text": "Like, how do you ease into it and make sure that it's a positive experience and you progress in the most optimal and positive

school and I wanted, I was at Manhattan College in the Bronx and I wanted to go and learn martial arts because it was always something that was interesting to me, but it was never something that I

I began with was, I think, expectation management."}, {"time": 3772, "text": "And I think that that's something that I would, that'd be the first thing that I would start is almost imagining what is

thinker's disease."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "You wanna figure out what's gonna happen and what you should expect to have happen before you get involved versus going, using the old Bruce Lee saying

physical."}, {"time": 3862, "text": "But the biggest thing that I guess I would suggest to anyone to say, well, why do you wanna do this?"}, {"time": 3866, "text": "You're like, well, I wanna challenge myself."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "I wanna learn, I would like to learn to fight."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "I wanted to learn to fight so that I could protect myself."}, {"time": 3872,

people."}, {"time": 3886, "text": "But basically I said, yeah, I'd like to have that."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "And I wanna, I know this is gonna be challenging and we'll see what happens."},

was like, well, this is all supposed to happen."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "That's no big deal."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "It would be like going and joining the army during peacetime and then going,

me somewhere."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."}, {"time": 3913, "text": "I didn't sign up for that."}, {"time": 3915, "text": "Actually you did, whether you realize it or not."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "You may not have thought that you did, but you did."}, {"time": 3919, "text": "So getting your mind right and just going, what are my expectations for this activity?"}, {"time": 3924, "text": "What is it that I'm looking to do?"}, {"time": 3925, "text": "And of course, you know, you're going into a gym, you're going into a place that you don't know

level."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "You know, 95% of my students don't know me."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "Not really, you know, I'll try to be polite and not annoy them too much, but they don't know me

take that leap."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "And one of the things that I've noticed as a martial arts instructor, that's the biggest struggle with dealing with adults, which is why a lot of people like to teach kids is because kids don't ask, don't argue."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "Now that also means there's all sorts of pitfalls or that sort of thing, and that can be an issue."}, {"time": 3965,

one talks to me like that."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "First it's like, hey man, you go join bootcamp, I don't care if you are Elon Musk, they're gonna tell you to shut up and do pushups."}, {"time":

my gym."}, {"time": 4004, "text": "I would try to help them in the way that I understand they need as best I can and as safe and reasonable a way as possible, but sometimes in a way that's gonna make

like if you go to, if people ask me, like graduate students, like your PhD advisor can be the difference."}, {"time": 4072, "text": "It's like you spend five years with somebody, they're going to basically define more impact on you than anybody you marry, anybody you hang out with."}, {"time": 4081, "text": "It's a huge impact."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "And the same with the coach selection, which is like the school selection, is it's going to be really important about in terms of like who you select will define how happy, like the trajectory of your growth and how happy you are with the entirety of the experience."}, {"time": 4101, "text": "And yet, like the flip side of that is, especially if you have an ego, especially if you are the manager that needs to let go of some stuff, you're going to feel like shit with the best kind of coach."}, {"time": 4115, "text": "That's what you need."}, {"time": 4117, "text": "But there's a weird balance there to find."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "Like, I mean, like, and everybody needs a different thing."}, {"time": 4123, "text": "Like I'm much more, I enjoy being sort of like, it sounds weird, but like I'm, you know, from the wrestling background, I enjoy feeling like crap in the sense like the coach, like getting beat up."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "I don't actually enjoy it."}, {"time": 4141, "text": "It's not like some masochistic thing or whatever."}, {"time": 4143, "text": "It's like, it's the growth."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "Like I like the anxiety."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "I like feeling like shit when I go home, like emotionally, physically, it's like, it's growth."}, {"time": 4157, "text": "It's a sign of growth, right?"}, {"time": 4158, "text": "Like if you're not having to feel those things, you're probably in your comfort zone, which is fine, but that's not your growth zone, right?"}, {"time": 4164, "text": "And everybody has a different threshold for that."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "And I mean, the beautiful thing about jiu jitsu is like, it's also has like a yoga feel to it."}, {"time": 4174, "text": "Like you're learning about your body."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "So depending on the gym and depending on, in fact, the coaches or the people around you within the gym, you can select little groups too, kind of like the people with who you roll, like if you're a smaller person, it doesn't mean you have to go against big people."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "You can go against the people who like smoke a lot of weed and they're chill, or you can go against like that crazy red blue

need today could change six months from now or a year from now."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "And that's something that I experienced."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "I'll use my first coach Christian, again,

martial arts, but get into, Hensel Gracie's gym was right down the street from where Christian was teaching."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "And Christian was a blue belt at the time."}, {"time": 4235,

place for people to train."}, {"time": 4266, "text": "But I think what was right for me at the time was to, I stumbled into, you know, like a two person elevator up and found a place where six people trained at that time."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "And I had someone that could give me some, like in addition to martial arts advice, like personal guidance."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "And that made a big difference."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "And then when initially we would have like competitions or like intra, you know, gym competitions with the Sambo guys, we would compete, we would roll with them."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "And like, again, it was great because they were just a bunch of like Russian dudes from like Brighton Beach."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "And they would come down and then we would all fight."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "And then everyone would train and we'd all drink tea and then go home."}, {"time": 4301, "text": "And anyway, what was, it was super tough."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "And they were like, again, just a tough group of people."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "And then I remember when I decided after like four or five months, I'm like, man, I really want to try to take this seriously."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "And I told Christian about that."}, {"time": 4315, "text": "And he's like, well, hey, I think you need to do the following."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "And it was, you know, like, hey, here's, there was a guy named Jeff Ruth, who was a purple belt at the time, which was a much bigger deal than it is now, but it was 10 and always an MMA fighter, a lot of amateur box spirit, super tough dude."}, {"time": 4326, "text": "And Jeff was the best person at that time that I'd ever trained with."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "And I just got squashed."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "Christian used to beat me up too, but like Jeff would just absolutely kick the crap out of me."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "And I was like, this is awesome."},

because I told him that's what I was thinking."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "And this was a coach that, you know, when it's like when initially was exactly what I needed."}, {"time": 4347, "text": "And then he's like, well, hey, that's not what I'm doing here."}, {"time": 4349, "text": "Maybe they're going to be able to help you onto a path that's, that's kind of commensurate with what your goals are at the moment."}, {"time": 4354, "text": "And then, you know, that was an, that was an interesting thing."}, {"time": 4357, "text": "And I really got, I feel that I was fortunate to start at a place where my coach was able to transition roles and, and, and do so comfortably."}, {"time": 4366, "text": "And I think that that also was probably a factor of the fact that, you know, where he'd done some of his training prior, like there've been issues with, with the coach there."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "We're like not supporting, not having the support, you know, feeling like, hey, like I'm going to hold onto my students."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "I'm gonna hold onto my best guy or my best girl, even if I can't take them where they need to go."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "So that was an interesting thing."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "And just recognizing also though, that the people like the same way you're an individual going into a gym and you don't know what you're getting into your coach is a person too."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "And he or she, you know, they may have been doing this activity longer than you, but they're not, they're not some weird little, you know, all

all these traditions."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "There's something, it seems ridiculous from the outside perhaps, but there's something really powerful to that because that process of you said, why

like a father figure or like this, you always put them in this position of power."}, {"time": 4499, "text": "And I think that's, I think at least for me, it's been a very, it's been a very useful way to see the coach because it allows you to not think and let go and really allow yourself to grow and emotionally deal with all the beatings."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "Well, they'll push you where past oftentimes where you would have stopped yourself, right?"}, {"time": 4518, "text": "Which is great."}, {"time": 4518, "text": "And then hopefully they know they, if they're paying attention and

find, you use Jiu Jitsu when you need it to grow as a person and when it overwhelms you, you have to pull that person out, like look at the bigger picture, always look at the bigger picture and it's

on, they go, okay, I hear why I see why that might happen."}, {"time": 5458, "text": "Let's talk about this."}, {"time": 5459, "text": "And we can, again, all push forward in a positive direction that

two days ago, maybe yesterday, no, two days ago, I've never been that cranky in my life."}, {"time": 5481, "text": "I think, I don't know what it was, but I wanted to tell everybody how much they annoyed me."}, {"time": 5488, "text": "It was like, I was just very conscious of this feeling of like, why, why is this happening right now?"}, {"time": 5495, "text": "So I consciously decided as I

way you see the world."}, {"time": 5572, "text": "So I've noticed that like, if I am shitty to people on the internet, which I haven't been, I think in a long time is like, it, it somehow brings the

curious."}, {"time": 5726, "text": "Um, it's, uh, it's a thing on the internet where, uh, I think you can play Taylor Swift songs on, um, but you can also now play Joe Rogan podcasts and they gave him a hundred million dollars."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "So that that's, um, you know, that's it's yeah."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "Uh, but the thing I've had a discussion with him and I made a video about it that I took down because of the toxicity is like, it's hard to put into words, but he will give away the a hundred million in a second."}, {"time": 5760, "text": "If he ever has to compromise who he is, like he doesn't, I mean, he already said, as he talked about, he's made quote unquote, fuck you money a long time ago, he doesn't need any more money."}, {"time": 5774, "text": "He doesn't care."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "It's nice to have money, whatever, but like, he'll give it away."}, {"time": 5779, "text": "So the it's nice to see when people like him at a level of celebrity level of success and financial success, don't change at all."}, {"time": 5833, "text": "And it's kind of inspiring to see that."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "And I hope people, I hope people realize how special of a human he is."}, {"time": 5841, "text": "He's inspired like people like me, like I'm just, I'm a scientist, right?"}, {"time": 5847, "text": "So he inspired somebody like me from a very different walk of life to be like kind to others, to be open minded."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "I don't know that it's a special dude."}, {"time": 5859, "text": "So like people need to support that and treasure that as opposed to as opposed to be toxic about it."}, {"time": 5867, "text": "I mean, what people really for a long time have told me that it would be awesome if Ryan Hall goes on Joe Rogan."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "I definitely think that would be an awesome thing."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "Have you listened to Joe?"}, {"time": 5882, "text": "Has he been a part of your life in

gotten to like, from a bird's eye view, watch his kind of just path through life."}, {"time": 5896, "text": "But one of the things that I always appreciate, and again, I barely know Joe other than to shake his hand."}, {"time": 5900, "text": "He interviewed me after the, briefly in the ring after the BJ pan fight."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "But one of the things that I've always admired about Joe

about him a great deal because as you say, it's interesting to watch, it's like you hope that George St. Pierre is like this."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "It's really, I'm not super close to George, but we're teammates at TriStar and he's never been anything but a gentleman."}, {"time": 5927, "text": "He's one of those people that if you didn't know George was famous when you walk into the gym, you'd have no idea."}, {"time": 5932, "text": "He's not holding court, not doing it."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "He's just, you know, training and he'll help out an amateur doing this."}, {"time": 5936, "text": "If you have a question for him, he'll help me."}, {"time": 5938, "text": "Like I'm nobody, man."}, {"time": 5939, "text": "He would give me advice and train me."}, {"time": 5941, "text": "It was super cool."}, {"time": 5942, "text": "And he didn't kill me, which I really appreciated."}, {"time": 5944, "text": "He's a gentleman."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "But you know, it's like you meet someone and you go, man, it's so cool that this is the guy who's the best, that this is the guy who has been successful."}, {"time": 5953, "text": "And then you go, why are they successful?"},

consistent."}, {"time": 5973, "text": "And it's neat to watch someone not compromise on their values and not change who they are."}, {"time": 5978, "text": "And not, you know, periodically, like, you know, again, we all make mistakes."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "Like you have a bad day or this or that."}, {"time": 5982, "text": "And an apology needs to be issued or even my bad or this or that."},

a mistake."}, {"time": 5991, "text": "As you mentioned, open mind and some like, so what are the correct beliefs to have about this that I know going in, everyone's going to be okay with what I'm saying, which is usually the beginning of a conversation that's going to go nowhere."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "And, uh, it's, it's neat to see, um, the things I guess that he's created on his own as a result of the authenticity that's there."}, {"time": 6010, "text": "And it reminds me of like Dave Chappelle."}, {"time": 6012, "text": "And, and again, I don't know, I've never met Dave, but it's neat to see someone that's clearly again, authentic in their own way, doing their own thing."}, {"time": 6020, "text": "And they're because of that, they're above the corporate nonsense."}, {"time": 6024, "text": "But what's funny, I think the message behind all of it is, Hey guys, we all are, I can't promise you that I'm going to have money."}, {"time": 6030, "text": "Joe couldn't promise you that he's going to have money."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "Now it ended up working out, but he was above that nonsense from the jump."}, {"time": 6038, "text": "And he just continued to be above it by never giving it any mind and just going like, yeah, I'm going to be a reasonable person."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "I'm going to try to learn."}, {"time": 6043, "text": "I'm going to try to grow."},

if I need to say my bad, thanks, appreciate it."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "You know, I will."}, {"time": 6053, "text": "And if I don't need to, I'm like, Hey, I still appreciate the talk."}, {"time": 6055, "text": "Thanks man."}, {"time": 6056, "text": "I'll shake your hand and we'd carry on and we'd go our separate ways and hopefully I'll treat you with respect."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "You treat me with respect and that's about it."}, {"time": 6062, "text": "And I guess I think it's a lesson that it can work out no matter what you don't have to count out to like these weird powers that be."}, {"time": 6069, "text": "And whether you're at this level or at this level, but you can live your life the way that you want."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "And as you mentioned, talk to your friends, hang out, be happy."}, {"time": 6076, "text": "And it just so happens that that resonates with people."}, {"time": 6078, "text": "It actually reminds me of like, uh, speaking to MIT and being in Boston is like a good will hunting."}, {"time": 6083, "text": "You know, like, again, that's what did he really want to do?"}, {"time": 6085, "text": "He could have gone this way."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "Could have gone that way."}, {"time": 6087, "text": "And it was an interesting story, but it's like this person wants to hang out with his buddies and wants to do other things."}, {"time": 6093, "text": "And again, it happens to be brilliant and happens to be able to do all these other things, but there was."}, {"time": 6098, "text": "I guess it's like, at least in my mind, a story of authenticity as well."}, {"time": 6101, "text": "And it was both the same thing in the Robin Williams character."}, {"time": 6104, "text": "And I just think that that's a message cause watch watching things occur on the internet as they do now."}, {"time": 6110, "text": "Think so many things playing out in the public eye."}, {"time": 6112, "text": "I feel like so many private or otherwise formerly private discussions and disputes and, and, you know, interactions now become, they all have a, a, well, what is this going to say when it goes public?"}, {"time": 6122, "text": "So how can I couch what I'm saying?"}, {"time": 6124, "text": "Or how can I word this in a way that's going to get people on my side or use the right buzzwords and not use the wrong buzzwords."}, {"time": 6129, "text": "And it's just neat to see people."}, {"time": 6131, "text": "You know, in their own way, flip the bird to the head, because I just think that that's, that's just not how a human being is meant to think or interact."}, {"time": 6138, "text": "I'm curious what you think about the thing that recently has, you know, me like hosting this podcast, I sometimes think about like, who should I talk to and not in terms of like, it's the, the old Hitler question now, Hitler, I would definitely talk to because post world war II, because everyone knows he's evil."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "The question, whether you talk to Hitler in 1937, like when people who are really students of what's going on, understand that this is a very dangerous human being."}, {"time": 6177, "text": "But a large number of the part of the world are like, well, he's a leader who cares for Germany."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "So the question I have, it's interesting to me, it involves a particular person named who also lives in Austin, Texas named Alex Jones."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "I don't know if you're familiar with the guy."}, {"time": 6194, "text": "I am familiar with Mr. Jones."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "I've actually recently just listened to Infowars, like one episode of his show, I guess that he does every day."}, {"time": 6205, "text": "And it kind of reminds me of a time in college when I drank too much tequila."}, {"time": 6212, "text": "There's no turning back."}, {"time": 6213, "text": "Like, it's like, like the mistakes you make that like, it's, I mean, you don't know where you're going to wake up, you don't know who you're going to kill or not kill or steal or rob, it's unclear."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "So that, it felt like I was getting pulled into a dark place where pretty much everybody is a pedophile that's trying to control the world."}, {"time": 6240, "text": "So Bill Gates definitely is a pedophile."}, {"time": 6244, "text": "Everybody in power, anybody in power, there's a kind of a deep skepticism about power and a conspiratorial way to see the world where everything is like dark forces in all corners."}, {"time": 6257, "text": "It's like the way you feel when you're a kid, that there's a monster hiding in the closet."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "Which is also why you leap over the bed from like four feet away."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "There's a strategy."}, {"time": 6266, "text": "So, but he says that you're just being weak."}, {"time": 6268, "text": "You need to look under the bed."}, {"time": 6270, "text": "Under the bed, there's monsters and we need to be aware of them because they're growing, they're multiplying."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "You should be."}, {"time": 6276, "text": "And they're touching children."}, {"time": 6277, "text": "They're touching children."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "So it all connects."}, {"time": 6280, "text": "But the, the, I, when I listened to him and I thought about like, do I want to talk to him on this podcast, for example, when I listened to his conversation with Joe Rogan, the two times he talked on there, to me, it was somehow entertaining."}, {"time": 6299, "text": "Like it was fun to listen to."}, {"time": 6301, "text": "It's fun to listen to a madman go on for four hours because it's almost like theater."}, {"time": 6310, "text": "Like, this is what I talked to Joe about."}, {"time": 6313, "text": "When people try to censor Alex Jones, Joe says that the people who try to censor him don't give enough credit to the intelligence of human beings to like, understand like that, like what a person says on a large platform does not necessarily is not the truth."}, {"time": 6332, "text": "You can be a madman and say crazy things and people are intelligent enough to hear certain things being, when they're said like the earth is flat, they can, they can be intelligent enough not to all of a sudden start believing that the earth is flat."}, {"time": 6349, "text": "Like they, they're intelligent enough to sort of select different ideas and be able to enjoy the theater of a particular ridiculous over the top conversation without being sort of influenced to where they start believing like toxic set of beliefs."}, {"time": 6365, "text": "Now there's a lot of sort of other kinds of people, especially now with cancel culture that say, well, you don't want to give platform to crazy people that ultimately whose beliefs might lead to dangerous consequences."}, {"time": 6380, "text": "Like, and I see it very often now with conspiracy theories that go, that go like way too far."}, {"time": 6419, "text": "And yet every interview, anything you see now on Bill Gates, everyone is calling him, I believe haven't looked into it, but I believe everyone's calling him a pedophile."}, {"time": 6430, "text": "I don't know the full structure of it, but it's, it's just a very, it feels like an army of like, it feels like it's hundreds of thousands of people."}, {"time": 6438, "text": "That's what it feels like."}, {"time": 6439, "text": "It might be a much smaller percentage, but it feels like a huge number of people are calling him a pedophile."}, {"time": 6444, "text": "So that's the, that's the flip side."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "If you allow, if you give platform to conspiracy theories like that, then you start to have bigger and bigger percent of the population believe in these crazy things."}, {"time": 6455, "text": "I just, I wanted to put it out there."}, {"time": 6457, "text": "Cause I don't know what to think of that."}, {"time": 6460, "text": "If you put yourself in Joe Rogan's shoes, if you put yourself in my shoes, if you put yourself just in your own shoes, I mean, I'm even I'm in my shoes right now."}, {"time": 6469, "text": "If you're staying in your shoes, just stay in your shoes."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "Can I have your, would you talk, would you give platform to people like Alex Jones, would, would you talk to somebody like Alex Jones or, or not?"}, {"time": 6485, "text": "Uh, I, yes, I would."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "And I feel very strongly about this, honestly."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "Um, well, I think that it's, it's an interesting thing and I, I would just say a lot of times, um, I can understand, you know, very, very clearly why people would take issue with the idea of, I guess what they proceed to be amplifying this man's voice, this man's reach, um, you know, as, as a demonstrable negative."}, {"time": 6510, "text": "But I think, um, you know, when you take a step back further, uh, the, the cure is more damaging than the disease and significantly."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "So, um, I guess I think that I'm very, very wary of, I think being where you mentioned Alex Jones being wary of power and people with it, that's a lot of times there's a lot of truth and validity to crazy things that people say it's the conspiracy theories that stick are the ones that sound credible, at least quasi credible in some aspect."}, {"time": 6545, "text": "And it's almost like it seems to me like an anchor in people's mind."}, {"time": 6547, "text": "And it is also funny to me, obviously the, the Bill Gates, it's so funny to tar people with things like pedophile, racist, rapist, like, these are things that we're basically trying to pick words that no one can ever support someone who does these things."}, {"time": 6560, "text": "And that's, you know, and that changes year by year."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "Like currently pedophile is totally in as a thing to call somebody just, just as a, it used to be communist or Marxist Cleveland Browns fan, you know, like, come on, you know, actually nobody likes the Browns."}, {"time": 6578, "text": "So I'll agree with you."}, {"time": 6579, "text": "That was, that's why I picked them."}, {"time": 6580, "text": "That's the trick is you find a group of people that nobody likes."}, {"time": 6583, "text": "We're good here."}, {"time": 6584, "text": "That's the move, but, uh, yeah, that's a creepy thing though, because that is, that is the creepy thing is like, if people are always looking for groups of people are always looking for, and I find this really deeply disturbing, um, like, Hey, so who's the guy that we can all get away with?"}, {"time": 6598, "text": "You know, just treating like dirt, who's the guy that I can be a dick to?"}, {"time": 6602, "text": "I can just walk up and punch in the face and no one's going to say anything."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "And it's, even if I, you know, people do that with, whether it's literal Nazis or someone that I called a Nazi, you know, I guess what's the bigger issue, this person's ridiculous beliefs or what I'm doing."}, {"time": 6617, "text": "And you mentioned Hitler before, and obviously Mein Kampf being a, you know, like the outline for some of the things he did later and when the evil was it always there, did it, did it take root later on or flourish later on?"}, {"time": 6628, "text": "But was, was Adolf Hitler a problem because he had crazy ideas or because he did things?"}, {"time": 6635, "text": "I think it's because it's not, I think I know it's because he did things."}, {"time": 6638, "text": "Now, if I'm going to start punishing thought crime, I, I'm going to have to start punishing thought crime."}, {"time": 6644, "text": "And that's a terrifying concept."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "Even if I'm right about the certain, about the objectively correct about the things that I decide to call out of bounds, who put me in charge and made me arbiter of good taste and how long until I did it, did it, did it, did it, did it long until I decide that something else is, is out of bounds."}, {"time": 6661, "text": "It's, it's always a sliding scale or it's always a sliding standard."}, {"time": 6665, "text": "And I find that, that, you know, to be more of a concern than people doing crazy things, because I guess if you mentioned Alex Jones, you know, putting out ridiculous, ridiculous ideas, ridiculous theories, I think that most people don't look at Alex Jones as a credible person."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "Now I'm not going to pretend to be deeply read into all of his beliefs or the things that he's trying to peddle."}, {"time": 6683, "text": "Um, but there's plenty of things that are quasi mainstream that I think on with this side or that side that maybe not comparably ridiculous, but are, you know, particularly in hindsight or, you know, or we're not, or, or silly."}, {"time": 6697, "text": "And I guess, uh,

question that he has skills to be dangerous."}, {"time": 11279, "text": "And one of the funny things, obviously the Khabib fight when Khabib was a great fighter and also has the chance to beat anyone in that ring at any given time."}, {"time": 11287, "text": "But there's, there was a Conner, you know, it's a one that he can, he can put anybody away."}, {"time": 11296, "text": "And as you

almost so much of a letdown."}, {"time": 11302, "text": "I remember that happened the same weekend that I did the ultimate fighter finale."}, {"time": 11305, "text": "And you're like, all right, wait, what?"}, {"time": 11309, "text": "It almost doesn't feel like a fight happening, but we mentioned Miyamoto Musashi."}, {"time": 11312, "text": "I mean, Musashi was famous for the way he poked and

had on, on Jose was, I mean, beyond evident."}, {"time": 11335, "text": "When was the last time Jose started the, started the fight with leaping left hand, leaping right hand, you're like, wait, what?"}, {"time": 11341, "text": "And then he was obviously, you know, living rent free and in Jose's head at that point."}, {"time": 11346, "text": "And that was a combination of psychological, you know, ability and, and, and wherewithal and then physical."}, {"time": 11352, "text": "And it reminded me of the way Muhammad Ali would, would bother people and whatnot."}, {"time": 11355, "text": "And, uh, the fact that he's a polarizing figure, um, I think makes some people not give him his due."}, {"time": 11362, "text": "And then at the same time, sometimes certain fans may be go overboard, but, uh, they remember the knee that Ben Askren got knocked out with by Masoudal."}, {"time": 11370, "text": "I mean, that was an amazing, unbelievable thing, but three inches to the right, three inches to the left, I guess, whichever side his head wasn't, could have been squarer."}, {"time": 11378, "text": "But, uh, and that fight starts with Ben Askren on top of you in the first five seconds."}, {"time": 11383, "text": "Well, Connor ran and threw a knee just like that at Khabib and Khabib got right around it."}, {"time": 11388, "text": "That could have easily gone the other way."}, {"time": 11390, "text": "Can you imagine what would have happened if after the, after coming back from boxing, um, after coming back from, from the Mayweather fight, Connor, in the first 10 seconds, it's Khabib in the first 10 seconds, it's over and you're like, he would, it would have been intolerable, but basically, like, you know, but see, here's the thing."}, {"time": 11408, "text": "Let me actually push back slightly."}, {"time": 11410, "text": "Uh, I mean, to the fans, correct me if I'm wrong, but Connor seems to cause I've competed a lot and like there's a tension."}, {"time": 11420, "text": "There's a negativity sometimes depending on the opponent and there's a respect afterwards that happens, like when you understand that there's a deep like respect and almost like love for each other."}, {"time": 11432, "text": "Like, I always seen that in Connor, like all the trash talk afterwards."}, {"time": 11437, "text": "There's a, it's, it's a subtle thing."}, {"time": 11439, "text": "You can't always see it, but there's a respect like."}, {"time": 11442, "text": "And like that, I almost on the Khabib side, I almost feel like Khabib really took it personally."}, {"time": 11451, "text": "He did, he didn't, he lost the respect for Connor."}, {"time": 11454, "text": "I thought, I thought the whole time Connor had the respect."}, {"time": 11456, "text": "So I, I, what I wanted to say is like, if Connor won that fight, like rock Khabib, I could see like, I wouldn't see trash talking."}, {"time": 11464, "text": "I could see like trash talking stop right there."}, {"time": 11467, "text": "I think so too, but at the same time, I'm sure you recall like Connor, Connor crossing some pretty personal territory, you know, both religiously and, and also familiarly with, uh, with Khabib."}, {"time": 11475, "text": "And it's, you know, I mean, I think it's the sort of thing that, I don't know, it's, it's an interesting, that's one of the reasons."}, {"time": 11481, "text": "Like you have to know the diff so obviously I know the, the, the Khabib, uh, the Dagestani people, they don't play around like that."}, {"time": 11489, "text": "They don't play around like that."}, {"time": 11491, "text": "You know, I mean, they take offense to basically, I mean, you, you don't do that."}, {"time": 11496, "text": "So, uh, so like Connor didn't, maybe he did it on purpose or maybe he wasn't even just aware of, of, uh, it was cultural differences of the box he opened."}, {"time": 11507, "text": "Like you, you can talk to Floyd Mayweather, you can, you can go anywhere with him."}, {"time": 11512, "text": "You can, you can say the most offensive things, but with, uh, with Khabib, it's, it's, yeah, hard lines, but you, uh, I mean, a lot of people ask, I know you're a featherweight, but if you were to, uh, face, it feels like Khabib was one of the hardest puzzles to solve in, in all of mixed martial arts."}, {"time": 11533, "text": "If you were to face Khabib, do you think, how would you go about solving that puzzle?"}, {"time": 11539, "text": "Like almost the question is almost from a Jiu Jitsu perspective too."}, {"time": 11543, "text": "What do you do with a guy that's exceptionally good at controlling position, especially on top, very good at wrestling and taking down and controlling position."}, {"time": 11552, "text": "Like let's say, so forget maybe striking on the ground."}, {"time": 11558, "text": "How do you solve that guy?"}, {"time": 11560, "text": "Like what do you do with your guard if you get taken down or do you create an entire system of not getting taken down or escaping is like, what, what ideas do you have for that?"}, {"time": 11570, "text": "Well, I guess I would say in my mind, fighting is a game of trading energy."}, {"time": 11573, "text": "Um, kind of, uh, you know, there's two, there's two things, there's damage and there's energy."}, {"time": 11578, "text": "So like when I say energy and being like, uh, tired, not tired, how much, how much gas you've got."}, {"time": 11583, "text": "Um, and then damage counts obviously as well."}, {"time": 11585, "text": "Um, you could be feeling, I could be feeling great and then you get to kick me in the head hard, really hard three times."}, {"time": 11590, "text": "It doesn't matter that I could get up and run a mile."}, {"time": 11592, "text": "I can't get up."}, {"time": 11593, "text": "So anyway, um, you know, I, I think what Khabib does is so well is he makes the fight look like it could be an amalgamated fight."}, {"time": 11600, "text": "Um, he does a great job of avoiding damage on the feet for the most part and really sucking the life out of people with how suffocating and oppressive is his control is."}, {"time": 11610, "text": "Um, his chain wrestling is as good as anyone we've ever seen in the UFC."}, {"time": 11614, "text": "Um, but, uh, that poses a really serious threat for people that need to maintain a certain amount of space and try to hurt them on the feed because unless they're able to inflict an adequate amount of damage, they're going to each time, let's say for instance, let's say him taking them down as a foregone conclusion at some point."}, {"time": 11631, "text": "Um, if every single time Khabib takes you down, you get right back up."}, {"time": 11635, "text": "It's not that big a deal, um, because it's actually more, we've all experienced this."}, {"time": 11638, "text": "Let's say you and I are rolling, you tap me 15 times in one round."}, {"time": 11641, "text": "Who's more tired?"}, {"time": 11642, "text": "Probably you are."}, {"time": 11645, "text": "My ass so badly that, that it's like, you're the only one working, but, um, So if you're comfortable with the up and down of it, like being taken down."}, {"time": 11653, "text": "If you're, if you don't, if you don't get hurt badly or tired on the bottom, you have a chance, but that doesn't involve just cracking him on the feet before he gets ahold of you."}, {"time": 11663, "text": "Um, That's a lot."}, {"time": 11665, "text": "That's a lot to ask."}, {"time": 11667, "text": "That's difficult to do."}, {"time": 11668, "text": "It seemed actually like Connor, it seemed like it when he was being kind of taken down or the, the take down attempts against Khabib, he seemed to be somewhat relaxed the whole thing."}, {"time": 11678, "text": "I thought he was doing well, actually."}, {"time": 11679, "text": "I think that particularly for the first round, I thought he did a very good job."}, {"time": 11682, "text": "It's just one of those things that I think like, uh, Khabib being the fights taking place in Khabib's world in large part."}, {"time": 11689, "text": "And I mean, set aside that one giant, uh, was it right hand that, that Khabib hit Connor with it, by the way, Connor reacted like an absolute champion."}, {"time": 11696, "text": "He got crushed by that overhand and then drop and his eyes went right back on Khabib."}, {"time": 11701, "text": "It was immediate positive, great response."}, {"time": 11703, "text": "So even though that was, I think that was a bit of a surprising thing, Connor reacted really, really well."}, {"time": 11707, "text": "But if you're going to be on bottom with Khabib for four rounds, that's going to be tough."}, {"time": 11711, "text": "And also Connor's a way better grappler than people like to give him credit for, but he's not the type of grappler that can do that can, that can, that's too tall of an order, but there are grapplers that could do that or at least would have a much, much better shot at, uh, being able to weather that type of a storm."}, {"time": 11726, "text": "Do you see yourself being able to be relaxed through that kind of storm?"}, {"time": 11730, "text": "Well, I guess I can remember being, being, being, being savagely beaten is very relaxing."}, {"time": 11739, "text": "The time that the timing of that answer was like, okay, that's a dumb question."}, {"time": 11745, "text": "No, that's ultimately the goal of Jiu Jitsu is to, um, be relaxed to the fire."}, {"time": 11752, "text": "And remember like every UFC fighter, I win all hypothetical matchups."}, {"time": 11759, "text": "Uh, since, uh, I'm one to ask ridiculous questions and we've been talking about sci fi and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 11767, "text": "Let me ask the kind of big question that everybody disagrees about, certainly with me is, uh, who are the top five greatest MMA fighters of all time and, um, um, why is Fedor number one?"}, {"time": 11780, "text": "Well, first off, Fedor is number one."}, {"time": 11783, "text": "Right there with you."}, {"time": 11786, "text": "Talk about people that just get completely underappreciated."}, {"time": 11787, "text": "He's never been in the, uh, like he's never succeeded in the UFC."}, {"time": 11790, "text": "It's not his fault."}, {"time": 11791, "text": "It came along after him at the time that, at the time that Fedor was at his height, the UFC was not where it was at for heavyweight fighting."}, {"time": 11798, "text": "I mean, not that there weren't good heavyweights there, but Fedor, Fedor was unbelievable."}, {"time": 11803, "text": "You remember, I mean, Minotaur Noguera, I was a massive fan of him."}, {"time": 11807, "text": "I still remember watching, uh, what is it pride 2004 when, when Noguera fought Cro Cop and got blasted with that left kick and dropped with like seconds left in the first round."}, {"time": 11816, "text": "Pride was great cause he had a 10 minute first round and that five minute second, which again materially alters, alters the fight big time."}, {"time": 11822, "text": "And you know, just the texture of the fight is just totally, it's borderline a different sport, you know, then, then getting a five, a pause and a five."}, {"time": 11829, "text": "But anyway, uh, similar sports, like one of those swimming things where they have nine gold medals for different types of swimming, right?"}, {"time": 11834, "text": "But still swimming."}, {"time": 11835, "text": "But anyway, um, Oh yeah."}, {"time": 11837, "text": "They would disagree."},

I mean, I guess it's, it's tough to compete, to compare across eras."}, {"time": 11860, "text": "It would be like going and saying like, Oh man, how, how would such and such great grappler from today fare against someone from 1995?"}, {"time": 11867, "text": "I'm like, well, probably pretty well for them, depending upon who they are, what's going on."}, {"time": 11873, "text": "There's some people that would, their skill sets might transition across eras, but a lot of times not, but that's not fair."}, {"time": 11879, "text": "We get the, they'll be like comparing Spartans to modern day, you

think about for great fighters, their, their, their quality of opposition, um, their level of like lasting and like success, their level of lasting innovation."}, {"time": 11903, "text": "Like the

was like on a teletype."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "So it's using something that's kind of like a typewriter."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "And then using those to plot functions."}, {"time": 1343,

the text editor and corrector."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "Corrector, wow, so many features."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "And the original Emacs came out as, so Emacs stands for editor macros."},

a TECO program on a page, you think it was just random characters."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "It really looks like just line noise."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "So it's kind of like LaTeX or something."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "Oh, way worse than LaTeX."}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Way, way worse than LaTeX."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "But if you use TECO a lot, which I did, TECO was completely optimized for touch typing at high speed."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "So there were no two character commands."}, {"time": 1835, "text": "Well, there were a few, but mostly they were just one character."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "So every character on the keyboard was a separate command."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "And actually, every character on the keyboard was usually two or three commands because you could hit Shift and Control and all of those things."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "It's just a way of very tightly encoding it."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "And mostly what Emacs did was it made that visual."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "So one way to think of TECO is use Emacs with your eyes closed, where you have to maintain a mental model of a mental image of your document."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "You have to go, OK, so the cursor is between the A and the E.

set, but using Emacs with your eyes closed."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "So part of what Emacs added to the whole thing was being able to visually see what you were editing in a form that matched your document."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "And a lot of things changed in the command set because it was programmable."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "It was really flexible."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "You could add new commands for all kinds of things."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "And then people rewrote Emacs multiple times in Lisp."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "There was one done at MIT for the Lisp machine."},

of work."}, {"time": 1975, "text": "I spent a really intense three months working on this Pascal compiler, basically living in Emacs."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And it was the one written in Mac Lisp by Bernie Greenberg."}, {"time": 1991, "text": "And I thought, wow, this is just a way better way to do editing."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "And then I got back to CMU, where we had one of everything and two of a bunch of things and four of a few things."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "And since I mostly worked in the Unix universe, and Unix didn't have an Emacs, I decided that I needed to fix that problem."}, {"time": 2023, "text": "So I wrote this implementation of Emacs in C, because at the time, C was really the only language that worked on Unix."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "And you were comfortable with C as well at that point?"}, {"time": 2038, "text": "Yeah, at that time, I had done a lot of C coding."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "This was in, like, 86."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "And it was running well enough for me to use it to edit itself within a month or two."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "And then it kind of took over the university."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "And it spread outside."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "Yeah, and then it went outside."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "And largely because Unix kind of took over the research community on the ARPANET, and Emacs was kind of the best editor out there."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "It kind of took over."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "And there was actually a brief period where I actually had login IDs on every nonmilitary host on the ARPANET."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "Because people would say, oh, can we install this?"}, {"time": 2101, "text": "And I'd like, well, yeah, but you'll need some help."}, {"time": 2109, "text":

{"time": 2136, "text": "Some of it is remarkably unchanged."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "So one of the things that I noticed really early on when I was at Carnegie Mellon was that a lot of social life became centered around the ARPANET."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "So things like between email and text messaging."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "Because text messaging was a part of the ARPANET really early on."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "There were no cell phones, but you're sitting at a terminal and you're typing stuff."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "So essentially email, or what is text messaging?"},

message to somebody."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "And so pretty much everything from arranging lunch to going out on dates was all like driven by social media."}, {"time": 2208, "text": "Social media."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "Right, in the 80s."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "Easier than phone calls, yeah."}, {"time": 2215, "text": "And my life had gotten to where I was living on social media

the internet?"}, {"time": 2299, "text": "So fundamentally, the cable TV companies and broadcasters and phone companies, at the deepest fibers of their being, they hated the internet."}, {"time": 2318,

whatever, out to their customers."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "They view their business as serving their customers."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "But as you climb up the hierarchy in the cable companies,

most people who worked at the cable companies."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "But I had various dust ups with various cable companies where you could see in the stratified layers of the corporation that this view of the reason that you have cable TV is to capture eyeballs."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "So they didn't see it that way."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "Well, so most of the people who worked at the phone company or at the cable companies, their view was that their job was getting delightful content out to their customers."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "And their customers would pay for that."}, {"time": 2433, "text": "Higher up, they viewed this as a way of attracting eyeballs to them."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "And then what they were really doing was selling the eyeballs that were glued to their content to the advertisers."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "To the advertisers, yeah."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "And so the internet was a competition in that sense."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "They were right."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "I mean, there was one proposal that we sent, one detailed proposal that we wrote up back at Sun in the early 90s that was essentially like, look, anybody with internet technologies, anybody can become provider of content."}, {"time": 2487, "text": "So you could be distributing home movies to your parents or your cousins or who are anywhere else."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "So anybody can become a publisher."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "Wow, you were thinking about that already."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "Netflix, Netflix, YouTube."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "Yeah, that was like in the early 90s."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "And we thought, this would be great."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "And the kind of content we were thinking about at the time was like home movies, kids essays, stuff from grocery stores or a restaurant that they could actually start sending information about."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "And the reaction of the cable companies was like, fuck no."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "Because then we're out of business."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "What is it about companies that, because they could have just, they could have been ahead of that wave."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "They could have listened to that."}, {"time": 2561, "text": "And they could have."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "They didn't see a path to revenue."}, {"time": 2566,

just plot it on the graph."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "And it's like, sure, film is better today."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "But digital is improving like this."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "The lines are going to cross."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "And the point at which the lines cross is going to be a collapse in their business."}, {"time": 2700, "text": "And they could see that."}, {"time": 2705,

they did the math, it never started to make sense for them to kind of lead the charge."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "And part of the issues for a lot of companies for this kind of stuff is that if you're going to leap over a chasm like that, like with Kodak going from film to digital, that's a transition that's going to take a while."}, {"time": 2749, "text": "We had fights like this with people over smart cards."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "The smart cards fights were just ludicrous."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "But that's where visionary leadership comes in, right?"}, {"time": 2760, "text":

short term."}, {"time": 2772, "text": "So you can draw the graphs you want that show that if we leap from here, on our present trajectory, we're doing this and there's a cliff."}, {"time": 2782,

a need for a revolution?"}, {"time": 4368, "text": "Well, so the need for a revolution was not about a language."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "It was just as simple and vague as there are things

folks."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "And because we worked for Sun, we had folks who were willing to give us introductions."}, {"time": 4422, "text": "We visited Samsung and a bunch of Korean companies."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "And we went all over Europe."}, {"time": 4431, "text": "We went to places like Philips and Siemens and Thomson."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "And what did you see there?"}, {"time": 4440, "text": "For me, one of the things that sort of leapt out was that they were doing all the usual computer things that people had been doing like 20 years before."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "The thing that really leapt out to me was that they were sort of reinventing computer networking."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "And they were making all the mistakes that people in the

"text": "But also, at the same time, we learned a bunch of things from these mostly consumer electronics companies."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "And high on the list was that they viewed their relationship with the customer as sacred."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "They were never, ever willing to make tradeoffs between for safety."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "So one of the things that had always made me nervous in the computer industry was that people were willing to make tradeoffs in reliability to get performance."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "They want faster, faster."}, {"time": 4578,

are the principles that were inspiring."}, {"time": 4646, "text": "But how did, from the days of Java's called oak, because of a tree outside the window story that a lot of people know, how did it become this incredible, powerful language?"}, {"time": 4663, "text": "Well, so it was a bunch of things."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "So after all that, the way that we decided that we could understand things better was by building a demo, building a prototype of something."}, {"time": 4679, "text": "So because it was easy and fun, we decided to build a control system for some home electronics, TV, VCR, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "And as we were building it, we discovered that there were some things about standard practice in C programming that were really getting in the way."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "And it wasn't exactly because we were writing all this C code and C++ code that we couldn't write it to do the right thing."}, {"time": 4717, "text": "But one of the things that was weird in the group was that we had a guy whose top level job was he was a business guy."}, {"time": 4732, "text": "He was an MBA kind of person, think about business plans and all of that."}, {"time": 4738, "text": "And there were a bunch of things that were kind of, and we would talk about things that were going wrong and things that were going wrong, things that were going right."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "And as we thought about things like the requirements for security and safety, some low level details and see like naked pointers."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "And so back in the early 90s, it was well understood that the number one source of security vulnerabilities."}, {"time": 4781, "text": "Was pointers."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "Was just pointers, was just bugs."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "And it was like 50%, 60%, 70% of all security vulnerabilities were bugs."}, {"time": 4793, "text": "And the vast majority of them were like buffer overflows."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "So you're like, we have to fix this."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "We have to make sure that this cannot happen."}, {"time": 4804, "text": "And that was kind of the original thing for me was this cannot continue."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "And one of the things I find really entertaining this year was, I forget which Rag published it, but there was this article that came out that was sort of the result of an examination of all the security vulnerabilities in Chrome."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "And Chrome is like a giant piece of C++ code."}, {"time": 4839, "text": "And 60% or 70% of all the security vulnerabilities were stupid pointer tricks."}, {"time": 4848, "text": "And I thought, it's 30 years later and we're still there."}, {"time": 4854, "text": "Still there."}, {"time": 4854, "text": "And we're still there."}, {"time": 4856, "text": "And that's one of those slap your forehead and just want to cry moments."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "Would you attribute, or is that too much of a simplification, but would you attribute the creation of Java to C pointers?"}, {"time": 4875, "text": "Obvious problem."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "Well, I mean, that was one of the trigger points."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "Concurrency you've mentioned."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "Concurrency was a big deal."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "Because when you're interacting with people, the last thing you ever want to see is the thing like waiting and issues about the software development process."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "When faults happen, can you recover from them?"}, {"time": 4905, "text": "What can you do to make it easier to create and eliminate complex data structures?"}, {"time": 4914, "text": "What can you do to fix one of the most common C problems, which is storage

"text": "So when I was originally thinking about that, I was thinking about it in terms of safety and security issues."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "And one of the things I came to understand was that it wasn't just about safety and security, but it was about developer velocity."}, {"time": 4959, "text": "So and I got really religious about this because at that point, I had spent an ungodly amount of my life hunting down mystery pointer bugs."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "And two thirds of my time as a software developer was because the mystery pointer bugs tend to be the hardest to find because they tend to be very, very statistical."}, {"time": 4991, "text": "The ones that hurt, they're like a one in a million chance."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "But nevertheless, create an infinite amount of suffering."}, {"time": 5004, "text": "Because when you're doing a billion operations a second, one in a million chance means it's going to happen."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "And so I got really religious about this thing, about making it so that if something fails, it fails immediately and visibly."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "And one of the things that was a real attraction of Java to lots of development shops was that we get our code up and running twice as fast."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "You mean like the entirety of the development process, debugging, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 5044, "text": "Yeah, so if you measure time from you first touch fingers to keyboard until you get your first demo out, not much different."}, {"time": 5061, "text": "But if you look from fingers touching keyboard to solid piece of software that you could release in production, it would be way faster."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "And I think what people don't often realize is, yeah, there's things that really slow you down, like the hard to catch bugs probably is the thing that really slows down the entire time."}, {"time": 5083, "text": "It really slows things down."}, {"time": 5085, "text": "But also, one of the things that you get out of object oriented programming is a strict methodology about what are the interfaces between things and being really clear about how parts relate to each other."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "And what that helps with is so many times what people do is they kind of like sneak around the side."}, {"time": 5112, "text": "So if you've built something and people are using it and you say, well, OK, I built this thing."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "You use it this way."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "And then you change it in such a way that it still does what you said it does."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "It just does it a little bit different."}, {"time": 5130, "text": "Then you find out that somebody out there was sneaking around the side."}, {"time": 5135, "text": "They sort of tunneled in a back door."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And this person, their code broke."}, {"time": 5141, "text": "And because they were sneaking through a side door."}, {"time": 5147, "text": "And normally, the attitude is, dummy."}, {"time": 5156, "text": "But a lot of times, you can't just slap their hand and tell them to not do that."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "Because it's some bank's account reconciliation system that some developer decided, oh, I'm lazy."}, {"time": 5182, "text": "I'll just sneak through the back door."}, {"time": 5184,

of people was I made it so that you really couldn't go through back doors."}, {"time": 5198, "text": "So the whole point of that was to say, if the interface here isn't right, the wrong way to deal with that is to go through a back door."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "The right way to deal with it is to walk up to the developer of this thing and say, fix it."}, {"time": 5218, "text": "And so it was kind of like a social engineering thing."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "And people ended up discovering that that really made a difference in terms of."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "And a bunch of this stuff, if you're just screwing around writing your own class project scale stuff, a lot of this stuff isn't quite so important because you're both sides of the interface."}, {"time": 5251, "text":

virtual machine, you can think of it in different ways because it was carefully designed to have different ways of viewing it."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "So one view of it that most people don't

all."}, {"time": 5381, "text": "I could explain it, and that would blow all of our time."}, {"time": 5384, "text": "But the other way to think of it and the way that it ends up being explained is that it's like the instruction set of an abstract machine that's designed such that you can translate that abstract machine to a physical machine."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "And the reason that that's important, so if you wind back to the early 90s when we were talking to all of these companies doing consumer electronics, and you talk to the purchasing people, there were interesting conversations with purchasing."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "So if you look at how these devices come together, they're sheet metal and gears and circuit boards and capacitors and resistors and stuff."}, {"time":

of other perspectives that all probably hated this idea."}, {"time": 5556, "text": "But from a technical aspect, just like the creation of an abstraction layer that's agnostic to the underlying

then there's also the time thing because, you know, as you went from one generation to the next generation to the next generation, they were all different."}, {"time": 5587, "text": "And you would often have to rewrite your software."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "Oh, you mean generations of machines of different kinds?"}, {"time": 5595, "text": "So like one of the things that sucked about a year

started to realize that there were some properties of P code that made that really easy, some properties that made it really hard."}, {"time": 5860, "text": "So I ended up writing this thing that translated from P code on the Three Rivers PERCs into assembly code on the VAX."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "And I actually got higher quality code than the C compiler."}, {"time": 5880, "text": "And so

like, nah."}, {"time": 5903, "text": "That's, I mean, it's kind of a brilliant idea, right?"}, {"time": 5909, "text": "Or maybe you didn't have the, you weren't able to articulate the big picture of it."}, {"time": 5914, "text": "And I think that was a key part."}, {"time": 5919, "text": "But so then clock comes forward a few years."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "And it's like, we've got to be able to, if they want to be able to switch from this weird microprocessor to that weird and totally different microprocessor, how do you do that?"}, {"time": 5938, "text": "And I kind of went, oh, maybe by doing something kind of in the space of Pascal P code, I could do multiple translations to multiple translators."}, {"time": 5955, "text": "And I spent some time thinking about that and thinking about what worked and what didn't work when I did the P code to Vax translator."}, {"time": 5965, "text": "And I talked to some of the folks who were involved in Smalltalk because Smalltalk also did a

of the breakthroughs you might have in machine learning kind of require large scale experiments."}, {"time": 387, "text": "So it was almost like the early days."}, {"time": 387, "text": "So I wonder how many low hanging fruit there are in science and mathematics and even engineering where it's like you could do that little experiment quickly, like you have an insight in a bar."}, {"time": 401, "text": "Why is it always a bar?"}, {"time": 401, "text": "But you have an insight at a bar and then just implement and the world changes."}, {"time": 406, "text": "It's a good point."}, {"time": 406, "text": "I think it also depends a lot on the maturity of the field."}, {"time": 413, "text": "When you look at a field like mathematics, like it's a pretty mature field, a field like machine learning, it's growing pretty fast."}, {"time": 419, "text": "And it's actually pretty interesting."}, {"time": 427, "text": "I looked up like the number of new papers on archive with the keyword machine learning and like 50% of those papers have been published in the last 12 months."}, {"time": 434, "text": "So you can see just the 5.0, 50%."}, {"time": 440, "text": "So you can see the magnitude of growth in that field."}, {"time": 440, "text": "And so I think like as fields mature, like those types of moments, I think naturally are less frequent."}, {"time": 449, "text": "It's just a consequence of that."}, {"time": 457, "text": "The other point that is interesting about the backstory is that it can really make it more memorable in a way."}, {"time": 462, "text": "And by making it more memorable, it kind of sediments the knowledge more in your mind."}, {"time": 467, "text": "I remember also reading the sort of the backstory to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm."}, {"time": 474, "text": "He came up with it essentially while he was sitting down at a coffee shop in Amsterdam."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And he came up with that algorithm over 20 minutes."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And one interesting aspect is he didn't have any pen or paper at the time."}, {"time": 489, "text": "And so he had to do it all in his mind."}, {"time": 489, "text": "And so there's only so much complexity that he can handle if you're just thinking about it in your mind."}, {"time": 493, "text": "And that like when you think about the simplicity of Dijkstra's shortest path finding algorithm, it's knowing that backstory helps sediment that algorithm in your mind so that you don't forget about it as easily."}, {"time": 510, "text": "It might be from you that I saw a meme about Dijkstra."}, {"time": 510, "text": "It's like he's trying to solve it and he comes up with some kind of random path."}, {"time": 518, "text": "And then it's like my parents aren't home."}, {"time": 518, "text": "And then he does."}, {"time": 525, "text": "He figures out the algorithm for the shortest path."}, {"time": 525, "text": "He tried through words to convey memes, but it's hilarious."}, {"time": 533, "text": "I don't know if it's in post that we construct stories that romanticize it."}, {"time": 539, "text": "Apparently with Newton, there was no apple."}, {"time": 539, "text": "Especially when you're working on problems that have a physical manifestation or a visual manifestation, it feels like the world could be an inspiration to you."}, {"time": 552, "text": "So it doesn't have to be completely on paper."}, {"time": 552, "text": "Like you could be sitting at a bar and all of a sudden see something and a pattern will spark another pattern and you can visualize it and rethink a problem in a particular way."}, {"time": 565, "text": "Of course, you can also load the math that you have on paper and always carry that with you."}, {"time": 571, "text": "So when you show up to the bar, some little inspiration could be the thing that changes it."}, {"time": 575, "text": "Is there any other people almost on the human side, whether it's physics with Feynman, Dirac, Einstein, or computer science, Turing, anybody else?"}, {"time": 585, "text": "Any backstories that you remember that jump out?"}, {"time": 591, "text": "Because I'm also referring to not necessarily these stories where something magical happens, but these are personalities."}, {"time": 598, "text": "They have big egos."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Some of them are super friendly."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Some of them are like self obsessed."}, {"time": 604, "text": "Some of them have anger issues."}, {"time": 604, "text": "Some of them, how do I describe Feynman?"}, {"time": 611, "text": "But he appears to have a appreciation of the beautiful in all its forms."}, {"time": 611, "text": "He has a wit and a cleverness and a humor about him."}, {"time": 619, "text": "So does that come into play in terms of the construction of the science?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "Well, I think you brought up Newton."}, {"time": 624, "text": "Newton is a good example also to think about his backstory because there's a certain backstory of Newton that people always talk about, but then there's a whole another aspect of him that is also a big part of the person that he was, but he was really into alchemy and that he spent a lot of time thinking about that and writing about it and he took it very seriously."}, {"time": 648, "text": "He was really into Bible interpretation, trying to predict things based on the Bible."}, {"time": 653, "text": "And so there's also a whole backstory then and of course you need to look at it in the context and the time that when Newton lived, but it adds to his personality and it's important to also understand those aspects that maybe people are not as proud to teach to little kids, but it's important."}, {"time": 672, "text": "It was part of who he was and maybe without those, who knows what he would have done otherwise."}, {"time": 678, "text": "Well, the cool thing about alchemy, I don't know how it was viewed at the time, but it almost like to me symbolizes dreaming of the impossible."}, {"time": 690, "text": "Like most of the breakthrough ideas kind of seem impossible until they're actually done."}, {"time": 696, "text": "It's like achieving human flight."}, {"time": 696, "text": "It's not completely obvious to me that alchemy is impossible or putting myself in the mindset of the time."}, {"time": 700, "text": "And perhaps even still, everything that some of the most incredible breakthroughs would seem impossible."}, {"time": 716, "text": "And I wonder the value of believing, almost like focusing and dreaming of the impossible, such that it actually is possible in your mind and that in itself manifests whether the accomplishing that goal or making progress in some unexpected direction."}, {"time": 734, "text": "So alchemy almost symbolizes that for me."}, {"time": 734, "text": "I distinctly remember having the same thought of thinking, when I learned about atoms and that they have protons and electrons, I was like, okay, to make gold, you just take whatever has an atomic weight below it and then shove another proton in there and then you have a bunch of gold."}, {"time": 748, "text": "So like, why don't people do that?"}, {"time": 753, "text": "It seemed like conceptually is like, this sounds feasible."}, {"time": 753, "text": "You might be able to do it, you might be able to do it."}, {"time": 757, "text": "And you can actually, it's just very, very expensive."}, {"time": 761, "text": "So in a sense we do have alchemy and maybe even back then it wasn't as crazy that he was so into it, but people just don't like to talk about that as much."}, {"time": 768, "text": "But Newton in general was a very interesting fellow."}, {"time": 774, "text": "Anybody else come to mind?"}, {"time": 774, "text": "In terms of people that inspire you, in terms of people that you just are happy that they have once or still exist on this earth?"}, {"time": 788, "text": "I think, I mean, Freeman Dyson for me."}, {"time": 792, "text": "Yeah, Freeman Dyson was, I've had a chance to actually exchange a couple of emails with him."}, {"time": 797, "text": "It was probably one of the most humble scientists that I've ever met."}, {"time": 797, "text": "And that had a big impact on me."}, {"time": 803, "text": "We were trying, we're actually trying to convince him to annotate a paper on Fermat's library."}, {"time": 809, "text": "And I sent him an email asking him if he could annotate a paper."}, {"time": 809, "text": "And his response was something like, I have very limited knowledge."}, {"time": 817, "text": "I just know a couple of things about certain fields."}, {"time": 822, "text": "I'm not sure if I'm qualified to do that."}, {"time": 822, "text": "That was his first response."}, {"time": 822, "text": "And this was someone that should have won an Obel prize and worked on a bunch of different fields, did some really, really great work."}, {"time": 833, "text": "And then just the interactions that I had with him, every time I asked him a couple of questions about his papers, and he always responded saying, I'm not here to answer your questions."}, {"time": 845, "text": "I just want to open more questions."}, {"time": 845, "text": "And so that had a big impact on me."}, {"time": 845, "text": "It was like just an example of an extremely humble, yet accomplished scientist."}, {"time": 853, "text": "And Feynman was also a big, big inspiration in the sense that he was able to be, again, extremely talented and scientist, but at the same time, socially, he was able to, he was also really smart from a social perspective."}, {"time": 875, "text": "And he was able to interact with people."}, {"time": 875, "text": "He was also a really good teacher and was also to did awesome work in terms of explaining physics to the masses and motivating and getting people interested in physics."}, {"time": 889, "text": "And that for me was, was also a big inspiration."}, {"time": 894, "text": "I liked the childlike curiosity of some of those folks that you mentioned, Feynman."}, {"time": 897, "text": "I've, Daniel Kahneman, I got a chance to meet and interact with some of these truly special scientists."}, {"time": 903, "text": "What makes them special is that even in older age, there's still like, there's still that fire of childlike curiosity that burns."}, {"time": 910, "text": "And some of that is like not taking yourself so seriously that you think you've figured it all out, but almost like thinking that you don't know much of it."}, {"time": 921, "text": "And that's like step one in having a great conversation or collaboration or exploring a scientific question."}, {"time": 931, "text": "And it's cool how the very thing that probably earned people the Nobel prize or, or work that's seminal in some way is the very thing that still burns even after they've won the prize."}, {"time": 945, "text": "It's cool to see."}, {"time": 945, "text": "And they're rare humans, it seems."}, {"time": 950, "text": "And to that point, I remember like the last email that I sent to Freeman Dyson was like in his last birthday, he was really into number theory and primes."}, {"time": 954, "text": "So what I did is I took like a photo of him picture, and then I turned that into like a giant prime number."}, {"time": 960, "text": "So I converted the picture into a bunch of one and eights."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And then I moved some numbers around until it was a prime."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And then I sent him that."}, {"time": 973, "text": "Oh, so the, the visual, like it's still look like the picture, it's made up of a prime."}, {"time": 978, "text": "That's tricky to do."}, {"time": 978, "text": "It's hard to do."}, {"time": 978, "text": "It looks harder than it actually is."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So the way you do it is like you convert the darker regions into eights and the lighter regions in ones."}, {"time": 990, "text": "And then there's... And then just keep flipping numbers until..."}, {"time": 990, "text": "But there's like some primality tests that are cheaper from a computational standpoint."}, {"time": 995, "text": "But what it gives you is like it excludes numbers that are not prime."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Then you end up with a set of numbers that you don't know if they are prime or not."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "And then you run the full primality test on that."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So you just have to keep iterating on that."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And it was, it's funny because when you got the picture, it was like, how did you do that?"}, {"time": 1015, "text": "It was super curious too."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And then we got into the details."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And again, this was, it was already 90, I think 92 or something."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "And that curiosity was still there."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "So you can really see that in some of these scientists."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So could we talk about Fermat's library?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "What's the main goal?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "What's the dream?"}, {"time": 1038, "text": "It is a platform for annotating papers in its essence, right?"}, {"time": 1038, "text": "And so academic papers can be one of the densest forms of content out there and generally pretty hard to understand at times."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "And the idea is that you can make them more accessible and easier to understand by adding these rich annotations to the site, right?"}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And so we can just imagine a PDF view on your browser, and then you have annotations on each side."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "And then when you click on them, a sidebar expands and then you have annotations that support LaTeX and Markdown."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And so the idea is that you can, say, explain a tougher part of a paper where there's a step that is not completely obvious."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And then you can add more context to it."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "And then over time, papers can become easier and easier to understand and can evolve in a way."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "But it really came from myself, Luis, and two other friends."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "We've had this long running habit of kind of running a journal club amongst us."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "We come from different backgrounds, right?"}, {"time": 1097, "text": "I studied CS, we studied physics."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And so we'd read papers and present them to the each other."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And then we tried to bring some of that online."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And that's when we decided to build Fermat's library."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And then over time, it kind of grew into something with a broader goal."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And really, what we're trying to do is trying to help move science in the right direction."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "That's really the ultimate goal and where we want to take it now."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "Well, so there's a lot to be said."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So first of all, for people who haven't seen it, the interface is exceptionally well done."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "Execution is really important here."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "The other thing is just to mention for a large number of people, apparently, which is new to me, don't know what LaTeX is."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So it's spelled like LaTeX."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So be careful googling it if you haven't before."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "It's a, sorry, I don't even know the correct terminology."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Type setting language?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "It's a type setting language where you're basically program, writing a program that then generates something that looks, from a typography perspective, beautiful."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And so a lot of academics use it to write papers."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "I think there's like a bunch of communities that use it to write papers."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "I would say it's mathematics, physics, computer science."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "That's, yeah, that's the main."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Because I'm collaborating currently on a paper with two neuroscientists from Stanford."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "And they don't know LaTeX."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "So I'm using Microsoft Word and Mendeley, and like all of those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "And I'm being very zen like about the whole process, but it's fascinating."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "It's a little heartbreaking actually, because it actually, it's funny to say, but, and we'll talk about open science, actually, the bigger mission behind Fermat's library is like, really opening up the world of science to everybody."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "Is these silly two facts of like one community uses LaTeX and another uses Word, is actually a barrier between them."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "That's like, it's like boring and practical in a sense, but it makes it very difficult to collaborate."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "Just on that, like, I think there are some people that should have received like a Nobel Prize, but will never get it."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And I think one of those is like Donald Knuth, because of tech and LaTeX."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "And then, because it had a huge impact in terms of like just making it easier for researchers to put their content out there, like making it uniform as much as possible."},

his work in algorithms and so on."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "So like an incredibly, I think it's in, it might be even the sixties, but I think it's the seventies."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "So when he was really young and then he went on to do like incredible work with his book and yeah, with tech that people don't know."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "And going back just on the reason why we ended up, because I think this is interesting."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "The reason why we ended up using the name Fermat's Library, this was because of Fermat's Last Theorem."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And Fermat's Last Theorem is actually a funny story."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "So Pierre de Fermat, he was like a lawyer and he wrote like on a book that he had a solution to Fermat's Last Theorem, which, but that didn't fit the margin of that book."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "And so Fermat's Last Theorem basically states that there's no solution."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "If you have integers a, b and c, there's no solution to a to the power of n plus b to the power of n equals to c to the power of n, if n is bigger than two."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "So there's no solutions."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And he said that, and that problem remained open for almost 300 years, I believe."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And a lot of the most famous mathematicians tried to tackle that problem."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "No one was able to figure that out until Andrew Wiles, I think was in the 90s, was able to publish the solution, which was, I believe, almost 300 pages long."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "And so it's kind of an anecdote that, you know, there's a lot of knowledge and insights that can be trapped in the margins."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And there's a lot of potential energy that you can release if you actually spend some time trying to digest that."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "And that was the origin story for for the name."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "Yes, you can share the contents of the margins with the world that could inspire a solution or a communication that then leads to a solution."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And if you think about papers, like papers are, as Joan was saying, probably one of the densest pieces of text that any human can read."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "And you have these researchers, like some of the brightest minds in these fields, working on like new discoveries and publishing these work on journals that are imposing them restrictions in terms of the number of pages that they can have to explain a new scientific breakthrough."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "So at the end of the day, papers are not optimized for clarity and for a proper explanation of that content because there are so many restrictions."}, {"time":

clubs."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And so we've just made that freely available."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "And then librarian is a browser extension that we developed that is sort of an overlay on top of archive."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "So it's about bringing some of the same functionality around comments, plus adding some extra niceties to archive, like being able to very easily extract the

locked."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "And so that's why it's so important for people to have websites that are open to people to have websites like archive so that you can share that before it goes to the journal with the rest of the world."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "There was actually on archive that Perelman published the three papers that led to the proof of the Poincare conjecture."}, {"time":

librarian, it's useful for that so that you can distinguish that in a field that is growing so fast as machine learning."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "And then you have platforms that focus, for instance, on just biology."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "BioArchive is a good example."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "BioArchive is also super interesting because there's actually an interesting experiment that was run in the 60s."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So in the 60s, the NIH supported this experiment called the Information Exchange Group, which at the time was a way for researchers to share biology preprints via mail or using libraries."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "And that project in the 1960s got canceled six years after it started."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "And it was due to intense pressure from the journals to kill that project because they were fearing competition from the preprints for the journal industry."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "Crick was one of the famous scientists that opposed to the Information Exchange Group."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "And it's interesting because right now, if you analyze the number of biology papers that appear first as preprints, it's only 2% of the papers."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "And this was almost 50 years after that first experiment."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "So you can see that pressure from the journals to cancel that initial version of a preprint repo had a tremendous impact on the number of papers that are showing up in biology as preprints."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So it delayed a lot that revolution."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "But now platforms like BioArchive are doing that work."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "But there's still a lot of room for growth there."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And I think it's super important because those are the papers that are open that everyone can read."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "But if we just look at the entire process of science as a big system, can we just talk about how it can be revolutionized?"}, {"time": 1833, "text": "So you have an idea, depending on the field, you want to make that idea concrete, you want to run a few experiments in computer science, there might be some code, there'd be a data set for, you know, some of the more sort of biology, psychology, you might be collecting the data set that's called, you know, a study, right?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "So that's part of that, that's part of the methodology."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And so you are putting all that into a paper form."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And then you have some results."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And then you submit that to a place for review through the peer review process."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "And there's a process where, how would you summarize the peer review process?"}, {"time": 1883, "text": "But it's really just like a handful of people look over your paper and comment."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "And based on that, decide whether your paper is good or not."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "So there's a whole broken nature to it."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "At the same time, I love the peer review process when I buy stuff on Amazon, like for like the commenting system, whatever that is."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "So there's a bunch of possibilities for revolutions there."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "And then there's the other side, which is the collaborative aspect of the science, which is people annotating, people commenting, sort of the low effort collaboration, which is a comment."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "Sometimes, as you've talked about, a comment can change everything."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "But, you know, or a higher effort collaboration, like more like maybe annotations, or even like contributing to the paper, you can think of like, collaborative updating of the paper over time."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "So there's all these possibilities for doing things better than they've been done."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Can we talk about some ideas in this space?"}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Some ideas that you're working on, some ideas that you're not yet working on, but should be revolutionized?"}, {"time": 1951, "text": "Because it does seem that archive and like open review, for example, are like the craigslist of science."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Like, like, yeah, okay."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "I'm very grateful that we have it."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "But it just feels like, it's like 10 to 20 years."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "Like, it doesn't feel like that's a feature."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "The simplicity of it is a feature."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "It feels like it's a, it's a bug."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "But then again, the pushback there is Wikipedia has the same kind of simplicity to it."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "And it seems to work exceptionally well in the crowdsourcing aspect of it."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So I'm sorry, there's a bunch of stuff going on on the table."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "Let's just pick random things that we can talk about."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "Wikipedia, you know, for me, it's the cosmological constant of the internet."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "It's, I think we are lucky to live in the parallel universe where Wikipedia exists."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "Because if someone had pitched me Wikipedia, like a publicly edited encyclopedia, like a couple of years ago, like it would be, I don't know how many people would have said that that would have survived."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "I mean, it makes almost no sense."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "It's like having a Google doc that everybody on the internet can edit."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And like, that will be like the most reliable source for knowledge."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And I don't know how many, but hundreds of thousands of topics."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And like you have, and then you have users, like there's one single user that edited one third of the articles on Wikipedia."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "So we have these really, really big power users."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "There are a substantial part of like what makes Wikipedia successful."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "And so like, no one would have ever imagined that that could happen."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "And so that's one thing."}, {"time": 2058,

the discussion of everything else."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "I also believe, I've seen that with Stack Overflow, that one individual or a small collection of individuals contribute or revolutionized most of the community."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "Like if you create a really powerful system for archive or like open review and made it really easy and compelling and exciting for one person who is like a 10x contributor to do their thing, that's going to change everything."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "It seems like that was the mechanism that changed everything for Wikipedia."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "And that's the mechanism that changed everything for Stack Overflow."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "Is gamifying or making it exciting or just making it fun or pleasant or fulfilling in some way for those people who are insane enough to like answer thousands of questions or write thousands of factoids and like research them and check them, all those kinds of things, or read thousands of papers."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "No, Stack Overflow is another great example of that."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "And it's just, and those are both to do incredibly productive communities that generate a ton of value and capture almost none of it."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "And it's in a way, it's almost like, it's very counterintuitive that these communities would exist and thrive."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "And it's really hard to, there aren't that many communities like that."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "So how do we do that for science?"}, {"time": 2157, "text": "Do you have ideas there?"}, {"time": 2161, "text": "Like what are the biggest problems that you see?"}, {"time": 2161, "text": "You're working on some of them."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "Like just on that, there are a couple of really interesting experiments that people are running."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "An example would be like the Polymath projects."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "So this is a kind of a social experiment that was created by Tim Gowers, Fields Medalist."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "And his idea was to try to prove that, is it possible to do mathematics in a massively collaborative way on the internet?"}, {"time": 2182, "text": "So he decided to pick a couple of problems and test that."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "And they found out that it actually is possible for specific types of problems, namely problems that you're able to break down in little pieces and go step by step."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "You might need, as with open source, you might need people that are just kind of reorganizing the house every once in a while."}, {"time": 2208, "text": "And then people throw a bunch of ideas and then you make some progress, then you reorganize, you reframe the problem and you go step by step."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "But they were actually able to prove that it is possible to collaborate online and do progress in terms of mathematics."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "And so I'm confident that there are other avenues that could be explored here."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "Can we talk about peer review, for example?"}, {"time": 2236, "text": "I think in terms of the peer review, I think it's important to look at the bigger picture here of what the scientific publishing ecosystem looks like."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "Because for me, there are a lot of things that are wrong about that entire process."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So if you look at what publishing means in a traditional journal, you have journals that pay authors for their articles, and then they might pay reviewers to review those articles."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "And finally, they pay people or distributors to distribute the content."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "In the scientific publishing world, you have scientists that are usually backed by government grants."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "They are giving away their work for free in the form of papers."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "And then you have other scientists that are reviewing their work."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "This process is known as the peer review process, again for free."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "And then finally, we have government backed universities and libraries that are buying back all that work so that other scientists can read."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "So this is, for me, it's bizarre."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "You have the government that is funding the research, it's paying the salaries of the scientists, it's paying the salaries of the reviewers, and it's buying back all that product of their work again."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "And I think the problem with this system and it's why it's so difficult to break this suboptimal equilibrium is because of the way academia works right now and the way you can progress in your academic life."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And so in a lot of fields, the competition in academia is really insane."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "So you have hundreds of PhD students, they are trying to get to a professor position and it's hyper competitive."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "And the only way for you to get there is if you publish papers, ideally in journals with a high impact factor."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "In computer science, it's often conferences are also very prestigious or actually more prestigious than journals now."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So that's the one discipline where, I mean, that has to do with the thing we've discussed in terms of how quickly the field turns around."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "But like NeurIPS, CVPR, those conferences are more prestigious, or at the very least as prestigious as the journals."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "But it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "The process is what it is."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So for people that don't know, the impact factor of a journal is basically the average number of citations that a paper would get if it gets published on that journal."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "But so you can really think that the problem with the impact factor is that it's a way to turn papers into accounting units."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "And let me unpack this because the impact factor is almost like a nobility title."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "Because papers are born with impact even before anyone reads them."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "So the researchers, they don't have the incentive to care about if this paper is going to have a long term impact on the world."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "What they care, their goal, their end goal is the paper to get published so that they get that value upfront."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "So for me, that is one of the problems of that."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "And that really creates a tyranny of metrics."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "Because at the end of the day, if you are a dean, what you want to hire is people, researchers that publish papers on journals with high impact factors because that will increase the ranking of your university and will allow you to charge more for tuition, so on and so forth."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "And that, especially when you are in super competitive areas, that people will try to gamify that system and misconduct starts showing up."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "There's a really interesting book on this topic called Gaming the Metrics."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "It's a book by a researcher called Mario Biagioli."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "It goes a lot into how the impact factor and metrics affect science negatively."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "And it's interesting to think, especially in terms of citations, if you look at the early work of looking at citations, there was a lot of work that was done by a guy called Eugene Garfield."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "And this guy, the early work in terms of citation, they wanted to use citations from a descriptive point of view."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "So what they wanted to create was a map."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "And that map would create a visual representation of influence."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "So citations would be links between papers."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "And ideally, what they would show, they would represent is that you read someone else's paper and it had an impact on your research."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "They weren't supposed to be counted."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "I think this inspired Larry and Sergey's work for Google."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "I think they even mentioned that."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "But what happens is, as you start counting citations, you create a market."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And the work of Eugene Garfield was a big inspiration for Larry and Sergey and for the PageRank algorithm that led to the creation of Google."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "And they even recognized that."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "And if you think about it, it's like the same way there's a gigantic market for search engine optimization, SEO, where people try to optimize the PageRank and how a web page will rank on Google."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "The same will happen for papers."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "People will try to optimize the impact factors and the citations that they get."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And that creates a really big problem."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And it's super interesting to actually analyze them."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "If you look at the distribution of the impact factors of journals, you have like Nature."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "Nature, I believe, is in the low 40s."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "And then you have, I believe, Science is high 30s."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "And then you have a really good set of good journals that will fall between 10 and 30."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And then you have a gigantic tale of journals that have impact factor below 2."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And you can really see two economies here."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "You see the universities that are maybe less prestigious, less known, where the faculty are pressured to just publish papers regardless of the journal."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "What I want to do is increase the ranking of my university."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "And so they end up publishing as many papers as they can in journals with low impact factor."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "And unfortunately, this represents a lot of the global south."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "And then you have the luxury good economy."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "And there are also problems here in the luxury good economy."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "So if you look at the journal like Nature, so with impact factor in the low 40s, there's no way that you're going to be able to sustain that level of impact factor by just grabbing the attention of scientists."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "What I mean by that is for the journals, the articles that get published in Nature, they need to be New York Times grade."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "So they need to make it to the big media."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "They need to be captured by the big media."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "And because that's the only way for you to capture enough attention to sustain that level of citations."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "And that, of course, creates problems because people then will try to, again, gamify the system and have like titles or abstracts or that are bigger, make claims that are bigger than what is actually can be, you know, sustained by the data or the content of the paper."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "And you'll have clickbait titles or clickbait abstracts."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "And again, this is all a consequence of science or metrics."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "And this is a very dangerous cycle that I think it's very hard to break, but it's happening in academia in a lot of fields right now."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "Is it fundamentally the existence of metrics or the metrics just need to be significantly improved?"}, {"time": 2721, "text": "Because like I said, the metrics used for Amazon for purchasing, I don't know, computer parts is pretty damn good in terms of selecting which are the good ones, which are not."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "In that same way, if we had Amazon type of review system in the space of ideas, in the space of science, it feels like that those metrics would be a little bit better."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "Sort of when it's significantly more open to the crowdsource nature of the internet, of the scientific internet, meaning as opposed to, like my biggest problem with peer review has always been that it's like five, six, seven people, usually even less."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "And it's often, nobody's incentivized to do a good job in the whole process."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "Meaning it's anonymous in a way that doesn't incentivize, like doesn't gamify or incentivize great work."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "And also it doesn't necessarily have to be anonymous."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Like there has to be, the entire system is, doesn't encourage actual sort of rigorous review."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "For example, like open review does kind of incentivize that kind of process of collaborative review, but it's also imperfect."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "But it just feels like the thing that Amazon has, which is like thousands of people contributing their reviews to a product, it feels like that could be applied to science where the same kind of thing you're doing with Fermat's library, but doing at a scale that's much larger."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "It feels like that should be possible given the number of grad students, given the number of general public that's getting, for example, I personally, as a person who got an education in mathematics and computer science, like I can be a quote unquote, like reviewer on a lot bigger set of things than is my exact expertise."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "If I'm one of thousands of reviewers, if I'm the only reviewer, one of five, then I better be like an expert in the thing."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "But if I, and I've learned this with COVID, which is like, you can just use your basic skills as a data analyst to contribute to the review process and a particular little aspect of a paper and be able to comment, be able to sort of draw in some references that challenge the ideas presented or to enrich the ideas that are presented."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "It just feels like crowdsourcing the review process would be able to allow you to have metrics in terms of how good a paper is that are much better representative of its actual impact in the world, of its actual value to the world, as opposed to some kind of arbitrary, gamified version of its impact."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "I think there's definitely the possibility, at least for a more resilient system than what we have today."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "And I think that's kind of what you're describing, Alex."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "I mean, to an extent, we kind of have like a little bit of a Heisenberg uncertainty principle."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "When you pick a metric, as soon as you do it, then maybe it works as a good heuristic for a short amount of time, but soon enough, people would start gamifying."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "But then you can definitely have metrics that are more resilient to gamification and they'll work as a better heuristic to try to push you in the best direction."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "But I guess down the line, the underlying problem you're saying is there's a shortage of positions in academia."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "That's a big problem for me."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "And that, and so they're going to be constantly gamifying the metrics."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "It's a bit of a zero sum game."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "It's a very competitive field."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "And that's what usually happens in very competitive fields."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "But I think some of the peer review problems, like scale helps, I think."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "And it's interesting to look at what you're mentioning, breaking it down, maybe in like smaller parts and having more people jumping in."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "But this is definitely a problem."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "And the peer review problem, as I mentioned, is correlated with the problem of academic career progression."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "And it's all intertwined."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "And that's why I think it's so hard to break it."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "There are a couple of really interesting things that are being done right now."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "There are a couple of, for instance, journals that are overlay journals on top of platforms like archive and bio archive that want to remove like the more traditional journals from the equation."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "So essentially a journal is just a collection of links to papers."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "And what they're trying to do is like removing that middleman and trying to make the review process a little bit more transparent

problem there is getting to critical mass."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "So it's again, convincing the researchers and especially the young researchers that need that impact factor, need those publications to have citations to not publish on the traditional journal and go on an open journal and publish their work there."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "There, I think there are a couple of really high profile scientists of people like Tim Gowers."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "They are trying to incentivize like famous scientists that already have tenure and that don't need that to publish that to increase the reputation of those journals."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "So that other maybe younger scientists can start publishing on those as well."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "And so that you can try to break that vicious cycle of the more traditional journals."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "I mean, another possible way to break this cycle is to like raise public awareness and just by force, like ban paid journals."}, {"time": 3099, "text": "Like what exactly are they contributing to the world?"}, {"time": 3099, "text": "Like basically making it illegal to forget the fact that it's mostly federally funded."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "So that's that's a super ugly picture too."}, {"time": 3115, "text": "But like, why should knowledge be so expensive?"}, {"time": 3115, "text": "Like where

everything."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "Like people should be outraged that there's these gates."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "Because, so the moment you dissolve the journals, then there will be an

"Which is especially curious given what Luis was saying, right?"}, {"time": 3234, "text": "That it's kind of in their genesis."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "There's this, you know, research that was very connected with how papers reference each other and like building a network out of that."}, {"time": 3244, "text": "Interestingly enough, like Google, I think there was a, there was not intended, Google Plus was like the Google social network that got cancelled, was used by a lot of researchers."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "Which I think was just a, you know, side, kind of a side effect."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "But then a lot of people ended up migrating to Twitter, but it was not on purpose."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "But yeah, I agree with you."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "Like they haven't gone past Google Scholar and I don't know why."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "Well, that said, Google Scholar is incredible."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "For people who are not familiar, it's one of the best aggregation of all the scientific work that's out there and especially the network that connects to all of them."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "What sites, what."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "And also trying to aggregate all of the versions of the papers that are available there and trying to merge them in a way that one particular work, even though it's available in a bunch of places, counts as, you know, like a central hub of what that work is, according to multiple versions."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "But that almost seems like a fun pet project of a couple of engineers within within Google, as opposed to a serious effort to make the world science accessible."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "But going back to just the journals, when you're talking about that, Lex, I believe that in that front, I think we might be past the event horizon."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "So I think the model, the business model for the journals, you know, doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "They're a middle layer that is not adding a lot of value."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "And you see a lot of motions, whereas like in Europe, a lot of the papers that are funded by the European Union, they will have to be open to the public."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "And I think there's a lot of... Bill Gates too, like what the Gates Foundation funds, like the demand that it's accessible to everybody."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "So I think it's a question of time before that wall kind of falls."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "And that is going to open a lot of possibilities."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "Because, you know, imagine if you had like the layer of that gigantic layer of papers all available online, you know, that unlocks a lot of potential as a platform for people to build things on top of that."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "But to what you're saying, it is weird, like you can literally go and listen to any song that was ever made on your phone, right?"}, {"time": 3373, "text": "You open Spotify and you might not even pay for it."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "You might be on the free version and you can listen to any song that was ever made, pretty much."}, {"time": 3384, "text": "But there's like, you don't have access to a huge percentage of academic papers, which is just like this fundamental knowledge that we're all funding."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "But you as an individual don't have access to it."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "And some of it, you know, you don't have access to, you know, don't have access to it."}, {"time": 3402, "text": "And somehow, you know, like the problem for music got solved."}, {"time": 3402, "text": "But for papers, it's still like..."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "It's just not yet."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "It could be ad supported, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "And then hopefully, that would change the way we do science."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "This is the most exciting thing for me is, especially once I started like making videos and this silly podcast thing, I started to realize like that if you want to do science, one of the most effective ways is to do like couple the paper with a set of YouTube videos, like explaining it."}, {"time": 3433, "text": "That also seems like there's a lot of room for disruption there."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "What is the paper 2.0 going to look like?"}, {"time": 3441, "text": "I think like LaTeX and the PDF, seems like if you..."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "If you look at the first paper that got published in Nature, and if you look at the paper that got published in Nature today, if you look at the two side by side, they are fundamentally the same."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "And even though like the paper that gets published today, you know, you get..."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "Even code, like right now, people put like code, like on a PDF."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "And there are so many things that are related to papers today, you know, you have data, you have code, you might need videos to better explain the concepts."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "So, I think for me, it's natural that there's going to be also an evolution there, that papers are not going to be just the static PDFs or LaTeX, there's going to be a next interface."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "So, in academia, a lot of things that are judged, you're judged by is often quantity, not quality."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "I wonder if there's an opportunity to have like..."}, {"time": 3502, "text": "I tend to judge people by the best work they've ever done as opposed to..."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "I wonder if there's a possibility for that to encourage sort of focusing on the quality, and not necessarily in paper form, but maybe a subset of a paper, subset of idea, almost even a blog post or an experiment."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "Like, why does it have to be published in a journal to be legitimate?"}, {"time": 3526, "text": "And it's interesting that you mentioned that I also think like, yeah, it's why is that the only format?"}, {"time": 3533, "text": "Why can't a blog post or...

Like some people submitted a couple of those, like I think the limit was three or four tweets."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "Maybe it's a new way to look at a proof or something, but I think it just serves to show that there should be other ways to publish like scientific discoveries that don't fit the paper format."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "Well, but so even with the Twitter thread, it would be nice to have some mechanism of formalizing it and making it into an NFT."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "Like a concrete thing that you can reference as a link that's unique."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "Because, I mean, everything we've been saying, all of that, while being true, it's also true that the constraints and the formalism of a paper works well."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "It like forces you, constraints forces you to narrow down your thing and literally put it on paper."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "But, you know, make concrete."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "And that's why, I mean, it's not broken."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "It just could be better."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "And that's the main idea."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "I think there's something about writing, whether it's a blog post or Twitter thread or a paper, that's really nice to concretize a particular little idea that can then be referenced by other ideas, then it can be built on top of with other ideas."},

itself."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "How do you advise people read papers?"}, {"time": 3661, "text": "Or maybe you want to broaden it beyond just papers, but just read concrete pieces of information to understand the insights that labeled in."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "I would say for paper specifically, I would bring back kind of what Louise was talking about, is that it's important to keep in mind that papers are not optimized for ease of understanding."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "And so, right, there's all sorts of restrictions and size and format and language that they can use."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "And so it's important to keep that in mind."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "And so that if you're struggling to read a paper, that might not mean that the underlying material is actually that hard."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "And so that's definitely something that, especially for us, that we read papers and most of the time the papers are completely outside of our comfort zone, I guess."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "And so it would be completely new areas to us."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "So I always try to keep that in mind."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "So there's usually a certain kind of structure, like abstract introductions, methodology, depending on the community and so on."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "Is there something about the process of how to read it, whether you want to skim it to try to find the parts that are easy to understand or not, reading it multiple times?"}, {"time": 3739, "text": "Is there any kind of hacks that you can comment on?"}, {"time": 3746, "text": "I remember like Feynman had this kind of hack when he was reading papers, where you would basically, I think I believe you would read the conclusion of the paper."}, {"time": 3759, "text": "And we would try to just see if he would be able to figure out how to get to the conclusion in like a couple of minutes by himself."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "And he would read a lot of papers that way."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "And I think Fermi also did that almost."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "And Fermi was known for doing a lot of back of the envelope calculation."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "So he was a master at doing that."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "And in terms of like, especially when reading a paper, I think a lot of times people might feel discouraged about the first time you read it."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "You know, it's very hard to grasp or you don't understand a huge fraction of the paper."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And I think it's having read a lot of papers in my life, I think I'm in peace with like the fact that you might spend hours where you're just reading a paper and jumping from paper to paper, reading citations."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "And like your level of understanding sometimes of the paper is very close to 0%."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "And all of a sudden, you know, everything kind of makes sense in your mind."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "And then, you know, you have this quantum jump where all of a sudden you understand the big picture of the paper."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "And this is an exercise that I have to do when reading papers and especially like more complex papers, like, okay, you don't understand because you're just going through the process and just keep going."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "And like, it might feel super chaotic, especially if you're jumping from reference to reference."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "You know, you might end up with like 20 tabs open and you're reading a ton of other papers, but it's just trusting that process that at the end, like you'll find light."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "And I think for me, that's a good framework when reading a paper."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "It's hard because, you know, you might end up spending a lot of time and it looks like you're lost, but that's the process to actually, you know, understand what they're talking about in the paper."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Yeah, I think that process, I enjoy, I've found a lot of value in the process, especially for things outside my field of reading a lot of related work sections and kind of going down that path of getting a big context of the field."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "Because what's, especially when they're well written, there's opinions injected into the really related work."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "Like what work is important, what is not."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "And if you read multiple related work sections that cite or don't cite each other, like the papers, you get a sense of where the field, where the tensions of the field are, where the field is striving."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "And that helps you put into context, like whether the work is radical, whether it's overselling itself, whether it's underselling itself, all those things."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "And added on top of that, I find that often the related work section is the most kind of accessible and readable part of a paper because it's kind of, it's brief to the point, it's like summarizing, it's almost like a Wikipedia style article."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "The introduction is supposed to be a compelling story or whatever, but it's often like overselling, there's like an agenda in the introduction."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "The related work usually has the least amount of agenda except for the few like elements where you're trying to talk shit about previous work where you're trying to sell that you're doing much better."}, {"time": 3958, "text": "But other than that, when you're just painting where the field came from or where the field stands, that's really valuable."}, {"time": 3965, "text": "And also again, just to agree with Fionn in the conclusion, I get a lot of value from the breadth first search, kind of read the conclusion, then read the related work, and then go through the references in the related work, read the conclusion, read the related work, and just go down the tree until you like hit dead ends or run out of coffee."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "And then through that process, you go back up the tree and now you can see the results in their proper context, unless of course the paper is truly revolutionary, which even that process will help you understand that is in fact truly revolutionary."}, {"time": 4002, "text": "You've also, you talked about just following your Twitter thread in depth first search."}, {"time": 4010, "text": "You talked about that you read the book on Grisha Perlman, Grigori Perlman, and then you had a really nice Twitter thread on it and you were taking notes throughout."}, {"time": 4027, "text": "So at a high level, is there suggestions you can give on how to take good notes?"}, {"time": 4033, "text": "Whether it's we're talking about annotations or just for yourself to try to put on paper ideas as you progress through the work in order to then like understand the work better."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "For me, I always try not to underestimate how much you can forget within six months after you've read something."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "I thought you were going to say five minutes, but yeah, six months is good."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "Yeah, or even shorter."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "And so that's something that I always try to keep in mind."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "And it's often, I mean, every once in a while I'll read back a paper that I annotated on Fermat and I'll read through my own annotations and I've completely forgotten what I had written."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "But it's interesting because in a way, after you just understood something, you're kind of the best possible teacher that can teach your future self."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "After you've forgotten it, you're kind of your own best possible teacher at that moment."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "And so it can be great to try to capture that."}, {"time": 4099,

{"time": 4113, "text": "That's under explored, but it's super powerful because you were the person that you can, if you look at the scale from one not knowing anything about the topic and 10, you are the one that progressed from one to 10 and you know which steps you struggled with."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "So you're really the best person to help yourself make that transition from one to 10."}, {"time": 4133, "text": "And a lot of the times, I really believe that the framework that we have to expose ourselves to be talking to us when we were an expert, when we were taking that class and we knew everything about quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 4147, "text": "And then six months later, you don't remember half of the things."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "How could we make it easier to have those conversations between you and your past expert self?"}, {"time": 4159, "text": "I think there might be, it's an under explored idea."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "I think notes on paper are probably not the best way."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "I'm not sure if it's a combination of video, audio, where it's like you have a guided framework that you follow to extract information from yourself so that you can later kind of revisit to make it easier to remember."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "But that's, I think it's an interesting idea worth exploring that I haven't seen a lot of people kind of trying to distill that problem."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "Yeah, I'm creating the kind of tools."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "I find if I record, it sounds weird, but I'll take notes, but if I record audio, like little clips of thoughts, like rants, that's really effective at capturing something that notes can't."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "Because when I replay them, for some reason, it loads my brain back into where I was when I was reading that in a way that notes don't."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "Like when I read notes, I'll often be like, what?"}, {"time": 4222, "text": "What was I thinking there?"}, {"time": 4222, "text": "But when I listened to the audio, it brings you right back to that place."}, {"time": 4229, "text": "And maybe with video, with visual, that might be even more powerful."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "And I think just the process of verbalizing it, that alone kind of makes you have to structure your thought and put it in a way that somebody else could come and understand it."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "And just the process of that is useful to organize your thoughts and yeah, just that alone."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "Does the Fermat's Library

people build videos on top of it to explain the paper?"}, {"time": 4267, "text": "Because you're doing all the hard work of understanding deeply the paper."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "We haven't seen that happening too much."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "But we were actually playing around with the idea of creating some sort of podcast version where we try to distill the paper on an audio format that not maybe you can have access to."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "Might be tricky."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "Might be trickier, but there are definitely people that could be interested in the paper and

even bring the authors to the conversation, but it's tricky."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "And especially for like more technical papers."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "We've thought about doing that, but we haven't converged."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "I'm not sure if you have any tips."}, {"time": 4315, "text": "Well, I'm going to take that as a small project to take one of the Fermat's almost like half advertisement and half as a challenge for myself to take one of the annotated papers and use it as a basis for creating a quick video."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "I've seen like, hopefully I'm saying the name correctly, but machine learning street talk."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "I think that's the name of the show that I recommend highly."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "That's the right name."},

the mountain."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "And so when you start thinking about this, it's a fairly difficult problem."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "And this is like sixth century BC, so you had very limited access to the mathematical tools that you had at the time, were very limited."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "And so what this paper is about is about the story of how they built it and about the fact that for about 2000 years, kind of the accepted explanation of how they built it was actually wrong."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "And so this tunnel has been famous for a while."}, {"time": 4658,

historians described, is that they effectively tried to draw a right angle triangle with the two entrances at each end of the hypotenuse."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "And the way they did it is like they would go around the mountain and kind of walking in a grid fashion."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "And then you can figure out the two sides of the triangle."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "And then after

4814, "text": "I think hero of Alexandria."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "And then for about like yeah for about 2000 years that's how we thought that they had built this tunnel."}, {"time": 4820, "text":

what they probably must have done is to use something that is similar to an iron sight on a rifle."}, {"time": 4852, "text": "The way you can line up your rifle with a target off in the distance by having an iron sight."}, {"time": 4860, "text": "And they must have done something similar to that effectively with three sticks."}, {"time": 4868, "text": "And that way they were able to line up sticks along the side of the mountain that were all on the same height."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "And so that then you could get to the other side and you could and then you could draw that line."},

{"time": 1367, "text": "And, you know, it's been going for a few years now."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "So it's always a challenge to kind of find these appropriate pockets of reducibility."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "But let me see what I can do."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So, so I mean, first of all, let's let's talk about physics, first of all."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And, you know, a key observation, that one of the starting point of our physics project is things about what is space?"}, {"time": 1383, "text": "What is the universe made of?"}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And, you know, ever since Euclid, people just sort of say space is just this thing where you can put things at any position you want."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And they're just points."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "And they're just geometrical things that you can just arbitrarily put at different different coordinate positions."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "So the first thing in our physics project is the idea that space is made of something, just like just like water is made of molecules, space is made of kind of atoms of space."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "And the only thing we can say about these atoms of space is they have some identity."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "There's a there's a there is it's this atom as opposed to this atom."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "And, you know, you could give them a few a computer person, you give them UUIDs or something."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And that's all there is to say about them, so to speak."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And then all we know about these atoms of space is how they relate to each other."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "So we say, these three atoms of space are associated with each other in some relation."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "So you can think about that as you know, what atom of space is friends with what other atom of space, you can build this essentially friend network of the atoms of space."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "And the sort of starting point of our physics project is that's what our universe is, it's a giant friend network of the atoms of space."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And so how can that possibly represent our universe?"}, {"time": 1464, "text": "Well, it's like in something like water, you know, their molecules bouncing around, but on a large scale that, you know, that produces fluid flow, and we have fluid vortices, and we have all of these phenomena that are sort of the emergent phenomena from that underlying kind of collection of molecules bouncing around."}, {"time": 1482, "text": "And by the way, it's important that that collection of molecules bouncing around have this phenomenon of computational irreducibility, that's actually what leads to the second law of thermodynamics among other things."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "And that leads to the sort of randomness of the underlying behavior, which is what gives you something which on a large scale seems like it's a smooth continuous type of thing."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And so okay, so first thing is space is made of something, it's made of all these atoms of space connected together in this network."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "And then everything that we experience is sort of features of that structure of space."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "So, you know, when we have an electron or something or a photon, it's some kind of tangle in the structure of space, much like kind of a vortex in a fluid would be just this thing that is, you know, it can actually, the vortex can move around, it can involve different molecules in the fluid, but the vortex still stays there."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And if you zoom out enough, the vortex looks like an atom itself, like a basic element."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "So there's the levels of abstraction."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "If you squint and kind of blur things out, it looks like at every level of abstraction, you can define what is a basic individual entity."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "But, you know, in this model, there's a bottom level, you know, there's an elementary length, maybe 10 to the minus 100 meters, let's say, which is really small, you know, proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters, the smallest we've ever been able to sort of see with a particle accelerator is around 10 to the minus 21 meters."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "So, you know, if we don't know precisely what the correct scale is, but it's perhaps over the order of 10 to the minus 100 meters, so it's pretty small."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "But that's the end, that's what things are made of."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "What's your intuition where the 10 to the minus 100 comes from?"}, {"time": 1586, "text": "What's your intuition about this scale?"}, {"time": 1593, "text": "Well, okay, so there's a calculation, which I consider to be somewhat rickety, okay, which has to do with comparing, so there are various fundamental constants, there's a speed of light, the speed of light, once you know the elementary time, the speed of light tells you the conversion from the elementary time to the elementary length."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "Then there's the question of how do you convert to the elementary energy?"}, {"time": 1612, "text": "And how do you convert to between other things?"}, {"time": 1616, "text": "And the various constants we know, we know the speed of light, we know the gravitational constant, we know Planck's constant and quantum mechanics, those are the three important ones."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "And we actually know some other things, we know things like the size of the universe, the Hubble constant, things like that."}, {"time": 1629, "text": "And essentially, this calculation of the elementary length comes from looking at the combination of those."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "Okay, so the most obvious thing, people have assumed that quantum gravity happens at this thing, the Planck scale, 10 to the minus 34 meters, which is the combination of Planck's constant and the gravitational constant, the speed of light, that gives you that kind of length."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "Turns out in our model, there is an additional parameter, which is essentially the number of simultaneous threads of execution of the universe, which is essentially the number of sort of independent quantum processes that are going on."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "And that number, let's see if I remember that number, that number is 10 to the 170, I think, and so it's a big number."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "But that number then connects, sort of modifies what you might think from all these Planck units to give you the things we're giving."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "And there's been sort of a mystery actually in the more technical physics thing, that the Planck mass, the Planck energy, Planck energy is actually surprisingly big."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "The Planck length is tiny, 10 to the minus 34 meters, you know, Planck time, 10 to the minus 43 meters, I think, seconds, I think."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "But the Planck energy is like the energy of a lightning strike, okay, which is pretty weird."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "In our models, the actual elementary energy is that divided by the number of sort of simultaneous quantum threads, and it ends up being really small too."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "And that sort of explains that mystery that's been around for a while about how Planck units work."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "But whether that precise estimate is right, we don't know yet."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "I mean, that's one of the things that's sort of been a thing we've been pretty interested in is how do you see through, you know, how do you make a gravitational microscope that can kind of see through to the atoms of space?"}, {"time": 1740, "text": "You know, how do you get in fluid flow, for example, if you go to hypersonic flow or something, you know, you've got a Mach 20, you know, space plane or something, it really matters that there are individual molecules hitting the space plane, not a continuous fluid."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "The question is, what is the analog of hypersonic flow for things about the structure of spacetime?"}, {"time": 1797, "text": "And there may be some effect in, for example, gravitational waves produced by rapidly rotating black hole that in which one could actually see some phenomenon where one can say, yes, these don't come out the way one would expect based on having a continuous structure of spacetime, that is something where you can kind of see through to the discrete structure."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "We don't know that yet."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "So can you maybe elaborate a little bit deeper how a microscope that can see the 10 to the minus 100, how rotating black holes and presumably the detailed accurate detection of gravitational waves from such black holes can reveal the discreteness of space?"}, {"time": 1842, "text": "Okay, first thing is, what is a black hole?"}, {"time": 1842, "text": "Actually, we need to go a little bit further in the story of what spacetime is, because I explained a little bit about what space is, but I didn't talk about what time is."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "And that's sort of important in understanding spacetime, so to speak."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "And your sense is both space and time in the story are discrete."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "But it's a complicated story."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "And needless to say."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "Well, it's simple at the bottom."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "It's very simple at the bottom."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "In the end, it's simple but deeply abstract."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "And something that is simple in conception, but kind of wrapping one's head around what's going on is pretty hard."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "So first of all, we have this."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "So I've described these kind of atoms of space and their connections."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "You can think about these things as a hypergraph."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "A graph is just you connect nodes to nodes, but a hypergraph you can have not just individual friends to friends, but you can have these triplets of friends or whatever else."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "And so we're just saying that's just the relations between atoms of space are the hyperedges of the hypergraph."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "And so we got some big collection of these atoms of space, maybe 10 to the 400 or something in our universe."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "And that's the structure of space."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "And every feature of what we experience in the world is a feature of that hypergraph, that spatial hypergraph."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "So then the question is, well, what does that spatial hypergraph do?"}, {"time": 1932, "text": "Well, the idea is that there are rules that update that spatial hypergraph."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "And in a cellular automaton, you've just got this line of cells and you just say at every step, at every time step, you've got fixed time steps, fixed array of cells."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "At every step, every cell gets updated according to a certain rule."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "And that's the way it works."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "Now in this hypergraph, it's sort of vaguely the same kind of thing."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "We say every time you see a little piece of hypergraph that looks like this, update it to one that looks like this."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "So just keep rewriting this hypergraph."}, {"time": 1960, "text": "Every time you see something that looks like that, anywhere in the universe, it gets rewritten."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "Now, one thing that's tricky about that, which we'll come to, is this multi computational idea, which has to do with you're not saying in some kind of lockstep way, do this one, then this one, then this one."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "It's just whenever you see one you can do, you can go ahead and do it."}, {"time": 1982, "text": "And that leads one not to have a single thread of time in the universe."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "Because if you knew which one to do, you just say, okay, we do this one, then we do this one, then we do this one."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "But if you say, just do whichever one you feel like, you end up with these multiple threads of time, these kind of multiple histories of the universe, depending on which order you happen to do the things you could do in."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "So it's fundamentally asynchronous and parallel."}, {"time": 2010, "text": "Which is very uncomfortable for the human brain that seeks for things to be sequential."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "And synchronous."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "Well, I think that this is part of the story of consciousness, is I think the key aspect of consciousness that is important for sort of parsing the universe, is this point that we have a single thread of experience."}, {"time": 2028, "text": "We have a memory of what happened in the past."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "We can say something, predict something about the future, but there's a single thread of experience."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "And it's not obvious it should work that way."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "I mean, we've got 100 billion neurons in our brains and they're all firing at all kinds of different ways."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "But yet, our experience is that there is the single thread of time that goes along."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "And I think that one of the things I've kind of realized with a lot more clarity in the last year is the fact that the fact that we conclude that the universe has the laws it has is a consequence of the fact that we have consciousness the way we have consciousness."}, {"time": 2064, "text": "And so, just to go on with kind of the basic setup, so we've got this spatial hypergraph, it's got all these atoms of space, they're getting these little clumps of atoms of space, they're getting turned into other clumps of atoms of space, and that's happening everywhere in the universe all the time."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "And so, one thing that's a little bit weird is there's nothing permanent in the universe."}, {"time": 2085, "text":

walk around and it's still us when we walked a foot forward, so to speak?"}, {"time": 2116, "text": "And in a sense, with our models, that's again a question because it's a different set of atoms of space."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "When I move my hand, it's moving into a different set of atoms of space."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "It's having to be recreated."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "The thing itself is not there."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "It's being continuously recreated all the time."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "Now, it's a little bit like waves in an ocean, vortices in a fluid, which again, the actual molecules that exist in those are not what define the identity of the thing."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "But this idea that there can be pure motion, that it is even possible for an object to just move around in the universe and not change, it's not self evident that such a thing should be possible."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "And that is part of our perception of the universe is that we parse those aspects of the universe where things like pure motion are possible."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "Now, pure motion, even in general relativity, the theory of gravity, pure motion is a little bit of a complicated thing."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "I mean, if you imagine your average teacup or something approaching a black hole, it is deformed and distorted by the structure of space time."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "And to say, is it really pure motion?"}, {"time": 2187, "text": "Is it that same teacup that's the same shape?"}, {"time": 2187, "text": "Well, it's a bit of a complicated story."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And this is a more extreme version of that."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "So anyway, the thing that's happening is we've got space, we've got this notion of time."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "So time is this kind of this rewriting of the hypergraph."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "And one of the things that's important about that time is this sort of computational irreducible process."}, {"time": 2210, "text": "There's something, you know, time is not something where it's kind of the mathematical view of time tends to be time is just to coordinate."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "We can, you know, slide a slider, turn a knob, and we'll change the time that we've got in this equation."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "But in this picture of time, that's not how it works at all."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "Time is this inexorable, irreducible kind of set of computations that go on, that go from where we are now to the future."}, {"time": 2232,

time, you know, there are all these kind of sort of folk stories you can tell about why space and time are the same kind of thing."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "In this model, they're fundamentally not the same kind of thing."}, {"time": 2263, "text": "Space is this kind of sort of connections between these atoms of space."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "Time is this computational process."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "So the thing that the first sort of surprising thing is, well, it turns out you get relativity anyway."}, {"time": 2275, "text": "And the reason that happens, there are a few bits and pieces here which one has to understand."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "But the fundamental point is if you are an observer embedded in the system that are part of this whole story of things getting updated in this way and that, there's sort of a limit to what you can tell about what's going on."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And really, in the end, the only thing you can tell is what are the causal relationships between events."}, {"time": 2298, "text": "So an event in this sort of an elementary event is a little piece of hypergraph got rewritten."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "And that means a few hyper edges of the hypergraph were consumed by the event and you produce some other hyper edges."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And that's an elementary event."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "And so then the question is what we can tell is kind of what the network of causal relationships between elementary events is."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "That's the ultimate thing, the causal graph of the universe."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "And it turns out that, well, there's this property of causal invariance that is true of a bunch of these models and I think is inevitably true for a variety of

different orders."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "When you construct the causal graph for each of those orders that you choose to do things in, you'll end up with the same causal graph."}, {"time": 2357,

relativity says they should have."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "And that's kind of how that works."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "I think I'm missing a little piece."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "If we can go there again, you said the fact that the observer is embedded in this hypergraph, what's missing?"}, {"time": 2382, "text": "What is the observer not able to state about this universe of space and time?"}, {"time": 2390, "text": "If you look from the outside, you can say, oh, I see this particular place was updated and then this one was updated and I'm seeing which order things were updated in."}, {"time": 2405, "text": "But the observer embedded in the universe doesn't know which order things were updated in because until they've been updated, they have no idea what else happened."},

universe is a Turing machine."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "Turing machines have just this one update head which does something and otherwise the Turing machine just does nothing."}, {"time": 2430,

machine?"}, {"time": 2435, "text": "Could the universe just have a single updating head that's just zipping around all over the place?"}, {"time": 2440, "text": "You say, that's crazy because I'm talking to you, you seem to be updating, I'm updating, et cetera."}, {"time": 2449, "text": "But the thing is, there's no way to know that because if there was just this head moving around, it's like, okay, it updates me, but you're completely frozen at that point."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "Until the head has come over and updated you, you have no idea what happened to me."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "And so if you sort of unravel that argument, you realize the only thing we actually can tell is what the network of causal relationships between the things that happened were."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "We don't get to know from some sort of outside, sort of God's eye view of the thing."}, {"time": 2473, "text": "We don't get to know what sort of from the outside, what happened."},

this, I guess it would be called multi computation."}, {"time": 2496, "text": "Can't I then look back in the causal tree?"}, {"time": 2500, "text": "Where do you record the trace?"}, {"time": 2502,

an outdated picture, can't I record?"}, {"time": 2518, "text": "See, the problem is, and this is where things start getting very entangled in terms of what one understands."}, {"time": 2523, "text":

this."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And that's why, I mean, lots of the features of this model and the way things work end up being a result of that."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "So, but what, I guess from on a human level, what is the cost you're paying?"}, {"time": 2543, "text": "What are you missing from not getting an updated picture all the time?"}, {"time": 2550, "text": "I got, I understand what you're saying."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "But like what, like, how does consciousness emerge from that?"}, {"time": 2555, "text": "Like how, like, what are the limitations of that observer?"},

of the observer, I think."}, {"time": 2570, "text": "Maybe just explain something about quantum mechanics, because that maybe is a, is an extreme version of some of these issues, which helps to kind

this continuous fluid."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "But every so often, if you look at the exact right experiment, you can start seeing, well, actually, it's made of these molecules where they might go that way, or they might go this way, and that's kind of quantum effects."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "And so, this kind of idea of where we're sort of embedded in the universe, this branching brain is

the two defining features of consciousness that, and I, you know, I would say that the sort of the preamble to this is, for years, you know, as I've talked about sort of computation and fundamental

those other neurons that didn't make it to be part of our sort of conscious stream of experience."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "So in that sense, intelligence as computational sophistication is much broader than the computational constraints which consciousness operates under, and also the sequential, like the sequential thing, like the notion of time."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "But then the follow up question is like, okay, starting to get a sense of what is intelligence, and how does that connect to our human brain?"}, {"time": 3125, "text": "Because you're saying intelligence is almost like a fabric, like what we like plug into it or something, like our consciousness plugs into it."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "Yeah, I mean, the intelligence, I think the core, I mean, you know,

humans have built and so on?"}, {"time": 3153, "text": "You know, what is intelligence?"}, {"time": 3153, "text": "You know, is the weather, you know, people say the weather has a mind of its own."},

your conception of computation, just intelligence is the capacity to perform computation and the sea of?"}, {"time": 3174, "text": "I mean, I think that's right."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "And I think that, you know, this question of, is it for a purpose?"}, {"time": 3179, "text": "Okay, that quickly degenerates into a horrible philosophical mess."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "Because, you know,

persistence, like a consistency over time that the intelligence I plugged into."}, {"time": 3210, "text": "So like, what's, it seems like there's a hard constraint between the amount of computation I can perform in my consciousness."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "Like they seem to be really closely connected somehow."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "Well, I think the point is that the thing that gives you kind of the ability to have kind of conscious intelligence, you can have kind of this, okay, so one thing is we don't know intelligences other than the ones that are very much like us."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "And the ones that are very much like us, I think have this feature of single thread of time, bounded, you know, computationally bounded."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "But you also need

of the bedrock on which we can construct the things we construct."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "Now, the fact that we have this experience of the world that has the single thread of time and

think exist."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "So in other words, if we say, why do we believe that there is, you know, continuous space, let's say, why do we believe that gravity works the way it does?"},

case is that the things that if we say, given this sort of hypergraph that's updating and all the details about all the sort of atoms of space and what they do, and we say, how do we slice that to what we can be sensitive to?"}, {"time": 3360, "text": "What seems to be the case is that as soon as we assume, you know, computational boundedness, single thread of time, that leads us to general

it doesn't."}, {"time": 3414, "text": "This is when I say general relativity, that's the uber theory, so to speak."}, {"time": 3420, "text": "I mean, Newtonian gravity is just the approximation that we can make, you know, on the earth and things like that."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "So this is, you know, the phenomenon of gravity is one that is a consequence of, you know, we would perceive

space and time."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "So in other words, one of the one of the things that we do is we say as time progresses everywhere in space is something happens at a particular time and

somehow useful for consciousness."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "That's what consciousness does."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "Because in a sense, what consciousness is doing is it's insisting that the

that computation?"}, {"time": 3768, "text": "The statement of the principle of computational equivalence is, as soon as it's not obviously simple, it will be as sophisticated as anything."}, {"time":

the difference?"}, {"time": 3869, "text": "And the principle of computational equivalence says there isn't, at some level, a fundamental, you know, you can't say, mathematically, there's a fundamental

4517, "text": "Then there's what we call branchial space, the space of quantum branches."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "So in this thing we call the multiway graph of all of this branching histories, there's this idea of a kind of space where instead of moving around in physical space, you're moving from history to history, so to speak, from one possible history to another possible history."},

slowly understanding things like destructive interference in quantum mechanics, that what's happening is branchial space is associated with phase in quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "And what's happening is the two photons that are supposed to be interfering and destructively interfering are winding up at different ends of branchial space."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "And so us as these poor observers that have branching brains that are trying to conflate together these different threads of history and say, we've really got a consistent story that we're telling here."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "We're really knitting together these threads of history."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "By the time the two photons wound up at opposite ends of branchial space, we just can't knit them together to tell a consistent story."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "So for us, that's sort of the analog of destructive interference."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "And then there's rule space too, which is the space of rules."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "Well, that's another level up."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "So there's the question."}, {"time": 4597, "text": "Actually, I do want to mention one thing because it's something I've realized in recent times and I think it's really, really kind of cool, which is about time dilation and relativity."}, {"time": 4606, "text": "And it kind of helps to understand it's something that kind of helps in understanding what's going on."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "So according to relativity, if you have a clock, it's ticking at a certain rate, you send it in a spacecraft that's going at some significant fraction of the speed of light, to you as an observer at rest, that clock that's in the spacecraft will seem to be ticking much more slowly."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "And so in other words, it's kind of like the twin who goes off to Alpha Centauri and goes very fast will age much less than the twin who's on Earth that is just hanging out where they're hanging out."}, {"time": 4642, "text": "Okay, why does that happen?"}, {"time": 4642, "text": "Okay, so it has to do with what motion is."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "So in our models of physics, what is motion?"}, {"time": 4648, "text": "Well, when you move from somewhere to somewhere, you're having to sort of recreate yourself at a different place in space."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "When you exist at a particular place and you just evolve with time, again, you're updating yourself, you're following these rules to update what happens."}, {"time": 4690, "text": "And so time dilation ends up being, it's really cool, actually, that this is explainable in a way that isn't just imagine the mathematics of relativity."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "But time dilation is a story of the fact that as you kind of are recreating yourself as you move, you are using up some of your computation."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "And so you don't have as much computation left over to actually work out what happens progressively with time."}, {"time": 4713, "text": "So that means that time is running more slowly for you because it is, you're using up your computation, your clock can't tick as quickly, because every tick of the clock is using up some computation, but you already use that computation up on moving at, you know, half the speed of light or something."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "And so that's why time dilation happens."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "And so you can start, so it's kind of interesting that one can sort of get an intuition about something like that, because it has seemed like just a mathematical fact about the mathematics of special relativity and so on."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "Well, for me, it's a little bit confusing what the you in that picture is, because you're using up computation."}, {"time": 4750, "text": "Okay, so we're simply saying the entity is updating itself according to the way that the universe updates itself."}, {"time": 4759, "text": "And the question is, you know, those updates, let's imagine the you as a clock."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "And the clock is, you know, there's all these little updates, the hypergraph and a sequence of updates cause the pendulum to swing back the other way, and then swing back, swinging back and forth."}, {"time": 4777, "text": "And all of those updates are contributing to the motion of, you know, the pendulum going back and forth or the little oscillator moving, whatever it is."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "But then the alternative is that sort of situation one, where the thing is at rest, situation two, where it's kind of moving, what's happening is it is having to recreate itself at every moment, the thing is going to have to do the computations to be able to sort of recreate itself at a different position in space."}, {"time": 4807, "text": "And that's kind of the intuition behind, so it's either going to spend its computation recreating itself at a different position in space, or it's going to spend its computation doing the sort of doing the updating of the, you know, of the ticking of the clock, so to speak."}, {"time": 4824, "text": "So the more updating is doing, the less the ticking of the clock update is doing."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "The more it's having to update because of motion, the less it can update the clock."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "Obviously, there's a sort of mathematical version of it that relates to how it actually works in relativity, but that's kind of, to me, that was sort of exciting to me that it's possible to have a really mechanically explainable story there."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "But the thing about this physical space and physical space, the main sort of big theory is general relativity, the theory of gravity, and that tells you how things move in physical space."}, {"time": 4886, "text": "In branchial space, the big theory is the Feynman path integral, which it turns out tells you essentially how things move in quantum in the space of quantum phases."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "So it's kind of like motion in branchial space."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "And it's kind of a fun thing to start thinking about all these things that we know in physical space, like event horizons and black holes and so on."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "What are the analogous things in branchial space?"}, {"time": 4911, "text": "For example, the speed of light, what's the analog of the speed of light in branchial space?"}, {"time": 4915, "text": "It's the maximum speed of quantum entanglement."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "So the speed of light is a flash bulb goes off here."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "What's the maximum rate at which the effect of that flash bulb is detectable moving away in space?"}, {"time": 4926, "text": "So similarly, in branchial space, something happens."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "And the question is, how far in this branchial space, in the space of quantum states, how far away can that get within a certain period of time?"}, {"time": 4943, "text": "And so there's this notion of a maximum entanglement speed."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "And that might be observable."}, {"time": 4948, "text": "That's the thing we've been sort of poking at, is might there be a way to observe it, even in some atomic physics kind of situation?"}, {"time": 4952, "text": "Because one of the things that's weird in quantum mechanics is when we study quantum mechanics, we mostly study it in terms of small numbers of particles."}, {"time": 4964, "text": "This electron does this, this thing on an ion trap does that and so on."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "But when we deal with large numbers of particles, kind of all bets are off."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "It's kind of too complicated to deal with quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 5005, "text": "And it's like, but wait a minute, in quantum mechanics, nothing ends up in a definite place."}, {"time": 5009, "text": "There's always just some wave function for this to happen."}, {"time": 5012, "text": "How can it be the case that we can draw these reasonable, it just ended up in this place?"}, {"time": 5017, "text": "And you have to kind of say, well, the environment of the molecule effectively made a bunch of measurements on the molecule to keep it kind of classical."}, {"time": 5026, "text": "And that's a story that has to do with this whole thing about measurements have to do with this idea of, can we conclude that something definite happened?"}, {"time": 5032, "text": "Because in quantum mechanics, the intrinsic quantum mechanics, the mathematics of quantum mechanics is all about, they're just these amplitudes for different things to happen."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "Then there's this thing of, and then we make a measurement and we conclude that something definite happened."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "And that has to do with this thing, I think, about sort of moving about knitting together these different threads of history and saying, this is now something where we can definitively say something definite happened."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "In the traditional theory of quantum mechanics, it's just like, after you've done all this amplitude computation, then this big hammer comes down and you do a measurement and it's all over."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "And that's been very confusing."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "For example, in quantum computing, it's been a very confusing thing because when you say, in quantum computing, the basic idea is you're going to use all these separate threads of computation, so to speak, to do all the different parts of, try these different factors for an integer or something like this."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "And it looks like you can do a lot because you've got all these different threads going on."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "But then you have to say, well, at the end of it, you've got all these threads and every thread came up with a definite answer, but we got to conflate those together to figure out a definite thing that we humans can take away from it, a definite, so the computer actually produced this output."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "So having this branchial space and this hypergraph model of physics, do you think it's possible to then make predictions that are definite about many body quantum mechanical systems?"}, {"time": 5121, "text": "I think it's likely, yes."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "Every one of these things, when you go from the underlying theory, which is complicated enough and it's, I mean, the theory at some level is beautifully simple, but as soon as you start actually trying to, it's this whole question about how do you bridge it to things that we humans can talk about, it gets really complicated."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "And this thing about actually getting it to a definite prediction about definite thing you can say about chemistry or something like this, that's just a lot of work."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "There's a thing called the quantum Zeno effect."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "So the idea is quantum stuff happens, but then if you make a measurement, you're kind of freezing time in quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 5161, "text": "So it looks like there's a possibility that with sort of the relationship between the quantum Zeno effect and the way that many body quantum mechanics works and so on, maybe just conceivably, it may be possible to actually figure out a way to measure the maximum entanglement speed."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "And the reason we can potentially do that is because the systems we deal with in terms of atoms and things, they're pretty big."}, {"time": 5183, "text": "A mole of atoms is a lot of atoms, but it's something where to get, when we're dealing with how can you see 10 to the minus 100, so to speak?"}, {"time": 5197, "text": "Well, by the time you've got 10 to the 30th atoms, you're within a little bit closer striking distance of that."}, {"time": 5205, "text": "It's not like, oh, we've just got two atoms and we're trying to see down to 10 to the minus 100 meters or whatever."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "So I don't know how it will work, but this is a potential direction."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "And if you can tell, by the way, if we could measure the maximum entanglement speed, we would know the elementary length."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "These are all related."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "So if we get that one number, we just need one number."}, {"time": 5227, "text": "If we can get that one number, the theory has no parameters anymore."}, {"time": 5233, "text": "And there are other places, well, there's another hope for doing that is in cosmology."}, {"time": 5240, "text": "In this model, one of the features is the universe is not fixed dimensional."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "We think we live in three dimensional space, but this hypergraph doesn't have any particular dimension."}, {"time":

you go a distance R away from a given point?"}, {"time": 5261, "text": "And you can say, well, if I get to about R cubed nodes, when I go a distance R away in the hypergraph, then I'm living roughly in three dimensional space."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "But you might also get to R to the point 2.92 for some value of R. As R increases, that might be the sort of fit to what happens."}, {"time": 5282, "text": "And so one of the things we suspect is that the very early universe was essentially infinite dimensional, and that as the universe expanded, it became lower dimensional."}, {"time": 5293, "text": "And so one of the things that is another little sort of point where we think there might be a way to actually measure some things is dimension fluctuations in the early universe."}, {"time": 5304, "text": "That is, is there leftover dimension fluctuation of at the time of the cosmic microwave background, 100,000 years or something after the beginning of the universe?"}, {"time": 5310, "text": "Is it still the case that there were pieces of the universe that didn't have dimension three, that had dimension 3.01 or something?"}, {"time": 5319, "text": "And can we tell that?"}, {"time": 5319, "text": "Is that possible to observe fluctuations in dimensions?"}, {"time": 5327, "text": "So the question, which should be an elementary exercise in electrodynamics, except it isn't, is understanding what happens to a photon when it propagates through 3.01 dimensional space."}, {"time": 5339,

the surface area of sphere is not proportional to R squared."}, {"time": 5353, "text": "It's R to the whatever 2.01 or something."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "And so that means that I think when you kind of try and do optics, you know, a common principle in optics is Huygens principle, which basically says that every piece of a wave front of light is a source of new spherical waves."}, {"time":

{"time": 5518, "text": "So people study univariate calculus, they study multivariate calculus, it's one variable, it's two variables, three variables."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "But whoever studied, you know, 2.5 variable calculus, turns out nobody."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "Turns out that what we need to have to understand these fractional dimensional spaces, which don't work like well, they're spaces where the effective dimension is not an integer."}, {"time": 5543, "text": "So you can't apply the tools of calculus naturally and easily to fractional dimensions?"}, {"time": 5550, "text": "So somebody has to figure out how to do that."}, {"time": 5550, "text": "Yeah, we're trying to figure this out."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "I mean, it's very connected to very frontier issues in mathematics."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "We're dealing with a scale that's so, so much smaller than our human scale."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "Is it possible to make predictions versus explanations?"}, {"time": 5571, "text": "Do you have a hope that with this hypergraph model, you'd be able to make predictions that then could be validated with a physics experiment, predictions that couldn't have been done or weren't done otherwise?"}, {"time": 5584, "text": "I mean, you know, I think which, in which domain do you think?"}, {"time": 5588, "text": "Okay, so they're going to be cosmology ones to do with dimension fluctuations in the universe."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "That's a very bizarre effect."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "Nobody, you know, dimension fluctuations is just something nobody ever looked for that."}, {"time": 5596, "text": "If anybody sees dimension fluctuation, that's a huge flag that something like our model is going on."}, {"time": 5600, "text": "And how one detects that, you know, that's a problem of kind of, you know, that's a problem of traditional physics in a sense of what's the best way to actually figure that out."}, {"time": 5612, "text":

you know, look, figuring out experiments is like figuring out technology inventions."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "That is, you know, you've got a set of raw materials, you've got an underlying model, and now you've got to be very clever to figure out, you know, what is that thing I can measure that just somehow, you know, leverages into the right place."}, {"time": 5656, "text": "And we've spent less effort on that than I would have liked."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "Because one of the reasons is that I think that the physicists who've been working on our models, with now lots of physicists actually, it's very, very nice."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "It's kind of, it's one of these cases where I'm almost, I'm really kind of pleasantly surprised that the sort of absorption of the things we've done has been quite rapid and quite sort of, you know, very positive."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "So it's a Cambrian explosion of physicists too, not just ideas."}, {"time": 5714, "text": "And these fields have a bunch of good mathematical physicists in them who've been working for decades in these particular areas."}, {"time": 5724, "text": "And the question is, but they've been building these mathematical structures."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "And the mathematical structures are interesting, but they don't typically sit on anything."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "They're just mathematical structures."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "And I think what's happened is our models provide kind of a machine code that lives underneath those models."}, {"time": 5739, "text": "So a typical example, this is due to Jonathan Gorod, who's one of the key people who's been working on our project."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "This is in, okay, so I'll give you an example just to give a sense of how these things connect."}, {"time": 5752, "text": "This is in causal set theory."}, {"time": 5756, "text": "So the idea of causal set theory is there are, in spacetime, we imagine that there's space

space and time."}, {"time": 5769, "text": "And the idea of causal set theory is the only thing you say about the universe is there are a bunch of events that happen sort of randomly at different places in space and time."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "And then the whole sort of theory of physics has to be to do with this graph of causal relationships between these randomly thrown down events."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "So they've always been confused by the fact that to get even Lorentz invariants, even relativistic invariants, you need a very special way to throw down those events."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "And they've had no natural way to understand how that would happen."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "So what Jonathan figured out is that, in fact, from our models, instead of just generating events at random, our models necessarily generate events in some pattern in spacetime effectively that then leads to Lorentz invariants and relativistic invariants and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5822, "text": "So it's a place where all the mathematics that's been done on, well, we just have a random collection of events."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "Now what consequences does that have in terms of causal set theory and so on?"}, {"time": 5830, "text": "That can all be kind of wheeled in now that we have some different underlying foundational idea for what the particular distribution of events is as opposed to just what we throw down random events."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "And so that's a typical sort of example of what we're seeing in all these different areas of kind of how you can take really interesting things that have been done in mathematical physics and connect them."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "And it's really kind of beautiful because the abstract models we have just seem to plug into all these different very interesting, very elegant abstract ideas."}, {"time": 5868, "text": "But we're now giving sort of a reason for that to be the way, a reason for one to care."}, {"time": 5868, "text": "I mean, it's like saying you can think about computation abstractly."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "You can think about, I don't know, combinators or something as abstract computational things."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "And you can sort of do all kinds of study of them."}, {"time": 5886, "text": "But it's like, why do we care?"}, {"time": 5886, "text": "Well, okay, Turing machines are a good start because you can kind of see they're sort of mechanically doing things."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "But when we actually start thinking about computers, computing things, we have a really good reason to care."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "And this is sort of what we're providing, I think, is a reason to care about a lot of these areas of mathematical physics."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "So that's been very nice."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "So I'm not sure we've ever got to the question of why does the universe exist at all?"}, {"time": 5910, "text": "No, no, let's talk about that."}, {"time": 5910, "text": "So it's not the simplest question in the world."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "So it takes a few steps to get to it."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "And it's nevertheless even surprising that you can even begin to answer this question, as you were saying."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "I'm very surprised."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "So the next thing to perhaps understand is this idea of ruleal space."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "So we've got kind of physical space."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "We've got branchial space, the space of possible quantum histories."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "And now we've got another level of kind of abstraction, which is ruleal space."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "And here's where that comes from."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "So you say, okay, you say we've got this model for the universe."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "We've got a particular rule."}, {"time": 5952, "text": "And we run this rule and we get the universe."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "Why that rule?"}, {"time": 5959, "text": "Why not another rule?"}, {"time": 5959, "text": "And so that confused me for a long time."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "And I realized, well, actually, what if the thing could be using all possible rules?"}, {"time": 5965, "text": "What if at every step, in addition to saying apply a particular rule at all places in this hypergraph, one could say, just take all possible rules and apply all possible rules at all possible places in this hypergraph."}, {"time": 5981, "text": "And then you make this ruleal multiway graph, which both is all possible histories for a particular rule and all possible rules."}, {"time": 5988, "text": "So the next thing you'd say is, how can you get anything reasonable out of it?"}, {"time": 5993, "text": "How can anything real come out of the set of all possible rules applied in all possible ways?"}, {"time": 5998, "text": "This is a subtle thing, which I haven't fully untangled."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "There is this object, which is the result of running all possible rules in all possible ways."}, {"time": 6011, "text": "And you might say, if you're running all possible rules, why can't everything possible happen?"}, {"time": 6015, "text": "Well, the answer is because when you, there's sort of this entanglement that occurs."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "So let's say that you have a lot of different possible initial conditions, a lot of different possible states."}, {"time": 6027, "text": "Then you're applying these different rules."}, {"time": 6027, "text": "Well, some of those rules can end up with the same state."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "So it isn't the case that you can just get from anywhere to anywhere."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "There's this whole entangled structure of what can lead to what, and there's a definite structure that's produced."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "I think I'm going to call that definite structure the rulead, the limit of kind of all possible rules being applied in all possible ways."}, {"time": 6048, "text": "And you're saying that structure is finite, so that somehow connects to maybe a similar kind of thing as like causal invariance."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "Well, it happens that the rulead necessarily has causal invariance."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "That's a feature of, that's just a mathematical consequence of essentially using all possible rules plus universal computation gives you the fact that from any diverging paths, the paths will always converge."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "But does that necessarily infer that the rulead is finite?"}, {"time": 6081, "text": "In the end, it's not necessarily finite."}, {"time": 6081, "text": "I mean, just like the history of the universe may not be finite."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "The history of the universe, time may keep going forever."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "You can keep running the computations of the rulead and you'll keep spewing out more and more and more structure."}, {"time": 6092, "text": "It's like time doesn't have to end."}, {"time": 6097, "text": "But the issue is there are three limits that happen in this rulead object."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "One is how long you run the computation for."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "Another is how many different rules you're applying."}, {"time": 6111, "text": "And another is how many different states you start from."}, {"time": 6111, "text": "And the mixture of those three limits."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "I mean, this is just mathematically a horrendous object."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "And what's interesting about this object is the one thing that does seem to be the case about this object is it connects with ideas in higher category theory."}, {"time": 6127, "text": "And in particular, it connects to some of the 20th century's most abstract mathematics done by this chap Grothendieck."}, {"time": 6132, "text": "Grothendieck had a thing called the infinity groupoid, which is closely related to this rulead object."}, {"time": 6138, "text": "Although the details of the relationship, you know, I don't fully understand yet."}, {"time": 6144, "text": "But I think that what's interesting is this thing that is sort of this very limiting object."}, {"time": 6151, "text": "So, okay, so a way to think about this that, again, will take us into another direction, which is the equivalence between physics and mathematics."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "The way that, well, let's see, maybe this is just to give a sense of this kind of groupoid and things like that."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "You can think about, in mathematics, you can think you have certain axioms, they're kind of like atoms, and you, well, actually, let's say, let's talk about mathematics for a second."}, {"time": 6181, "text": "What is it made of, so to speak?"}, {"time": 6181, "text": "Mathematics, there's a bunch of statements, like, for addition, x plus y is equal to y plus x, that's a statement in mathematics."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "Another statement would be, you know, x squared minus one is equal to x plus one, x minus one."}, {"time": 6198, "text": "There are an infinite number of these possible statements of mathematics."}, {"time": 6201, "text": "Well, it's not, I mean, it's not just, I guess, a statement, but with x plus y, it's a rule that you can, I mean, you think of it as a rule."}, {"time": 6209, "text": "It is a rule."}, {"time": 6209, "text": "It's also just a thing that is true in mathematics."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "The statement of truth, okay."}, {"time": 6217, "text": "And what you can imagine is, you imagine just laying out this giant kind of ocean of all statements."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "Well, actually, you first start, okay, this is where this was segueing into a different thing."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "Let me not go in this direction for a second."}, {"time": 6232, "text": "Let's not go to metamathematics just yet."}, {"time": 6234, "text": "Yeah, we'll maybe get to metamathematics, but it's, so let me not, let me explain the groupoid and things later."}, {"time": 6240, "text": "But, so let's come back to the universe, always a good place to be in, so to speak."}, {"time": 6247, "text": "Yeah, so what does the universe have to do with the rule add, the rule of L space, and how that's possibly connected to why the thing exists at all, and why there's just one of them?"}, {"time": 6258, "text": "So here's the point."}, {"time": 6258, "text": "So the thing that had confused me for a long time was, let's say we get the rule for the universe."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "We hold it in our hand."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "We say, this is our universe."}, {"time": 6268, "text": "Then the immediate question is, well, why isn't it another one?"}, {"time": 6268, "text": "And that's kind of the sort of the lesson of Copernicus is, we're not very special."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "So how come we got universe number 312 and not universe quadrillion, quadrillion, quadrillion?"}, {"time": 6279, "text": "And I think the resolution of that is the realization that the universe is running all possible rules."}, {"time": 6292, "text": "So then you say, well, how on earth do we perceive the universe to be running according to a particular rule?"}, {"time": 6298, "text": "How do we perceive definite things happening in the universe?"}, {"time": 6302, "text": "Well, it's the same story."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "It's the observer, there is a reference frame that we are picking in this ruleal space, and that that is what determines our perception of the universe."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "With our particular sensory information and so on, we are parsing the universe in this particular way."}, {"time": 6318, "text": "So here's the way to think about it."}, {"time": 6318, "text": "In physical space, we live in a particular place in the universe."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "And we could live on Alpha Centauri, but we don't."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "We live here."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "And similarly, in ruleal space, we could live in many different places in ruleal space, but we happen to live here."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "And what does it mean to live here?"}, {"time": 6336, "text": "It means we have certain sensory input."}, {"time": 6341, "text": "We have certain ways to parse the universe."}, {"time": 6341, "text": "Those are our interpretation of the universe."}, {"time": 6347, "text": "What would it mean to travel in ruleal space?"}, {"time": 6347, "text": "What it basically means is that we are successively interpreting the universe in different ways."}, {"time": 6356, "text": "So in other words, to be at a different point in ruleal space is to have a different, in a sense, a different interpretation of what's going on in the universe."}, {"time": 6361, "text": "And we can imagine even things like an analog of the speed of light as the maximum speed of translation in ruleal space and so on."}, {"time": 6370, "text": "So wait, what's the interpretation?"}, {"time": 6370, "text": "So ruleal space and we, I'm confused by the we and the interpretation and the universe."}, {"time": 6378, "text": "I thought moving about in ruleal space changes the way the universe is."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "The way we would perceive it."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "So it ultimately has to do with the perception."}, {"time": 6393, "text": "So it doesn't real, ruleal space is not somehow changing, like branching into another universe or something like that."}, {"time": 6401, "text": "No, I mean, the point is that the whole point of this is the rule yard is sort of the encapsulated version of everything that is the universe running according to all possible rules."}, {"time": 6414, "text": "We think of our universe, the observable universe, as a thing."}, {"time": 6420, "text": "So we're a little bit loose with the word universe then, because wouldn't the rule yard potentially encapsulate a very large number, like combinatorially large, maybe infinite set of what we human physicists think of as universes?"}, {"time": 6434, "text": "That's an interesting, interesting parsing of the word universe, right?"}, {"time": 6440, "text": "Because what we're saying is, just as we're at a particular place in physical space, we're at a particular place in ruleal space, at that particular place in ruleal space, our experience of the universe is this."}, {"time": 6450, "text": "Just as if we lived at the center of the galaxy, our universe, our experience of the universe will be different from the one it is, given where we actually live."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "And so what we're saying is, you might say, I mean, in a sense, this rule yard is sort of a super universe, so to speak."}, {"time": 6467, "text": "But it's all entangled together."}, {"time": 6467, "text": "It's not like you can separate out."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "You can say, let me, it's like when we take a reference, okay, it's like our experience of the universe is based on where we are in the universe."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "We could imagine moving to somewhere else in the universe, but it's still the same universe."}, {"time": 6485, "text": "So there's not like universes existing in parallel?"}, {"time": 6490, "text": "Because, and the whole point is that if we were able to change our interpretation of what's going on, we could perceive a different reference frame in this rule yard."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "Yeah, but that's not, that's just, yeah, that's the same rule yard."}, {"time": 6504, "text": "That's the same universe."}, {"time": 6511, "text": "You're just moving about."}, {"time": 6511, "text": "These are just coordinates in the universe."}, {"time": 6514, "text": "So the reason that's interesting is, imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence, so the alien intelligence, we should say."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "The alien intelligence might live on Alpha Centauri, but it might also live at a different place in real space."}, {"time": 6528, "text": "It can live right here on Earth."}, {"time": 6528, "text": "It just has a different reference frame that includes a very different perception of the universe."}, {"time": 6532, "text": "And then because that real space is very large, I mean, Do we get to communicate with them?"}, {"time": 6544, "text": "Yeah, but it's also, well, one thing is how different the perception of the universe could be."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "I think it could be bizarrely, unimaginably completely different."}, {"time": 6553, "text": "And I mean, one thing to realize is, even in kind of things I don't understand well, you know, I know about the kind of Western tradition of understanding, you know, science and all that kind of thing."}, {"time": 6565, "text": "And, you know, you talk to people who say, well, I, you know, I'm really into some, you know, Eastern tradition of this, that and the other."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "And it's really obvious to me how things work."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "I don't understand it at all."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "But, you know, it is not obvious, I think, with this kind of realization that there's these very different ways to interpret what's going on in the universe."}, {"time": 6587, "text": "That kind of gives me at least, it doesn't help me to understand that different interpretation."}, {"time": 6592, "text": "But it gives me at least more respect for the possibility that there will be other interpretations."}, {"time": 6599, "text": "Yeah, it humbles you to the possibility that like, what is it, reincarnation or all these like eternal recurrence with Nietzsche, like just these ideas?"}, {"time": 6612, "text": "Well, you know, the thing that I realized about a bunch of those things is that, you know, I've been sort of doing my little survey of the history of philosophy, just trying to understand, you know, what can I actually say now about some of these things?"}, {"time": 6620, "text": "And you realize that some of these concepts like the immortal soul concept, which, you know, I remember when I was a kid, and, you know, it was kind of a lots of religion bashing type stuff of people saying, you know, well, we know about physics, tell us how much does a soul weigh?"}, {"time": 6635, "text": "And people are like, well, how can it be a thing if it doesn't weigh anything?"}, {"time": 6641, "text": "Well, now we understand, you know, there is this notion of what's in brains that isn't the matter of brains, and it's something computational."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "And there is a sense and in fact, it is correct, that it is in some sense, immortal, because this pattern of computation is something abstract that is not specific to the particular material of a brain."}, {"time": 6661, "text": "Now, we don't know how to extract it, you know, in our traditional scientific approach."}, {"time": 6667, "text": "But it's still something where it isn't a crazy thing to say there is something doesn't weigh anything."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "That's a kind of a silly question."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "How much does it weigh?"}, {"time": 6673, "text": "Well, actually, maybe it isn't such a silly question in our model of physics, because the actual computational activity has has a consequence for gravity and things, but that's a very subtle."}, {"time": 6687, "text": "You can talk about mass and energy and so on."}, {"time": 6687, "text": "That could be a, what would you call it, a solitron."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "A particle that somehow contains soulness."}, {"time": 6699, "text": "Well, that's what, by the way, that's what Leibniz said."}, {"time": 6699, "text": "And, you know, one thing I've never understood this, you know, Leibniz had this idea of monads and monadology, and he had this idea that what exists in the universe is this big collection of monads."}, {"time": 6713, "text": "And that they that the only thing that one knows about the monads is sort of how they relate to each other."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "It sounds awfully like hypergraphs, right?"}, {"time": 6717, "text": "But Leibniz had really lost me at the following thing."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "He said, each of these monads has a soul, and each of them has a consciousness."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "And it's like, okay, I'm out of here."}, {"time": 6729, "text": "I don't understand this at all."}, {"time": 6732, "text": "But I realized recently that in his day, the concept that a thing could do something could spontaneously do something."}, {"time": 6739, "text": "That was his only way of describing that."}, {"time": 6743, "text":

know, what people have generally thought, and I don't know of a lot of discussion of this, why does the universe exist question?"}, {"time": 7626, "text": "It's been a very, you know, I've been surprised actually at how little, I mean, I think it's one of these things that's really kind of far out there."}, {"time": 7632, "text": "But the thing that is, you know, the surprise here is that

think about this, let me see."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "So like concrete terms."}, {"time": 7741, "text": "Well, they're not very concrete."}, {"time": 7741, "text": "I mean, they're just things

exist as a result of kind of biological evolution and whatever else."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "But the thing is that in some sense that there is, it is a different kind of thing to say, does plus

system, once we exist as observers embedded in that formal system, that's enough to have something which is like our universe."}, {"time": 7839, "text": "And so then what you're kind of asking is perhaps is why, I mean, the point is we definitely can imagine it."}, {"time": 7853, "text": "There's nothing that says that we're not saying that it's sort of inevitable that that is a thing that we can imagine."}, {"time": 7862, "text": "We don't have to ask, does it exist?"}, {"time": 7862, "text": "We're just, it is definitely something we can imagine."}, {"time": 7867, "text": "Now that's,

around, I don't know, a cylinder or something, you can wind around one way and you can, there's no paths where you can easily deform one path into another because it's just sort of sitting on the same side of the cylinder."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "But when you've got something that winds all the way around a cylinder, you can't continuously deform that down to a point because it's, it's stuck

those proofs."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "How would that be possible if they started the same place and ended the same place?"}, {"time": 9032, "text": "Well, it's the same thing as, you know, we've got points on a, you know, if we've got paths on a cylinder."}, {"time": 9040, "text": "Now I understand how it works in physical space, but it just doesn't, it feels like proof space shouldn't have that."}, {"time": 9044, "text": "I mean, I'm not sure."}, {"time": 9047, "text": "We'll know very soon because we get to do some experiments."}, {"time": 9047, "text": "This is the great thing about

to, so I've sort of claimed that there've been sort of four epochs in the history of making models of things."}, {"time": 9088, "text": "And this multi computation thing is the fourth, is a new

made of?"}, {"time": 9112, "text": "Or the, you know, there are these crystal spheres that represent where the planets are and so on."}, {"time": 9118, "text": "It's like a structural idea of how the

that I kind of started really pushing in the early 1980s as a result, you know, the things that we were talking about before about complexity, that was my motivation."}, {"time": 9159, "text": "But the bigger story was the story of kind of computational models of things."}, {"time": 9163, "text": "And the big difference there from the mathematical models is, in mathematical models, there's an equation, you solve it, you kind of slide time to the place where you want it."}, {"time": 9172, "text": "In computational models, you give the rule and then you just say, go run the rule."}, {"time":

there's still one thread of time."}, {"time": 9201, "text": "It's still the case, you know, the cellular automaton state, then it has the next state and the next state and so on."}, {"time": 9211,

threads of time."}, {"time": 9221, "text": "And so in this multi computation paradigm, the kind of idea is, instead of there being the single thread of time, there are these kind of distributed asynchronous threads of time that are happening."}, {"time": 9232, "text": "And the thing that's sort of different there is if you want to know what happened, if you say what happened in the system,

steps, not even clear what a thousand steps means, because you've got all these different threads of time, but there is no state."}, {"time": 9253, "text": "There's all these different possible, you know, there's all these different paths."}, {"time": 9257, "text": "And so the only way you can know what happened is to have some kind of observer who is saying, here's how to parse the results of what was going on."}, {"time": 9267, "text": "But that observer is embedded and they don't have a complete picture."}, {"time": 9271, "text": "So in the case of physics, that's right."}, {"time":

just want the one that's the winner that factors the number or whatever else."}, {"time": 9304, "text": "And similarly, it's the same story in logic programming and so on, but we say, we've got this

one proof and then I'm happy."}, {"time": 9318, "text": "What's happening in multi computation in physics is we actually care about many paths."}, {"time": 9323, "text": "And well, there is a case,

all these multiple paths."}, {"time": 9343, "text": "But the thing that is notable is that when you're an observer embedded in this thing, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, with various other sort of footnotes and so on, it is inevitable that the thing that you parse out of the system looks like general relativity and quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 9362, "text": "In other words, that just by the very structure of this multi computational setup, it inevitably is the case that you have certain emergent laws."}, {"time": 9367, "text": "Now, why is this perhaps not surprising?"}, {"time": 9376,

kind of thing."}, {"time": 9388, "text": "But I think what happens is what's a sort of a funny thing that I just been understanding very recently is when when I kind of introduced this whole sort of computational paradigm complexity ish thing back in the 80s, it was kind of like a big downer because it's like there's a lot of stuff you can't say about what systems will do."}, {"time": 9408,

these details."}, {"time": 9450, "text": "But to that kind of observer, what's important is only the core structure of multi computation, which means that observer observes comparatively simple laws."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "And I think it is inevitable that that observer observes laws which are mathematically structured like general relativity and quantum mechanics, which, by the way, are the same law in our in our model of physics."}, {"time": 9476, "text": "So that's an explanation why there are simple laws that explain a lot for this observer."}, {"time": 9481, "text": "But what the

9590, "text": "And so that's a story very much like theorem proving."}, {"time": 9595, "text": "And people have done actually they start in the 1960s looking at kind of the theorem proving approach to that, although it didn't really it didn't it didn't was sort of done too early, I think."}, {"time": 9604, "text": "But anyway, so that's kind of the view is that that chemistry, chemical reactions are the story of of all these different sort of paths of possible things that go on."}, {"time": 9615, "text": "OK, let's let's go to an even lower level."}, {"time": 9615, "text": "Let's say instead of asking about which species of molecules we're talking about, let's look at individual molecules and let's say we're looking at individual molecules and they are having chemical reactions and we're building up this big graph of all these reactions that are happening."}, {"time": 9631, "text": "OK, so so then we've got this big graph."}, {"time": 9636, "text": "And by the way, that big graph is incredibly similar to this hypergraph rewriting things."}, {"time": 9642, "text": "In fact, in the underlying theory of multi computation there, these things we call token event graphs, which are basically you've broken your state into tokens."}, {"time": 9646, "text": "Like in the case of a hypergraph, you've broken it into hyper edges and each event is just consuming some number of tokens and producing some number of tokens."}, {"time": 9658, "text": "But then you have to there's a lot of work to be done on update rules in terms of what they actually are for chemistry."}, {"time": 9662, "text": "Yeah, what they offer are observed chemistry."}, {"time": 9668, "text": "And we've been working on that actually because we have this beautiful system and Wolfram language for representing chemistry symbolically."}, {"time": 9672, "text": "So we actually have you know, this is this is an ongoing thing to actually figure out what they are for some practical cases."}, {"time": 9681, "text": "Does that require human injection or can it be automatically discovered these update rules?"}, {"time": 9687, "text": "Well, if we can do chemistry better, we could probably discover them automatically."}, {"time": 9690, "text": "But I think in, in reality, right now, it's like there are these particular reactions."}, {"time": 9695, "text": "And really, to understand what's going on, we're probably going to pick a particular subtype of chemistry."}, {"time": 9699, "text": "And just because because let me explain where this is going to the place that his his where this is going."}, {"time": 9705, "text": "So got this whole network of all these molecules, having all these reactions and so on."}, {"time": 9710, "text": "And this is some whole multi computational story because each each sort of chemical reaction event is its own separate event."}, {"time": 9716, "text": "We're saying they will happen asynchronously."}, {"time": 9722, "text": "We're not describing in what order they happen."}, {"time": 9722, "text": "You know, maybe that order is governed by some quantum mechanics thing doesn't really matter."}, {"time": 9727, "text": "We're just saying they happen in some order."}, {"time": 9731, "text": "And then we ask, what is the what what's the you know, how do we think about the system?"}, {"time": 9736, "text": "Well, this thing is some kind of big multi computational system."}, {"time": 9736, "text": "The question is what is the chemical observer?"}, {"time": 9741, "text": "And one possible chemical observer is all you care about is did you make that particular drug molecule?"}, {"time": 9747, "text": "You're just asking, you know, the for the one path."}, {"time": 9747, "text": "Another thing you might care about is I want to know the concentration of each species."}, {"time": 9751, "text": "I want to know, you know, at every stage, I'm going to solve the differential equations that represent the concentrations."}, {"time": 9760, "text": "And I want to know what those all are."}, {"time": 9760, "text": "Because when and it's kind of like you're going below and statistical mechanics, there's kind of all these molecules bouncing around."}, {"time": 9771, "text": "And you might say, we're just going to ignore we're just going to look at the aggregate densities of certain kinds of molecules."}, {"time": 9777, "text": "But you can look at a lower level, you can look at this whole graph of possible interactions."}, {"time": 9782, "text": "And so the kind of the idea would be what, you know, is the only chemical observer, one who just cares about overall concentrations?"}, {"time": 9788, "text": "Or can there be a chemical observer who cares about this network of what happened?"}, {"time": 9794, "text": "And so that the question then is, so let me give an analogy."}, {"time": 9800, "text": "So this is where I think this is potentially very relevant to molecular biology and molecular computing."}, {"time": 9805, "text": "When we think about a computation, usually, we say it's input, it's output, we, you know, or chemistry, we say there's this input, we're going to make this molecule as the output."}, {"time": 9816, "text": "But what if what we actually encode, what if our computation, what thing we care about is some part of this dynamic network?"}, {"time": 9822, "text": "What if it isn't just the input and the output that we care about?"}, {"time": 9828, "text": "What if there's some dynamics of the network that we care about?"}, {"time": 9828, "text": "Now, imagine you're a chemical observer, what is a chemical observer?"}, {"time": 9832, "text": "Well, in molecular biology, there are all kinds of weird sorts of observers, there are membranes that exist, that have, you know, different kinds of molecules that can bind to them, things like this, it's not obvious that the from a human scale, we just measure the concentration of something is the relevant story."}, {"time": 9853, "text": "We can imagine that, for example, when we look at this whole network of possible reactions, we can imagine, you know, at a physical level, we can imagine, well, what was the actual momentum direction of that of that molecule?"}, {"time": 9862, "text": "What was it which we don't pay any attention to when we're just talking about chemical concentrations?"}, {"time": 9866, "text": "What was the orientation of that molecule, these kinds of things?"}, {"time": 9871, "text": "And so here's the place where I'm, I have a little suspicion, okay?"}, {"time": 9871, "text": "So one of the questions in biology is what matters in biology?"}, {"time": 9876, "text": "And that is, you know, we have all these chemical reactions, we have all these, all these molecular processes going on in, you know, in biological systems, what matters?"}, {"time": 9886, "text": "And, you know, one of the things is to be able to tell what matters, well, so a big story of the what matters question was what happened in genetics in 1953, when DNA, when it was figured out how DNA worked."}, {"time": 9897, "text": "Because before that time, you know, genetics have been all these different effects and complicated things."}, {"time": 9903, "text": "And then it was realized, ah, there's something new, a molecule can store information, which wasn't obvious before that time, a single molecule can store information."}, {"time": 9912, "text": "So there's a place where there can be something important that's happening in molecular biology, and it's just in the sequence that's storing information in a molecule."}, {"time": 9921, "text": "So the possibility now is imagine this dynamic network, this, you know, causal graphs and multiway causal graphs and so on, that represent all of these different reactions between molecules."}, {"time": 9933, "text": "What if there is some aspect of that, that is storing information that's relevant for molecular biology?"}, {"time": 9939, "text": "And the dynamic aspect of that."}, {"time": 9939, "text": "So that it's similar to how the structure of a DNA molecule stores information, it could be the dynamics of the system somehow stores information."}, {"time": 9950, "text": "And this kind of process might allow you to give predictions of what that would be."}, {"time": 9956, "text": "Well, yes, but also imagine that you're trying to do, for example, imagine you're trying to do molecular computation."}, {"time": 9963, "text": "You might think the way we're going to do molecular computation is we're just going to run the thing."}, {"time": 9968, "text": "We're going to see what came out."}, {"time": 9968, "text": "We're going to see what molecule came out."}, {"time": 9971, "text": "This is saying that's not the only thing you can do."}, {"time": 9971, "text": "There is a different kind of chemical observer that you can imagine constructing, which is somehow sensitive to this dynamic network."}, {"time": 9982, "text": "Exactly how that works, how we make that measurement, I don't know, but a few ideas, but that's what's important, so to speak."}, {"time": 9987, "text": "And that means, and by the way, you can do the same thing even for Turing machines."}, {"time": 9993, "text": "You can say, if you have a multiway Turing machine, you can say, how do you compute with a multiway Turing machine?"}, {"time": 9999, "text": "You can't say, well, we've got this input and this output because the thing has all these threads of time and it's got lots of outputs."}, {"time": 10003, "text": "And so then you say, well, what does it even mean to be a universal multiway Turing machine?"}, {"time": 10008, "text": "I don't fully know the answer to that."}, {"time": 10013, "text": "It would freak Turing out for sure, because then the dynamics of the trajectory of the computation matters."}, {"time": 10019, "text": "I mean, but the thing is that that, so this is again, a story of what's the observer, so to speak."}, {"time": 10025, "text": "In chemistry, what's the observer there?"}, {"time": 10030, "text": "Now to give an example of where that might matter, a very sort of present day example is in immunology, where we have whatever it is, 10 billion different kinds of antibodies that are all these different shapes and so on."}, {"time": 10043, "text": "We have a trillion different kinds of T cell receptors that we produce."}, {"time": 10049, "text": "And the traditional theory of immunology is this clonal selection theory where we are constantly producing, randomly producing all these different antibodies."}, {"time": 10062, "text": "And as soon as one of them binds to an antigen, then that one gets amplified and we produce more of that antibody and so on."}, {"time": 10066, "text": "Back in the 1960s, an immunologist called Nils Joerner, who was the guy who invented monoclonal antibodies, various other things, kind of had this network theory of the immune system where it would be like, well, we produce antibodies, but then we produce antibodies to the antibodies, anti antibodies, and we produce anti anti antibodies."}, {"time": 10084, "text": "And we get this whole dynamic network of interactions between different immune system cells."}, {"time": 10089, "text": "And that was kind of a qualitative theory at that time."}, {"time": 10096, "text": "And I've been a little disappointed because I've been studying immunology a bit recently."}, {"time": 10101, "text": "And I knew something about this like 35 years ago or something."}, {"time": 10101, "text": "And I knew, you know, I'd read a bunch of the books and I talked to a bunch of the people and so on."}, {"time": 10109, "text": "And it was like an emerging theoretical immunology world."}, {"time": 10109, "text": "And then I look at the books now, and they're very thick because they've got, you know, there's just a ton known about immunology and, you know, all these different pathways, all these different details and so on."}, {"time": 10123, "text": "But the theoretical sections seem to have shrunk."}, {"time": 10123, "text": "And so it's so the question is, what, you know, for example, immune memory, where is the where does the immune memory reside?"}, {"time": 10131, "text": "Is it actually some cells sitting in our bone marrow that is, you know, living for the whole of our lives that's going to spring into action as soon as we're shown the same antigen?"}, {"time": 10139, "text": "Or is it something different from that?"}, {"time": 10145, "text": "Is it something more dynamic?"}, {"time": 10145, "text": "Is it something more like some network of interactions between these different kinds of immune system cells and so on?"}, {"time": 10149, "text":

clear."}, {"time": 10159, "text": "And to have a qualitative theory for that doesn't seem to exist."}, {"time": 10165, "text": "In fact, I was just been trying to study this."}, {"time": 10165, "text": "So I'm quite incomplete in my study of these things."}, {"time": 10170, "text": "But I was a little bit taken aback because I've been looking at these things and it's like, and then they get to the end where they have the most advanced theory that they've got."}, {"time": 10177, "text": "And it turns out it's a cellular automaton theory."}, {"time": 10177, "text": "It's like, okay, well, at least I understand that theory."}, {"time": 10183, "text": "But but, you know, I think that the possibility is that in that this is a place where if you want to know, you know, explain roughly how the immune system works, it ends up being this sort of dynamic network."}, {"time": 10196, "text": "And then the the, you know, the immune consciousness, so to speak, the observer ends up being something that, you know, in the end, it's kind of like, does the human get sick or whatever?"}, {"time": 10206, "text": "But it's a it's something which is a complicated story that relates to this whole sort of dynamic network and so on."}, {"time": 10212, "text": "And I think that's another place where this kind of notion of where I think multi computation has the possibility."}, {"time": 10216, "text": "See, one of the things, okay, you can end up with something where yes, there is a general relativity in there."}, {"time": 10223, "text": "But it turns up, but it may turn out that the observer who sees general relativity in the immune system is an observer that's irrelevant to what we care about about the immune system."}, {"time": 10233, "text": "I mean, it could be yes, there is some effect where, you know, there's some, you know, time dilation of T cells interacting with whatever."}, {"time": 10243, "text": "But it's like, that's an effect that's just irrelevant."}, {"time": 10243, "text": "And the thing we actually care about is things about, you know, what happens when you have a vaccine that goes into some place in shapespace?"}, {"time": 10252, "text": "And, you know,

shapespace, for example, that's an that's an important issue."}, {"time": 10261, "text": "If you have one of these dynamic theories, it's like, you know, you you're poking to shapespace by having, you know, let's say, a vaccine or something that has a particular configuration in shapespace."}, {"time": 10270, "text": "How, how quickly as this dynamic network spreads out, how quickly do you get sort of other antibodies in different places in shapespace, things like that?"}, {"time": 10282, "text": "When you say shapespace, you mean the shape of the molecules?"}, {"time": 10282, "text": "And then,

of proteins that Right, exactly."}, {"time": 10296, "text": "then actually has an impact on helping develop drugs, for example, or has an impact on virology, immunology, helping."}, {"time": 10306,

other words, is it chemical reaction networks?"}, {"time": 10318, "text": "Is it, you know, genetics, you know, DNA, big, you know, big news, it's kind of there's a digital aspect to the whole thing."}, {"time": 10325, "text": "You know, what is the qualitative way to think about how things work in biology?"}, {"time": 10330, "text": "You know, when we think about, I don't know, some phenomenon like aging or something, which is a big, complicated phenomenon, which just seems to have all these different tentacles."}, {"time": 10338, "text": "Is it really the case that that can be thought about in some, you know, without DNA, when people were describing, you know, genetic phenomena, there were, you know, dominant recessive, this, that and the other got very, very complicated."}, {"time": 10349, "text": "And then people realize, oh, it's just, you know, and what is a gene and so on and so on and so on."}, {"time": 10353, "text": "Then people realize it's just base pairs."}, {"time": 10358, "text": "And there's this digital representation."}, {"time": 10358, "text": "And so the question is, what is the overarching representation that we can now start to think about using a molecular biology?"}, {"time": 10367, "text": "I don't know how this will work out."}, {"time": 10367, "text": "And this is again, one of these things where, and the place where that gets important is, you know, maybe molecular biology is doing molecular computing by using some dynamic process that is something where it is very happily saying, oh, I just got a result."},

these things are, I don't know, it's for me, it's like, I've not really, that was not a view."}, {"time": 10410, "text": "I mean, I've thought about molecular computing for ages and ages and ages."}, {"time": 10414, "text": "And I've always imagined that the big story is kind of the original promise of nanotechnology of like, can we make a molecular scale constructor that will just build a molecule in any shape?"}, {"time": 10425, "text": "I don't think I'm now increasingly concluding that's not the big point."}, {"time": 10425, "text": "The big point is something more dynamic."},

molecular computing that's really working is us biological organisms."}, {"time": 10440, "text": "And, you know, maybe the thing that's important there is not this, you know, what chemicals do you make, so to speak, but more this kind of dynamic process."}, {"time": 10450, "text": "The dynamic process."}, {"time": 10450, "text": "And then you can have a good model like the hypergraph to then explore what, like simulate again, make predictions."}, {"time": 10455, "text": "And if they, I think just have a way to reason about biology."}, {"time": 10462, "text": "I mean, it's hard, you know,

that's really striking about that is that means, you know, including the whole sort of technology stack I built around that's about 40 years old."}, {"time": 10770, "text": "And that means it's a significant fraction of the total age of the computer industry."}, {"time": 10774, "text": "And it's I mean, I think it's cool that we can still run, you know, Mathematica version one programs today and so on."}, {"time": 10779, "text": "And we've sort of maintained compatibility."}, {"time": 10784, "text": "And we've been just building this big tower all those years of just more and more and more computational capabilities."}, {"time": 10789, "text": "We just made this this picture of kind of the different kind of threads of of of computational content, of, you know, mathematical content and and, you know, all sorts of things with, you know, data and graphs and whatever else."}, {"time": 10805, "text": "And what you see in this picture is about the first 10 years."}, {"time": 10805, "text": "It's kind of like it's just a few threads."}, {"time": 10810, "text": "And then then about maybe 15, 20 years ago, it kind of explodes in this whole collection, different threads of all these different capabilities that are now part of open language and representing different things in the world."}, {"time": 10820, "text": "But the thing that was super lucky in some sense is it's all based on one idea."}, {"time": 10825, "text": "It's all based on the idea of symbolic expressions and transformation rules for symbolic expressions, which was kind of what I originally put into this SMP system back in 1979 that was a predecessor of the whole open language stack."}, {"time": 10842, "text": "So that idea was an idea that I got from sort of trying to understand mathematical logic and so on."}, {"time": 10848, "text": "It was my attempt to kind of make a general human comprehensible model of computation of just everything is a symbolic expression."}, {"time": 10854, "text": "And all you do is transform symbolic expressions."}, {"time": 10860, "text": "And, you know, in in retrospect, I was very lucky that I understood as little as I understood then, because had I understood more, I would have been completely freaked out about all the different ways that that kind of model can can fail."}, {"time": 10871, "text": "Because what do you do when you have a symbolic expression, you make transformations for symbolic expressions?"}, {"time": 10877, "text": "Well, for example, one question is, there may be many transformations that could be made in a very multi computational kind of way."}, {"time": 10886, "text": "But what we're doing is picking, we're using the first transformation that applies."}, {"time": 10890, "text": "And we keep doing that until we reach a fixed point."}, {"time": 10890, "text": "And that's the result."}, {"time": 10890, "text": "And that's kind of a very, it's kind of a way of sort of sliding around the edge of multi computation."}, {"time": 10902, "text": "And back when I was working on SMP and things, I actually thought about these questions about about how, you know, how, what determines the this kind of evaluation path."}, {"time": 10906, "text": "So for example, you know, you work out Fibonacci, you know, Fibonacci is a recursive thing, f of n is f of n minus one plus f of n minus two, and you get this whole tree of recursion,

one side?"}, {"time": 10926, "text": "Do you do it breadth first, where you're kind of collecting the terms together, where you know that, you know, f of eight plus f of seven, f of seven, plus f of six, you can collect the f of sevens, and so on."}, {"time": 10934, "text": "These are, you know, I didn't realize that at the time, it's kind of funny, I was working on on gauge field theories back in 1979."}, {"time": 10945, "text": "And I was also working on the evaluation model in SMP."}, {"time": 10945, "text": "And they're the same problem."}, {"time": 10945, "text": "But it took me 40 more years to realize that."}, {"time": 10951, "text": "And this question about how you do this sort of evaluation front, that's a question of reference frames."}, {"time": 10957, "text": "It's a question of kind of the story of I mean, that that's, that is basically this question of, in what order is the universe evaluated?"}, {"time": 10968, "text": "And that's, and so what you realize is, there's this whole sort of world of different kinds of computation that you can do, sort of multi computationally."}, {"time": 10972, "text": "And that's a, that's an interesting thing."}, {"time": 10977,

and this is not what we're doing with Cardano, but but this is a different thing."}, {"time": 10986, "text": "The this is something where one of the questions is, when you have, in a sense, blockchain is a deeply sequentialized story of time."}, {"time": 10999, "text": "Because in blockchain, there's just one copy of the ledger."}, {"time": 10999, "text": "And you're saying, this is what happened, you know, time has progressed in this way."}, {"time": 11006, "text": "And there are little things around the edges, as you try and reach consensus and so on."}, {"time": 11009, "text": "And, and, you know, actually, we just recently, we've had this little conference we organized about the theory of distributed consensus, because I realized that a bunch of interesting things that some of our science can tell one about that."}, {"time": 11024, "text": "But that's a different let's let's not go down that that part."}, {"time": 11024, "text": "Yeah, but distributed consensus that still has a sequential there's like, there's still sequentiality."}, {"time": 11031, "text": "So don't tell me you're thinking through like how to apply multi computation to blockchain."}, {"time": 11037, "text": "And so so that becomes a story of, you know, instead of transactions all having to settle in one ledger, it's like a story of all these different ledgers."}, {"time": 11044, "text": "And they all have to have some ultimate consistency, which is what causal invariance would give one, but it can take a while."}, {"time": 11055, "text": "And the it can take a while is kind of like quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 11055, "text": "So it's kind of what's happening is there these different paths of history that correspond to, you know, in one path of history, you got paid this amount in another path of history, you got paid this amount."}, {"time": 11065, "text": "In the end, the universe will always become consistent."}, {"time": 11069, "text": "Now, now the way it will it works is, okay, it's a little bit more complicated than that."}, {"time": 11076, "text": "What happens is, the way space is knitted together in our theory of physics is through all these events."}, {"time": 11080, "text": "And the the idea is that the way that economic space is knitted together is between is there these autonomous events that essentially knit together economic space."}, {"time": 11092, "text": "So there are all these threads of transactions that are happening."}, {"time": 11097, "text": "And the question is, can they be made consistent?"}, {"time": 11097, "text": "Are there is there something forcing them to be sort of a consistent fabric of economic reality?"}, {"time": 11101, "text": "And sort of what this has led me to is trying to realize how does economics fundamentally work?"}, {"time": 11108, "text": "And, you know, what is economics?"}, {"time": 11108, "text": "And, you know, what what are the atoms of economics, so to speak?"}, {"time": 11114, "text": "And so what I've kind of realized is that, that sort of the perhaps I don't even know if this is right yet, there's sort of events in economics, the transactions, there are states of agents that are kind of the atoms of economics."}, {"time": 11125, "text": "And then transactions are kind of agents transact in some transact in some way, and that's an event."}, {"time": 11132, "text": "And then the question is, how do you knit together sort of economic space from that?"}, {"time": 11138, "text": "What is there in economic space?"}, {"time": 11143, "text": "Well, all these transactions, there's a whole complicated collection of possible transactions."}, {"time": 11148, "text": "But one thing that's true about economics is we tend to have the notion of a definite value for things."}, {"time": 11152, "text": "We could imagine that, you know, you buy a cookie from somebody, and they want to get a movie ticket."}, {"time": 11162, "text": "And there is some way that AI bots could make some path from the cookie to the movie ticket by all these different intermediate transactions."}, {"time": 11169, "text": "But in fact, we have an approximation to that, which is we say they each have a dollar value."}, {"time": 11176, "text": "And we have this kind of numeraire concept of there's just a way of kind of taking this whole complicated space of transactions and parsing it in something which is a kind of a simplified thing that is kind of like our parsing of physical space."}, {"time": 11194, "text": "And so my guess is that the yet again, I mean, it's crazy that all these things are so connected."}, {"time": 11201, "text": "This is another multi computation story."}, {"time": 11201, "text": "Another story of where what's happening is that the economic consciousness, the economic observer is not going to deal with all of those are different microscopic transactions."}, {"time": 11214, "text": "They're just going to parse the whole thing by saying, there's this value, it's a number."}, {"time": 11217, "text": "And that's their understanding of their summary of this economic network."}, {"time": 11223, "text": "And there will be all kinds of things like there are all kinds of arbitrage opportunities, which are kind of like the quantum effects in this whole thing."}, {"time": 11227, "text": "And that's in places where there's sort of different paths that can be followed and so on."}, {"time": 11234, "text": "So the question is, can one make a sort of global theory of economics?"}, {"time": 11241, "text": "And then my test case is again, what is time dilation in economics?"}, {"time": 11247, "text": "And I know if you imagine a very agricultural economics where people are growing lettuces and fields and things like this, and you ask questions about, well, if you're transporting lettuces to different places, what is the value of the lettuces after you have to transport them versus if you're just sitting in one place and selling them, you can kind of get a little bit of an analogy there."}, {"time": 11267, "text": "But I think there's a better and more complete analogy."}, {"time": 11271, "text": "And that's the question of, is there a theory like general relativity that is a global theory of economics?"}, {"time": 11276, "text": "And is it about something we care about?"}, {"time": 11276, "text": "It could be that there is a global theory, but it's about a feature of economic reality that isn't important to us."}, {"time": 11285, "text": "Now, another part of the story is, can one use those ideas to make essentially a distributed blockchain, a distributed generalization of blockchain, kind of the quantum analog of money, so to speak, where you have, for example, you can have uncertainty relations where you're saying, you know, well, if I insist on knowing my bank account right now, there'll be some uncertainty."}, {"time": 11307, "text": "If I'm prepared to wait a while, then it'll be much more certain."}, {"time": 11307, "text": "And so there's, you know, is there a way of using and so we've made a bunch of prototypes of this, which I'm not yet happy with."}, {"time": 11319, "text": "But what I realized is, to really understand these prototypes, I actually have to have a foundational theory of economics."}, {"time": 11323, "text": "And so that's kind of a, you know, it may be that we could deploy one of these prototypes as a practical system."}, {"time": 11328, "text": "But I think it's really going to be much better if we actually have an understanding of how this plugs into kind of the economics."},

mean, you know, how there emerge sort of laws of economics, I don't even know."}, {"time": 11348, "text": "And I've been asking friends of mine who are economists and things, what is economics?"},

what kind of a theory is it?"}, {"time": 11357, "text": "Is it a theory, you know, what kind of thinking?"}, {"time": 11362, "text": "It's like in biology, in evolutionary biology, for example, there's a certain pattern of thinking that goes on in evolutionary biology where if you're a, you know, a good evolutionary biologist, somebody says, that creature has a weird horn."}, {"time": 11376, "text": "And they'll say, well, that's because this and this and this and the selection of this kind and that kind."}, {"time": 11381, "text": "And that's the story."}, {"time": 11381, "text": "And it's not a mathematical story."}, {"time": 11381, "text": "It's a story of a different type of thinking about these things."}, {"time": 11386, "text": "By the way, evolutionary biology is yet another place where it looks like this multi computational idea can be applied."}, {"time": 11392, "text": "And that's where maybe speciation is related to things like event horizons."}, {"time": 11398,

understanding of our reality."}, {"time": 11409, "text": "So it could be the biology, the chemistry, at the physics level, the economics."}, {"time": 11415, "text": "And you could potentially, the thing is, it's like, okay, sure, at all these levels, it might rhyme."}, {"time": 11424, "text": "It might make sense as a model."}, {"time": 11424, "text": "The question is, can you make useful predictions as one of these levels?"}, {"time": 11428, "text": "And that's really a question of, you know, it's a weird situation because the situation where the model probably has definite consequences."}, {"time": 11440, "text": "The question is, are they consequences we care about?"}, {"time": 11440, "text": "And that's some, you know, and so in the case of, in the economic case, the,

a different direction."}, {"time": 11467, "text": "And it has to do with this computational language that we built to describe the world that knows about, you know, different kinds of cookies and knows about different cities and knows about how to compute all these kinds of things."}, {"time": 11475, "text": "One of the things that is of interest is if you want to run the world, you need, you know, with contracts and laws and rules and so on, there are rules at a human level and there are kind of things like, and so this gets one into the idea of computational contracts."}, {"time": 11493,

there's a little bit of slowing down of some of this Cambrian explosion that's happening is a project I've been meaning to really do for a long time, which is what I'm calling a symbolic discourse language."}, {"time": 11549, "text": "It's just finishing the job of being able to represent everything like the conversation we're having in computational terms."}, {"time": 11554, "text": "And one of the use cases for that is computational contracts."}, {"time": 11560, "text": "Another use case is something like the constitution that says what the AIs, what we want the AIs to do."}, {"time": 11565, "text": "So, but this is useful."}, {"time": 11565, "text": "So you're saying, so these are like, you're saying computational contracts, but smart contracts."}, {"time": 11570, "text": "This is what's in the domain of cryptocurrency is known as smart contracts."}, {"time": 11575, "text": "And so the language you've developed, this symbolic or seek to further develop symbolic discourse

things happening on the blockchain."}, {"time": 11596, "text": "And sometimes they have oracles."}, {"time": 11596, "text": "And in fact, our Wolfman Alpha API is the main thing people use to get

we realized, people were using Wolfram Alpha as the oracle for smart contracts, so to speak."}, {"time": 11617, "text": "And so that got us interested in blockchains in general."}, {"time": 11623,

computational language."}, {"time": 11675, "text": "Then ultimately, it's kind of like, how do you run the world with code?"}, {"time": 11680, "text": "That is, how do you write sort of all these things which are right now, regulations and laws and contracts and things in computational language?"}, {"time": 11685, "text": "And kind of the ultimate vision is that sort of something happens in the world, and then there's this giant domino effect of all these computational contracts that trigger based on the thing that happened."}, {"time": 11695, "text": "And there's a whole story to that."}, {"time": 11700, "text": "And of course, I like to always pay attention to the latest things that are going on."}, {"time": 11706, "text": "And I really, I kind of like blockchain because it's another rethinking of kind of computation."}, {"time": 11711, "text": "It's kind of like cloud computing was a little bit of that, of sort of persistent kind of computational resources and so on."},

compute."}, {"time": 11728, "text": "The idea that you lodge kind of these autonomous lumps of computation out there in the blockchain world."}, {"time": 11733, "text": "And one of the things that just sort of for fun, so to speak, is we've been doing a bit of stuff with NFTs, and we just did some NFTs on Cardano, and we'll be doing some more."}, {"time": 11744, "text": "And we did some cellular automaton NFTs on Cardano, which people seem to like quite a bit."}, {"time": 11748, "text": "And one of the things I've realized about NFTs is that there's kind of this notion, and we're really working on this, I like recording stuff."}, {"time": 11761, "text": "You know, one of the things that's come out of kind of my science, I suppose, is this history matters type story of, you know, it's not just the current state, it's the history that matters."}, {"time": 11771, "text": "And I've kind of, I don't think this is actually realizing, maybe it's not coincidental that I'm sort of the human who's recorded more about themselves than anybody else."}, {"time": 11777, "text": "And then I end up with these science results that say history matters, which was not those things."},

and having sort of a permanent record of things, one of the things that's kind of interesting there is, you know, you put up a website and it's got a bunch of stuff on it, but you know, you have to keep paying the hosting fees or the thing's going to go away."}, {"time": 11803, "text": "But one of the things about blockchain is quite interesting is if you put something on a blockchain and you pay, you know, your commission to get that thing, you know, put on, you know, mine, put on the blockchain, then in a sense, everybody who comes after you is, you know, they are motivated to keep your thing alive because that's what keeps the consistency of the blockchain."}, {"time": 11824, "text": "So in a sense with sort of the NFT world, it's kind of like if you want to have something permanent, well, at least for the life of the blockchain, but even if the blockchain goes out of circulation, so to speak, there's going to be enough value in that whole collection of transactions that people are going to archive the thing."}, {"time": 11838, "text": "But that means that, you know, pay once and you're kind of, you're lodged in the blockchain forever."}, {"time": 11843, "text":

know, it's the opposite of the Snapchat view of the world."}, {"time": 11861, "text": "There's a permanence to it that's heavily incentivized and thereby you can have a permanence of history."},

about this kind of physics inspired distributed blockchain, obviously, there, the sort of the proof that it works, that there are no double spends, there's no whatever else, that proof becomes a very formal kind of almost a matter of physics, so to speak."}, {"time": 11900, "text": "And, you know, it's been it's been an interesting thing for the for the practical blockchains to do kind of actual

to."}, {"time": 11914, "text": "But I think it's a challenging thing because basically, the point is one of the one of the things about proving correctness of something as well."}, {"time": 11919,

correct means."}, {"time": 11927, "text": "I mean, it's it's kind of like then you have to have another language."}, {"time": 11931, "text": "And people are very confused back in past decades of, you

correctness, we just mean it can't crash or it can't scribble on memory."}, {"time": 11946, "text": "But but the thing is that there's this complicated trade off, because as soon as there's as soon as
