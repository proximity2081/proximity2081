greater power than he did."}, {"time": 336, "text": "And in fact, he didn't take that option."}, {"time": 340, "text": "He was more interested in seeing institutionalization, of seeing the country develop strong institutions rather than an individual leader like himself have excess power."}, {"time": 354, "text": "So that's very important."}, {"time": 356, "text": "So like I said, not everyone craves unconstrained power, even if they're very ambitious."}, {"time": 361, "text": "And of course, Washington was very ambitious."}, {"time": 363, "text": "He was a successful general before he was a president."}, {"time": 368, "text": "So that clearly comes from the influences on your life, where you grow up, how you grow up, how you raised, what kind of values are imparted to you along the way."}, {"time": 380, "text": "You can understand power as the ability to share, or you can understand or the ability to advance something for the collective in a collective process, not an individual process."}, {"time": 394, "text": "So power comes in many different varieties."}, {"time": 398, "text": "And ambition doesn't always equate to despotic power."}, {"time": 403, "text": "Right power is something different from ordinary institutional power that we see."}, {"time": 411, "text": "The president of MIT does not have unconstrained power."}, {"time": 415, "text": "The president of MIT rightly must consult with other members of the administration, with the faculty members, to a certain extent with the student body and certainly with the trustees of MIT."}, {"time": 430, "text": "Those constraints make the institution strong and enduring and make the decisions better than they would be if he had unconstrained power."}, {"time": 441, "text": "But you can't say that the president is not ambitious."}, {"time": 444, "text": "Of course, the president is ambitious."}, {"time": 447, "text": "We worry about unconstrained power."}, {"time": 449, "text": "We worry about executive authority that's not limited."}, {"time": 453, "text": "That's the definition of authoritarianism or tyranny."}, {"time": 457, "text": "Unlimited or barely limited executive authority."}, {"time": 462, "text": "Executive authority is necessary to carry out many functions."}, {"time": 466, "text": "We all understand that."}, {"time": 467, "text": "That's why MIT has an executive, has a president."}, {"time": 471, "text": "But unlimited or largely unconstrained executive power is detrimental to even the person who exercises that power."}, {"time": 482, "text": "So what do you think?"}, {"time": 484, "text": "It's an interesting notion."}, {"time": 486, "text": "We kind of take it for granted that constraints on executive power is a good thing."}, {"time": 491, "text": "But why is that necessarily true?"}, {"time": 494, "text": "So what is it about absolute power that does something bad to the human mind?"}, {"time": 501, "text": "So you know, the popular saying of absolute power corrupts absolutely."}, {"time": 507, "text": "Is that the case?"}, {"time": 508, "text": "That the power in itself is the thing that corrupts the mind in some kind of way where it leads to a bad leadership over time?"}, {"time": 519, "text": "People make more mistakes when they're not challenged."}, {"time": 522, "text": "When they don't have to explain things and get others to vote and go along with it."}, {"time": 528, "text": "When they can make a decision without anybody being able to block their decision or to have input necessarily on their decision."}, {"time": 537, "text": "You're more prone to mistakes."}, {"time": 539, "text": "You're more prone to extremism."}, {"time": 542, "text": "There's a temptation there."}, {"time": 544, "text": "For example, we have separation of powers in the United States."}, {"time": 548, "text": "The Congress, right, has authority that the president doesn't have."}, {"time": 555, "text": "As for example, in budgeting, the so called power of the purse."}, {"time": 559, "text": "This can be very frustrating."}, {"time": 561, "text": "People want to see things happen and they complain that there's a do nothing Congress or that the situation is stalemated."}, {"time": 570, "text": "But actually that's potentially a good thing."}, {"time": 573, "text": "In fact, that's how our system was designed."}, {"time": 577, "text": "Our system was designed to prevent things happening in government."}, {"time": 582, "text": "And there's frustration with that, but ultimately that's the strength of the institutions we have."}, {"time": 588, "text": "And so when you see unconstrained executive authority, there can be a lot of dynamism."}, {"time": 594, "text": "A lot of things can get done quickly."}, {"time": 597, "text": "But those things can be like, for example, what happened in China under Mao or what happened in the Soviet Union under Stalin or what happened in Haiti under Papa Doc and then Baby Doc or fill in the blank, right?"}, {"time": 610, "text": "What happens sometimes in corporations where a corporate leader is not constrained by the shareholders, by the board or by anything."}, {"time": 621, "text": "And they can seem to be a genius for a while, but eventually it catches up to them."}, {"time": 626, "text": "And so the idea of constraints on executive power is absolutely fundamental to the American system, American way of thinking."}, {"time": 635, "text": "And not only America, obviously large other parts of the world that have a similar system, not an identical system, but a similar system of checks and balances on executive power."}, {"time": 648, "text": "And so the case that I study, the only checks and balances on executive power are circumstantial."}, {"time": 656, "text": "So for example, distances in the country, it's hard to do something over 5,000 miles or the amount of time in a day, it's hard for a leader to get to every single thing the leader wants to get to because there are only 24 hours in a day."}, {"time": 673, "text": "Those are circumstantial constraints on executive power."}, {"time": 676, "text": "They're not institutional constraints on executive power."}, {"time": 680, "text": "One of the constraints on executive power that United States has versus Russia, maybe something you've implied and actually spoke directly to is there's something in the Russian people and the Soviet people that are attracted to authoritarian power, psychologically speaking, or at least the kind of leaders that sought authoritarian power throughout its history."}, {"time": 705, "text": "And that desire for that kind of human is a lack of a constraint."}, {"time": 711, "text": "In America, it seems as people, we desire somebody not like Stalin, somebody more like George Washington."}, {"time": 719, "text": "So that's another constraint, the belief of the people, what they admire in a leader, what they seek in a leader."}, {"time": 726, "text": "So maybe you can speak to, well, first of all, can you speak briefly to that psychology of, is there a difference between the Russian people and the American people in terms of just what we find attractive in a leader?"}, {"time": 744, "text": "Not as great a difference as it might seem."}, {"time": 747, "text": "There are unfortunately many Americans who would be happy with an authoritarian leader in the country."}, {"time": 755, "text": "It's by no means a majority."}, {"time": 758, "text": "It's not even a plurality, but nonetheless, it's a real sentiment in the population."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Sometimes because they feel frustrated because things are not getting done."}, {"time": 768, "text": "Sometimes because they're against something that's happening in the political realm and they feel it has to be corrected and corrected quickly."}, {"time": 777, "text": "It's a kind of impulse."}, {"time": 779, "text": "People can regret the impulse later on, that the impulse is motivated by reaction to their environment."}, {"time": 787, "text": "In the Russian case, we have also people who crave, sometimes known as a strong hand, an iron hand, an authoritarian leader, because they want things to be done and be done more quickly that align with their desires."}, {"time": 803, "text": "But I'm not sure it's a majority in the country today."}, {"time": 808, "text": "Certainly in Stalin's time, this was a widespread sentiment and people had few alternatives that they understood or could appeal to."}, {"time": 817, "text": "Nowadays in the globalized world, the citizens of Russia can see how other systems have constraints on executive power and the life isn't so bad there."}, {"time": 827, "text": "In fact, the life might even be better."}, {"time": 830, "text": "So the impatience, the impulsive quality, the frustration does sometimes in people reinforce their craving for the unconstrained executive to quote, get things done or shake things up."}, {"time": 846, "text": "Yes, that's true."}, {"time": 848, "text": "But in the Russian case, I'm not sure it's cultural today."}, {"time": 852, "text": "I think it might be more having to do with the failures, the functional failures of the kind of political system that they tried to institute after the Soviet collapse."}, {"time": 867, "text": "And so it may be frustration with the version of constraints on executive power they got and how it didn't work the way it was imagined, which has led to a sense in which nonconstrained executive power could fix things."}, {"time": 885, "text": "But I'm not sure that that's a majority sentiment in the Russian case, although it's hard to measure because under authoritarian regimes, a public opinion is shaped by the environment in which people live, which is very constrained in terms of public opinion."}, {"time": 904, "text": "But on that point, why at least from a distance does there seem to nevertheless be support for the current Russian president Vladimir Putin?"}, {"time": 915, "text": "Is that have to do with the fact that measuring, getting good metrics and statistics on support is difficult in authoritarian governments, or is there still something appealing to that kind of power to the people?"}, {"time": 930, "text": "I think we have to give credit to President Putin for understanding the psychology of the Russians to whom he appeals."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Many of them were the losers in the transition from communism."}, {"time": 946, "text": "They were the ones whose pensions were destroyed by inflation or whose salaries didn't go up or whose regions were abandoned."}, {"time": 955, "text": "They were not the winners for the most part, and so I think there's an understanding on his part of their psychology."}, {"time": 962, "text": "Putin has grown in the position."}, {"time": 964, "text": "He was not a public politician when he first started out."}, {"time": 968, "text": "He was quite poor in public settings."}, {"time": 970, "text": "He didn't have the kind of political instincts that he has now."}, {"time": 974, "text": "He didn't have the appeal to traditional values and the Orthodox Church and some of the other dimensions of his rule today."}, {"time": 984, "text": "So yes, we have to give some credit to Putin himself for this in addition to the frustrations and the mass of the people."}, {"time": 994, "text": "But let's think about it this way in addition, without taking away the fact that he's become a better retail politician over time and that sentiment has shifted because of the disappointments with the transition with the population."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "When I ask my kids, am I a good dad?"}, {"time": 1017, "text": "My kids don't have any other dad to measure me against."}, {"time": 1021, "text": "I'm the only dad they know, and I'm the only dad they can choose or not choose."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "If they don't choose me, they still get me as dad, right?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "So with Putin today, he's the only dad that the Russian people have."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "Now, if my kids were introduced to alternative fathers, they might be better than me."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "They might be more loving, more giving, funnier, richer, whatever it might be."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "They might be more appealing."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "There are some blood ties there for sure that I have with my kids, but they would at least be able to choose alternatives and then I would have to win their favor in that constellation of alternatives."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "If President Putin were up against real alternatives, if the population had real choice and that choice could express itself and have resources and have media and everything else the way he does, maybe he would be very popular and maybe his popularity would not be as great as it currently is."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "So the absence of alternatives is another factor that reinforces his authority and his popularity."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "Having said that, there are many authoritarian leaders who deny any alternatives to the population and are not very popular."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "So denial of alternatives doesn't guarantee you the popularity."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "You still have to figure out the mass psychology and be able to appeal to it."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "So in the Russian case, the winners from the transition live primarily in the big cities and are self employed or entrepreneurial."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Even if they're not self employed, they're able to change careers."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "They have tremendous skills and talent and education and knowledge as well as these entrepreneurial or dynamic personalities."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "Putin also appealed to them."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "He did that with Medvedev and it was a very clever ruse."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "He himself appealed to the losers from the transition, the small towns, the rural, the people who were not well off and he had them for the most part."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Not all."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "We don't want to generalize to say that he had every one of them because those people have views of their own, sometimes in contradiction with the president of Russia."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "And then he appealed to the opposite people, the successful urban base through the so called reformer Medvedev, the new generation, the technically literate prime minister who for a time was president."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "And so that worked very successfully for Putin."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "He was able to bridge a big divide in the society and gain a greater mass support than he would otherwise have had by himself."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "That ruse only worked through the time that Medvedev was temporarily president for a few years because of the Constitution, Putin couldn't do three consecutive terms and stepped aside in what they call castling in chess."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "When this was over, Putin had difficulty with his popularity."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "There were mass protests in the urban areas, precisely that group of the population that he had been able to win in part because of the Medvedev castling and now had had their delusions exposed and were disillusioned, and there were these mass protests in the urban areas, not just in the capital, by the way."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "And Putin had to, as it were, come up with a new way to fix his popularity, which happened to be the annexation of Crimea, from which he got a very significant bump."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "However, the trend is back in the other direction."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "It's diminishing again, although it's still high relative to other leaders around the world."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "So I wouldn't say that he's unpopular with the mass in Russia."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "There is some popularity there, there is some success, but I would say it's tough for us to gauge because of the lack of alternatives."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "And Putin is unpopular inside the state administration."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "At every level, the bureaucracy of the leadership."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "Because those people are well informed, and they understand that the country is declining, that the human capital is declining, the infrastructure is declining, the economy is not really growing, it's not really diversifying, Russia's not investing in its future."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "The state officials understand all of that, and then they see that the Putin clique is stealing everything in sight."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "So between the failure to invest in a future and the corruption of a narrow group around the president, there's disillusionment in the state apparatus because they see this more clearly or more closely than the mass of the population."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "They can't necessarily yet oppose this in public because they're people, they have families, they have careers, they have children who want to go to school or want a job."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "And so there are constraints on their ability to oppose the regime based upon what we might call cowardice or other people might call realism."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "I don't know how courageous people can be when their family, children, career are on the line."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "So it's very interesting dynamic to see the disillusionment inside the government with the president, which is not yet fully public for the most part, but could become public."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "And once again, if there's an alternative, if an alternative appears, things could shift quickly."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "And that alternative could come from inside the regime."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "From inside the regime."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "But the leadership, the party, the people that are now, as you're saying, opposed to Putin, nevertheless, maybe you can correct me, but it feels like there's, structurally is deeply corrupt."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "So each of the people we're talking about are, don't feel like a George Washington."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Once again, the circumstances don't permit them to act that way necessarily, right?"}, {"time": 1433, "text": "George Washington did great things, but in certain circumstances."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "A lot of the state officials in Russia for certain are corrupt."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Many of them, however, are patriotic and many of them feel badly about where the country has been going."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "They would prefer that the country was less corrupt."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "They would prefer that there were greater investment in all sorts of areas of Russia."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "They might even themselves steal less if they could be guaranteed that everybody else would steal less."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "There's a deep and abiding patriotism inside Russia, as well as inside the Russian regime."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "So they understand that Putin in many ways rescued the Russian state from the chaos of the 1990s."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "They understand that Russia was in very bad shape as an incoherent failing state almost when Putin took over and that he did some important things for Russia's stability and consolidation."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "There's also some appreciation that Putin stood up to the West and stood up to more powerful countries and regained a sense of pride and maneuverability for Russia in the international system."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "People appreciate that and it's real."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "It's not imagined that Putin accomplished that."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "The problem is the methods that he accomplished it with."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "He used the kind of methods, that is to say, taking other people's property, putting other people in jail for political reasons."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "He used the kind of methods that are not conducive to long term growth and stability."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "So he fixed the problem, but he fixed the problem and then created even bigger long term problems potentially."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "And moreover, all authoritarian regimes that use those methods are tempted to keep using them and using them and using them until they're the only ones who are the beneficiaries and the group narrows and narrows."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "The elite gets smaller and narrower."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "The interest groups get excluded from power and their ability to continue enjoying the fruits of the system and the resentment grows."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "And so that's the situation we have in Russia is a place that is stuck."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "It was to a certain extent rescued."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "It was rescued with methods that were not conducive to long term success and stability."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "The rescue you're referring to is the sort of the economic growth when Putin first took office."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "Yes, they had 10 years."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "They had a full decade of an average of 7% growth a year, which was phenomenal and is not attributable predominantly to oil prices."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "During President Putin's first term as president, the average price of oil was $35 a barrel."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "During his second term as president, the average price was $70 a barrel."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So during those two terms, when Russia was growing at about 7% a year, oil prices were averaging somewhere around $50 a barrel, which is fine, but is not the reason because later on when oil prices were over $100 a barrel, Russia stagnated."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "So the initial growth, do you think Putin deserves some credit for that?"}, {"time": 1654, "text": "Yes, he does because he introduced some important liberalizing measures."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "He lowered taxes."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "He allowed land to be bought and sold."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "He deregulated many areas of the economy."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "And so there was a kind of entrepreneurial burst that was partly attributable, partly attributable to government policy during his first term."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "But also he was consolidating political power."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "And as I said, the methods he used overall for the long term were not able to continue sustain that success."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "In addition, we have to remember that China played a really big role in the success of Russia in the first two terms of Putin's presidency because China's phenomenal growth created insatiable demand for just about everything that the Soviet Union used to produce."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "So fertilizers, cement, fill in the blank, chemicals, metals, China had insatiable demand for everything the Soviet Union once produced."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "And so China's raising of global demand overall brought Soviet era industry back from the dead."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "And so there was something that happened."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "Soviet era industry fell off a cliff in the 1990s."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "There was a decline in manufacturing and industrial production greater than in the Great Depression in the US."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "But a lot of that came back online in the 2000s."}, {"time": 1761, "text": "And that had to do with China's phenomenal growth."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "The trade between China and Russia was not always direct."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "So this was an indirect effect."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "But raising global prices for the commodities and the products, the kind of lower end, lower value products in manufacturing, not high end stuff, but lower end stuff like steel or iron or cement or fertilizer, where the value added is not spectacular, but nonetheless, which had been destroyed by the 1990s and after the Soviet collapse, this was brought back to life."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "Now, you can do that once."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "You can bring Soviet era industry back to life once."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "And that happened during Putin's first two terms, in addition to the liberalizing policies, which spurred entrepreneurialism in some small and medium business."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "The crash of the ruble in 1998, which made Russian products much cheaper abroad and made imports much more expensive, also facilitated the resuscitation, the revival of domestic manufacturing."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "So all of this came together for that spectacular 10 year, 7% on average economic growth."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "And moreover, people's wages after inflation, their disposable income grew more even than GDP grew."}, {"time": 1852, "text": "So disposable income after inflation, that is real income, was growing greater than 7%."}, {"time": 1859, "text": "In some cases, 10% a year."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "So there was a boom, and the Russian people felt it, and it happened during Putin's first two terms, and people were grateful, rightly so, for that."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "And those who don't want to give Putin credit, give oil prices all the credit."}, {"time": 1879, "text": "But I don't think that oil prices can explain this."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "Having said that, that doesn't mean that this was sustainable over the long term."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "So you've briefly mentioned, sort of implying the possibility, you know, Stalin held power for, let's say, 30 years."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "You briefly mentioned that as a question, will Putin be able to beat that record, to beat that?"}, {"time": 1906, "text": "So can you talk about your sense of, is it possible that Putin holds power for that kind of duration?"}, {"time": 1915, "text": "Let's hope not for Russia's sake."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "The primary victims of President Putin's power are Russians."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "They're not Ukrainians, although to a certain extent, Ukraine has suffered because of Putin's actions."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "And they're not Americans, they're Russians."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "Moreover, Russia has lost a great deal of human talent."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "Tens of millions of people have left Russia since 1991 overall."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "Somewhere between five and 10 million people have left the country and are beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So they left the Soviet space entirely."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "Moreover, the people who left are not the poor people."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "They're not the uneducated."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "They're not the losers."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "The people who've left are the more dynamic parts of the population."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "The better educated, the more entrepreneurial."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "So that human capital loss that Russia has suffered is phenomenal."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "And in fact, right here where we're sitting at MIT, we have examples of people who are qualified good enough for MIT and have left Russia to come to MIT."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "You're looking at one of them."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "And the other aspect, just to quickly comment, is those same people like me, I'm not welcome back."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "No, you're not under the current regime."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "It was a big loss for Russia if you're patriotic, but not from the point of view of the Putin regime."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "That has to do, also factors into popularity."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "If the people who don't like you leave, they're not there to complain, to protest, to vote against you."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "And so your opposition declines when you let them leave."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "However, it's very costly in human capital terms."}, {"time": 2029, "text": "Hemorrhaging that much human capital is damaging,
