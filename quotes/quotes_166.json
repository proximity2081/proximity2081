what do you think the world would look like if Tim Dillon was given absolute power?"}, {"time": 245, "text": "He seems like a person that's an interesting study of the corrupting effects of power."},

and educated as you wearing a suit."}, {"time": 259, "text": "Like cause you know, suits corrupt you."}, {"time": 261, "text": "You put that suit on, you start feeling that power."}, {"time": 262,

programs, not of people who are political dissidents, but of people who don't meet his food standard."}, {"time": 287, "text": "His cuisine standard is high and he's usually right."}, {"time": 290, "text": "Do you think power does corrupt people?"}, {"time": 293, "text": "Like one of the reasons we mentioned offline Joe Rogan, he's been an inspiration to me cause he gets, he gets, if you get power, just more famous and famous and yes, probably a bit of power in terms of influence and he's still pretty much the same guy."}, {"time": 307, "text": "I'm not sure that's going to be true for everybody."}, {"time": 309, "text": "Do you ever think, ask yourself that question?"}, {"time": 312, "text": "He's a rare breed."}, {"time": 313, "text": "He's like a benign king."}, {"time": 315, "text": "Most people I meet who are like really powerful are like douchebags and that's how they got there."}, {"time": 320, "text": "I think that's, psychopaths have the advantage because they don't have feelings and Joe's a rare example."}, {"time": 324, "text": "He's just a powerhouse of will and he, I do think about that."}, {"time": 330, "text": "I think I should be stopped right now."},

just reveals your darkest, you know, people aren't supposed to have anything they want."}, {"time": 344, "text": "You got to be able to struggle for everything."}, {"time": 345, "text": "So I would have a harem, I'd be like a Roman dictator."}, {"time": 349, "text": "I'd be like a Roman emperor."}, {"time": 350, "text": "I mean, people called them emperors."}, {"time": 351, "text": "They were dictators."}, {"time": 352, "text": "The most effective leaders are dictators."}, {"time": 353, "text": "I hope we get back to that."}, {"time": 355, "text": "Democracy hasn't worked."}, {"time": 356,

social workers can only get you so far."}, {"time": 367, "text": "You need action."}, {"time": 368, "text": "I was a social worker for five years and all you do is ask about medications and you don't solve anything."}, {"time": 375, "text": "I do ask myself of that, like, cause I'm more in the tech space of constructing systems that prevent me from being corrupt."}, {"time": 383, "text": "Cause right now I'm all about love and all about those kinds of things."}, {"time": 387, "text": "But I wonder, you said like, it just reveals the darkness."}, {"time": 391, "text": "The problem is we might not be aware of our own darkness."}, {"time": 395, "text": "I have the same feeling about money actually."}, {"time": 397, "text": "I've been avoiding thinking about money, like basically constructing my moral system, my moral compass around money."}, {"time": 406, "text": "It's like the moment I feel a little too happy about the idea of owning some cool shiny thing, I started to think, okay, I'm not going to own that shiny thing cause I'm afraid of the slippery slope of it."}, {"time": 421, "text": "You ever think about that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 423, "text": "The thing about the capitalist system is it puts sort of a profit motive above beauty."}, {"time": 431, "text": "And you notice when you see certain cities, especially in the old days where like buildings used to be beautiful and now they're just like boxes, they throw a kid up and it's just for all profit margin."}, {"time": 444, "text": "It's the illusion of permanence that, you know, it's like, oh, let me get as much money as I can."}, {"time": 448, "text": "You're like, yeah."}, {"time": 449, "text": "You know, my dad used to say, you know, everyone, it's a cliche, but you can't take it with you."}, {"time": 453, "text": "So it's kind of, it's, it's comical to me that we're here trying to get this infinite amount."}, {"time": 458, "text": "Like it's like Sisyphus, we're all trying to climb this hill, but I mean, the rock's going to fall on us."}, {"time": 462, "text": "So I think that's a healthy outlook."}, {"time": 465, "text": "My dad always used to say before he passed, you know, he would say, you can't, you have to survive not only physically, but you have to survive emotionally."}, {"time": 471, "text": "I think a lot of people forget about the emotional part of a survival."}, {"time": 476, "text": "You have to survive emotionally and humor and, and, and understanding reality in its objective context helps with that."}, {"time": 484, "text": "Accepting reality as this ephemeral thing that you're really just a part of, but not as significant as your ego wants you to believe is a, is a start."}, {"time": 495, "text": "That's a good foundation for surviving emotionally."}, {"time": 499, "text": "Surviving emotionally?"}, {"time": 500, "text": "Like what, what's an ideal life look like while you're thriving?"}, {"time": 503, "text": "You can't take things too seriously."}, {"time": 505, "text": "You can't, because they're ephemeral."}, {"time": 507, "text": "They're not permanent."}, {"time": 509, "text": "Your bank account's not permanent."}, {"time": 510, "text": "Your abilities aren't permanent."}, {"time": 515, "text": "Your memory's not permanent."}, {"time": 516, "text": "Your, your, your dick getting hard is not permanent."}, {"time": 518, "text": "Can I curse on this or is this go out to, yeah, you can curse to your heart's content."}, {"time": 525, "text": "I mean, gender's not even permanent anymore."}, {"time": 526, "text": "I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna change maybe and live my second half as another gender just to have, I'm bored with this gender."}, {"time": 531, "text": "So it's like nothing is permanent."}, {"time": 533, "text": "And so accepting that emotionally is a good start to being more flexible."}, {"time": 539, "text": "You gotta be flexible."}, {"time": 540, "text": "Like my dad used to say, anything too stiff snaps."}, {"time": 543, "text": "You gotta, you know, it's a cliche and people have said it a bunch of different ways, but Bruce Lee's right, man."}, {"time": 551, "text": "Bukowski has this quote about love, that love is a fog that fades with the first light of reality."}, {"time": 559, "text": "So he's, he's a romantic, that guy."}, {"time": 561, "text": "But that even love is a thing that just doesn't last very long."}, {"time": 566, "text": "Um, you know, some people would disagree with that."}, {"time": 568, "text": "Maybe it morphs, like, like, like water, it changes, right?"}, {"time": 572, "text": "It might not be, it might not be this, cause he's mostly just, uh, loved like prostitutes, I think."}, {"time": 578, "text": "So, The best kind of love."}, {"time": 581, "text": "No demand."}, {"time": 582, "text": "No, uh, responsibilities."}, {"time": 584, "text": "It's a financial transaction."}, {"time": 586, "text": "Uh, ephemeral as ever."}, {"time": 588, "text": "You mentioned your dad."}, {"time": 589, "text": "He passed away, uh, two, uh, a year and a half ago."}, {"time": 594, "text": "What did you learn from him?"}, {"time": 596, "text": "I love my dad."}, {"time": 597, "text": "My dad, I would say my dad was my, my hero."}, {"time": 600, "text": "He was just, uh, my dad really embodied those values and I think, um, for better or worse, it's made me who I am."}, {"time": 606, "text": "He's, he, uh, my dad was, was a painter, he was a lawyer, he was, uh, he was, uh, you know, a Lieutenant in the military."}, {"time": 617, "text": "Born and bred Brooklyn."}, {"time": 618, "text": "His dad, his dad, you know, uh, surprise owned a diner."}, {"time": 621, "text": "So that's, that's sort of the Greek passport."}, {"time": 624, "text": "That's the immigration passport for Greeks into America."}, {"time": 627, "text": "And, um, yeah, my dad played football."}, {"time": 629, "text": "He just, my dad did what he wanted."}, {"time": 631, "text": "He lived as he wanted at all costs and I think I got that from him for better or worse."}, {"time": 635, "text": "I think it's hurt me in my pursuits."}, {"time": 637, "text": "Uh, if you consider money and fame, uh, to be paramount, you know, I, I've always done what I wanted and if I stopped wanting to do it, I just stopped doing it."}, {"time": 647, "text": "I think I got that from my dad."}, {"time": 648, "text": "So maybe for better or worse, that's what I learned from him."}, {"time": 652, "text": "But that's a real currency, you know, feeling like you're in love with what you're doing when you're doing it, maybe perhaps that's worth more than money."}, {"time": 665, "text": "But I'm happy that, uh, he, he got 91 years."}, {"time": 668, "text": "It's very rare."}, {"time": 669, "text": "I mean, he smoked for 60 years."}, {"time": 672, "text": "Talk about like a guy who was an outlier and he smoked like 60 years, like packs."}, {"time": 676, "text": "I mean, and he didn't die from that."}, {"time": 679, "text": "He had a prostate cancer, which is the way men should go."}, {"time": 681, "text": "Your dick should give out."}, {"time": 682, "text": "It should start from the dick."}, {"time": 684, "text": "I mean, we focus so much of our life on the dick that that's the way that's a successful life and that's why every man eventually gets prostate cancer because that is the universe's way of saying like the thing you focused on the most is you put the most energy into is the thing that's spent and it's going to, your, your rotting is going to start there."}, {"time": 702, "text": "So that's a successful life and it just spread all over his body and he slowly died."}, {"time": 707, "text": "I was with him when he died and that meant a lot to me because me and my brother weren't talking at the time cause we're Greeks, we're, we're talking again, but that's how it is."}, {"time": 715, "text": "You got a few brothers, right?"}, {"time": 716, "text": "I got two brothers, but I wanted to make sure I was with him when he died and I got lucky and I was in the room with him when he died."}, {"time": 723, "text": "You were in the room with your brother and you weren't."}, {"time": 726, "text": "No, my brother wasn't there."}, {"time": 727, "text": "We were kind of doing shifts."}, {"time": 728, "text": "I was, I was there."}, {"time": 729, "text": "I spent the night, the dad, my, the night my dad died, he died in the early in the morning and I heard the death rattle last breath and it was just, I think it was, uh, I, he knew I was there and, uh, I think that just probably meant something to him and I'm just glad I was there."}, {"time": 745, "text": "Does that make you sad that, uh, life is ephemeral, like you said, that, that you die?"}, {"time": 751, "text": "What do you think about your own death?"}, {"time": 752, "text": "You meditate on that?"}, {"time": 753, "text": "I think it, I think the actual, if there is a point to life, it's to, um, hopefully not fear death, to accept reality."}, {"time": 764, "text": "I think so much goes awry in the human condition when we lose touch with reality."}, {"time": 770, "text": "Every, uh, political system that's led to mass murder and everything, I think because it's because the, the tenants of those political philosophies ended up being utopian."}, {"time": 782, "text": "They were detached from reality, detached from nature."}, {"time": 785, "text": "And so I think it's, it's very important to accept and acknowledge your own mortality."}, {"time": 791, "text": "I think it's the foundation for what makes a good person, a moral person, um, a contributing member of society because it's true."}, {"time": 798, "text": "True things should be the foundation of all things."}, {"time": 801, "text": "If, if, if what you believe is based on illusion, you're going to end up doing destruction."}, {"time": 806, "text": "Whether that destruction is on a scale of one to 10, you are going to be destructive because it's not real."}, {"time": 811, "text": "It's a fantasy."}, {"time": 812, "text": "It doesn't exist."}, {"time": 813, "text": "See, the thing is the truth is about, I don't think you can ever reach truth."}, {"time": 816, "text": "Truth is about like constantly digging and to push back on your idea that you should accept death."}, {"time": 821, "text": "I think the more honest response to death, so the least honest is to run away from it, create illusions that help you imagine that there's not a death."}, {"time": 831, "text": "Uh, the next is to accept it, but the real honest one is to fear it because I, I, I mean, I'm, I'm with, uh, Ernest Becker is a philosopher, uh, wrote a book called Denial of Death."}, {"time": 844, "text": "He says that the, like much of the human condition is based in the fear of mortality."}, {"time": 850, "text": "That we like, that's, that's the creative force of the human energy."}, {"time": 855, "text": "Like Freud said, do you want to sleep with your mother?"}, {"time": 857, "text": "He said, no, that's not what motivates you."}, {"time": 860, "text": "Maybe his mom wasn't hot though."}, {"time": 861, "text": "I mean, or he wasn't Greek because apparently at a poll, we found that we found that all things good and bad."}, {"time": 869, "text": "Thanks for that."}, {"time": 871, "text": "I just don't know if his mom was a looker or not."}, {"time": 872, "text": "I mean, I'd have to Google it."}, {"time": 875, "text": "I'll look up on Google images."}, {"time": 878, "text": "But I think the honest, as he says, the thing that we run away from is that there's a terror."}, {"time": 884, "text": "He calls it like terror."}, {"time": 885, "text": "Uh, there's something called terror management theory."}, {"time": 888, "text": "That's some philosophers after him followed on that we're basically trying to run away from this fear and acceptance is actually creating an illusion for yourself."}, {"time": 900, "text": "Like you can actually accept something as terrifying as this."}, {"time": 903, "text": "So he's more with the stoics, the stoic constantly meditate on their death."}, {"time": 907, "text": "I mean, they, what does that mean?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "I mean, it's kind of, it's, you know, acceptance of death isn't a thing you do like on a Monday and then you're done is a thing you constantly have to meditate on, like reminding yourself like this ride is over."}, {"time": 923, "text": "It could be over today."}, {"time": 925, "text": "And that's something you're, if you think about every single day, it gives you an appreciation of Woody Allen movies, at least it gives you appreciation of basically everything, including Woody Allen movies, which shows you how deep your appreciation for life could be."}, {"time": 939, "text": "I've actually haven't been following much about what Woody Allen's, but apparently he's been a troublemaker through most of his life."}, {"time": 947, "text": "He's yeah."}, {"time": 948, "text": "I mean, you know, he's caused a little bit of strife."}, {"time": 949, "text": "He's left a little, uh, yeah, he's left a little confusion in his wake for sure."}, {"time": 953, "text": "But I mean, you know, that's another one separate the art from the artist."}, {"time": 958, "text": "He's got, I mean, the guys will go down in history as the greatest he's made, I mean, maybe a year and they're all, you can always find something good about each movie, like the dialogue or whatever."}, {"time": 968, "text": "Um, I love what you're saying."}, {"time": 969, "text": "It's interesting, but the only thing I would say to push back a little bit since we're playing a little table tennis here is, um, I don't know if it's a choice to fear death."}, {"time": 977, "text": "That's more of an, it seems more instinctual."}, {"time": 979, "text": "It seems like something that nature wants you to do because I've been in positions where I thought I was going to die."}, {"time": 985, "text": "Like I've been shot and I had those moments and then nature also, uh, you know, kicks in an instinct, which is acceptance where you kind of, I don't know, it's a chemical release or whatever."}, {"time": 997, "text": "I don't know, you know, we're all, we're robots basically."}, {"time": 999, "text": "So some sort of chemical is released that protects you, but there is an acceptance."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "I don't know how much, uh, of it was a conscious choice, probably very little."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Um, and that's the point I'm making is it's, it's instinctual."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "We don't really have a choice in fearing death."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "Otherwise there would be no progression."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "We wouldn't all life seems to want to survive, uh, not by choice, but by instinct."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "So he, he argues that the fear is not the instinctual of, it's not the animalistic stuff."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "That's the thing that makes us special is the, what humans are able to do is to have a knowledge that we're going to die one day."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Animals don't have that animals."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "Fear is instinctual."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "It's like, Holy shit, what's that sound over there?"}, {"time": 1039, "text": "He says, we're actually able to contemplate the fact that this ride ends and that that kind of cognitive construct is difficult for us to deal with."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "Like what the hell does that mean?"}, {"time": 1051, "text": "Like just to, just to think about, it's going to be over at a certain point, it's just over lights out."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "Like it's very difficult to kind of load that into whatever this like little brain we got."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "Maybe that's what gives everything meaning."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Because if everything lasted forever, if, uh, if this went on ad infinitum, there would be no meaning to it."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "I'd be like, Hey, if I don't see you tomorrow, I'll see in a million years, there would be no meaning."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "There'll be no urgency."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "There would be no feelings."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "There'd be no, uh, nothing of magnitude or superficiality."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "It would all just be this kind of, it would be torture."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "It would actually, that would actually be torture to be here forever."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "I mean, I'm already sick of this place and I'm just in my forties."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "Like I'm done."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "I'm sick of me."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "I'm sick of everything."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "You know, a lot of people, when they talk about mortality, they consider, they consider mortality appealing because you get a chance to do basically all these things you might not get a chance to do otherwise, like all the kinds of travel broadly, explore, read every book, explore every idea, do every hobby, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "The idea I was talking to mentioned, uh, the reality of being immortal would be more likely, I like this idea, more likely would be you just sitting there doing nothing because, and putting off all that travel and exploration to later because you'll always have time."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "And so what you're going to have, what actual immortality would look like for a bunch of humans is people sitting there doing nothing."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "It would be like a Greek caffineer just sitting around drinking coffee."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "I mean, it's a lazy man's paradise."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "But it's so interesting because that, that's, that rings true to me for what humans are like is we'll basically just put off all those exciting adventures and just be lazy, become lazier and lazier and lazier because you'll always have a chance to do all the exciting things and we'll just get, we'll basically become Tim Dillon."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "We just sit there and have a podcast and that's it."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "He works hard."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "I mean, that sounds actually like heaven, dude."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "That's speaking to my heart really."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "I mean, I'm at heart, I'm a very lazy person."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "I always try to find ways to lie down."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "Like if I'm sitting, I'll figure out a way to kind of contort myself to later."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "That's an interesting thing to like in, yeah."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "If you can always push something off, yeah, that, I like that."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "I think that's heaven."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "And um, See, we just changed your mind."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "You kind of like the immortality."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "I kind of like it."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So there'll be no thirsts."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "You can always put it off."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "You don't want to bang this girl."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "You're like, ah, put it off."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "But now I'm thinking about Muslim heaven and they may be offering the best deal."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "I mean, if it was an expo and they had a booth, I may go with them because they offer, they offer 62 or 72, but then I'd get sick of them."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "I'd want to, I don't know."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "I always wondered like, are you given the 62 virgins or you choose, can you create them like an avatar, like a video game, or are you just given?"}, {"time": 1236, "text": "I don't know what the number, why it's important to have that high number."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "First of all, I think it's a mistranslation about the virgins, but outside of that, outside of that, I feel like the conversation is really important."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "I don't think they ever specify like what kind of books these girls read."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "Like what are they, what are they into?"}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Like the quality of the conversation, I think if you're talking about eternity, the quality of the intellect and the conversation and the personalities is way more important."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "And the Greeks have an ancient, ancient expression, pat metronaros stone, which my mother always used to say, which is everything in moderation, nothing in excess."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "So trying to always get the status quo and uh, yeah, that many women, eventually

richer with the guy who was a little, and it was a pyramid scheme."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "And he was able to do it for so long and steal so much money."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "And he would win people over with the scheme because with that scheme, he was the only guy who could provide, who could guarantee like a 1% return even during times of recession."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "And because
