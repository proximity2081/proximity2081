time and we're just creating a lot of pollution, but so is the other creatures."}, {"time": 331, "text": "So I don't know, do you think you'd be able to detect humans?"}, {"time": 335, "text": "Like how would you go about detecting in the computational sense?"}, {"time": 339, "text": "Maybe we can leave humans behind."}, {"time": 340, "text": "In the computational sense, detect interesting things."}, {"time": 346, "text": "Do you basically have to have a strict objective function by which you measure the performance of a system or can you find curiosities and interesting things?"}, {"time": 355, "text": "Yeah, well, I think that the first measurement would be to detect how much of an effect you can have in your environment."}, {"time": 363, "text": "So if you look around, we have cities and that is constructed environments."}, {"time": 368, "text": "And that's where a lot of people live, most people live."}, {"time": 371, "text": "So that would be a good sign of intelligence that you don't just live in an environment, but you construct it to your liking."}, {"time": 380, "text": "And that's something pretty unique."}, {"time": 381, "text": "I mean, there are certainly birds build nests but they don't build quite cities."}, {"time": 385, "text": "Termites build mounds and ice and things like that."}, {"time": 389, "text": "But the complexity of the human construction cities, I think would stand out even to an external observer."}, {"time": 394, "text": "Of course, that's what a human would say."}, {"time": 396, "text": "Yeah, and you know, you can certainly say that sharks are really smart because they've been around so long and they haven't destroyed their environment, which humans are about to do, which is not a very smart thing."}, {"time": 408, "text": "But we'll get over it, I believe."}, {"time": 412, "text": "And we can get over it by doing some construction that actually is benign and maybe even enhances the resilience of nature."}, {"time": 422, "text": "So you mentioned the simulation that we run over and over might start, it's a slow start."}, {"time": 428, "text": "So do you think how unlikely, first of all, I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff, but how unlikely is step number zero, which is the springing up, like the origin of life on earth?"}, {"time": 442, "text": "And second, how unlikely is the, anything interesting happening beyond that?"}, {"time": 450, "text": "So like the start that creates all the rich complexity that we see on earth today."}, {"time": 456, "text": "Yeah, there are people who are working on exactly that problem from primordial soup."}, {"time": 462, "text": "How do you actually get self replicating molecules?"}, {"time": 465, "text": "And they are very close."}, {"time": 468, "text": "With a little bit of help, you can make that happen."}, {"time": 471, "text": "So of course we know what we want, so they can set up the conditions and try out conditions that are conducive to that."}, {"time": 480, "text": "For evolution to discover that, that took a long time."}, {"time": 484, "text": "For us to recreate it probably won't take that long."}, {"time": 487, "text": "And the next steps from there, I think also with some handholding, I think we can make that happen."}, {"time": 495, "text": "But with evolution, what was really fascinating was eventually the runaway evolution of the brain that created humans and created, well, also other higher animals, that that was something that happened really fast."}, {"time": 509, "text": "And that's a big question."}, {"time": 512, "text": "Is that something replicable?"}, {"time": 513, "text": "Is that something that can happen?"}, {"time": 515, "text": "And if it happens, does it go in the same direction?"}, {"time": 519, "text": "That is a big question to ask."}, {"time": 520, "text": "Even in computational terms, I think that it's relatively possible to come up here, create an experiment where we look at the primordial soup and the first couple of steps of multicellular organisms even."}, {"time": 533, "text": "But to get something as complex as the brain, we don't quite know the conditions for that."}, {"time": 539, "text": "And how do you even get started and whether we can get this kind of runaway evolution happening?"}, {"time": 545, "text": "From a detector perspective, if we're observing this evolution, what do you think is the brain?"}, {"time": 552, "text": "What do you think is the, let's say, what is intelligence?"}, {"time": 555, "text": "So in terms of the thing that makes humans special, we seem to be able to reason, we seem to be able to communicate."}, {"time": 563, "text": "But the core of that is this something in the broad category we might call intelligence."}, {"time": 569, "text": "So if you put your computer scientist hat on, is there a favorite ways you like to think about that question of what is intelligence?"}, {"time": 581, "text": "Well, my goal is to create agents that are intelligent."}, {"time": 588, "text": "Not to define what."}, {"time": 589, "text": "And that is a way of defining it."}, {"time": 592, "text": "And that means that it's some kind of an object or a program that has limited sensory and effective capabilities interacting with the world."}, {"time": 608, "text": "And then also a mechanism for making decisions."}, {"time": 611, "text": "So with limited abilities like that, can it survive?"}, {"time": 617, "text": "Survival is the simplest goal, but you could also give it other goals."}, {"time": 620, "text": "Can it multiply?"}, {"time": 621, "text": "Can it solve problems that you give it?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "And that is quite a bit less than human intelligence."}, {"time": 627, "text": "There are, animals would be intelligent, of course, with that definition."}, {"time": 631, "text": "And you might have even some other forms of life, even."}, {"time": 635, "text": "So intelligence in that sense is a survival skill given resources that you have and using your resources so that you will stay around."}, {"time": 647, "text": "Do you think death, mortality is fundamental to an agent?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "So like there's, I don't know if you're familiar, there's a philosopher named Ernest Becker who wrote The Denial of Death and his whole idea."}, {"time": 661, "text": "And there's folks, psychologists, cognitive scientists that work on terror management theory."}, {"time": 666, "text": "And they think that one of the special things about humans is that we're able to sort of foresee our death, right?"}, {"time": 673, "text": "We can realize not just as animals do, sort of constantly fear in an instinctual sense, respond to all the dangers that are out there, but like understand that this ride ends eventually."}, {"time": 685, "text": "And that in itself is the force behind all of the creative efforts of human nature."}, {"time": 692, "text": "That's the philosophy."}, {"time": 693, "text": "I think that makes sense, a lot of sense."}, {"time": 695, "text": "I mean, animals probably don't think of death the same way, but humans know that your time is limited and you wanna make it count."}, {"time": 703, "text": "And you can make it count in many different ways, but I think that has a lot to do with creativity and the need for humans to do something beyond just surviving."}, {"time": 711, "text": "And now going from that simple definition to something that's the next level, I think that that could be the second level of definition, that intelligence means something, that you do something that stays behind you, that's more than your existence."}, {"time": 729, "text": "You create something that is useful for others, is useful in the future, not just for yourself."}, {"time": 735, "text": "And I think that's the nicest definition of intelligence within a next level."}, {"time": 739, "text": "And it's also nice because it doesn't require that they are humans or biological."}, {"time": 745, "text": "They could be artificial agents that are intelligence."}, {"time": 748, "text": "They could achieve those kind of goals."}, {"time": 750, "text": "So particular agent, the ripple effects of their existence on the entirety of the system is significant."}, {"time": 758, "text": "So like they leave a trace where there's like a, yeah, like ripple effects."}, {"time": 763, "text": "But see, then you go back to the butterfly with the flap of a wing and then you can trace a lot of like nuclear wars and all the conflicts of human history, somehow connected to that one butterfly that created all of the chaos."}, {"time": 776, "text": "So maybe that's not, maybe that's a very poetic way to think that that's something we humans in a human centric way wanna hope we have this impact."}, {"time": 789, "text": "Like that is the secondary effect of our intelligence."}, {"time": 792, "text": "We've had the long lasting impact on the world, but maybe the entirety of physics in the universe has a very long lasting effects."}, {"time": 802, "text": "Sure, but you can also think of it."}, {"time": 805, "text": "What if like the wonderful life, what if you're not here?"}, {"time": 809, "text": "Will somebody else do this?"}, {"time": 811, "text": "Is it something that you actually contributed because you had something unique to compute?"}, {"time": 816, "text": "That contribute, that's a pretty high bar though."}, {"time": 819, "text": "Uniqueness, yeah."}, {"time": 820, "text": "So, you have to be Mozart or something to actually reach that level that nobody would have developed that, but other people might have solved this equation if you didn't do it, but also within limited scope."}, {"time": 835, "text": "I mean, during your lifetime or next year, you could contribute something that unique that other people did not see."}, {"time": 844, "text": "And then that could change the way things move forward for a while."}, {"time": 851, "text": "So, I don't think we have to be Mozart to be called intelligence, but we have this local effect that is changing."}, {"time": 858, "text": "If you weren't there, that would not have happened."}, {"time": 860, "text": "And it's a positive effect, of course, you want it to be a positive effect."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Do you think it's possible to engineer into computational agents, a fear of mortality?"}, {"time": 870, "text": "Like, does that make any sense?"}, {"time": 875, "text": "So, there's a very trivial thing where it's like, you could just code in a parameter, which is how long the life ends, but more of a fear of mortality, like awareness of the way that things end and somehow encoding a complex representation of that fear, which is like, maybe as it gets closer, you become more terrified."}, {"time": 898, "text": "I mean, there seems to be something really profound about this fear that's not currently encodable in a trivial way into our programs."}, {"time": 908, "text": "Well, I think you're referring to the emotion of fear, something, because we have cognitively, we know that we have limited lifespan and most of us cope with it by just, hey, that's what the world is like and I make the most of it."}, {"time": 920, "text": "But sometimes you can have like a fear that's not healthy, that paralyzes you, that you can't do anything."}, {"time": 929, "text": "And somewhere in between there, not caring at all and getting paralyzed because of fear is a normal response, which is a little bit more than just logic and it's emotion."}, {"time": 941, "text": "So now the question is, what good are emotions?"}, {"time": 943, "text": "I mean, they are quite complex and there are multiple dimensions of emotions and they probably do serve a survival function, heightened focus, for instance."}, {"time": 955, "text": "And fear of death might be a really good emotion when you are in danger, that you recognize it, even if it's not logically necessarily easy to derive and you don't have time for that logical deduction, you may be able to recognize the situation is dangerous and this fear kicks in and you all of a sudden perceive the facts that are important for that."}, {"time": 978, "text": "And I think that's generally is the role of emotions."}, {"time": 981, "text": "It allows you to focus what's relevant for your situation."}, {"time": 984, "text": "And maybe if fear of death plays the same kind of role, but if it consumes you and it's something that you think in normal life when you don't have to, then it's not healthy and then it's not productive."}, {"time": 994, "text": "Yeah, but it's fascinating to think how to incorporate emotion into a computational agent."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "It almost seems like a silly statement to make, but it perhaps seems silly because we have such a poor understanding of the mechanism of emotion, of fear, of, I think at the core of it is another word that we know nothing about, but say a lot, which is consciousness."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Do you ever in your work, or like maybe on a coffee break, think about what the heck is this thing consciousness and is it at all useful in our thinking about AI systems?"}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Yes, it is an important question."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "You can build representations and functions, I think into these agents that act like emotions and consciousness perhaps."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "So I mentioned emotions being something that allow you to focus and pay attention, filter out what's important."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "Yeah, you can have that kind of a filter mechanism and it puts you in a different state."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "Your computation is in a different state."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "Certain things don't really get through and others are heightened."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Now you label that box emotion."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "I don't know if that means it's an emotion, but it acts very much like we understand what emotions are."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "And we actually did some work like that, modeling hyenas who were trying to steal a kill from lions, which happens in Africa."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "I mean, hyenas are quite intelligent, but not really intelligent."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "And they have this behavior that's more complex than anything else they do."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "They can band together, if there's about 30 of them or so, they can coordinate their effort so that they push the lions away from a kill."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Even though the lions are so strong that they could kill a hyena by striking with a paw."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "But when they work together and precisely time this attack, the lions will leave and they get the kill."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "And probably there are some states like emotions that the hyenas go through."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "The first, they call for reinforcements."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "They really want that kill, but there's not enough of them."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "So they vocalize and there's more people, more hyenas that come around."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "And then they have two emotions."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "They're very afraid of the lion, so they want to stay away, but they also have a strong affiliation between each other."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "And then this is the balance of the two emotions."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And also, yes, they also want the kill."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "So it's both repelled and attractive."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "But then this affiliation eventually is so strong that when they move, they move together, they act as a unit and they can perform that function."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "So there's an interesting behavior that seems to depend on these emotions strongly and makes it possible, coordinate the actions."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "And I think a critical aspect of that, the way you're describing is emotion there is a mechanism of social communication, of a social interaction."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Maybe humans won't even be that intelligent or most things we think of as intelligent wouldn't be that intelligent without the social component of interaction."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "Maybe much of our intelligence is essentially an outgrowth of social interaction."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And maybe for the creation of intelligent agents, we have to be creating fundamentally social systems."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "Yes, I strongly believe that's true."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "And yes, the communication is multifaceted."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "I mean, they vocalize and call for friends, but they also rub against each other and they push and they do all kinds of gestures and so on."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "So they don't act alone."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "And I don't think people act alone very much either, at least normal, most of the time."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "And social systems are so strong for humans that I think we build everything on top of these kinds of structures."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "And one interesting theory around that, bigotness theory, for instance, for language, but language origins is that where did language come from?"}, {"time": 1236, "text": "And it's a plausible theory that first came social systems, that you have different roles in a society."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And then those roles are exchangeable, that I scratch your back, you scratch my back, we can exchange roles."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "And once you have the brain structures that allow you to understand actions in terms of roles that can be changed, that's the basis for language, for grammar."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "And now you can start using symbols to refer to objects in the world."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And you have this flexible structure."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "So there's a social structure that's fundamental for language to develop."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "Now, again, then you have language, you can refer to things that are not here right now."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "And that allows you to then build all the good stuff about planning, for instance, and building things and so on."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So yeah, I think that very strongly humans are social and that gives us ability to structure the world."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "But also as a society, we can do so much more because one person does not have to do everything."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "You can have different roles and together achieve a lot more."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And that's also something we see in computational simulations today."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "I mean, we have multi agent systems that can perform tasks."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "This fascinating demonstration, Marco Dorego, I think it was, these little robots that had to navigate through an environment and there were things that are dangerous, like maybe a big chasm or some kind of groove, a hole, and they could not get across it."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "But if they grab each other with their gripper, they formed a robot that was much longer under the team and this way they could get across that."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "So this is a great example of how together we can achieve things we couldn't otherwise."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "Like the hyenas, you know, alone they couldn't, but as a team they could."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And I think humans do that all the time."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "We're really good at that."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "Yeah, and the way you described the system of hyenas, it almost sounds algorithmic."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "Like the problem with humans is they're so complex, it's hard to think of them as algorithms."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "But with hyenas, there's a, it's simple enough to where it feels like, at least hopeful that it's possible to create computational systems that mimic that."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "Yeah, that's exactly why we looked at that."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "As opposed to humans."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Like I said, they are intelligent, but they are not quite as intelligent as say, baboons, which would learn a lot and would be much more flexible."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "The hyenas are relatively rigid in what they can do."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "And therefore you could look at this behavior, like this is a breakthrough in evolution about to happen."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "That they've discovered something about social structures, communication, about cooperation, and it might then spill over to other things too in thousands of years in the future."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "Yeah, I think the problem with baboons and humans is probably too much is going on inside the head."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "We won't be able to measure it if we're observing the system."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "With hyenas, it's probably easier to observe the actual decision making and the various motivations that are involved."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "Yeah, they are visible."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "And we can even quantify possibly their emotional state because they leave droppings behind."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "And there are chemicals there that can be associated with neurotransmitters."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "And we can separate what emotions they might have experienced in the last 24 hours."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "What to you is the most beautiful, speaking of hyenas, what to you is the most beautiful nature inspired algorithm in your work that you've come across?"}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Something maybe early on in your work or maybe today?"}, {"time": 1454, "text": "I think evolution computation is the most amazing method."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "So what fascinates me most is that with computers is that you can get more out than you put in."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "I mean, you can write a piece of code and your machine does what you told it."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "I mean, this happened to me in my freshman year."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "It did something very simple and I was just amazed."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "I was blown away that it would get the number and it would compute the result."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "And I didn't have to do it myself."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "But if you push that a little further, you can have machines that learn and they might learn patterns."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "And already say deep learning neural networks, they can learn to recognize objects, sounds, patterns that humans have trouble with."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And sometimes they do it better than humans."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And that's so fascinating."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "And now if you take that one more step, you get something like evolutionary algorithms that discover things, they create things, they come up with solutions that you did not think of."}, {"time": 1513, "text": "And that just blows me away."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "It's so great that we can build systems, algorithms that can be in some sense smarter than we are, that they can discover solutions that we might miss."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "A lot of times it is because we have as humans, we have certain biases, we expect the solutions to be certain way and you don't put those biases into the algorithm so they are more free to explore."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "And evolution is just absolutely fantastic explorer."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "And that's what really is fascinating."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "Yeah, I think I get made fun of a bit because I currently don't have any kids, but you mentioned programs."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "I mean, do you have kids?"}, {"time": 1551, "text": "So maybe you could speak to this, but there's a magic to the creative process."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "Like with Spot, the Boston Dynamics Spot, but really any robot that I've ever worked on, it just feels like the similar kind of joy I imagine I would have as a father."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "Not the same perhaps level, but like the same kind of wonderment."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "Like there's exactly this, which is like you know what you had to do initially to get this thing going."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "Let's speak on the computer science side, like what the program looks like, but something about it doing more than what the program was written on paper is like that somehow connects to the magic of this entire universe."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "Like that's like, I feel like I found God."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "Every time I like, it's like, because you've really created something that's living."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Even if it's a simple program."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "It has a life of its own, it has the intelligence of its own."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "It's beyond what you actually thought."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "And that is, I think it's exactly spot on."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "That's exactly what it's about."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "You created something and it has a ability to live its life and do good things and you just gave it a starting point."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "So in that sense, I think it's, that may be part of the joy actually."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "But you mentioned creativity in this context, especially in the context of evolutionary computation."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "So, we don't often think of algorithms as creative."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "So how do you think about creativity?"}, {"time": 1641, "text": "Yeah, algorithms absolutely can be creative."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "They can come up with solutions that you don't think about."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "I mean, creativity can be defined."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "A couple of requirements has to be new."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "It has to be useful and it has to be surprising."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "And those certainly are true with, say, evolutionary computation discovering solutions."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "So maybe an example, for instance, we did this collaboration with MIT Media Lab, Caleb Harbus Lab, where they had a hydroponic food computer, they called it, environment that was completely computer controlled, nutrients, water, light, temperature, everything is controlled."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "Now, what do you do if you can control everything?"}, {"time": 1685, "text": "Farmers know a lot about how to make plants grow in their own patch of land."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "But if you can control everything, it's too much."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And it turns out that we don't actually know very much about it."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "So we built a system, evolutionary optimization system, together with a surrogate model of how plants grow and let this system explore recipes on its own."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "And initially, we were focusing on light, how strong, what wavelengths, how long the light was on."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "And we put some boundaries which we thought were reasonable."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "For instance, that there was at least six hours of darkness, like night, because that's what we have in the world."}, {"time": 1727, "text": "And very quickly, the system, evolution, pushed all the recipes to that limit."}, {"time": 1734,

environment can be evaluated how good it is."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "So even that mapping is a big question and how do you do it?"}, {"time": 2554, "text": "But typically the representations are,

like that that are not really that useful."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "If you try to explain them now, it would make no sense, very hard."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "But if you think of us as productive evolution, you can see where they came from."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "They were useful at one point perhaps and no longer are, but they're still there."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "So that process is complex and your representation should support it."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "And that is quite difficult if we are limited with strings or trees, and then we are pretty much limited what can be constructed."}, {"time": 2643, "text": "And one thing that we are still missing in evolutionary computation in particular is what we saw in biology, major transitions."}, {"time": 2651, "text": "So that you go from, for instance, single cell to multi cell organisms and eventually societies."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "There are transitions of level of selection and level of what a unit is."},

2670, "text": "Is that what that is?"}, {"time": 2671, "text": "Most likely it does, but it's quite, we don't even understand it in biology very well where it's coming from."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "So it would be really good to look at major transitions in biology, try to characterize them a little bit more in detail, what the processes are."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "How does a, so like a unit, a cell is no longer evaluated alone."}, {"time": 2690, "text": "It's evaluated as part of a community, a multi cell organism."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "Even though it could reproduce, now it can't alone."}, {"time": 2697, "text": "It has to have that environment."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "So there's a push to another level, at least a selection."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "And how do you make that jump to the next level?"}, {"time": 2704, "text": "Yes, how do you make the jump?"}, {"time": 2706, "text": "As part of the algorithm."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "So we haven't really seen that in computation yet."}, {"time": 2712, "text": "And there are certainly attempts to have open ended evolution."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "Things that could add more complexity and start selecting at a higher level."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "But it is still not quite the same as going from single to multi to society, for instance, in biology."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "So there essentially would be, as opposed to having one agent, those agent all of a sudden spontaneously decide to then be together."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "And then your entire system would then be treating them as one agent."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "Some kind of weird merger building."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "But also, so you mentioned, I think you mentioned selection."}, {"time": 2749, "text": "So basically there's an agent and they don't get to live on if they don't do well."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "So there's some kind of measure of what doing well is and isn't."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "And does mutation come into play at all in the process and what in the world does it serve?"}, {"time": 2764, "text": "Yeah, so, and again, back to what the computational mechanisms of evolution computation are."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "So the way to create variation, you can take multiple individuals, two usually, but you could do more."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "And you exchange the parts of the representation."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "You do some kind of recombination."}, {"time": 2782, "text": "Could be crossover, for instance."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "In biology, you do have DNA strings that are cut and put together again."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "We could do something like that."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "And it seems to be that in biology, the crossover is really the workhorse in biological evolution."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "In computation, we tend to rely more on mutation."}, {"time": 2807, "text": "And that is making random changes into parts of the chromosome."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "You can try to be intelligent and target certain areas of it and make the mutations also follow some principle."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "Like you collect

years."}, {"time": 2831, "text": "I mean, evolution computation has been around for 50 years, but a lot of the recent..."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "Success comes from mutation."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "Yes, comes from using statistics."}, {"time": 2839, "text": "It's like the rest of machine learning based on statistics."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "We use similar tools to guide evolution computation."}, {"time": 2845, "text": "And in that sense, it has diverged a bit from biological evolution."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And that's one of the things I think we could look at again, having a weaker selection, more crossover, large populations, more time, and maybe a different kind of creativity would come out of it."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "We are very impatient in evolution computation today."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "We want answers right now, right, quickly."}, {"time": 2868, "text": "And if somebody doesn't perform, kill it."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "And biological evolution doesn't work quite that way."}, {"time": 2875, "text": "And it's more patient."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "Yes, much more patient."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "So I guess we need to add some kind of mating, some kind of like dating mechanisms, like marriage maybe in there."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "So into our algorithms to improve the combination as opposed to all mutation doing all of the work."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "Yeah, and many ways of being successful."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "Usually in evolution computation, we have one goal, play this game really well compared to others."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "But in biology, there are many ways of being successful."}, {"time": 2908, "text": "You can build niches."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "You can be stronger, faster, larger, or smarter, or eat this or eat that."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So there are many ways to solve the same problem of survival."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "And that then breeds creativity."}, {"time": 2923, "text": "And it allows more exploration."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "And eventually you get solutions that are perhaps more creative rather than trying to go from initial population directly or more or less directly to your maximum fitness, which you measure as just one metric."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "So in a broad sense, before we talk about neuroevolution, do you see evolutionary computation as more effective than deep learning in a certain context?"}, {"time": 2954, "text": "Machine learning, broadly speaking."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "Maybe even supervised machine learning."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "I don't know if you want to draw any kind of lines and distinctions and borders where they rub up against each other kind of thing, where one is more

the deep learning has been really successful in domains where we have a lot of data."}, {"time": 2979, "text": "And that means not just data about situations, but also what the right answers were."},

learning to create engineering solutions, but that's still roughly the distinction."}, {"time": 3115, "text": "And from the point of view of what algorithm you wanna use, if you have something where there is a cost for every trial, reinforcement learning might be your choice."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "Now, if you have a domain where you can use a surrogate perhaps, so you don't have much of a cost for trial, and you want to have surprises, you want to explore more broadly, then this population based method is perhaps a better choice because you can try things out that you wouldn't afford when you're doing reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "There's very few things as entertaining as watching either evolutionary computation or reinforcement learning teaching a simulated robot to walk."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Maybe there's a higher level question that could be asked here, but do you find this whole space of applications in the robotics interesting for evolution computation?"}, {"time": 3171, "text": "Yeah, yeah, very much."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And indeed, there are fascinating videos of that."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "And that's actually one of the examples where you can contrast the difference."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "Between reinforcement learning and evolution."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "Yes, so if you have a reinforcement learning agent, it tries to be conservative because it wants to walk as long as possible and be stable."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "But if you have evolutionary computation, it can afford these agents that go haywire."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "They fall flat on their face and they could take a step and then they jump and then again fall flat."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "And eventually what comes out of that is something like a falling that's controlled."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "You take another step and another step and you no longer fall."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "Instead you run, you go fast."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "So that's a way of discovering something that's hard to discover step by step incrementally."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "Because you can afford these evolutionist dead ends, although they are not entirely dead ends in the sense that they can serve as stepping stones."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "When you take two of those, put them together, you get something that works even better."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "And that is a great example of this kind of discovery."}, {"time": 3235, "text": "Yeah, learning to walk is fascinating."}, {"time": 3238, "text": "I talked quite a bit to Russ Tedrick who's at MIT."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "There's a community of folks who just roboticists who love the elegance and beauty of movement."}, {"time": 3249, "text":

evolve the controller together with the body, you get movements that look natural because they're optimized for that physical setup."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "And these creatures, you start believing them that they're alive because they walk in a way that you would expect somebody with that kind of a setup to walk."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "Yeah, there's something subjective also about that, right?"}, {"time": 3343, "text": "I've been thinking a lot about that, especially in the human robot interaction context."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "You know, I mentioned Spot, the Boston Dynamics robot."}, {"time": 3355, "text": "There is something about human robot communication."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "Let's say, let's put it in another context, something about human and dog context, like

is that you could do that in simulation and then transfer it into the physical space if you're able to model the robot sufficiently naturally."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "Yeah, and sometimes I think that that requires a theory of mind on the side of the robot that they understand what you're doing because they themselves are doing something similar."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "And that's a big question too."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "We talked about intelligence in general and the social aspect of intelligence."}, {"time": 3470, "text": "And I think that's what is required that we humans

bounce into the other robot and win if they were stronger."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "And we watched evolution discover more and more complex behaviors."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "They first went to the nearest food and then they started to plot a trajectory so they get more, but then they started to pay attention what the other robot was doing."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "And in the end, there was a behavior where one of the robots, the most sophisticated one, sensed where the food pieces were and identified that the other robot was close to two of a very far distance and there was one more food nearby."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "So it faked, now I'm using anthropomorphizing terms, but it made a move towards those other pieces in order for the other robot to actually go and get them because it knew that the last remaining piece of food was close and the other robot would have to travel a long way, lose its energy and then lose the whole competition."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "So there was like emergence of something like a theory of mind, knowing what the other robot would do, to guide it towards bad behavior in order to win."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "So we can get things like that happen in simulation as well."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "But that's a complete natural emergence of a theory of mind."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "But I feel like if you add a little bit of a place for a theory of mind to emerge like easier, then you can go really far."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "I mean, some of these things with evolution, you know, you add a little bit of design in there, it'll really help."}, {"time": 3585, "text": "And I tend to think that a very simple theory of mind will go a really long way for cooperation between agents and certainly for human robot

3898, "text": "Yeah, neural evolution is a combination of neural networks and evolution computation in many different forms, but the early versions were simply using evolution as a way to construct a neural network instead of say, stochastic gradient descent or backpropagation."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "Because evolution can evolve these parameters, weight values in a neural network, just like any other string of numbers, you can do that."}, {"time": 3926, "text": "And that's useful because some cases you don't have those targets that you need to backpropagate from."}, {"time": 3933,

backprop, but this way you can still evolve a neural net."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "And neural networks are really good at these tasks, because they recognize patterns and they generalize, interpolate between known situations."}, {"time": 3953, "text": "So you want to have a neural network in such a task, even if you don't have a supervised targets."}, {"time": 3959, "text": "So that's a reason and that's a solution."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "And also more recently, now when we have all this deep learning literature, it turns out that we can use evolution to optimize many aspects of those designs."}, {"time": 3971, "text": "The deep learning architectures have become so complex that there's little hope for us little humans to understand their complexity and what actually makes a good design."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "And now we can use evolution to give that design for you."}, {"time": 3984, "text": "And it might mean optimizing hyperparameters, like the depth of layers and so on, or the topology of the network, how many layers, how they're connected, but also other aspects like what activation functions you use where in the network during the learning process, or what loss function you use, you could generalize that."}, {"time": 4003, "text": "You could generate that, even data augmentation, all the different aspects of the design of deep learning experiments could be optimized that way."}, {"time": 4013, "text": "So that's an interaction between two mechanisms."}, {"time": 4016, "text": "But there's also, when we get more into cognitive science and the topics that we've been talking about, you could have learning mechanisms at two level timescales."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "So you do have an evolution that gives you baby neural networks that then learn during their lifetime."}, {"time": 4032, "text": "And you have this interaction of two timescales."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "And I think that can potentially be really powerful."}, {"time": 4039, "text": "Now, in biology, we are not born with all our faculties."}, {"time": 4043, "text": "We have to learn, we have a developmental period."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "In humans, it's really long and most animals have something."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "And probably the reason is that evolution of DNA is not detailed enough or plentiful enough to describe them."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "We can describe how to set the brain up, but we can, evolution can decide on a starting point and then have a learning algorithm that will construct the final product."}, {"time": 4068, "text": "And this interaction of intelligent, well, evolution that has produced a good starting point for the specific purpose of learning from it with the interaction with the environment, that can be a really powerful mechanism for constructing brains and constructing behaviors."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "I like how you walk back from intelligence."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "So optimize starting point, maybe."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "Yeah, okay, there's a lot of fascinating things to ask here."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "And this is basically this dance between neural networks and evolution and computation could go into the category of automated machine learning to where you're optimizing, whether it's hyperparameters of the topology or hyperparameters taken broadly."}, {"time": 4114,

an organism is really fascinating space."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "How hard is it, do you think, to grow a neural network?"}, {"time": 4138, "text": "And maybe what kind of neural networks are more amenable to this kind of idea than others?"}, {"time": 4144, "text": "I've seen quite a bit of work on recurrent neural networks."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "Is there some architectures that are friendlier than others?"}, {"time": 4150, "text": "And is this just a fun, small scale set of experiments or do you have hope that we can be able to grow powerful neural networks?"}, {"time": 4160, "text": "I think we can."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "And most of the work up to now is taking architectures that already exist that humans have designed and try to optimize them further."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And you can totally do that."}, {"time": 4172, "text": "A few years ago, we did an experiment."}, {"time": 4174, "text": "We took a winner of the image captioning competition and the architecture and just broke it into pieces and took the pieces."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "And that was our search base."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "See if you can do better."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "And we indeed could, 15% better performance by just searching around the network design that humans had come up with, Oreo vinyls and others."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "So, but that's starting from a point that humans have produced, but we could do something more general."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "It doesn't have to be that kind of network."}, {"time": 4205, "text": "The hard part is, there are a couple of challenges."}, {"time": 4208, "text": "One of them is to define the search base."}, {"time": 4210, "text": "What are your elements and how you put them together."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "And the space is just really, really big."}, {"time": 4218, "text": "So you have to somehow constrain it and have some hunch what will work because otherwise everything is possible."}, {"time": 4225, "text": "And another challenge is that in order to evaluate how good your design is, you have to train it."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "I mean, you have to actually try it out."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "And that's currently very expensive, right?"}, {"time": 4237, "text": "I mean, deep learning networks may take days to train while imagine you having a population of a hundred and have to run it for a hundred generations."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "It's not yet quite feasible computationally."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "It will be, but also there's a large carbon footprint and all that."}, {"time": 4252, "text": "I mean, we are using a lot of computation for doing it."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "So intelligent methods and intelligent, I mean, we have to do some science in order to figure out what the right representations are and right operators are, and how do we evaluate them without having to fully train them."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "And that is where the current research is and we're making progress on all those fronts."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "So yes, there are certain architectures that are more amenable to that approach, but also I think we can create our own architecture and all representations that are even better at that."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "And do you think it's possible to do like a tiny baby network that grows into something that can do state of the art on like even the simple data set like MNIST, and just like it just grows into a gigantic monster that's the world's greatest handwriting recognition system?"}, {"time": 4302, "text": "Yeah, there are approaches like that."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "Esteban Real and Cochlear for instance, I worked on evolving a smaller network and then systematically expanding it to a larger one."}, {"time": 4311, "text": "Your elements are already there and scaling it up will just give you more power."}, {"time": 4316, "text": "So again, evolution gives you that starting point and then there's a mechanism that gives you the final result and a very powerful approach."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "But you could also simulate the actual growth process."}, {"time": 4332, "text": "And like I said before, evolving a starting point and then evolving or training the network, there's not that much work that's been done on that yet."}, {"time": 4341, "text": "We need some kind of a simulation environment so the interactions at will, the supervised environment doesn't really, it's not as easily usable here."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "Sorry, the interaction between neural networks?"},

4367, "text": "We would like to get there, but just the task of simulating something is at that level is very hard."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "I love the idea."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "I mean, one of the powerful things about evolution on Earth is the predators and prey emerged."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "And like there's just like, there's bigger fish and smaller fish and it's fascinating to think that you could have neural networks competing against each other in one neural network being able to destroy another one."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "There's like wars of neural networks competing to solve the MNIST problem, I don't know."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "Oh, totally, yeah, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "And we actually simulated also that prey and it was interesting what happened there, Padmini Rajagopalan did this and Kay Holkamp was a zoologist."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "So we had, again, we had simulated hyenas, simulated zebras."}, {"time": 4418, "text": "And initially, the hyenas just tried to hunt them and when they actually stumbled upon the zebra, they ate it and were happy."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "And then the zebras learned to escape and the hyenas learned to team up."}, {"time": 4434, "text": "And actually two of them approached in different directions."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "And now the zebras, their next step, they generated a behavior where they split in different directions, just like actually gazelles do when they are being hunted."}, {"time": 4448, "text": "They confuse the predator by going in different directions."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "That emerged and then more hyenas joined and kind of circled them."}, {"time": 4456, "text": "And then when they circled them, they could actually herd the zebras together and eat multiple zebras."}, {"time": 4463, "text": "So there was like an arms race of predators and prey."}, {"time": 4468, "text": "And they gradually developed more complex behaviors, some of which we actually do see in nature."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "And this kind of coevolution, that's competitive coevolution, it's a fascinating topic because there's a promise or possibility that you will discover something new that you don't already know."}, {"time": 4486, "text": "You didn't build it in."}, {"time": 4488, "text": "It came from this arms race."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "It's hard to keep the arms race going."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "It's hard to have rich enough simulation that supports all of these complex behaviors."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "But at least for several steps,

to this kind of multiheaded beast that's operating in the real world?"}, {"time": 4552, "text": "Yes, it's a very good problem for neuroevolution."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "And the reason is that when you have multiple tasks, they support each other."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "So let's say you're learning to classify X ray images to different pathologies."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "So you have one task is to classify this disease and another one, this disease, another one, this one."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "And when you're learning from one disease, that forces certain kinds of internal representations and embeddings, and they can serve as a helpful starting point for the other tasks."}, {"time": 4587, "text": "So you are combining the wisdom of multiple tasks into these representations."}, {"time": 4592, "text": "And it turns out that you can do better in each of these tasks when you are learning simultaneously other tasks than you would by one task alone."},

that you know in new domains, and certainly neural network can do that."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "When neuroevolution comes in is that, what's the best way to combine these tasks?"}, {"time": 4615, "text": "Now there's architectural design that allow you to decide where and how the embeddings, the internal representations are combined and how much you combine them."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "And there's quite a bit of research on that."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "And my team, Elliot Meyerson has worked on that in particular, like what is a good internal representation that supports multiple tasks?"}, {"time": 4637, "text": "And we're getting to understand how that's constructed and what's in it, so that it is in a space that supports multiple different heads, like you said."}, {"time": 4648, "text": "And that I think is fundamentally how biological intelligence works as well."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "You don't build a representation just for one task."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "You try to build something that's general, not only so that you can do better in one task or multiple tasks, but also future tasks and future challenges."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "So you learn the structure of the world and that helps you in all kinds of future challenges."}, {"time": 4674, "text": "And so you're trying to design a representation that will support an arbitrary set of tasks in a particular sort of class of problem."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "Yeah, and also it turns out, and that's again, a surprise that Elliot found was that those tasks don't have to be very related."},

because you've also on the competition neuroscience side, you worked on both language and vision."}, {"time": 4721, "text": "What's the connection between the two?"}, {"time": 4724, "text": "What's more, maybe there's a bunch of ways to ask this, but what's more difficult to build from an engineering perspective and evolutionary perspective, the human language system or the human vision system or the equivalent of in the AI space language and vision, or is it the best as the multitask idea that you're speaking to that they need to be deeply integrated?"}, {"time": 4747, "text": "Yeah, absolutely the latter."}, {"time": 4749, "text": "Learning both at the same time, I think is a fascinating direction in the future."}, {"time": 4755, "text": "So we have data sets where there's visual component as well as verbal descriptions, for instance, and that way you can learn a deeper representation, a more useful representation for both."}, {"time": 4765, "text": "But it's still an interesting question of which one is easier."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "I mean, recognizing objects or even understanding sentences, that's relatively possible, but where it becomes, where the challenges are is to understand the world."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "Like the visual world, the 3D, what are the objects doing and predicting what will happen, the relationships."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "That's what makes vision difficult."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "And language, obviously it's what is being said, what the meaning is."}, {"time": 4792, "text": "And the meaning doesn't stop at who did what to whom."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "There are goals and plans and themes, and you eventually have to understand the entire human society and history in order to understand the sentence very much fully."}, {"time": 4807, "text": "There are plenty of examples of those kinds of short sentences when you bring in all the world knowledge to understand it."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "And that's the big challenge."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "Now we are far from that, but even just bringing in the visual world together with the sentence will give you already a lot deeper understanding of what's happening."}, {"time": 4826, "text": "And I think that that's where we're going very soon."}, {"time": 4829, "text": "I mean, we've had ImageNet for a long time, and now we have all these text collections, but having both together and then learning a semantic understanding of what is happening, I think that that will be the next step in the next few years."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "Yeah, you're starting to see that with all the work with Transformers, was the community, the AI community starting to dip their toe into this idea of having language models that are now doing stuff with images, with vision, and then connecting the two."}, {"time": 4863, "text": "I mean, right now it's like these little explorations we're literally dipping the toe in, but maybe at some point we'll just dive into the pool and it'll just be all seen as the same thing."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "I do still wonder what's more fundamental, whether vision is, whether we don't think about vision correctly."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "Maybe the fact, because we're humans and we see things as beautiful and so on, and because we have cameras that are taking pixels as a 2D image, that we don't sufficiently think about vision as language."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "Maybe Chomsky is right all along, that vision is fundamental to, sorry, that language is fundamental to everything, to even cognition, to even consciousness."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "The base layer is all language, not necessarily like English, but some weird abstract representation, linguistic representation."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "Yeah, well, earlier we talked about the social structures and that may be what's underlying the language, and that's the more fundamental part, and then language has been added on top of that."}, {"time": 4928, "text": "Language emerges from the social interaction."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "Yeah, that's a very good guess."}, {"time": 4933, "text": "We are visual animals, though."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "A lot of the brain is dedicated to vision, and also, when we think about various abstract concepts, we usually reduce that to vision and images, and that's, you know, we go to a whiteboard, you draw pictures of very abstract concepts."}, {"time": 4953, "text": "So we tend to resort to that quite a bit, and that's a fundamental representation."}, {"time": 4957, "text": "It's probably possible that it predated language even."}, {"time": 4961, "text": "I mean, animals, a lot of, they don't talk, but they certainly do have vision, and language is interesting development in from mastication, from eating."}, {"time": 4973, "text": "You develop an organ that actually can produce sound to manipulate them."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "Maybe that was an accident."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "Maybe that was something that was available and then allowed us to do the communication, or maybe it was gestures."}, {"time": 4986, "text": "Sign language could have been the original proto language."}, {"time": 4990, "text": "We don't quite know, but the language is more fundamental than the medium in which it's communicated, and I think that it comes from those representations."}, {"time": 5000, "text": "Now, in current world, they are so strongly integrated, it's really hard to say which one is fundamental."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "You look at the brain structures and even visual cortex, which is supposed to be very much just vision."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "Well, if you are thinking of semantic concepts, you're thinking of language, visual cortex lights up."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "It's still useful, even for language computations."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "So there are common structures underlying them."}, {"time": 5027,

understanding relationships between words and concepts."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "So I think that that's how they are integrated."}, {"time": 5039, "text": "Yeah, and there's dreams, and once we close our eyes, there's still a world in there somehow operating and somehow possibly the visual system somehow integrated into all of it."}, {"time": 5049, "text": "I tend to enjoy thinking about aliens and thinking about the sad thing to me about extraterrestrial intelligent life, that if it visited us here on Earth, or if we came on Mars or maybe another solar system, another galaxy one day,

communicate with each other, like if we met each other at some, okay, we could do SETI, which is communicating from across a very big distance, but also just us, if you did a podcast with an alien, do you think we'd be able to find a common language and a common methodology of communication?"}, {"time": 5128, "text": "I think from a computational perspective, the way to ask that is you have very fundamentally different creatures, agents that are created, would they be able to find a common language?"}, {"time": 5138, "text": "Yes, I do think about that."}, {"time": 5140, "text": "I mean, I think a lot of people who are in computing, they, and AI in particular, they got into it because they were fascinated with science fiction and all of these options."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "I mean,

that, people have done that many times, that they communicate, they signal and so on, but actually develop a language."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "And language means grammar, it means all these social

organisms like AI systems that would be able to understand much deeper, like really understand what it means to live in a multi dimensional world that's outside of the four dimensions, the three of space and one of time."}, {"time": 6045, "text": "Translation, and generally we can deal with the world, even if you don't understand all the details, we can use computers, even though we don't, most of us don't know all the structure that's underneath or drive a car."}, {"time": 6055, "text": "I mean, there are many components, especially new cars that you don't quite fully know, but you have the interface, you have an abstraction of it that allows you to operate it and utilize it."}, {"time": 6065, "text": "And I think that that's perfectly adequate and we can build on it."}, {"time": 6069, "text": "And AI can play a similar role."}, {"time": 6073, "text": "I have to ask about beautiful artificial life systems or evolutionary computation systems."}, {"time": 6080, "text": "Cellular automata to me, I remember it was a game changer for me early on in life when I saw Conway's Game of Life who recently passed away, unfortunately."}, {"time": 6091, "text": "And it's beautiful how much complexity can emerge from such simple rules."}, {"time": 6100, "text": "I just don't, somehow that simplicity is such a powerful illustration and also humbling because it feels like I personally, from my perspective, understand almost nothing about this world because like my intuition fails completely how complexity can emerge from such simplicity."}, {"time": 6121, "text": "Like my intuition fails, I think, is the biggest problem I have."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "Do you find systems like that beautiful?"}, {"time": 6128, "text": "Is there, do you think about cellular automata?"}, {"time": 6131, "text": "Because cellular automata don't really have, and many other artificial life systems don't necessarily have an objective."}, {"time": 6138, "text": "Maybe that's a wrong way to say it."}, {"time": 6141, "text": "It's almost like it's just evolving and creating."}, {"time": 6148, "text": "And there's not even a good definition of what it means to create something complex and interesting and surprising, all those words that you said."}, {"time": 6157, "text": "Is there some of those systems that you find beautiful?"}, {"time": 6161, "text": "And similarly, evolution does not have a goal."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "It is responding to current situation and survival then creates more complexity and therefore we have something that we perceive as progress but that's not what evolution is inherently set to do."}, {"time": 6180, "text": "And yeah, that's really fascinating how a simple set of rules or simple mappings can, how from such simple mappings, complexity can emerge."}, {"time": 6194, "text": "So it's a question of emergence and self organization."}, {"time": 6197, "text": "And the game of life is one of the simplest ones and very visual and therefore it drives home the point that it's possible that nonlinear interactions and this kind of complexity can emerge from them."}, {"time": 6214, "text": "And biology and evolution is along the same lines."}, {"time": 6217, "text": "We have simple representations."}, {"time": 6220, "text": "DNA, if you really think of it, it's not that complex."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "It's a long sequence of them, there's lots of them but it's a very simple representation."}, {"time": 6228, "text": "And similarly with evolutionary computation, whatever string or tree representation we have and the operations, the amount of code that's required to manipulate those, it's really, really little."}, {"time": 6240, "text": "And of course, game of life even less."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "So how complexity emerges from such simple principles, that's absolutely fascinating."}, {"time": 6249, "text": "The challenge is to be able to control it and guide it and direct it so that it becomes useful."}, {"time": 6255, "text": "And like game of life is fascinating to look at and evolution, all the forms that come out is fascinating but can we actually make it useful for us?"}, {"time": 6264, "text": "And efficient because if you actually think about each of the cells in the game of life as a living organism, there's a lot of death that has to happen to create anything interesting."}, {"time": 6274, "text": "And so I guess the question is for us humans that are mortal and then life ends quickly, we wanna kinda hurry up and make sure we take evolution, the trajectory that is a little bit more efficient than the alternatives."}, {"time": 6289, "text": "And that touches upon something we talked about earlier that evolution competition is very impatient."}, {"time": 6294, "text": "We have a goal, we want it right away whereas this biology has a lot of time and deep time and weak pressure and large populations."}, {"time": 6304, "text": "One great example of this is the novelty search."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "So evolutionary computation where you don't actually specify a fitness goal, something that is your actual thing that you want but you just reward solutions that are different from what you've seen before, nothing else."}, {"time": 6325, "text": "You actually discover things that are interesting and useful that way."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "Ken Stanley and Joel Lehmann did this one study where they actually tried to evolve walking behavior on robots."}, {"time": 6335, "text": "And that's actually, we talked about earlier where your robot actually failed in all kinds of ways and eventually discovered something that was a very efficient walk."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "And it was because they rewarded things that were different that you were able to discover something."}, {"time": 6350, "text": "And I think that this is crucial because in order to be really different from what you already have, you have to utilize what is there in a domain to create something really different."}, {"time": 6360, "text": "So you have encoded the fundamentals of your world and then you make changes to those fundamentals you get further away."}, {"time": 6369, "text": "So that's probably what's happening in these systems of emergence."}, {"time": 6374, "text": "That the fundamentals are there."}, {"time": 6377, "text": "And when you follow those fundamentals you get into points and some of those are actually interesting and useful."}, {"time": 6382, "text": "Now, even in that robotic Walker simulation there was a large set of garbage, but among them, there were some of these gems."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "And then those are the ones that somehow you have to outside recognize and make useful."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "But this kind of productive systems if you code them the right kind of principles I think that encode the structure of the domain then you will get to these solutions and discoveries."}, {"time": 6409, "text": "It feels like that might also be a good way to live life."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "So let me ask, do you have advice for young people today about how to live life or how to succeed in their career or forget career, just succeed in life from an evolution and computation perspective?"}, {"time": 6428, "text": "Yes, yes, definitely."}, {"time": 6431, "text": "Explore, diversity, exploration and individuals take classes in music, history, philosophy, math, engineering, see connections between them, travel, learn a language."}, {"time": 6450, "text": "I mean, all this diversity is fascinating and we have it at our fingertips today."}, {"time": 6455, "text": "It's possible, you have to make a bit of an effort because it's not easy, but the rewards are wonderful."}, {"time": 6462, "text": "Yeah, there's something interesting about an objective function of new experiences."}, {"time": 6467, "text": "So try to figure out, I mean, what is the maximally new experience I could have today?"}, {"time": 6476, "text": "And that sort of that novelty, optimizing for novelty for some period of time might be very interesting way to sort of maximally expand the sets of experiences you had and then ground from that perspective, like what will be the most fulfilling trajectory through life."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "Of course, the flip side of that is where I come from."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "Again, maybe Russian, I don't know."}, {"time": 6500, "text": "But the choice has a detrimental effect, I think, at least from my mind where scarcity has an empowering effect."}, {"time": 6511, "text": "So if I sort of, if I have very little of something and only one of that something, I will appreciate it deeply until I came to Texas recently and I've been pigging out on delicious, incredible meat."}, {"time": 6527, "text": "I've been fasting a lot, so I need to do that again."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "But when you fast for a few days, that the first taste of a food is incredible."}, {"time": 6536, "text": "So the downside of exploration is that somehow, maybe you can correct me, but somehow you don't get to experience deeply any one of the particular moments, but that could be a psychology thing."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "That could be just a very human peculiar, flaw."}, {"time": 6563, "text": "Yeah, I didn't mean that you superficially explore."}, {"time": 6566, "text": "I mean, you can."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "Explore deeply."}, {"time": 6568, "text": "Yeah, so you don't have to explore 100 things, but maybe a few topics where you can take a deep enough dive that you gain an understanding."}, {"time": 6579, "text": "You yourself have to decide at some point that this is deep enough."}, {"time": 6584, "text": "And I obtained what I can from this topic and now it's time to move on."}, {"time": 6591, "text": "And that might take years."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "People sometimes switch careers and they may stay on some career for a decade and switch to another one."}, {"time": 6600, "text": "You can do it."}, {"time": 6601, "text": "You're not pretty determined to stay where you are, but in order to achieve something, 10,000 hours makes, you need 10,000 hours to become an expert on something."}, {"time": 6613, "text": "So you don't have to become an expert, but they even develop an understanding and gain the experience that you can use later."}, {"time": 6619, "text": "You probably have to spend, like I said, it's not easy."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "You've got to spend some effort on it."}, {"time": 6624, "text": "Now, also at some point then, when you have this diversity and you have these experiences, exploration, you may want to, you may find something that you can't stay away from."}, {"time": 6635, "text": "Like for us, it was computers, it was AI."}, {"time": 6638, "text": "It was, you know, that I just have to do it."}, {"time": 6641, "text": "And I, you know, and then it will take decades maybe and you are pursuing it because you figured out that this is really exciting and you can bring in your experiences."}, {"time": 6651, "text": "And there's nothing wrong with that either, but you asked what's the advice for young people."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "That's the exploration part."}, {"time": 6657, "text": "And then beyond that, after that exploration, you actually can focus and build a career."}, {"time": 6663, "text": "And, you know, even there you can switch multiple times, but I think that diversity exploration is fundamental to having a successful career as is concentration and spending an effort where it matters."}, {"time": 6675, "text": "And, but you are in better position to make the choice when you have done your homework."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "Explored."}, {"time": 6681, "text": "So exploration precedes commitment, but both are beautiful."}, {"time": 6686, "text": "So again, from an evolutionary computation perspective, we'll look at all the agents that had to die in order to come up with different solutions in simulation."}, {"time": 6695, "text": "What do you think from that individual agent's perspective is the meaning of it all?"}, {"time": 6701, "text": "So far as humans, you're just one agent who's going to be dead, unfortunately, one day too soon."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "What do you think is the why of why that
