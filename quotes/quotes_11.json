[{"title": "Keoki Jackson: Lockheed Martin | Lex Fridman Podcast #33", "id": "anXep8kBOCg", "quotes": [{"time": 360, "text": "So maybe you can give a little bit of an overview of, so Lockheed Martin has partnered with a few years ago with Boeing to work with the DOD and NASA to build launch systems and rockets with the ULA."}, {"time": 373, "text": "What's beyond that?"}, {"time": 375, "text": "What's Lockheed's mission timeline, long term dream in terms of space?"}, {"time": 379, "text": "You mentioned the moon, I've heard you talk about asteroids."}, {"time": 385, "text": "As Mars, what's the timeline?"}, {"time": 387, "text": "What's the engineering challenges and what's the dream long term?"}, {"time": 391, "text": "Yeah, I think the dream long term is to have a permanent presence in space beyond low earth orbit, ultimately with a long term presence on the moon and then to the planets, to Mars."}, {"time": 403, "text": "Sorry to interrupt on that."}, {"time": 405, "text": "So long term presence means..."}, {"time": 408, "text": "Sustained and sustainable presence in an economy, a space economy that really goes alongside that."}, {"time": 414, "text": "With human beings and being able to launch perhaps from those, so like hop?"}, {"time": 422, "text": "You know, there's a lot of energy that goes in those hops, right?"}, {"time": 426, "text": "So I think the first step is being able to get there and to be able to establish sustained bases, right?"}, {"time": 432, "text": "And build from there."}, {"time": 434, "text": "And a lot of that means getting, as you know, things like the cost of launch down and you mentioned United Launch Alliance."}, {"time": 443, "text": "And so I don't wanna speak for ULA, but obviously they're working really hard to on their next generation of launch vehicles to maintain that incredible mission success record that ULA has, but ultimately continue to drive down the cost and make the flexibility, the speed and the access ever greater."}, {"time": 466, "text": "So what's the missions that are in the horizon that you could talk to?"}, {"time": 471, "text": "Is there a hope to get to the moon?"}, {"time": 474, "text": "I mean, I think you know this, or you may know this, there's a lot of ways to accomplish some of these goals."}, {"time": 480, "text": "And so that's a lot of what's in discussion today."}, {"time": 483, "text": "But ultimately the goal is to be able to establish a base essentially in cislunar space that would allow for ready transfer from orbit to the lunar surface and back again."}, {"time": 499, "text": "And so that's sort of that near term, I say near term in the next decade or so vision, starting off with a stated objective by this administration to get back to the moon in the 2024, 2025 timeframe, which is right around the corner here."}, {"time": 517, "text": "How big of an engineering challenge is that?"}, {"time": 521, "text": "I think the big challenge is not so much to go, but to stay, right?"}, {"time": 526, "text": "And so we demonstrated in the 60s that you could send somebody up, do a couple of days of mission and bring them home again successfully."}, {"time": 535, "text": "Now we're talking about doing that, I'd say more to, I don't wanna say an industrial scale, but a sustained scale, right?"}, {"time": 541, "text": "So permanent habitation, regular reuse of vehicles, the infrastructure to get things like fuel, air, consumables, replacement parts, all the things that you need to sustain that kind of infrastructure."}, {"time": 560, "text": "So those are certainly engineering challenges, there are budgetary challenges, and those are all things that we're gonna have to work through."}, {"time": 570, "text": "The other thing, and I shouldn't, I don't wanna minimize this, I mean, I'm excited about human exploration, but the reality is our technology and where we've come over the last 40 years essentially has changed what we can do with robotic exploration as well."}, {"time": 588, "text": "And to me, it's incredibly thrilling, and this seems like old news now, but the fact that we have rovers driving around the surface of Mars and sending back data is just incredible."}, {"time": 601, "text": "The fact that we have satellites in orbit around Mars that are collecting weather, they're looking at the terrain, they're mapping, all of these kinds of things on a continuous basis, that's incredible."}, {"time": 612, "text": "And the fact that you got the time lag, of course, going to the planets, but you can effectively have virtual human presence there in a way that we have never been able to do before."}, {"time": 625, "text": "And now with the advent of even greater processing power, better AI systems, better cognitive systems and decision systems, you put that together with the human piece and we've really opened up the solar system in a whole different way."}, {"time": 642, "text": "And I'll give you an example, we've got OSIRIS REx, which is a mission to the asteroid Bennu."}, {"time": 647, "text": "So the spacecraft is out there right now on basically a year mapping activity to map the entire surface of that asteroid in great detail."}, {"time": 659, "text": "You know, all autonomously piloted, right?"}, {"time": 662, "text": "But the idea then that, and this is not too far away, it's gonna go in, it's got a sort of fancy vacuum cleaner with a bucket, it's gonna collect the sample off the asteroid and then send it back here to Earth."}, {"time": 674, "text": "And so, you know, we have gone from sort of those tentative steps in the 70s, you know, early landings, video of the solar system to now we've sent spacecraft to Pluto, we have gone to comets and brought and intercepted comets, we've brought stardust, you know, material back."}, {"time": 697, "text": "So that's, we've gone far and there's incredible opportunity to go even farther."}, {"time": 703, "text": "So it seems quite crazy that this is even possible, that can you talk a little bit about what it means to orbit an asteroid and with a bucket to try to pick up some soil samples?"}, {"time": 718, "text": "Yeah, so part of it is just kind of the, you know, these are the same kinds of techniques we use here on Earth for high speed, high accuracy imagery, stitching these scenes together and creating essentially high accuracy world maps, right?"}, {"time": 737, "text": "And so that's what we're doing, obviously, on a much smaller scale with an asteroid."}, {"time": 743, "text": "But the other thing that's really interesting, you put together sort of that neat control and, you know, data and imagery problem."}, {"time": 753, "text": "But the stories around how we designed the collection, I mean, as essentially, you know, this is the sort of the human ingenuity element, right?"}, {"time": 761, "text": "That, you know, essentially had an engineer who had a, one day he's like, oh, starts messing around with parts, vacuum cleaner, bucket, you know, maybe we could do something like this."}, {"time": 773, "text": "And that was what led to what we call the pogo stick collection, right?"}, {"time": 777, "text": "Where basically a thing comes down, it's only there for seconds, does that collection, grabs the, essentially blows the regolith material into the collection hopper and off it goes."}, {"time": 790, "text": "It doesn't really land almost."}, {"time": 792, "text": "It's a very short landing."}, {"time": 793, "text": "Wow, that's incredible."}, {"time": 795, "text": "So what is, in those, we talked a little bit more about space, what's the role of the human in all of this?"}, {"time": 804, "text": "What are the challenges?"}, {"time": 805, "text": "What are the opportunities for humans as they pilot these vehicles in space?"}, {"time": 813, "text": "And for humans that may step foot on either the moon or Mars?"}, {"time": 821, "text": "Yeah, it's a great question because, you know, I just have been extolling the virtues of robotic and, you know, rovers, autonomous systems, and those absolutely have a role."}, {"time": 833, "text": "I think the thing that we don't know how to replace today is the ability to adapt on the fly to new information."}, {"time": 842, "text": "And I believe that will come, but we're not there yet."}, {"time": 847, "text": "There's a ways to go."}, {"time": 848, "text": "And so, you know, you think back to Apollo 13 and the ingenuity of the folks on the ground and on the spacecraft essentially cobbled together a way to get the carbon dioxide scrubbers to work."}, {"time": 863, "text": "Those are the kinds of things that ultimately, you know, and I'd say not just from dealing with anomalies, but, you know, dealing with new information."}, {"time": 873, "text": "You see something and rather than waiting 20 minutes or half an hour, an hour to try to get information back and forth, but be able to essentially revector on the fly, collect, you know, different samples, take a different approach, choose different areas to explore."}, {"time": 892, "text": "Those are the kinds of things that human presence enables that is still a ways ahead of us on the AI side."}, {"time": 900, "text": "Yeah, there's some interesting stuff we'll talk about on the teaming side here on Earth."}, {"time": 904, "text": "That's pretty cool to explore."}, {"time": 906, "text": "And in space, let's not leave the space piece out."}, {"time": 908, "text": "So what does teaming, what does AI and humans working together in space look like?"}, {"time": 913, "text": "Yeah, one of the things we're working on is a system called Maya, which is, you think of it, so it's an AI assistant."}, {"time": 921, "text": "In space, exactly."}, {"time": 924, "text": "And you think of it as the Alexa in space, right?"}, {"time": 928, "text": "But this goes hand in hand with a lot of other developments."}, {"time": 931, "text": "And so today's world, everything is essentially model based, model based systems engineering to the actual digital tapestry that goes through the design, the build, the manufacture, the testing, and ultimately the sustainment of these system."}, {"time": 983, "text": "And it's not just, you know, dealing with problems as they come up, but also offering up opportunities for additional exploration capability, for example."}, {"time": 992, "text": "So that's the vision is that, you know, these are gonna take the best of the human to respond to changing circumstances and rely on the best of AI capabilities to monitor these, you know, this almost infinite number of data points and correlations of data points that humans frankly aren't that good at."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "So how do you develop systems in space like this, whether it's Alexa in space or in general, any kind of control systems, any kind of intelligent systems when you can't really test stuff too much out in space?"}, {"time": 1028, "text": "It's very expensive to test stuff."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So how do you develop such systems?"}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Yeah, that's the beauty of this digital twin, if you will."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And of course, with Lockheed Martin, we've over the past, you know, five plus decades been refining our knowledge of the space environment, of how materials behave, dynamics, the controls, the radiation environments, all of these kinds of things."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "So we're able to create very sophisticated models."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "They're not perfect, but they're very good."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "And so you can actually do a lot."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "I spent part of my career, you know, simulating communication spacecraft, you know, missile warning spacecraft, GPS spacecraft in all kinds of scenarios and all kinds of environments."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So this is really just taking that to the next level."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "The interesting thing is that now you're bringing into that loop a system depending on how it's developed that may be non deterministic, it may be learning as it goes."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "And in fact, we anticipate that it will be learning as it goes."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "And so that brings a whole new level of interest, I guess, into how do you do verification and validation of these non deterministic learning systems in scenarios that may go out of the bounds or the envelope that you have initially designed them to."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "So had this system and its intelligence has the same complexity, some of the same complexity human does and learns over time, it's unpredictable in certain kinds of ways in the, so you still, you also have to model that when you're thinking about it."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "So in your thoughts, it's possible to model the majority of situations, the important aspects of situations here on earth and in space enough to test stuff?"}, {"time": 1142, "text": "Yeah, this is really an active area of research and we're actually funding university research in a variety of places, including MIT."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "This is in the realm of trust and verification and validation of I'd say autonomous systems in general and then as a subset of that autonomous systems that incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "And this is not an easy problem."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "We're working with startup companies, we've got internal R&D, but our conviction is that autonomy and more and more AI enabled autonomy is gonna be in everything that Lockheed Martin develops and fields and it's gonna be retrofitting it."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Autonomy and AI are gonna be retrofit into existing systems, they're gonna be part of the design for all of our future systems."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "And so maybe I should take a step back and say the way we define autonomy."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "So we talk about autonomy essentially a system that composes, selects and then executes decisions with varying levels of human intervention."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "And so you could think of no autonomy."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "So this is essentially the human doing the task."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "You can think of effectively partial autonomy where the human is in the loop."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "So making decisions in every case about what the autonomous system can do."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "Either in the cockpit or remotely."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "Or remotely, exactly, but still in that control loop."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "And then there's what you'd call supervisory autonomy."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "So the autonomous system is doing most of the work, the human can intervene to stop it or to change the direction."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And then ultimately full autonomy where the human is off the loop altogether."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And for different types of missions wanna have different levels of autonomy."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "So now take that spectrum and this conviction that autonomy and more and more AI are in everything that we develop."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "The kinds of things that Lockheed Martin does, a lot of times are safety of life critical kinds of missions."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "You think about aircraft, for example."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "And so we require and our customers require an extremely high level of confidence."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "One, that we're gonna protect life."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "Two, that these systems will behave in ways that their operators can understand."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "And so this gets into that whole field."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Again, being able to verify and validate that the systems have been and that they will operate the way they're designed and the way they're expected."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "And furthermore, that they will do that in ways that can be explained and understood."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "And that is an extremely difficult challenge."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "Yeah, so here's a difficult question."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "I don't mean to bring this up, but I think it's a good case study that people are familiar with the Boeing 737 Max commercial airplane has had two recent crashes where their flight control software system failed and it's software."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "So I don't mean to speak about Boeing, but broadly speaking, we have this in the autonomous vehicle space too, semi autonomous."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "We have millions of lines of code software making decisions."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "There is a little bit of a clash of cultures because software engineers don't have the same culture of safety often that people who build systems like at Lockheed Martin do where it has to be exceptionally safe, you have to test this on."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "So how do we get this right when software is making so many decisions?"}, {"time": 1373, "text": "Yeah, and there's a lot of things that have to happen."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "And by and large, I think it starts with the culture, which is not necessarily something that A, is taught in school or B is something that would come, depending on what kind of software you're developing, it may not be relevant, right?"}, {"time": 1393, "text": "If you're targeting ads or something like that."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "So, and by and large, I'd say not just Lockheed Martin, but certainly the aerospace industry as a whole has developed a culture that does focus on safety, safety of life, operational safety, mission success."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "But as you note, these systems have gotten incredibly complex."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "And so they're to the point where it's almost impossible, you know, state spaces become so huge that it's impossible to, or very difficult to do a systematic verification across the entire set of potential ways that an aircraft could be flown, all the conditions that could happen, all the potential failure scenarios."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "Now, maybe that's soluble one day, maybe when we have our quantum computers at our fingertips, we'll be able to actually simulate across an entire, you know, almost infinite state space."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "But today, you know, there's a lot of work to really try to bound the system, to make sure that it behaves in predictable ways, and then have this culture of continuous inquiry and skepticism and questioning to say, did we really consider the right realm of possibilities?"}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Have we done the right range of testing?"}, {"time": 1480, "text": "Do we really understand, you know, in this case, you know, human and machine interactions, the human decision process alongside the machine processes?"}, {"time": 1489, "text": "And so that's that culture, we call it the culture of mission success at Lockheed Martin that really needs to be established."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "And it's not something, you know, it's something that people learn by living in it."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And it's something that has to be promulgated, you know, and it's done, you know, from the highest levels at a company of Lockheed Martin, like Lockheed Martin."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Yeah, and the same is being faced at certain autonomous vehicle companies where that culture is not there because it started mostly by software engineers."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "So that's what they're struggling with."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "Is there lessons that you think we should learn as an industry and a society from the Boeing 737 MAX crashes?"}, {"time": 1530, "text": "These crashes obviously are tremendous tragedies."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "They're tragedies for all of the people, the crew, the families, the passengers, the people on the ground involved."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "And, you know, it's also a huge business and economic setback as well."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "I mean, you know, we've seen that it's impacting essentially the trade balance of the US."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "So these are important questions."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "And these are the kinds that, you know, we've seen similar kinds of questioning at times."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "You know, you go back to the Challenger accident."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "And it is, I think, always important to remind ourselves that humans are fallible, that the systems we create, as perfect as we strive to make them, we can always make them better."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And so another element of that culture of mission success is really that commitment to continuous improvement."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "If there's something that goes wrong, a real commitment to root cause and true root cause understanding, to taking the corrective actions and to making the future systems better."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "And certainly we strive for, you know, no accidents."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "And if you look at the record of the commercial airline industry as a whole and the commercial aircraft industry as a whole, you know, there's a very nice decaying exponential to years now where we have no commercial aircraft accidents at all, right?"}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Fatal accidents at all."}, {"time": 1624, "text": "So that didn't happen by accident."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "It was through the regulatory agencies, FAA, the airframe manufacturers really working on a system to identify root causes and drive them out."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "So maybe we can take a step back and many people are familiar, but Lockheed Martin broadly, what kind of categories of systems are you involved in building?"}, {"time": 1654, "text": "You know, Lockheed Martin, we think of ourselves as a company that solves hard mission problems."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "And the output of that might be an airplane or a spacecraft or a helicopter or a radar or something like that."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "But ultimately we're driven by these, you know, what is our customer?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "What is that mission that they need to achieve?"}, {"time": 1672, "text": "And so that's what drove the SR71, right?"}, {"time": 1675, "text": "How do you get pictures of a place where you've got sophisticated air defense systems that are capable of handling any aircraft that was out there at the time, right?"}, {"time": 1687, "text": "So that, you know, that's what yielded an SR71."}, {"time": 1690, "text": "Let's build a nice flying camera."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "And make sure it gets out and it gets back, right?"}, {"time": 1695, "text": "And that led ultimately to really the start of the space program in the US as well."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "So now take a step back to Lockheed Martin of today."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "And we are, you know, on the order of 105 years old now between Lockheed and Martin, the two big heritage companies."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "Of course, we're made up of a whole bunch of other companies that came in as well."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "General Dynamics, you know, kind of go down the list."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "Today, you can think of us in this space of solving mission problems."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "So obviously on the aircraft side, tactical aircraft, building the most advanced fighter aircraft that the world has ever seen."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "We're up to now several hundred of those delivered, building almost a hundred a year."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And of course, working on the things that come after that."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "On the space side, we are engaged in pretty much every venue of space utilization and exploration you can imagine."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "So I mentioned things like navigation and timing GPS, communication satellites, missile warning satellites."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "We've built commercial surveillance satellites."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "We've built commercial communication satellites."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "We do civil space."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "So everything from human exploration to the robotic exploration of the outer planets."}, {"time": 1775, "text": "And keep going on the space front."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "But a couple of other areas that I'd like to put out, we're heavily engaged in building critical defensive systems."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "And so a couple that I'll mention, the Aegis Combat System."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "This is basically the integrated air and missile defense system for the US and allied fleets."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "And so protects carrier strike groups, for example, from incoming ballistic missile threats, aircraft threats, cruise missile threats, and kind of go down the list."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "So the carriers, the fleet itself is the thing that is being protected."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "The carriers aren't serving as a protection for something else."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "Well, that's a little bit of a different application."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "We've actually built the version called Aegis Ashore, which is now deployed in a couple of places around the world."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So that same technology, I mean, basically can be used to protect either an ocean going fleet or a land based activity."}, {"time": 1837, "text": "Another one, the THAAD program."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "So THAAD, this is the Theater High Altitude Area Defense."}, {"time": 1845, "text": "This is to protect relatively broad areas against sophisticated ballistic missile threats."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "And so now it's deployed with a lot of US capabilities."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "And now we have international customers that are looking to buy that capability as well."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "And so these are systems that defend, not just defend militaries and military capabilities, but defend population areas."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "We saw maybe the first public use of these back in the first Gulf War with the Patriot Systems."}, {"time": 1880, "text": "And these are the kinds of things that Lockheed Martin delivers."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "And there's a lot of stuff that goes into it."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "A lot of stuff that goes with it."}, {"time": 1889, "text": "So think about the radar systems and the sensing systems that cue these, the command and control systems that decide how you pair a weapon against an incoming threat."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "And then all the human and machine interfaces to make sure that they can be operated successfully in very strenuous environments."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "Yeah, there's some incredible engineering that at every front, like you said."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "So maybe if we just take a look at Lockheed history broadly, maybe even looking at Skunk Works."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "What are the biggest, most impressive milestones of innovation?"}, {"time": 1931, "text": "So if you look at stealth, I would have called you crazy if you said that's possible at the time."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And supersonic and hypersonic."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "So traveling at, first of all, traveling at the speed of sound is pretty damn fast."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "And supersonic and hypersonic, three, four, five times the speed of sound."}, {"time": 1952, "text": "That seems, I would also call you crazy if you say you can do that."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "So can you tell me how it's possible to do these kinds of things?"}, {"time": 1959, "text": "And is there other milestones and innovation that's going on that you can talk about?"}, {"time": 1965, "text": "Well, let me start on the Skunk Works saga."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "And you kind of alluded to it in the beginning."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "Skunk Works is as much an idea as a place."}, {"time": 1974, "text": "And so it's driven really by Kelly Johnson's 14 principles."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "And I'm not gonna list all 14 of them off, but the idea, and this I'm sure will resonate

really hard problems, you can do almost anything."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "Especially if you kind of shield them from bureaucratic influences, if you create very tight relationships with your customers so that you have that team and shared vision with the customer."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "Those are the kinds of things that enable the Skunk Works to do these incredible things."},

general officer and saying, would you like to have an aircraft that has the radar cross section of this ball bearing?"}, {"time": 2041, "text": "Probably one of the least expensive and most effective marketing campaigns in the history of the industry."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "So just for people that are not familiar, the way you detect aircraft, I'm sure there's a lot of ways, but radar for the longest time, there's a big blob that appears in the radar."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "How do you make a plane disappear so it looks as big as a ball bearing?"}, {"time": 2066, "text": "What's involved in technology wise there?"}, {"time": 2068, "text": "What's the broadly sort of the stuff you can speak about?"}, {"time": 2072, "text": "I'll stick to what's in Ben Rich's book."}, {"time": 2074, "text": "But obviously the geometry of how radar gets reflected and the kinds of materials that either reflect or absorb are kind of the couple of the critical elements there."}, {"time": 2086, "text": "And it's a cat and mouse game, right?"}, {"time": 2088, "text": "I mean, you know, radars get better, stealth capabilities get better."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "And so it's a really a game of continuous improvement and innovation there."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "I'll leave it at that."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "Yeah, so the idea that something is essentially invisible is quite fascinating."}, {"time": 2106, "text": "But the other one is flying fast."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "So speed of sound is 750, 60 miles an hour."}, {"time": 2115, "text": "So supersonic is three, you know, Mach three, something like that."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "Yeah, we talk about the supersonic obviously, and we kind of talk about that as that realm from Mach one up through about Mach five and then hypersonic."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "So, you know, high supersonic speeds would be past Mach five."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "And you got to remember Lockheed Martin and actually other companies have been involved in hypersonic development since the late 60s."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "You know, you think of everything from the X 15 to the space shuttle as examples of that."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "I think the difference now is if you look around the world, particularly the threat environment that we're in today, you're starting to see, you know, publicly, folks like the Russians and the Chinese saying they have hypersonic weapons capability that could threaten US and allied capabilities."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And also basically, you know, the claims are these could get around defensive systems that are out there today."}, {"time": 2181, "text": "And so there's a real sense of urgency."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "You hear it from folks like the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, Dr. Mike Griffin, and others in the department of defense that hypersonics is something that's really important to the nation in terms of both

had a heritage in, we've invested R and D dollars on our side for many years."}, {"time": 2213, "text": "And we have a number of things going on with various US government customers in that field today that we're very excited about."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "So I would anticipate we'll be hearing more about that in the future from our customers."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "And I've actually haven't read much about this."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "Probably you can't talk about much of it at all, but on the defensive side, it's a fascinating problem of perception of trying to detect things that are really hard to see."}, {"time": 2238, "text": "Can you comment on how hard that problem is and how hard is it to stay ahead, even if we go back a few decades, stay ahead of the competition?"}, {"time": 2250, "text": "Well, maybe I'd, again, you gotta think of these as ongoing capability development."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "And so think back to the early days of missile defense."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "So this would be in the 80s, the SDI program."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "And in that timeframe, we proved and Lockheed Martin proved that you could hit a bullet with a bullet, essentially, and which is something that had never been done before to take out an incoming ballistic missile."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "And so that's led to these incredible hit to kill kinds of capabilities, PAC 3."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "That's the Patriot Advanced Capability Model 3 that Lockheed Martin builds, the THAAD system that I talked about."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "So now hypersonics, they're different from ballistic systems."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "And so we gotta take the next step in defensive capability."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "I can, I'll leave that there, but I can only imagine."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "Now, let me just comment sort of as an engineer, it's sad to know that so much that Lockheed has done in the past is classified or today, and it's shrouded in secrecy."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "It has to be by the nature of the application."}, {"time": 2326, "text": "So like what I do, so what we do here at MIT, we would like to inspire young engineers, young scientists, and yet in the Lockheed case, some of that engineer has to stay quiet."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "How does that make you feel?"}, {"time": 2342, "text": "Is there a future where more can be shown or is it just the nature of this world that it has to remain secret?"}, {"time": 2353, "text": "It's a good question."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "I think the public can see enough of, and including students who may be in grade school, high school, college today, to understand the kinds of really hard problems that we work on."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "And I mean, look at the F35, right?"}, {"time": 2376, "text": "And obviously a lot of the detailed performance levels are sensitive and controlled."}, {"time": 2383, "text": "But we can talk about what an incredible aircraft this is, supersonic, super cruise, kind of a fighter, stealth capabilities."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "It's a flying information system in the sky with data fusion, sensor fusion capabilities that have never been seen before."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "So these are the kinds of things that I believe, these are the kinds of things that got me excited when I was a student."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "I think these still inspire students today."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "And the other thing I'd say, I mean, people are inspired by space."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "People are inspired by aircraft."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "Our employees are also inspired by that sense of mission."}, {"time": 2425, "text": "And I'll just give you an example."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "I had the privilege to work and lead our GPS programs for some time."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "And that was a case where I actually worked on a program that touches billions of people every day."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "And so when I said, I worked on GPS, everybody knew what I was talking about, even though they didn't maybe appreciate the technical challenges that went into that."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "But I'll tell you, I got a briefing one time from a major in the Air Force."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "And he said, I go by callsign GIMP, GPS is my passion."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "I love GPS."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "And he was involved in the operational test of the system."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "And he said, I was out in Iraq, and I was on a helicopter, Blackhawk helicopter, and I was bringing back a sergeant and a handful of troops from a deployed location."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "And he said, my job is GPS."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "So I asked that sergeant, and he's beaten down and kind of half asleep."}, {"time": 2491, "text": "And I said, what do you think about GPS?"}, {"time": 2494, "text": "And he brightened up, his eyes lit up, and he said, well, GPS, that brings me and my troops home every day."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "And that's the kind of story where it's like, okay, I'm really making a difference here in the kind of work."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "So that mission piece is really important."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "The last thing I'll say is, and this gets to some of these questions around advanced technologies."}, {"time": 2516, "text": "It's not, they're not just airplanes and spacecraft anymore."}, {"time": 2520, "text": "For people who are excited about advanced software capabilities, about AI, about bringing machine learning, these are the things that we're doing to exponentially increase the mission capabilities that go on those platforms."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "And those are the kinds of things that I think are more and more visible to the public."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "Yeah, I think autonomy, especially in flight, is super exciting."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "Do you see a day, here we go, back into philosophy, future when most fighter jets will be highly autonomous to a degree where a human doesn't need to be in the cockpit in almost all cases?"}, {"time": 2560, "text": "Well, I mean, that's a world that to a certain extent we're in today."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "Now these are remotely piloted aircraft, to be sure."}, {"time": 2567, "text": "But we have hundreds of thousands of flight hours a year now in remotely piloted aircraft."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "And then if you take the F35, there are huge layers, I guess, in levels of autonomy built into that aircraft so that the pilot is essentially more of a mission manager rather than doing the data, the second to second elements of flying the aircraft."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "So in some ways it's the easiest aircraft in the world to fly."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And kind of a funny story on that."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "So I don't know if you know how aircraft carrier landings work, but basically there's what's called a tail hook and it catches wires on the deck of the carrier."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "And that's what brings the aircraft to a screeching halt, right?"}, {"time": 2619, "text": "And there's typically three of these wires."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "So if you miss the first, the second one, you catch the next one, right?"}, {"time": 2625, "text": "And we got a little criticism."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "I don't know how true this story is, but we got a little criticism."}, {"time": 2632, "text": "The F35 is so perfect, it always gets the second wires."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "We're wearing out the wire because it always hits that one."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "But that's the kind of autonomy that just makes these, essentially up levels what the human is doing to more of that mission manager."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "So much of that landing by the F35 is autonomous."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "Well, it's just, the control systems are such that you really have dialed out the variability that comes with all the environmental conditions."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "You're wearing it out."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "So my point is to a certain extent, that world is here today."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Do I think that we're gonna see a day anytime soon when there are no humans in the cockpit?"}, {"time": 2671, "text": "I don't believe that."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "But I do think we're gonna see much more human machine teaming, and we're gonna see that much more at the tactical edge."}, {"time": 2680, "text": "And we did a demo, and you asked about what the Skunk Works is doing these days."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "And so this is something I can talk about, but we did a demo with the Air Force Research Laboratory."}, {"time": 2691, "text": "We called it Have Raider."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "And so using an F16 as an autonomous wingman, and we demonstrated all kinds of maneuvers and various mission scenarios with the autonomous F16 being that so called loyal or trusted wingman."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "And so those are the kinds of things that, we've shown what is possible now."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "Given that you've up leveled that pilot to be a mission manager, now they can control multiple other aircraft."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "Think of them almost as extensions of your own aircraft flying alongside with you."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "So that's another example of how this is really coming to fruition."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "And then I mentioned the landings, but think about just the implications for humans and flight safety, and this goes a little bit back to the discussion we were having about how do you continuously improve the level of safety through automation while working through the complexities that automation introduces."}, {"time": 2753, "text": "So one of the challenges that you have in high performance fighter aircraft is what's called G lock."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "So this is G induced loss of consciousness."}, {"time": 2760, "text": "So you pull nine Gs, you're wearing a pressure suit, that's not enough to keep the blood going to your brain, you black out."}, {"time": 2767, "text": "And of course that's bad if you happen to be flying low, near the deck and in an obstacle or terrain environment."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "And so we developed a system in our aeronautics division called Auto Gcast, so autonomous ground collision avoidance system."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "And we built that into the F16."}, {"time": 2790, "text": "It's actually saved seven aircraft, eight pilots already in a relatively short time it's been deployed."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "It was so successful that the Air Force said, hey, we need to have this in the F35 right away."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "So we've actually done testing of that now on the F35."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "And we've also integrated an autonomous air collision avoidance system."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "So think the air to air problem."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "So now it's the integrated collision avoidance system."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "But these are the kinds of capabilities, I wouldn't call them AI."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "I mean, they're very sophisticated models of the aircraft dynamics coupled with the terrain models to be able to predict when essentially the pilot is doing something that is gonna take the aircraft or the pilot's not doing something in this case."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "But it just gives you an example of how autonomy can be really a lifesaver in today's world."}, {"time": 2845, "text": "It's like a autonomous automated emergency braking in cars."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "But is there any exploration of perception of, for example, detecting a G lock that the pilot is out?"}, {"time": 2859, "text": "So as opposed to perceiving the external environment to infer that the pilot is out, but actually perceiving the pilot directly."}, {"time": 2867, "text": "Yeah, this is one of those cases where you'd like to not take action if you think the pilot's there."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "And it's almost like systems that try to detect if a driver's falling asleep on the road, right?"}, {"time": 2877, "text": "With limited success."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "So, I mean, this is what I call the system of last resort, right?"}, {"time": 2883, "text": "Where if the aircraft has determined that it's going into the terrain, get it out of there."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "And this is not something that we're just doing in the aircraft world."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "And I wanted to highlight, we have a technology we call Matrix, but this is developed at Sikorsky Innovations."}, {"time": 2902, "text": "The whole idea there is what we call optimal piloting."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So not optional piloting or unpiloted, but optimal piloting."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "So an FAA certified system."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "So you have a high degree of confidence."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "It's generally pretty deterministic."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "So we know that it'll do in different situations, but effectively be able to fly a mission with two pilots, one pilot, no pilots."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "And you can think of it almost as like a dial of the level of autonomy that you want, but able, so it's running in the background at all times and able to pick up tasks, whether it's sort of autopilot kinds of tasks or more sophisticated path planning kinds of activities to be able to do things like, for example, land on an oil rig in the North Sea in bad weather, zero, zero conditions."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "And you can imagine, of course, there's a lot of military utility to capability like that."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "You could have an aircraft that you want to send out for a crewed mission, but then at night, if you want to use it to deliver supplies in an unmanned mode, that could be done as well."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "And so there's clear advantages there."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "But think about on the commercial side, if you're an aircraft taken, you're gonna fly out to this oil rig."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "If you get out there and you can't land, then you gotta bring all those people back, reschedule another flight, pay the overtime for the crew that you just brought back because they didn't get where they were going, pay for the overtime for the folks that are out there in the oil rig."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "This is real economic, these are dollars and cents kinds of advantages we're bringing in the commercial world as well."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "So here's a difficult question from the AI space that I would love it if you're able to comment."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "So a lot of this autonomy in AI you've mentioned just now has this empowering effect."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "One is the last resort, it keeps you safe."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "The other is there's a, with the teaming and in general, assistive AI."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "And I think there's always a race."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "So the world is full of, the world is complex."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "It's full of bad actors."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "So there's often a race to make sure that we keep this country safe, right?"}, {"time": 3048, "text": "But with AI, there is a concern that it's a slightly different race."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "Though there's a lot of people in the AI space that are concerned about the AI arms race."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "That as opposed to the United States becoming, having the best technology and therefore keeping us safe, even we lose ability to keep control of it."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "So this, the AI arms race getting away from all of us humans."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "So do you share this worry?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "Do you share this concern when we're talking about military applications that too much control and decision making capabilities giving to software or AI?"}, {"time": 3091, "text": "Well, I don't see it happening today."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And in fact, this is something from a policy perspective, it's obviously a very dynamic space, but the Department of Defense has put quite a bit of thought into that."}, {"time": 3104, "text": "And maybe before talking about the policy, I'll just talk about some of the why."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "And you alluded to it being a sort of a complicated and a little bit scary world out there, but there's some big things happening today."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "You hear a lot of talk now about a return to great powers competition, particularly around China and Russia with the US, but there are some other big players out there as well."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And what we've seen is the deployment of some very, I'd say concerning new weapon systems, particularly with Russia and breaching some of the IRBM, Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile Treaties, that's been in the news a lot."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "The building of islands, artificial islands in the South China Sea by the Chinese and then arming those islands."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "The annexation of Crimea by Russia, the invasion of Ukraine."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "So there's some pretty scary things."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "And then you add on top of that, the North Korean threat has certainly not gone away."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "There's a lot going on in the Middle East with Iran in particular."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "And we see this global terrorism threat has not abated."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "So there are a lot of reasons to look for technology to assist with those problems, whether it's AI or other technologies like hypersonics, which we discussed."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "So now let me give just a couple of hypotheticals."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "So people react sort of in the second timeframe, right?"}, {"time": 3204, "text": "Photon hitting your eye to movement is on the order of a few tenths of a second kinds of processing time."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "Roughly speaking, computers are operating in the nanosecond timescale, right?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "So just to bring home what that means, a nanosecond to a second is like a second to 32 years."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "So seconds on the battlefield, in that sense, literally are lifetimes."}, {"time": 3236, "text": "And so if you can bring an autonomous or AI enabled capability that will enable the human to shrink, maybe you've heard the term the OODA loop."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "So this whole idea that a typical battlefield decision is characterized by observe."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "So information comes in, orient."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "How does that, what does that mean in the context?"}, {"time": 3261, "text": "Decide, what do I do about it?"}, {"time": 3263, "text": "And then act, take that action."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "If you can use these capabilities to compress that OODA loop to stay inside what your adversary is doing, that's an incredible powerful force on the battlefield."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "That's a really nice way to put it, that the role of AI and computing in general has a lot to benefit from just decreasing from 32 years to one second, as opposed to on the scale of seconds and minutes and hours making decisions that humans are better at making."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "And it actually goes the other way too."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "So that's on the short timescale."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "So humans kind of work in the one second, two seconds to eight hours."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "After eight hours, you get tired, you gotta go to the bathroom, whatever the case might be."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "So there's this whole range of other things."}, {"time": 3309, "text": "Think about surveillance and guarding facilities."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "Think about moving material, logistics, sustainment."}, {"time": 3320, "text": "A lot of these, what they call dull, dirty and dangerous things that you need to have sustained activity, but it's sort of beyond the length of time that a human can practically do as well."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "So there's this range of things that are critical in military and defense applications that AI and autonomy are particularly well suited to."}, {"time": 3343, "text": "Now, the interesting question that you brought up is, okay, how do you make sure that stays within human control?"}, {"time": 3349, "text": "So that was the context for now the policy."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "And so there is a DOD directive called 3000.09 because that's the way we name stuff in this world."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "But I'd say it's well worth reading."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "It's only a couple of pages long, but it makes some key points."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "And so, and by the way, I mean, none of this is easy, but I'm just trying to lay kind of the picture of how the US has said, this is the way we're gonna treat AI and autonomous systems, that it's not a free for all."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "And like there are rules of war and rules of engagement with other kinds of systems, think chemical weapons, biological weapons, we need to think about the same sorts of implications."}, {"time": 3435, "text": "And this is something that's really important for Lockheed Martin."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "I mean, obviously we are a hundred percent complying with our customer and the policies and regulations, but I mean, AI is an incredible enabler, say within the walls of Lockheed Martin in terms of improving production efficiency, doing helping engineers, doing generative design, improving logistics, driving down energy costs."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "I mean, there are so many applications, but we're also very interested in some of the elements of ethical application within Lockheed Martin."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "So we need to make sure that things like privacy is taken care of, that we do everything we can to drive out bias in AI enabled kinds of systems, that we make sure that humans are involved in decisions, that we're not just delegating accountability to algorithms."}, {"time": 3490, "text": "And so for us, it all comes back, I talked about culture before, and it comes back to sort of the Lockheed Martin culture and our core values."}, {"time": 3499, "text": "And so it's pretty simple for us and do what's right, respect others, perform with excellence."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "And now how do we tie that back to the ethical principles will govern how AI is used within Lockheed Martin."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "And we actually have a world, pretty, so you might not know this, but there are actually awards for ethics programs."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "Lockheed Martin's had a recognized ethics program for many years."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "And this is one of the things that our ethics team is working with our engineering team on."}, {"time": 3527, "text": "One of the miracles to me, perhaps a layman, again, I was born in the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "So I have echoes, at least in my family history of World War II

find the dynamics of them."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "So these studies are pretty impressive and very detailed."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "So by the way, just a step back, you said that there may be

well."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "There's all these kinds of things."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "And this is like at all different levels of the cortex you're saying."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "This happens at the lowest level or the highest level."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "In fact, feedback connections are more prevalent in everywhere in the cortex."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And so one way to think about it, and there's a lot of evidence for this, is inference."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "So basically, if you have a model of the world and when some evidence comes in, what you are doing is inference."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "You are trying to now explain this evidence using your model of the world."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "And this inference includes projecting your model onto the

have competing models of the world that try to explain."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "What do you mean by explain away?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "So this is a classic example in graphical models, probabilistic models."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "What are those?"}, {"time": 1681, "text": "I think it's useful to mention because we'll talk about them more."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "So neural

knowledge, you can do inference in the right way."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "What is the best way to explain some set of evidence using this model that you encoded?"}, {"time": 1755, "text": "So when you encode the model, you are encoding the relationship between these different variables."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "How is the edge connected to the model of the object?"}, {"time": 1764, "text":

this?"}, {"time": 1917, "text": "This is the cortical microcircuits paper that I sent you a draft of."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "Of course, this is a lot of this."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "A lot of

a lot more intricate structure there."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "But even within an artificial neural network, you can think of feature detection plus pooling as one level."}, {"time": 2183, "text":

this one."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "But this whole podcast is just a touring test, a long touring test."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "So humans can figure it out with very few examples."}, {"time":

doesn't exist."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "So that is the magic of human perception."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "And Doug Hofstadter put this very beautifully in one of his talks."}, {"time": 3301,

for example, as opposed to like inference, which is with artificial neural networks, which is a single pass to the network."}, {"time": 3462, "text": "So like you're basically doing some basic forms of reasoning, like integration of like how local things fit into the global picture."}, {"time": 3474, "text": "And things like explaining a way coming into this one, because you are explaining that

temporally?"}, {"time": 3545, "text": "What's the dynamics of this inference process?"}, {"time": 3553, "text": "So you can think of it as you have at the top of the model, the characters that you are trained on."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "They are the causes that you are trying to explain the pixels using the characters as the causes."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "The characters are the things that cause the pixels."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "So there's this causality thing."}, {"time": 3573, "text": "So the reason you mentioned causality, I guess, is because there's a temporal aspect to this whole thing."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "In this particular case, the temporal aspect is not important."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "It is more like when if I turn the character on, the pixels will turn on."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "Yeah, it will be after this a little bit."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "So that is causality in the sense of like a logic causality, like hence inference."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "The dynamics is that even though locally it will look like, okay, this is an A."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "And locally, just when I look at just that patch of the image, it looks like an A."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "But when I look at it in the context of all the other causes, A is not something that makes sense."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "So that is something you have to kind of recursively figure out."}, {"time": 3617, "text": "And this thing performed pretty well on the CAPTCHAs."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "And I mean, is there some kind of interesting intuition you can provide why it did well?"}, {"time": 3632, "text": "Like what did it look like?"}, {"time": 3632, "text": "Is there visualizations that could be human interpretable to us humans?"}, {"time": 3637,

pixels in the input that makes me think that it is an A."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "And also, these are the portions I hallucinated."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "It provides a complete explanation of that form."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "And then these are the contours."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "This is the interior."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "And this is in front of this other object."},

of errors it makes are also, I don't want to read too much into it, but the kind of errors the network makes are very similar to the kinds of errors humans would make in a similar situation."},

capture problem, this idea?"}, {"time": 3724, "text": "Not really hardcoded because the assumptions, as I mentioned, are general, right?"}, {"time": 3724, "text": "It is more, and those themselves can be applied in many situations which are natural signals."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "So it's the foreground versus background factorization and the factorization of the surfaces versus the contours."},

training set can we take in order to do a reasonable job of the classification task?"}, {"time": 3845, "text": "Have you explored that angle in these classic benchmarks?"}, {"time": 3853, "text": "So we did do MNIST."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "So it's not just capture."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "So there was also multiple versions of MNIST, including the standard version where we inverted the

performance you remember, like how well did it do?"}, {"time": 3882, "text": "How many examples did it need?"}, {"time": 3882, "text": "I remember that it was on the order of tens or hundreds of

the cortical micros?"}, {"time": 3985, "text": "So the same model."}, {"time": 3985, "text": "So the important part of the model was that it trains very quickly with very little training data and it's

have things in common, right?"}, {"time": 4722, "text": "It is a backpropagation is one way of credit assignment."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "There is another algorithm called expectation maximization, which is, you know, another weight adjustment algorithm."}, {"time": 4735, "text": "But is it your sense the brain does something like this?"}, {"time": 4738, "text": "Has to."}, {"time": 4738, "text": "There is no way around it in the sense of saying that you do have to adjust the connections."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "So yeah, and you're saying credit assignment, you have to reward the connections that were useful in making a correct prediction and not, yeah, I guess what else, but yeah, it doesn't have to be differentiable."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "Yeah, it doesn't have to be differentiable."}, {"time": 4756, "text": "But you have to have a, you know, you have a model that you start with, you have data comes in and you have to have a way of adjusting the model such that it better fits the data."}, {"time": 4767, "text": "So that is all of learning, right?"}, {"time": 4773, "text": "And some of them can be using backprop to do that."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "Some of it can be using, you know, very local graph changes to do that."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "That can be, you know, many of these learning algorithms have similar update properties locally in terms of what the neurons need to do locally."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "I wonder if small differences in learning algorithms can have huge differences in the actual effect."}, {"time": 4801, "text": "So the dynamics of, I mean, sort of the reverse like spiking, like if credit assignment is like a lightning versus like a rainstorm or something, like whether there's like a looping local type of situation with the credit assignment, whether there is like regularization, like how it injects robustness into the whole thing, like whether it's chemical or electrical or mechanical."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "All those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "I feel like it, that, yeah, I feel like those differences could be essential, right?"}, {"time": 4842, "text": "It's just that you don't know enough to, on the learning side, you don't know, you don't know enough to say that is definitely not the way the brain does it."}, {"time": 4854, "text": "So you don't want to be stuck to it."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "So that, yeah."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "So you've been open minded on that side of things."}, {"time": 4864, "text": "On the inference side, on the recognition side, I am much more, I'm able to be constrained because it's much easier to do experiments because, you know, it's like, okay, here's the stimulus, you know, how many steps did it get to take the answer?"},

et cetera, much more readily on the inference side."}, {"time": 4883, "text": "And then you can't do good experiments on the learning side."}, {"time": 4888, "text": "So let's go right into the cortical microcircuits right back."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "So what are these ideas beyond recursive cortical network that you're looking at now?"}, {"time": 4902, "text": "So we have made a, you

reasoning?"}, {"time": 4924, "text": "Similar to some of the things Francois talked about, right?"}, {"time": 4924, "text": "So we have taken one pass through it basically saying, what is the basic cognitive architecture that you need to have, which has a perceptual system, which has a system that learns dynamics of the world and then has something like a routine program learning system on top of it to learn concepts."}, {"time": 4952, "text": "So we have built one, you know, the version point one of that system."}, {"time": 4952, "text": "This was another science robotics paper."},

the application there was on manipulation, robotic manipulation?"}, {"time": 4969, "text": "It was, so think of it like this."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "Suppose you wanted to tell a new person that

pictures."}, {"time": 4997, "text": "You can basically say, look, this is the starting state."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "The things are here."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "This is the ending state."},

language."}, {"time": 5035, "text": "So what's it mean for a concept to be pre language?"}, {"time": 5042, "text": "Like why is language so important here?"}, {"time": 5050, "text": "So I want to make a distinction between concepts that are just learned from text by just feeding brute force text."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "You can start extracting things like, okay, a cow is likely to be on grass."}, {"time": 5063, "text": "So those kinds of things, you can extract purely from text."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "But that's kind of a simple association thing rather than a concept as an abstraction of something that happens in the real world in a grounded way that I can simulate it in my mind and connect it back to the real world."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "And you think kind of the visual world, concepts in the visual world are somehow lower level than just the language?"}, {"time": 5098, "text": "The lower level kind of makes it feel like, okay, that's unimportant."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "It's more like, I would say the concepts in the visual and the motor system and the concept learning system, which if you cut off the language part, just what we learn by interacting with the world and abstractions from that, that is a prerequisite for any real language understanding."}, {"time": 5126, "text": "So you disagree with Chomsky because he says language is at the bottom of everything."}, {"time": 5132, "text": "No, I disagree with Chomsky completely on how many levels from universal grammar to..."}, {"time": 5139, "text": "So that was a paper in science beyond the

last thing that you will be actually solved."}, {"time": 5167, "text": "Because if you do not build perception system in the right way, you cannot build concept system in the right way."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "So you have to build a perception system, however wrong that might be, you have to still build that and learn concepts from there and then keep iterating."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "And finally, perception will get solved fully when perception, cognition, language, all those things work together finally."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "So great, we've talked a lot about perception, but

this classic example I give."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "So suppose I give you a few sentences and then ask you a question following that sentence."}, {"time": 5216, "text": "This is a natural language

this?"}, {"time": 5267, "text": "I could ask more and more questions about this and I can ask, make you simulate the scene in more and more detail, right?"}, {"time": 5273, "text": "Where is all that

5285, "text": "It is stored from the everyday experiences that you have had from, and by the age of five, you have pretty much all of this, right?"}, {"time": 5292, "text": "And it is stored in your visual system, motor system in a way such that it can be accessed through language."}, {"time": 5304, "text": "So the language is just almost sort of the query into the whole visual cortex and that does the whole feedback thing."}, {"time": 5310, "text": "But I mean, it is all reasoning kind of connected to the perception system in some way."}, {"time": 5316, "text": "You can do a lot of it."}, {"time": 5316, "text": "You know, you can still do a lot of it by quick associations without having to go into the depth."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "And most of the time you will be right, right?"},

actually run the simulation."}, {"time": 5340, "text": "So figuring out how these concepts connect."}, {"time": 5340, "text": "Do I have a good idea of how to do that?"}, {"time": 5346, "text": "That's exactly one of the problems that we are working on."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "And the way we are approaching that is basically saying, okay, you need to, so the takeaway is that language, is simulation control and your perceptual plus a motor system is building a simulation of the world."}, {"time": 5368, "text": "And so that's basically the way we are approaching it."}, {"time": 5368, "text": "And the first thing that we built was a controllable perceptual system."}, {"time": 5374, "text": "And we built a schema networks, which was a controllable dynamic system."}, {"time": 5380,

step of connecting it to language."}, {"time": 5391, "text": "And it will be very simple examples."}, {"time": 5391, "text": "Initially, it will not be the GPT3 like examples, but it will be grounded simulation based language."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "And for like the querying would be like question answering kind of thing?"}, {"time": 5408, "text": "And so that's what we're trying to do."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "We're trying to build a system kind of thing."}, {"time": 5413, "text": "And it will be in some simple world initially on, you know, but it will be about, okay, can the system connect the language and ground it in the right way and run the right simulations to come up with the answer."}, {"time": 5425, "text": "And the goal is to try to do things that, for example, GPT3 couldn't do."}, {"time": 5429, "text": "Speaking of which, if we could talk about GPT3 a little bit, I think it's an interesting thought provoking set of ideas that OpenAI is pushing forward."},

recently released very large 175 billion parameter language model?"}, {"time": 5458, "text": "So I haven't directly evaluated it yet."}, {"time": 5458, "text": "From what I have seen on Twitter and other people evaluating it, it looks very intriguing."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "I am very intrigued by some of the properties it is displaying."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "And of course the text generation part of that was already evident in GPT2 that it can generate coherent text over long distances."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "But of course the weaknesses are also pretty visible in saying that, okay, it is not really carrying a world state around."}, {"time": 5492, "text": "And sometimes you get sentences like, I went up the hill to reach the valley or the thing like some completely incompatible statements, or when you're traveling from one place to the other, it doesn't take into account the time of travel, things like that."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "So those things I think will happen less in GPT3 because it is trained on even more data and it can do even more longer distance coherence."}, {"time": 5519, "text": "But it will still have the fundamental limitations that it doesn't have a world model and it can't run simulations in its head to find whether something is true in the world or not."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "So it's taking a huge amount of text from the internet and forming a compressed representation."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "Do you think in that could emerge something that's an approximation of a world model, which essentially could be used for reasoning?"}, {"time": 5547, "text": "I'm not talking about GPT3, I'm talking about GPT4, 5 and GPT10."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "Yeah, I mean they will look more impressive than GPT3."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "So if you take that to the extreme then a Markov chain of just first order and if you go to, I'm taking the other extreme, if you read Shannon's book, he has a model of English text which is based on first order Markov chains, second order Markov chains, third order Markov chains and saying that okay, third order Markov chains look better than first order Markov chains."}, {"time": 5583, "text": "So does that mean a first order Markov chain has a model of the world?"}, {"time": 5589, "text": "So yes, in that level when you go higher order models or more sophisticated structure in the model like the transformer networks have, yes they have a model of the text world, but that is not a model of the world."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "It's a model of the text world and it will have interesting properties and it will be useful, but just scaling it up is not going to give us AGI or natural language understanding or meaning."}, {"time": 5621, "text": "Well the question is whether being forced to compress a very large amount of text forces you to construct things that are very much like, because the ideas of concepts and meaning is a spectrum."}, {"time": 5646, "text": "So in order to form that kind of compression, maybe it will be forced to figure out abstractions which look awfully a lot like the kind of things that we think about as concepts, as world models, as common sense."}, {"time": 5671, "text": "No, I don't think it is possible because the information is not there."}, {"time": 5674, "text": "The information is there behind the text, right?"}, {"time": 5678, "text": "No, unless somebody has written down all the details about how everything works in the world to the absurd amounts like, okay, it is easier to walk forward than backward, that you have to open the door to go out of the thing, doctors wear underwear."}, {"time": 5691, "text": "Unless all these things somebody has written down somewhere or somehow the program found it to be useful for compression from some other text, the information is not there."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "So that's an argument that text is a lot lower fidelity than the experience of our physical world."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "Right, correct."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "Pictures worth a thousand words."}, {"time": 5717, "text": "Well, in this case, pictures aren't really..."}, {"time": 5717, "text": "So the richest aspect of the physical world isn't even just pictures, it's the interactivity with the world."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "It's being able to interact."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "It's almost like..."}, {"time": 5736, "text": "It's almost like if you could interact... Well, maybe I agree with you that pictures worth a thousand words, but a thousand..."}, {"time": 5745, "text": "It's still... Yeah, you could capture it with the GPTX."}, {"time": 5749, "text": "So I wonder if there's some interactive element where a system could live in text world where it could be part of the chat, be part of talking to people."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "I mean, fundamentally..."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "So you're making a statement about the limitation of text."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "Okay, so let's say we have a text corpus that includes basically every experience we could possibly have."}, {"time": 5770, "text": "I mean, just a very large corpus of text and also interactive components."}, {"time": 5779, "text": "I guess the question is whether the neural network architecture, these very simple transformers, but if they had like hundreds of trillions or whatever comes after a trillion parameters, whether that could store the information needed, that's architecturally."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "Do you have thoughts about the limitation on that side of things with neural networks?"}, {"time": 5806, "text": "I mean, so transformers are still a feed forward neural network."}, {"time": 5812, "text": "It has a very interesting architecture, which is good for text modeling and probably some aspects of video modeling, but it is still a feed forward architecture."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "You believe in the feedback mechanism, the recursion."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "Oh, and also causality, being able to do counterfactual reasoning, being able to do interventions, which is actions in the world."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "So all those things require different kinds of models to be built."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "I don't think transformers captures that family."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "It is very good at statistical modeling of text and it will become better and better with more data, bigger models, but that is only going to get so far."}, {"time": 5855, "text": "So I had this joke on Twitter saying that, hey, this is a model that has read all of quantum mechanics and theory of relativity and we are asking you to do text completion or we are asking you to solve simple puzzles."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "When you have AGI, that is not what you ask the system to do."}, {"time": 5879, "text": "We will ask the system to do experiments and come up with hypothesis and revise the hypothesis based on evidence from experiments, all those things."},

button in HTML."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "Right, which are all useful."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "There is no dissing the usefulness of it."}, {"time": 5909, "text": "So by the way, I am playing a little bit of a devil's advocate, so calm down internet."}, {"time": 5917, "text": "So I am curious almost in which ways will a dumb but large neural network will surprise us."}, {"time": 5927, "text": "I completely agree with your intuition."}, {"time": 5927, "text": "It is just that I do not want to dogmatically 100% put all the chips there."}, {"time": 5938, "text": "We have been surprised so much."}, {"time": 5938, "text": "Even the current GPT2 and GPT3 are so surprising."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "The self play mechanisms of AlphaZero are really surprising."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "The fact that reinforcement learning works at all to me is really surprising."}, {"time": 5958, "text": "The fact that neural networks work at all is quite surprising given how nonlinear the space is, the fact that it is able to find local minima that are at all reasonable."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "It is very surprising."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "I wonder sometimes whether us humans just want for AGI not to be such a dumb thing."}, {"time": 5979, "text": "Because exactly what you are saying is like the ideas of concepts and be able to reason with those concepts and connect those concepts in hierarchical ways and then to be able to have world models."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "Just everything we are describing in human language in this poetic way seems to make sense."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "That is what intelligence and reasoning are like."}, {"time": 6011, "text": "I wonder if at the core of it, it could be much dumber."}, {"time": 6011, "text": "Well, finally it is still connections and messages passing over."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "So in that way it is dumb."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "So I guess the recursion, the feedback mechanism, that does seem to be a fundamental kind of thing."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "The idea of concepts."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "Also memory."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "Having an episodic memory."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "That seems to be an important thing."}, {"time": 6039, "text": "So how do we get memory?"}, {"time": 6039, "text": "So we have another piece of work which came out recently on how do you form episodic memories and form abstractions from them."}, {"time": 6052, "text": "And we haven't figured out all the connections of that to the overall cognitive architecture."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "But what are your ideas about how you could have episodic memory?"}, {"time": 6057, "text": "So at least it is very clear that you need to have two kinds of memory."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "That is very, very clear."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "There are things that happen as statistical patterns in the world, but then there is the one timeline of things that happen only once in your life."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "And this day is not going to happen ever again."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "And that needs to be stored as just a stream of strings."}, {"time": 6087, "text": "This is my experience."}, {"time": 6087, "text": "And then the question is about how do you take that experience and connect it to the statistical part of it?"}, {"time": 6096, "text": "How do you now say that, okay, I experienced this thing."}, {"time": 6100, "text": "Now I want to be careful about similar situations."}, {"time": 6107, "text": "So you need to be able to index that similarity using your other giants that is the model of the world that you have learned."}, {"time": 6117, "text": "Although the situation came from the episode, you need to be able to index the other one."}, {"time": 6122, "text": "So the episodic memory being implemented as an indexing over the other model that you're building."}, {"time": 6133, "text": "So the memories remain and they're indexed into the statistical thing that you form."}, {"time": 6144, "text": "Yeah, statistical causal structural model that you built over time."}, {"time": 6144, "text": "So it's basically the idea is that the hippocampus is just storing or sequencing a set of pointers that happens over time."}, {"time": 6161, "text": "And then whenever you want to reconstitute that memory and evaluate the different aspects of it, whether it was good, bad, do I need to encounter the situation again?"}, {"time": 6168, "text": "You need the cortex to reinstantiate, to replay that memory."}, {"time": 6175, "text": "So how do you find that memory?"}, {"time": 6175, "text": "Like which direction is the important direction?"}, {"time": 6180, "text": "Both directions are again, bidirectional."}, {"time": 6185, "text": "I mean, I guess how do you retrieve the memory?"}, {"time": 6185, "text": "So this is again, hypothesis."}, {"time": 6185, "text": "We're making this up."}, {"time": 6191, "text": "So when you come to a new situation, your cortex is doing inference over in the new situation."}, {"time": 6201, "text": "And then of course, hippocampus is connected to different parts of the cortex and you have this deja vu situation, right?"}, {"time": 6207, "text": "Okay, I have seen this thing before."}, {"time": 6207, "text": "And then in the hippocampus, you can have an index of, okay, this is when it happened as a timeline."}, {"time": 6215, "text": "And then you can use the hippocampus to drive the similar timelines to say now I am, rather than being driven by my current input stimuli, I am going back in time and rewinding my experience from there, putting back into the cortex."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "And then putting it back into the cortex of course affects what you're going to see next in your current situation."}, {"time": 6243, "text": "So that's the whole thing, having a world model and then yeah, connecting to the perception."}, {"time": 6249, "text": "Yeah, it does seem to be that that's what's happening."}, {"time": 6249, "text": "On the neural network side, it's interesting to think of how we actually do that."}, {"time": 6256, "text": "To have a knowledge base."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "It is possible that you can put many of these structures into neural networks and we will find ways of combining properties of neural networks and graphical models."}, {"time": 6271,

a bunch of disparate modules of, does it feel like if you create a rule and we'll talk about the Wolfram physics model, which is fascinating, but if you have a simple set of rules with a data

complicated, but let's say that there were two, quantum mechanics and general relativity."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "Quantum mechanics kind of 1900 was kind of the very early stuff done by Planck that led to the idea of photons, particles of light."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "But let's take general relativity first."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "One feature of the story is that special relativity thing Einstein invented in 1905 was something which surprisingly was a kind of logically invented theory."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "It was not a theory where it was something where given these ideas that were sort of axiomatically thought to be true about the world, it followed that such and such a thing would be the case."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "It was a little bit different from the kind of methodological structure of some existing theories in the more recent times, where it's just been, we write down an equation and we find out that it works."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "So what happened there."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "So there's some reasoning about the light."}, {"time": 3353, "text": "The basic idea was the speed of light appears to be constant."}, {"time": 3359, "text": "Even if you're traveling very fast, you shine a flashlight, the light will come out."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "Even if you're going at half the speed of light, the light doesn't come out of your flashlight at one and a half times the speed of light."}, {"time": 3371, "text": "It's still just the speed of light."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "And to make that work, you have to change your view of how space and time work to be able to account for the fact that when you're going faster, it appears that length is foreshortened and time is dilated and things like this."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "And that's special relativity."}, {"time": 3387, "text": "That's special relativity."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "So then Einstein went on with sort of vaguely similar kinds of thinking."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "In 1915, invented general relativity, which is the theory of gravity."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "And the basic point of general relativity is it's a theory that says, when there is mass in space, space is curved."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "And what does that mean?"}, {"time": 3412, "text": "Usually you think of what's the shortest distance between two points."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "Like ordinarily on a plane in space, it's a straight line."}, {"time": 3420, "text": "Photons, light goes in straight lines."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "Well, then the question is, is if you have a curved surface, a straight line is no longer straight."}, {"time": 3432, "text": "On the surface of the earth, the shortest distance between two points is a great circle."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "It's a circle."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "So, you know, Einstein's observation was maybe the physical structure of space is such that space is curved."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "So the shortest distance between two points, the path, the straight line in quotes, won't be straight anymore."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "And in particular, if a photon is, you know, traveling near the sun or something, or if a particle is going, something is traveling near the sun, maybe the shortest path will be one that is something which looks curved to us because it seems curved to us because space has been deformed by the presence of mass associated with that massive object."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "So the kind of the idea there is, think of the structure of space as being a dynamical changing kind of thing."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "But then what Einstein did was he wrote down these differential equations that basically represented the curvature of space and its response to the presence of mass and energy."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "And that ultimately is connected to the force of gravity, which is one of the forces that seems to, based on its strength, operate on a different scale than some of the other forces."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "So it operates in a scale that's very large."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "What happens there is just this curvature of space, which causes, you know, the paths of objects to be deflected."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "That's what gravity does."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "It causes the paths of objects to be deflected."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "And this is an explanation for gravity, so to speak."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "And the surprise is that from 1915 until today, everything that we've measured about gravity precisely agrees with general relativity."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "And that, you know, it wasn't clear black holes were sort of a predict, well, actually the expansion of the universe was an early potential prediction, although

it turns out it was expanding and he should have just trusted the equations."}, {"time": 3551, "text": "And that's a lesson for those of us interested in making fundamental theories of physics is you should trust your theory and not try and patch it because of something that you think might be the case that might turn out not to be the case."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "Even if the theory says something crazy is happening."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "Like the universe is expanding."}, {"time": 3570, "text": "Like the universe is expanding, right, which is, but, you know, then it took until the 1940s, probably even really until the 1960s, until people understood that black holes were a consequence of general relativity and so on."}, {"time": 3582, "text": "But that's, you know, the big surprise has been that so far this theory of gravity has perfectly agreed with, you know, these collisions of black holes seen by their gravitational waves, you know, it all just works."}, {"time": 3595, "text": "So that's been kind of one pillar of the story of physics it's mathematically complicated to work out the consequences of general relativity, but it's not, there's no, I mean, and some things are kind of squiggly and complicated."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "Like people believe, you know, energy is conserved."}, {"time": 3612, "text": "Okay, well, energy conservation doesn't really work in general activity in the same way as it ordinarily does."}, {"time": 3616, "text": "And it's all a big mathematical story of how you actually nail down something that is definitive that you can talk about it and not specific to the, you know, reference frames you're operating in and so on and so on and so on."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "But fundamentally, general relativity is a straight shot in the sense that you have this theory, you work out its consequences."}, {"time": 3634, "text": "And that theory is useful in terms of basic science and trying to understand the way black holes work,

of, well, no, not at the Big Bang actually, right?"}, {"time": 3652, "text": "But the... Well, features of the expansion of the universe, yes."}, {"time": 3655, "text": "I mean, and there are lots of details where we don't quite know how it's working, you know, is there, you know, where's the dark matter, is there dark energy, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 3664, "text": "But fundamentally, the, you know, the testable features of general relativity, it all works very beautifully."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "And it's in a sense, it is mathematically sophisticated, but it is not conceptually hard to understand in some sense."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "So that's

work out."}, {"time": 4655, "text": "We don't have the mathematical tools in our time, which was 1940s, 1950s and so on to explore this."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "Like the way he thought, you mean that there is something very, very small and discrete that's underlying space."}, {"time": 4673, "text": "And that means that, so, you know, the mathematical theory, mathematical theories in physics assume that space can be described just as a continuous thing."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "You can just pick coordinates and the coordinates can have any values."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "And that's

space as in what we experience in the universe."}, {"time": 4714, "text": "So that you think this 3D aspect of it is fundamental."}, {"time": 4718, "text": "No, I don't think that 3D is fundamental at all, actually."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "I think that the thing that has been assumed is that space is this continuous thing where you can just describe it by, let's say three numbers, for instance."}, {"time": 4731, "text": "But most important thing about that is that you can describe it by precise numbers because you can pick any point in space and you can talk about motions, any infinitesimal motion in space."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "And that's what continuous means."}, {"time": 4743, "text": "That's what continuous means."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "That's what, you know,

not right at the level of the machine code, so to speak."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "Machine code."}, {"time": 4771, "text": "Yeah, of the simulation."}, {"time": 4773, "text": "They're the very lowest level of the fabric of the universe, at least under the Wolfram physics model is your senses is discrete."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "So now what does that mean?"}, {"time": 4786, "text": "So it means what is space then?"}, {"time": 4789, "text": "So in models, the basic idea is you say there are these sort of atoms of space."}, {"time": 4796, "text": "They're these points that represent, you know,

just, here's a big bag of points."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "Like in our universe, there might be 10 to the 100 of these points."}, {"time": 4818, "text": "And all we know is this point is connected to this other point."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "So it's like, you know, all we have is the friend network, so to speak."}, {"time": 4825, "text": "We don't have, you know, people's, you know, physical

answer is, by the time you have 10 to the 100 of these things, those connections can work in such a way that on a large scale, it will seem to be like continuous space in let's say three dimensions or some other number of dimensions or 2.6 dimensions or whatever else."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "Because they're much, much, much, much larger."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "So like the number of relationships here we're talking about is just a humongous amount."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "So the kind of thing you're talking about is very, very, very small relative to our experience of daily life."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "Right, so I mean, you know, we don't know exactly the size, but maybe 10 to the minus, maybe around 10 to the minus 100 meters."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "So, you know, the size of, to give a comparison, the size of a proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters."}, {"time": 4898, "text": "And so this is something incredibly tiny compared to that."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "And the idea that from that would emerge the experience of continuous space is mind blowing."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "Well, what's your intuition why that's possible?"}, {"time": 4913,

structure of neighbors on a computer screen."}, {"time": 4966, "text": "There's no concept of spatial, of space inherent in the underlying fabric of reality."}, {"time": 4976, "text": "So the point is that, but there are cases where there are."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "So for example, let's just imagine you have a square grid."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "Okay, and at every point on the grid, you have one of these atoms of space and it's connected to four other, four other atoms of space on the, you know, Northeast, Southwest corners, right?"}, {"time": 4994, "text": "There you have something where if you zoom out from that, it's like a computer screen."}, {"time": 4999, "text": "Yeah, so the relationship creates the spatial, like the relationship creates a constraint, which then in an emergent sense creates a like, yeah, like basically a spatial coordinate for that thing."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "Even though the individual point doesn't have a space."}, {"time": 5020, "text": "Even though the individual point doesn't know anything, it just knows what its neighbors are."}, {"time": 5025, "text": "On a large scale, it can be described by saying, oh, it looks like it's a, you know, this grid is zoomed out grid."}, {"time": 5032, "text": "You can say, well, you can describe these different points by saying they have certain positions, coordinates, et cetera."}, {"time": 5037, "text": "Now, in the sort of real setup, it's more complicated than that."}, {"time": 5040, "text": "It isn't just a square grid or something."}, {"time": 5043, "text": "It's something much more dynamic and complicated, which we'll talk about."}, {"time": 5047, "text": "But so, you know, the first idea, the first key idea is, you know, what's the universe made of?"}, {"time": 5053, "text": "It's made of atoms of space basically with these connections between them."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "What kind of connections do they have?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "Well, so the simplest kind of thing you might say is, we've got something like a graph where every atom of space, where we have these edges that go between, these connections that go between atoms of space."}, {"time": 5073, "text": "We're not saying how long these edges are."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "We're just saying there is a connection from this place, from this atom to this atom."}, {"time": 5079, "text": "Just a quick pause, because there's a lot of very people that listen to this."}, {"time": 5084, "text": "Just to clarify, because I did a poll actually, what do you think a graph is a long time ago?"}, {"time": 5089, "text": "And it's kind of funny how few people know the term graph outside of computer science."}, {"time": 5096, "text": "Let's call it a network."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "I think that's it."}, {"time": 5098, "text": "Let's call it a network is better."}, {"time": 5099, "text": "So, but every time, I like the word graph though."}, {"time": 5100, "text": "So let's define, let's just say that a graph will use terms nodes and edges maybe."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "And it's just the nodes represent some abstract entity and then the edges represent relationships between those entities."}, {"time": 5115, "text": "So that's what a graph says."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "Sorry, so there you go."}, {"time": 5118, "text": "So that's the basic structure."}, {"time": 5120, "text": "That is the simplest case of a basic structure."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "Actually, it tends to be better to think about hypergraphs."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "So a hypergraph is just, instead of saying there are connections between pairs of things, we say there are connections between any number of things."}, {"time": 5137, "text": "So there might be ternary edges."}, {"time": 5139, "text": "So instead of just having two points are connected by an edge, you say three points are all associated with a hyperedge, are all connected by a hyperedge."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "That's just, at some level, that's a detail."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "It's a detail that happens to make the, for me, sort of in the history of this project, the realization that you could do things that way broke out of certain kinds of arbitrariness that I felt that there was in the model before I had seen how this worked."}, {"time": 5167, "text": "I mean, a hypergraph can be mapped to a graph."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "It's just a convenient representation."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "Mathematical speaking."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "But so then, so, okay, so the first question, the first idea of these models of ours is space is made of these connected sort of atoms of space."}, {"time": 5186, "text": "The next idea is space is all there is."}, {"time": 5189, "text": "There's nothing except for this space."}, {"time": 5191, "text": "So in traditional ideas in physics, people have said there's space, it's kind of a background."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "And then there's matter, all these particles, electrons, all these other things, which exist in space, right?"}, {"time": 5203, "text": "But in this model, one of the key ideas is there's nothing except space."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "So in other words, everything that exists in the universe is a feature of this hypergraph."}, {"time": 5214, "text": "So how can that possibly be?"}, {"time": 5215, "text": "Well, the way that works is that there are certain structures in this hypergraph where you say that little twisty knotted thing, we don't know exactly how this works yet, but we have sort of idea about how it works mathematically."}, {"time": 5230, "text": "This sort of twisted knotted thing, that's the core of an electron."}, {"time": 5234, "text": "This thing over there that has this different form, that's something else."}, {"time": 5238, "text": "So the different peculiarities of the structure of this graph are the very things that we think of as the particles inside the space, but in fact, it's just a property of the space."}, {"time": 5251, "text": "Mind blowing, first of all, that it's mind blowing, and we'll probably talk in its simplicity and beauty."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "Yes, I think it's very beautiful."}, {"time": 5260, "text": "I mean, this is, I'm..."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "But okay, but that's space, and then there's another concept we didn't really kind of mention, but you think it of computation as a transformation."}, {"time": 5270, "text": "Let's talk about time in a second."}, {"time": 5271, "text": "Let's just, I mean, on the subject of space, there's this question of kind of what, there's this idea, there is this hypergraph, it represents space, and it represents everything that's in space."}, {"time": 5283, "text": "The features of that hypergraph, you can say certain features in this part we do know, certain features of the hypergraph represent the presence of energy, for example, or the presence of mass or momentum, and we know what the features of the hypergraph that represent those things are, but it's all just the same hypergraph."}, {"time": 5300, "text": "So one thing you might ask is, you know, if you just look at this hypergraph and you say, and we're gonna talk about sort of what the hypergraph does, but if you say, you know, how much of what's going on in this hypergraph is things we know and care about, like particles and atoms and electrons and all this kind of thing, and how much is just the background of space?"}, {"time": 5320, "text": "So it turns out, so far as in one rough estimate of this, everything that we care about in the universe is only one part in 10 to the 120 of what's actually going on."}, {"time": 5332, "text": "The vast majority of what's happening is purely things that maintain the structure of space."}, {"time": 5337, "text": "That, in other words, that the things that are the features of space that are the things that we consider notable, like the presence of particles and so on, that's a tiny little piece of froth on the top of all this activity that mostly is just intended to, you know, mostly, I can't say intended, there's no intention here, that just maintains the structure of space."}, {"time": 5360, "text": "Let me load that in."}, {"time": 5364, "text": "It just makes me feel so good as a human being."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "To be the froth on the one in a 10 to the 120 or something of, well."}, {"time": 5373, "text": "And also just humbling how, in this mathematical framework, how much work needs to be done on the infrastructure of our universe."}, {"time": 5384, "text": "Right, to maintain the infrastructure of our universe is a lot of work."}, {"time": 5387, "text": "We are merely writing a little tiny things on top of that infrastructure."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "But you were just starting to talk a little bit about, we talked about space, that represents all the stuff that's in the universe."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "The question is, what does that stuff do?"}, {"time": 5406, "text": "And for that, we have to start talking about time and what is time and so on."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "And, you know, one of the basic idea of this model is time is the progression of computation."}, {"time": 5418, "text": "So in other words, we have a structure of space and there is a rule that says how that structure of space will change."}, {"time": 5425, "text": "And it's the application, the repeated application of that rule that defines the progress of time."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "And what does the rule look like in the space of hypergraphs?"}, {"time": 5436, "text": "Right, so what the rule says is something like, if you have a little tiny piece of hypergraph that looks like this, then it will be transformed into a piece of hypergraph that looks like this."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "So that's all it says."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "It says you pick up these elements of space and you can think of these edges, these hyper edges as being relations between elements in space."}, {"time": 5457, "text": "You might pick up these two relations between elements in space."}, {"time": 5463, "text": "And we're not saying where those elements are or what they are, but every time there's a certain arrangement of elements in space, then arrangement in the sense of the way they're connected, then we transform it into some other arrangement."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "So there's a little tiny pattern and you transform it into another little pattern."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "And then because of this, I mean, again, it's kind of similar to cellular automata in that like on paper, the rule looks like super simple."}, {"time": 5486, "text": "It's like, yeah, okay."}, {"time": 5490, "text": "Yeah, right, from this, the universe can be born."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "But like once you start applying it, beautiful structure starts being, potentially can be created."}, {"time": 5501, "text": "And what you're doing is you're applying that rule to different parts, like anytime you match it within the hypergraph."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "And then one of the like incredibly beautiful and interesting things to think about is the order in which you apply that rule, because that pattern appears all over the place."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "Right, so this is a big complicated thing, very hard to wrap one's brain around, okay?"}, {"time": 5526, "text": "So you say the rule is every time you see this little pattern transform it in this way."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "But yet, as you look around the space that represents the universe, there may be zillions of places where that little pattern occurs."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "So what it says is just do this, apply this rule wherever you feel like."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "And what is extremely non trivial is, well, okay, so this is happening sort of in computer science terms, sort of asynchronously, you're just doing it wherever you feel like doing it."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "And the only constraint is that if you're going to apply the rule somewhere, the things to which you apply the rule, the little elements to which you apply the rule, if they have to be, okay, well, you can think of each application of the rule as being kind of an event that happens in the universe."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "And the input to an event has to be ready for the event to occur."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "That is, if one event occurred, if one transformation occurred, and it produced a particular atom of space, then that atom of space has to already exist before another transformation that's going to apply to that atom of space can occur."}, {"time": 5603, "text": "So that's like the prerequisite for the event."}, {"time": 5606, "text": "So that defines a kind of, this sort of set of causal relationships between events."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "It says, this event has to have happened before this event."}, {"time": 5618, "text": "But that is..."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "But that's not a very limiting constraint."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "And what's interesting... You still get the zillion, that's a technical term, options."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "But, okay, so this is where things get a little bit more elaborate, but..."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "But they're mind blowing, so..."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "Right, but so what happens is, so the first thing you might say is, you know, let's... Well, okay, so this question about the freedom of which event you do when."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "Well, let me sort of state an answer and then explain it."}, {"time": 5650, "text": "Okay, the validity of special relativity is a consequence of the fact that in some sense, it doesn't matter in what order you do these underlying things, so long as they respect this kind of set of causal relationships."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "So... And that's the part that's in a certain sense is a really important one, but the fact that it sometimes doesn't matter, that's a..."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "I don't know what to... That's another, like, beautiful thing."}, {"time": 5678, "text": "Well, okay, so there's this idea of what I call causal invariance."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "Causal invariance, exactly."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "So that's a... Really, really powerful idea."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "Right, it's a powerful idea, which has actually arisen in different forms many times in the history of mathematics, mathematical logic, even computer science, has many different names."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "I mean, our particular version of it is a little bit tighter than other versions, but it's basically the same idea."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "Here's how to think about that idea."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "So imagine that... Well, let's talk about it in terms of math for a second."}, {"time": 5708, "text": "Let's say you're doing algebra and you're told, you know, multiply out this series of polynomials that are multiplied together, okay?"}, {"time": 5716, "text": "You say, well, which order should I do that in?"}, {"time": 5719, "text": "Say, well, do I multiply the third one by the fourth one and then do it by the first one?"}, {"time": 5722, "text": "Or do I do the fifth one by the sixth one and then do that?"}, {"time": 5725, "text": "Well, it turns out it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "You can multiply them out in any order, you'll always get the same answer."}, {"time": 5731, "text": "That's a property..."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "If you think about kind of making a kind of network that represents in what order you do things, you'll get different orders for different ways of multiplying things out, but you'll always get the same answer."}, {"time": 5744, "text": "Same thing if you... Let's say you're sorting."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "You've got a bunch of A's and B's."}, {"time": 5748, "text": "They're in random, some random order, you know, BAA, BBBAA, whatever."}, {"time": 5753, "text": "And you have a little rule that says, every time you see BA, flip it around to AB, okay?"}, {"time": 5760, "text": "Eventually you apply that rule enough times, you'll have sorted the string so that it's all the A's first and then all the B's."}, {"time": 5767, "text": "Again, there are many different orders in which you can do that to many different sort of places where you can apply that update."}, {"time": 5775, "text": "In the end, you'll always get the string sorted the same way."}, {"time": 5778, "text": "I know with sorting the string, it sounds obvious."}, {"time": 5782, "text": "That's to me surprising that there is in complicated systems, obviously with a string, but in a hypergraph that the application of the rule, asynchronous rule can lead to the same results sometimes."}, {"time": 5796, "text": "Yes, yes, that is not obvious."}, {"time": 5799, "text": "And it was something that, you know, I sort of discovered that idea for these kinds of systems and back in the 1990s."}, {"time": 5805, "text": "And for various reasons, I was not satisfied by how sort of fragile finding that particular property was."}, {"time": 5814, "text": "And let me just make another point, which is that it turns out that even if the underlying rule does not have this property of causal invariance, it can turn out that every observation made by observers of the rule can, they can impose what amounts to causal invariance on the rule."}, {"time": 5833, "text": "We can explain that."}, {"time": 5834, "text": "It's a little bit more complicated."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "I mean, technically that has to do with this idea of completions, which is something that comes up in term rewriting systems, automated theorem proving systems and so on."}, {"time": 5844, "text": "But let's ignore that for a second."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "We can come to that later."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "But is it useful to talk about observation?"}, {"time": 5851, "text": "It's so great."}, {"time": 5853, "text": "So there's some concept of causal invariance as you apply these rules in an asynchronous way, you can think of those transformations as events."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "So there's this hypergraph that represents space and all of these events happening in the space and the graph grows in interesting complicated ways."}, {"time": 5870, "text": "And eventually the froth arises of what we experience as human existence."}, {"time": 5876, "text": "So that's it."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "That's some version of the picture, but let's explain a little bit more."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "What's a little more detail like?"}, {"time": 5884, "text": "Well, so one thing that is sort of surprising in this theory is one of the sort of achievements of 20th century physics was kind of bringing space and time together."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "That was, you know, special relativity."}, {"time": 5895, "text": "People talk about space time, this sort of unified thing where space and time kind of a mixed and there's a nice mathematical formalism that in which, you know, space and time sort of appear as part of the space time continuum, the space

know, and it seems like the theory of relativity sort of says space and time are fundamentally the same kind of thing."}, {"time": 5925, "text": "So one of the things that took a while to understand in this approach of mine is that in my kind of approach, space and time are really not fundamentally the same kind of thing."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "Space is the extension of this hypergraph."},

we can, it's worth explaining a little bit how this works."}, {"time": 5971, "text": "It's a little bit elaborate, but the basic point is that even though space and time sort of come from very different places, it turns out that the rules of sort of space time that special relativity talks about come out of this model when you're looking at large enough systems."}, {"time": 5993, "text": "So a way to think about this, you know, in terms of when you're looking at large enough systems, the part of that story is when you look at some fluid like water, for example, there are equations

to, the structure."}, {"time": 6131, "text": "So in other words, if you were to draw that, if you were to put that network on a picture of where you're doing all the updating, the places where you put the nodes of the network will be different, but the way the nodes are connected will always be the same."}, {"time": 6143, "text": "So, but the causal graph is, I don't know, it's kind of an

there's kind of this arbitrariness to how we set these reference frames that defines sort of what counts as simultaneous."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "And what is the essence of special relativity is to think about reference frames going at different speeds and to think about sort of how they assign, what counts as space, what counts as time and so on."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "That's all a bit technical, but the basic bottom line is that this causal invariance property, that means that it's always the same causal graph, independent of how you slice it with these reference frames, you'll always sort of see the same physical processes go on."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "And that's basically why special relativity works."}, {"time": 6490, "text": "So there's something like special

GD6, that's a term that means shortest path, comes from measuring the shortest paths on the Earth."}, {"time": 7383, "text": "So you look at a bunch of, a bundle of GD6, a bunch of shortest paths, it's like the paths that photons would take between two points."}, {"time": 7393, "text": "Then the statement of Einstein's equations, it's basically a statement about a certain the, that as you look at a bundle of GD6, the structure of space has to be such that, although the cross sectional area of this bundle may, although the actual shape of the cross section may change, the cross sectional area does not."}, {"time": 7411, "text": "That's a version, that's the most simple minded version of R mu nu minus a half R G mu nu equals zero, which is the more mathematical version of Einstein's equations."}, {"time": 7422, "text": "It's a statement of the thing called the Ritchie tensor is equal to zero."}, {"time": 7426, "text": "That's Einstein's equations for the vacuum."}, {"time": 7430, "text": "Okay, so we get that as a result of this model, but footnote, big footnote, because all the matter in the universe is the stuff we actually care about."}, {"time": 7441, "text": "The vacuum is not stuff we care about."}, {"time": 7443, "text": "So the question is, how does matter come into this?"}, {"time": 7446, "text": "And for that, you have to understand what energy is in these models."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "And one of the things that we realized, you know, late last year was that there's a very simple interpretation of energy in these models, okay?"}, {"time": 7462, "text": "And energy is basically, well, intuitively, it's the amount of activity in these hypergraphs and the way that that remains over time."}, {"time": 7476, "text": "So a little bit more formally, you can think about this causal graph as having these edges that represent causal relationships."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "You can think about, oh boy, there's one more concept that we didn't get to."}, {"time": 7487, "text": "It's the notion of space like hypersurfaces."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "So this is not as scary as it sounds."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "It's a common notion in general activity."}, {"time": 7499, "text": "The notion is you are defining what is a possibly, where in space time might be a particular moment in time."}, {"time": 7513, "text": "So in other words, what is a consistent set of places where you can say, this is happening now, so to speak."}, {"time": 7521, "text": "And you make the series of sort of slices through the space time, through this causal graph to represent sort of what we consider to be successive moments in time."}, {"time": 7534, "text": "It's somewhat arbitrary because you can deform that if you're going at a different speed in a special activity, you tip those things, there are different kinds of deformations, but only certain deformations are allowed by the structure of the causal graph."}, {"time": 7548, "text": "Anyway, be that as it may, the basic point is there is a way of figuring out, you say, what is the energy associated with what's going on in this hypergraph?"}, {"time": 7560, "text": "And the answer is there is a precise definition of that."}, {"time": 7564, "text": "And it is the formal way to say it is, it's the flux of causal edges through space like hypersurfaces."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "The slightly less formal way to say it, it's basically the amount of activity."}, {"time": 7574, "text": "See, the reason it gets tricky is you might say it's the amount of activity per unit volume in this hypergraph, but you haven't defined what volume is."}, {"time": 7585, "text": "So it's a little bit, you have to be a little more careful."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "But this hypersurface gives some more formalism to that."}, {"time": 7590, "text": "Yeah, yeah, it gives a way to connect that."}, {"time": 7592, "text": "But intuitive, we should think about as the just activity."}, {"time": 7596, "text": "Right, so the amount of activity that kind of remains in one place in the hypergraph corresponds to energy."}, {"time": 7602, "text": "The amount of activity that is kind of where an activity here affects an activity somewhere else, corresponds to momentum."}, {"time": 7610, "text": "And so one of the things that's kind of cool is that I'm trying to think about how to say this intuitively."}, {"time": 7616, "text": "The mathematics is easy, but the intuitive version, I'm not sure."}, {"time": 7619, "text": "But basically the way that things sort of stay in the same place and have activity is associated with rest mass."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "And so one of the things that you get to derive is E equals MC squared."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "That is a consequence of this interpretation of energy in terms of the way the causal graph works, which is the whole thing is sort of a consequence of this whole story about updates and hypergraphs and so on."}, {"time": 7643, "text": "So can you linger on that a little bit?"}, {"time": 7646, "text": "How do we get E equals MC squared?"}, {"time": 7648, "text": "So where does the mass come from?"}, {"time": 7652, "text": "I mean, is there an intuitive, it's okay."}, {"time": 7655, "text": "First of all, you're pretty deep in the mathematical explorations of this thing right now."}, {"time": 7661, "text": "We're in a very, we're in a flux currently."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "So maybe you haven't even had time to think about intuitive explanations, but."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "Yeah, I mean, this one is, look, roughly what's happening, that derivation is actually rather easy."}, {"time": 7678, "text": "And everybody, and I've been saying we should pay more attention to this derivation because it's such, you know, cause people care about this one."}, {"time": 7684, "text": "But everybody says, it's just easy."}, {"time": 7687, "text": "So there's some concept of energy that can be intuitively thought of as the activity, the flux, the level of changes that are occurring based on the transformations within a certain volume, however the heck do you find the volume."}, {"time": 7701, "text": "Okay, so, and then mass."}, {"time": 7703, "text": "Well, mass is associated with kind of the energy that does not cause you to, that does not somehow propagate through time."}, {"time": 7714, "text": "Yeah, I mean, one of the things that was not obvious in the usual formulation of special relativity is that space and time are connected in a certain way."}, {"time": 7722, "text": "Energy and momentum are also connected in a certain way."}, {"time": 7726, "text": "The fact that the connection of energy to momentum is analogous to the connection to space between space and time is not self evident in ordinary relativity."}, {"time": 7734, "text": "It is a consequence of this, of the way this model works."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "It's an intrinsic consequence of the way this model works."}, {"time": 7740, "text": "And it's all to do with that, with unraveling that connection that ends up giving you this relationship between energy and, well, it's energy, momentum, mass, they're all connected."}, {"time": 7753, "text": "And so like, that's hence the general relativity."}, {"time": 7759, "text": "You have a sense that it appears to be baked in to the fundamental properties of the way these hypergraphs are evolved."}, {"time": 7769, "text": "Well, I didn't yet get to, so I got as far as special relativity and equals MC squared."}, {"time": 7773, "text": "The one last step is, in general relativity, the final connection is energy and mass cause curvature in space."}, {"time": 7784, "text": "And that's something that when you understand this interpretation of energy, and you kind of understand the correspondence to curvature and hypergraphs, then you can finally sort of, the big final answer is, you derive the full version of Einstein's equations for space, time and matter."}, {"time": 7803, "text": "And that's some."}, {"time": 7804, "text": "Is that, have you, that last piece with curvature, have, is that, have you arrived there yet?"}, {"time": 7812, "text": "Oh yeah, we're there, yes."}, {"time": 7813, "text": "And here's the way that we, here's how we're really, really going to know we've arrived, okay?"}, {"time": 7818, "text": "So, you know, we have the mathematical derivation, it's all fine, but, you know, mathematical derivations, okay."}, {"time": 7825, "text": "So one thing that's sort of a, you know, we're taking this limit of what happens when you, the limit, you have to look at things which are large compared to the size of an elementary length, small compared to the whole size of the universe, large compared to certain kinds of fluctuations, blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 7841, "text": "There's a, there's a, there's a tower of many, many of these mathematical limits that have to be taken."}, {"time": 7846, "text": "So if you're a pure mathematician saying, where's the precise proof?"}, {"time": 7850, "text": "It's like, well, there are all these limits, we can, you know, we can try each one of them computationally and we could say, yeah, it really works, but the formal mathematics is really hard to do."}, {"time": 7860, "text": "I mean, for example, in the case of deriving the equations of fluid dynamics from molecular dynamics, that derivation has never been done."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "There is no rigorous version of that derivation."}, {"time": 7871, "text": "So, so that could be."}, {"time": 7872, "text": "Because you can't do the limits?"}, {"time": 7873, "text": "Yeah, because you can't do the limits."}, {"time": 7875, "text": "But so the limits allow you to try to describe something general about the system and very, very particular kinds of limits that you need to take with these very."}, {"time": 7883, "text": "Right, and the limits will definitely work the way we think they work."}, {"time": 7887, "text": "And we can do all kinds of computer experiments."}, {"time": 7888, "text": "It's just a hard derivation."}, {"time": 7889, "text": "Yeah, it's just, it's just the mathematical structure kind of, you know, ends up running right into computational irreducibility."}, {"time": 7897, "text": "And you end up with a bunch of, a bunch of difficulty there."}, {"time": 7899, "text": "But here's the way that we're getting really confident that we know completely what we're talking about, which is when people study things like black hole mergers, using Einstein's equations, what do they actually do?"}, {"time": 7911, "text": "Well, they actually use Mathematica or a whole bunch to analyze the equations and so on."}, {"time": 7914, "text": "But in the end, they do numerical relativity, which means they take these nice mathematical equations and they break them down so that they can run them on a computer."}, {"time": 7924, "text": "And they break them down into something which is actually a discrete approximation to these equations."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "Then they run them on a computer, they get results."}, {"time": 7931, "text": "Then you look at the gravitational waves and you see if they match, okay?"}, {"time": 7934, "text": "It turns out that our model gives you a direct way to do numerical relativity."}, {"time": 7939, "text": "So in other words, instead of saying, you start from these continuum equations from Einstein, you break them down into these discrete things, you run them on a computer, you say, we're doing it the other way around."}, {"time": 7948, "text": "We're starting from these discrete things that come from our model."}, {"time": 7951, "text": "And we're just running big versions on the computer."}, {"time": 7954, "text": "And, you know, what we're saying is, and this is how things will work."}, {"time": 7959, "text": "So the way I'm calling this is proof by compilation, so to speak, that is, in other words, you're taking something where, you know, we've got this description of a black hole system."}, {"time": 7972, "text": "And what we're doing is we're showing that the, you know, what we get by just running our model agrees with what you would get by doing the computation from the Einstein equations."}, {"time": 7984, "text": "As a small tangent or actually a very big tangent, but proof by compilation is a beautiful concept."}, {"time": 7995, "text": "In a sense, the way of doing physics with this model is by running it or compiling it."}, {"time": 8006, "text": "And have you thought about, and these things can be very large, is there a totally new possibilities of computing hardware and computing software, which allows you to perform this kind of compilation?"}, {"time": 8022, "text": "Well, algorithms, software, hardware."}, {"time": 8024, "text": "So first comment is these models seem to give one a lot of intuition about distributed computing, a lot of different intuition about how to think about parallel computation."}, {"time": 8036, "text": "And that particularly comes from the quantum mechanics side of things, which we didn't talk about much yet."}, {"time": 8041, "text": "But the question of what, you know, given our current computer hardware, how can we most efficiently simulate things?"}, {"time": 8050, "text": "That's actually partly a story of the model itself, because the model itself has deep parallelism in it."}, {"time": 8056, "text": "The ways that we are simulating it, we're just starting to be able to use that deep parallelism to be able to be more efficient in the way that we simulate things."}, {"time": 8064, "text": "But in fact, the structure of the model itself allows us to think about parallel computation in different ways."},

worrying about, you know, if multiple things can happen on different computers at different times, oh, what happens if this thing happens before that thing?"}, {"time": 8086, "text": "And we've really got, you know, we have these race conditions where something can race to get to the answer before another thing."}, {"time": 8091, "text": "And you get all tangled up because you don't know which thing is gonna come in first."}, {"time": 8095, "text": "And usually when you do parallel computing, there's a big obsession to lock things down to the point where you've had locks and mutexes and God knows what else, where you've arranged it so that there can only be one sequence of things that can happen."}, {"time": 8111, "text": "So you don't have to think about all the different kinds of things that can happen."}, {"time": 8114, "text": "Well, in these models, physics is throwing us into, forcing us to think about all these possible things that can happen."}, {"time": 8121, "text": "But these models together with what we know from physics is giving us new ways to think about all possible things happening, about all these different things happening in parallel."}, {"time": 8130,

concurrent programming in like Java, with all the basic concepts of concurrent programming, that if there could be built up a strong mathematical framework for causal invariance, that's so liberating."}, {"time": 8161, "text": "And that could be not just liberating, but really powerful for massively distributed computation."}, {"time": 8169, "text": "No, I mean, what's eventual consistency in distributed databases is essentially the causal invariance idea."}, {"time": 8177, "text": "But have you thought about, like really large simulations?"}, {"time": 8186, "text": "I mean, I'm also thinking about, look, the fact is I've spent much of my life as a language designer, right?"}, {"time": 8191, "text": "So I can't possibly not think about, what does this mean for designing languages for parallel computation?"}, {"time": 8198, "text": "In fact, another thing that's one of these..."}, {"time": 8201, "text": "I'm always embarrassed at how long it's taken me to figure stuff out."}, {"time": 8205, "text": "But back in the 1980s, I worked on trying to make up languages for parallel computation."}, {"time": 8210, "text": "I thought about doing graph rewriting."}, {"time": 8213, "text": "I thought about doing these kinds of things, but I couldn't see how to actually make the connections to actually do something useful."}, {"time": 8219, "text": "I think now physics is kind of showing us how to make those things useful."}, {"time": 8224, "text": "And so my guess is that in time, we'll be talking about, we do parallel programming."}, {"time": 8229, "text": "We'll be talking about programming in a certain reference frame, just as we think about thinking about physics in a certain reference frame."}, {"time": 8235, "text": "It's a certain coordination of what's going on."}, {"time": 8237, "text": "We say, we're gonna program in this reference frame."}, {"time": 8239, "text": "Oh, let's change the reference frame to this reference frame."}, {"time": 8242,

let me ask on this topic, cause I put out that I'm talking to you."}, {"time": 8252, "text": "I got way more questions than I can deal with, but what pops to mind is a question somebody asked on Reddit I think is, please ask Dr. Wolfram, what are the specs of the computer running the universe?"}, {"time": 8266, "text": "So we're talking about specs of hardware and software for simulations of a large scale thing."}, {"time": 8274, "text": "What about a scale that is comparative to something that eventually leads to the two of us talking and about?"}, {"time": 8282, "text": "So actually I did try to estimate that."}, {"time": 8285, "text": "And we actually have to go a couple more stages before we can really get to that answer because we're talking about this thing."}, {"time": 8294,

distance and this hypergraph to this moment of time."}, {"time": 8454, "text": "Again, that's an arbitrary thing, but we measure that in meters per second, for example, and that ratio is the speed of light."}, {"time": 8460, "text": "So the ratio of the elementary distance to the elementary time is the speed of light, okay?"}, {"time": 8467, "text": "And so there's another, there are two other

{"time": 8699, "text": "Right, so I mean, the key idea of quantum mechanics that sort of the typical interpretation is classical physics says a definite thing happens."}, {"time": 8709, "text": "Quantum physics says there's this whole set of paths of things that might happen."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "And we are just observing some overall probability of how those paths work."}, {"time": 8719, "text": "Okay, so when you think about our hypergraphs and all these little updates that are going on, there's a very remarkable thing to realize, which is if you say, well, which particular sequence of updates should you do?"}, {"time": 8732, "text": "Say, well, it's not really defined."}, {"time": 8733, "text": "You can do any of a whole collection of possible sequences of updates."}, {"time": 8737, "text": "Okay, that set of possible sequences of updates defines yet another kind of graph that we call a multiway graph."}, {"time": 8746, "text": "And a multiway graph just is a graph where at every node, there is a choice of several different possible things that could happen."}, {"time": 8755, "text": "So for example, you go this way, you go that way."}, {"time": 8757, "text": "Those are two different edges in the multiway graph."}, {"time": 8760, "text": "And you're building up the set of possibilities."}, {"time": 8762, "text": "So actually, like, for example, I just made the one, the multiway graph for tic tac toe, okay?"}, {"time": 8767, "text": "So tic tac toe, you start off with some board that, you know, is everything is blank, and then somebody can put down an X somewhere, an O somewhere, and then there are different possibilities."}, {"time": 8778, "text": "At each stage, there are different possibilities."}, {"time": 8780, "text": "And so you build up this multiway graph of all those possibilities."}, {"time": 8783, "text": "Now notice that even in tic tac toe, you have the feature that there can be something where you have two different things that happen and then those branches merge because you end up with the same shape, you know, the same configuration of the board, even though you got there in two different ways."}, {"time": 8800, "text": "So the thing that's sort of an inevitable feature of our models is that just like quantum mechanics suggests, definite things don't happen."}, {"time": 8808, "text": "Instead, you get this whole multiway graph of all these possibilities."}, {"time": 8812, "text": "Okay, so then the question is, so, okay, so that's sort of a picture of what's going on."}, {"time": 8818, "text": "Now you say, okay, well, quantum mechanics has all these features of, you know, all this mathematical structure and so on."}, {"time": 8824, "text": "How do you get that mathematical structure?"}, {"time": 8827, "text": "Okay, a couple of things to say."}, {"time": 8828, "text": "So quantum mechanics is actually, in a sense, two different theories glued together."}, {"time": 8833, "text": "Quantum mechanics is the theory of how quantum amplitudes work that more or less give you the probabilities of things happening."}, {"time": 8840, "text": "And it's the theory of quantum measurement, which is the theory of how we actually conclude definite things."}, {"time": 8847, "text": "Because the mathematics just gives you these quantum amplitudes, which are more or less probabilities of things happening, but yet we actually observe definite things in the world."}, {"time": 8856, "text": "Quantum measurement has always been a bit mysterious."}, {"time": 8859, "text": "It's always been something where people just say, well, the mathematics says this, but then you do a measurement, and there are philosophical arguments about what the measurement is."}, {"time": 8866, "text": "But it's not something where there's a theory of the measurement."}, {"time": 8869, "text": "Somebody on Reddit also asked, please ask Stephen to tell his story of the double slit experiment."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "Okay, yeah, I can."}, {"time": 8881, "text": "Is that, does that make sense?"}, {"time": 8882, "text": "Oh yeah, it makes sense."}, {"time": 8883, "text": "Absolutely makes sense."}, {"time": 8885, "text": "Why, is this like a good way to discuss?"}, {"time": 8888, "text": "Let me go, let me explain a couple of things first."}, {"time": 8890, "text": "So the structure of quantum mechanics is mathematically quite complicated."}, {"time": 8896, "text": "One of the features, let's see, well, how to describe this."}, {"time": 8900, "text": "Okay, so first point is there's this multiway graph of all these different paths of things that can happen in the world."}, {"time": 8908, "text": "And the important point is that these, you can have branchings and you can have mergings."}, {"time": 8915, "text": "Okay, so this property turns out causal invariance is the statement that the number of mergings is equal to the number of branchings."}, {"time": 8926, "text": "So in other words, every time there's a branch, eventually there will also be a merge."}, {"time": 8930, "text": "In other words, every time there were two possibilities for what might've happened, eventually those will merge."}, {"time": 8935, "text": "Beautiful concept by the way, but yeah, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "So that idea, okay, so then, so that's one thing and that's closely related to the sort of objectivity in quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 8948, "text": "The fact that we believe definite things happen, it's because although there are all these different paths, in some sense, because of causal invariance, they all imply the same thing."}, {"time": 8957, "text": "I'm cheating a little bit in saying that, but that's roughly the essence of what's going on."}, {"time": 8962, "text": "Okay, next thing to think about is you have this multiway graph, it has all these different possible things that are happening."}, {"time": 8970, "text": "Now we ask, this multiway graph is sort of evolving with time."}, {"time": 8974, "text": "Over time, it's branching, it's merging, it's doing all these things, okay?"}, {"time": 8979, "text": "Question we can ask is if we slice it at a particular time, what do we see?"}, {"time": 8986, "text": "And that slice represents in a sense, something to do with the state of the universe at a particular time."}, {"time": 8993, "text": "So in other words, we've got this multiway graph of all these possibilities, and then we're asking, okay, we take the slice, this slice represents, okay, each of these different paths corresponds to a different quantum possibility for what's happening."}, {"time": 9009, "text": "When we take the slice, we're saying, what are the set of quantum possibilities that exist at a particular time?"}, {"time": 9014, "text": "And when you say slice, you slice the graph and then there's a bunch of leaves."}, {"time": 9019, "text": "A bunch of leaves."}, {"time": 9020, "text": "Those represent the state of things."}, {"time": 9023, "text": "Right, but then, okay, so the important thing that you are quickly picking up on is that what matters is kind of how these leaves are related to each other."}, {"time": 9034, "text": "So a good way to tell how leaves are related is just to say on the step before do they have a common ancestor?"}, {"time": 9042, "text": "So two leaves might be, they might have just branched from one thing or they might be far away, way far apart in this graph where to get to a common ancestor, maybe you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the graph, all the way back to the beginning."}, {"time": 9055, "text": "So there's some kind of measure of distance."}, {"time": 9057, "text": "Right, but what you get is by making the slice, we call it branchial space, the space of branches."}, {"time": 9065, "text": "And in this branchial space, you have a graph that represents the relationships between these quantum states in branchial space."}, {"time": 9074, "text": "You have this notion of distance in branchial space."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "It's connected to quantum entanglement."}, {"time": 9080, "text": "Yes, yes, it's basically, the distance in branchial space is kind of an entanglement distance."}, {"time": 9087, "text": "So this."}, {"time": 9088, "text": "That's a very nice model."}, {"time": 9089, "text": "Right, it is very nice, it's very beautiful."}, {"time": 9093, "text": "I mean, it's so clean."}, {"time": 9095, "text": "I mean, it's really, and it tells one, okay, so anyway, so then this branchial space has this sort of map of the entanglements between quantum states."}, {"time": 9107, "text": "So in physical space, we have, so you can say, take, let's say the causal graph, and we can slice that at a particular time, and then we get this map of how things are laid out in physical space."}, {"time": 9121, "text": "When we do the same kind of thing, there's a thing called the multiway causal graph, which is the analog of a causal graph for the multiway system."}, {"time": 9127, "text": "We slice that, we get essentially the relationships between things, not in physical space, but in the space of quantum states."}, {"time": 9135, "text": "It's like which quantum state is similar to which other quantum state."}, {"time": 9139, "text": "Okay, so now I think next thing to say is just to mention how quantum measurement works."}, {"time": 9144, "text": "So quantum measurement has to do with reference frames in branchial space."}, {"time": 9149, "text": "So, okay, so measurement in physical space, it matters whether how we assign spatial position and how we define coordinates in space and time."}, {"time": 9162, "text": "And that's how we make measurements in ordinary space."}, {"time": 9165, "text": "Are we making a measurement based on us sitting still here?"}, {"time": 9168, "text": "Are we traveling at half the speed of light and making measurements that way?"}, {"time": 9171, "text": "These are different reference frames in which we're making our measurements."}, {"time": 9174, "text": "And the relationship between different events and different points in space and time will be different depending on what reference frame we're in."}, {"time": 9184, "text": "Okay, so then we have this idea of quantum observation frames, which are the analog of reference frames, but in branchial space."}, {"time": 9193, "text": "And so what happens is what we realize is that a quantum measurement is the observer is sort of arbitrarily determining this reference frame."}, {"time": 9203, "text": "The observer is saying, I'm going to understand the world by saying that space and time are coordinated this way."}, {"time": 9210, "text": "I'm gonna understand the world by saying that quantum states and time are coordinated in this way."}, {"time": 9216, "text": "And essentially what happens is that the process of quantum measurement is a process of deciding how you slice up this multiway system in these quantum observation frames."}, {"time": 9228, "text": "So in a sense, the observer, the way the observer enters is by their choice of these quantum observation frames."}, {"time": 9235, "text": "And what happens is that the observer, because, okay, this is again, another stack of other concepts, but anyway, because the observer is computationally bounded, there is a limit to the type of quantum observation frames that they can construct."}, {"time": 9249, "text": "Interesting, okay, so there's some constraints, some limit on the choice of observation frames."}, {"time": 9257, "text": "Right, and by the way, I just want to mention that there's a, I mean, it's bizarre, but there's a hierarchy of these things."}, {"time": 9263, "text": "So in thermodynamics, the fact that we believe entropy increases, we believe things get more disordered, is a consequence of the fact that we can't track each individual molecule."}, {"time": 9274, "text": "If we could track every single molecule, we could run every movie in reverse, so to speak, and we would not see that things are getting more disordered."}, {"time": 9282, "text": "But it's because we are computationally bounded, we can only look at these big blobs of what all these molecules collectively do, that we think that things are, that we describe it in terms of entropy increasing and so on."}, {"time": 9295, "text": "And it's the same phenomenon, basically, and also a consequence of computational irreducibility that causes us to basically be forced to conclude that definite things happen in the world, even though there's this quantum, this set of all these different quantum processes that are going on."}, {"time": 9311, "text": "So, I mean, I'm skipping a little bit, but that's a rough picture."}, {"time": 9318, "text": "And in the evolution of the Wolfram Physics Project, where do you feel we stand on some of the puzzles that are along the way?"}, {"time": 9325, "text": "See, you're skipping along a bunch of stuff."}, {"time": 9328, "text": "It's amazing how much these things are unraveling."}, {"time": 9330, "text": "I mean, you know, these things, look, it used to be the case that I would agree with Dick Feynman, nobody understands quantum mechanics, including me, okay?"}, {"time": 9338, "text": "I'm getting to the point where I think I actually understand quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 9341, "text": "My exercise, okay, is can I explain quantum mechanics for real at the level of kind of middle school type explanation?"}, {"time": 9350, "text": "And I'm getting closer, it's getting there."}, {"time": 9352, "text": "I'm not quite there, I've tried it a few times, and I realized that there are things where I have to start talking about elaborate mathematical concepts and so on."}, {"time": 9360, "text": "But I think, and you've got to realize that it's not self evident that we can explain at an intuitively graspable level, something which, about the way the universe works, the universe wasn't built for our understanding, so to speak."}, {"time": 9376, "text": "But I think then, okay, so another important idea is this idea of branchial space, which I mentioned, this sort of space of quantum states."}, {"time": 9387, "text": "It is, okay, so I mentioned Einstein's equations describing the effect of mass and energy on trajectories of particles, on GD6."}, {"time": 9400, "text": "The curvature of physical space is associated with the presence of energy, according to Einstein's equations, okay?"}, {"time": 9409, "text": "So it turns out that, rather amazingly, the same thing is true in branchial space."}, {"time": 9414, "text": "So it turns out the presence of energy or more accurately Lagrangian density, which is a kind of relativistic invariant version of energy, the presence of that causes essentially deflection of GD6 in this branchial space, okay?"}, {"time": 9431, "text": "So you might say, so what?"}, {"time": 9461, "text": "And so the big story has been, how do you derive these quantum amplitudes?"}, {"time": 9465, "text": "And people think these quantum amplitudes, they have a complex number, has a real part and an imaginary part."}, {"time": 9471, "text": "You can also think of it as a magnitude and a phase."}, {"time": 9473, "text": "And people have sort of thought these quantum amplitudes have magnitude and phase, and you compute those together."}, {"time": 9480, "text": "Turns out that the magnitude and the phase come from completely different places."}, {"time": 9486, "text": "The magnitude comes, okay, so how do you compute things in quantum mechanics?"}, {"time": 9490, "text": "Roughly, I'm telling you, I'm getting there to be able to do this at a middle school level, but I'm not there yet."}, {"time": 9497, "text": "Roughly what happens is you're asking, does this state in quantum mechanics evolve to this other state in quantum mechanics?"}, {"time": 9507, "text": "And you can think about that like a particle traveling or something traveling through physical space, but instead it's traveling through branchial space."}, {"time": 9516, "text": "And so what's happening is, does this quantum state evolve to this other quantum state?"}, {"time": 9519, "text": "It's like saying, does this object move from this place in space to this other place in space?"}, {"time": 9525, "text": "Okay, now the way that these quantum amplitudes characterize kind of to what extent the thing will successfully reach some particular point in branchial space, just like in physical space, you could say, oh, it had a certain velocity and it went in this direction."}, {"time": 9542, "text": "In branchial space, there's a similar kind of concept."}, {"time": 9545, "text": "Is there a nice way to visualize for me now mentally branchial space?"}, {"time": 9550, "text": "It's just, you have this hypergraph, sorry, you have this multiway graph."}, {"time": 9555, "text": "It's this big branching thing, branching and merging thing."}, {"time": 9558, "text": "But I mean, like moving through that space, I'm just trying to understand what that looks like."}, {"time": 9565, "text": "You know, that space is probably exponential dimensional, which makes it again, another can of worms in understanding what's going on."}, {"time": 9573, "text": "That space as in an ordinary space, this hypergraph, the spatial hypergraph limits to something which is like a manifold, like something like three dimensional space."}, {"time": 9585, "text": "Almost certainly the multiway graph limits to a Hilbert space, which is something that, I mean, it's just a weird exponential dimensional space."}, {"time": 9595, "text": "And by the way, you can ask, I mean, there are much weirder things that go on."}, {"time": 9598, "text": "For example, one of the things I've been interested in is the expansion of the universe in branchial space."}, {"time": 9603, "text": "So we know the universe is expanding in physical space, but the universe is probably also expanding in branchial space."}, {"time": 9610, "text": "So that means the number of quantum states of the universe is increasing with time."}, {"time": 9615, "text": "The diameter of the thing is growing."}, {"time": 9617, "text": "Right, so that means that the, and by the way, this is related to whether quantum computing can ever work."}, {"time": 9629, "text": "Okay, so let me explain why."}, {"time": 9630, "text": "So let's talk about, okay, so first of all, just to finish the thought about quantum amplitudes, that the incredibly beautiful thing, but I'm just very excited about this."}, {"time": 9640, "text": "The fine path integral is this formula."}, {"time": 9644, "text": "It says that the amplitude, the quantum amplitude is E to the I S over H bar, where S is the thing called the action."}, {"time": 9651, "text": "And it, okay, so that can be thought of as representing a deflection of the angle of this path in the multiway graph."}, {"time": 9662, "text": "So it's a deflection of a geodesic in the multiway path that is caused by this thing called the action, which is essentially associated with energy, okay?"}, {"time": 9670, "text": "And so this is a deflection of a path in branchial space that is described by this path integral, which is the thing that is the mathematical essence of quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 9679, "text": "Turns out that deflection is, the deflection of geodesics in branchial space follows the exact same mathematical setup as the deflection of geodesics in physical space, except the deflection of geodesics in physical space is described with Einstein's equations."}, {"time": 9696, "text": "The deflection of geodesics in branchial space is defined by the Feynman path integral, and they are the same."}, {"time": 9702, "text": "In other words, they are mathematically the same."}, {"time": 9705, "text": "So that means that general relativity is a story of essentially motion in physical space."}, {"time": 9713, "text": "Quantum mechanics is a story of essentially motion in branchial space."}, {"time": 9717, "text": "And the underlying equation for those two things, although it's presented differently because one's interested in different things in branchial space than physical space, but the underlying equation is the same."}, {"time": 9728, "text": "So in other words, it's just these two theories, which are those two sort of pillars of 20th century physics, which have seemed to be off in different directions, are actually facets of the exact same theory."}, {"time": 9744, "text": "That's exciting to see where that evolves and exciting that that just is there."}, {"time": 9749, "text": "Right, I mean, to me, look, having spent some part of my early life working in the context of these theories of 20th century physics, it's, they just, they seem so different."}, {"time": 9761, "text": "And the fact that they're really the same is just really amazing."}, {"time": 9766, "text": "Actually, you mentioned double slit experiment, okay?"}, {"time": 9792, "text": "But in quantum mechanics, there's this phenomenon of destructive interference that means that even though there are two slits, two can lead to nothing, as opposed to two leading to more than, for example, one slit."}, {"time": 9805, "text": "And what happens in this model, and we've just been understanding this in the last few weeks, actually, is that what essentially happens is that the double slit experiment is a story of the interface between branchial space and physical space."}, {"time": 9821, "text": "And what's essentially happening is that the destructive interference is the result of the two possible paths associated with photons going through those two slits winding up at opposite ends of branchial space."}, {"time": 9833, "text": "And so that's why there's sort of nothing there when you look at it, is because these two different sort of branches couldn't get merged together to produce something that you can measure in physical space."}, {"time": 9847, "text": "Is there a lot to be understood about branchial space?"}, {"time": 9850, "text": "I guess, mathematically speaking."}, {"time": 9853, "text": "Yes, it's a very beautiful mathematical thing."}, {"time": 9856, "text": "And it's very, I mean, by the way, this whole theory is just amazingly rich in terms of the mathematics that it says should exist."}, {"time": 9864, "text": "Okay, so for example, calculus is a story of infinitesimal change in integer dimensional space, one dimensional, two dimensional, three dimensional space."}, {"time": 9874, "text": "We need a theory of infinitesimal change in fractional dimensional and dynamic dimensional space."}, {"time": 9881, "text": "No such theory exists."}, {"time": 9882, "text": "So there's tools of mathematics that are needed here."}, {"time": 9886, "text": "And this is a motivation for that actually."}, {"time": 9887, "text": "Right, and there are indications and we can do computer experiments and we can see how it's gonna come out, but we need to, the actual mathematics doesn't exist."}, {"time": 9898, "text": "And in branchial space, it's actually even worse."}, {"time": 9900, "text": "There's even more sort of layers of mathematics that are, we can see how it works roughly by doing computer experiments, but to really understand it, we need more sort of mathematical sophistication."}, {"time": 9913, "text": "So quantum computers."}, {"time": 9914, "text": "Okay, so the basic idea of quantum computers, the promise of quantum computers is quantum mechanics does things in parallel."}, {"time": 9923, "text": "And so you can sort of intrinsically do computations in parallel."}, {"time": 9927, "text": "And somehow that can be much more efficient than just doing them one after another."}, {"time": 9933, "text": "And I actually worked on quantum computing a bit with Dick Feynman back in 1981, two, three, that kind of timeframe."}, {"time": 9941, "text": "And we..."}, {"time": 9942, "text": "It's a fascinating image."}, {"time": 9943, "text": "You and Feynman working on quantum computers."}, {"time": 9946, "text": "Well, we tried to work, the big thing we tried to do was invent a randomness chip that would generate randomness at a high speed using quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 9955, "text": "And the discovery that that wasn't really possible was part of the story of, we never really wrote anything about it."}, {"time": 9963, "text": "I think maybe he wrote some stuff, but we didn't write stuff about what we figured out about sort of the fact that it really seemed like the measurement process in quantum mechanics was a serious damper on what was possible to do in sort of the possible advantages of quantum mechanics for computing."}, {"time": 9980, "text": "But anyway, so the sort of the promise of quantum computing is let's say you're trying to factor an integer."}, {"time": 9988, "text": "Well, you can, instead of, when you factor an integer, you might say, well, does this factor work?"}, {"time": 9992, "text": "Does this factor work?"}, {"time": 9995, "text": "In ordinary computing, it seems like we pretty much just have to try all these different factors, kind of one after another."}, {"time": 10003, "text": "But in quantum mechanics, you might have the idea, oh, you can just sort of have the physics, try all of them in parallel, okay?"}, {"time": 10011, "text": "And there's this algorithm, Shor's algorithm, which allows you, according to the formalism of quantum mechanics, to do everything in parallel and to do it much faster than you can on a classical computer."}, {"time": 10025, "text": "Okay, the only little footnote is you have to figure out what the answer is."}, {"time": 10029, "text": "You have to measure the result."}, {"time": 10032, "text": "So the quantum mechanics internally has figured out all these different branches, but then you have to pull all these branches together to say, and the classical answer is this, okay?"}, {"time": 10041, "text": "The standard theory of quantum mechanics does not tell you how to do that."}, {"time": 10044, "text": "It tells you how the branching works, but it doesn't tell you the process of corralling all these things together."}, {"time": 10050, "text": "And that process, which intuitively you can see is gonna be kind of tricky, but our model actually does tell you how that process of pulling things together works."}, {"time": 10060, "text": "And the answer seems to be, we're not absolutely sure."}, {"time": 10062, "text": "We've only got to two times three so far which is kind of in this factorization in quantum computers."}, {"time": 10071, "text": "But we can, what seems to be the case is that the advantage you get from the parallelization from quantum mechanics is lost from the amount that you have to spend pulling together all those parallel threads to get to a classical answer at the end."}, {"time": 10087, "text": "Now, that phenomenon is not unrelated to various decoherence phenomena that are seen in practical quantum computers and so on."}, {"time": 10094, "text": "I mean, I should say as a very practical point, I mean, it's like, should people stop bothering to do quantum computing research?"}, {"time": 10100, "text": "No, because what they're really doing is they're trying to use physics to get to a new level of what's possible in computing."},

that's not relevant to the practical speed ups you can get by using different kinds of technologies, different kinds of physics to do basic computing."}, {"time": 10132, "text": "But you're saying, I

math."}, {"time": 13086, "text": "One is that it's hard, and the other is that it's doable, okay?"}, {"time": 13090, "text": "So first question is, why is math hard?"}, {"time": 13092, "text": "You know, you've got these axioms."}, {"time": 13093, "text": "They're very small."}, {"time": 13094, "text": "Why can't you just solve every problem in math easily?"}, {"time": 13097, "text": "Yeah, it's

doable."}, {"time": 13232, "text": "Oh yes, the second part."}, {"time": 13234, "text": "So you know why it's hard, why is it doable?"}, {"time": 13236, "text": "Right, why do we not just get lost in undecidability all the time?"}, {"time": 13240, "text": "So, and here's another fact, is in doing computer experiments and doing experimental mathematics, you do get lost in that way."}, {"time": 13249, "text": "When you just say, I'm picking a random integer equation."}, {"time": 13253, "text": "How do I, does it have a solution or not?"}, {"time": 13256, "text": "And you just pick it at

13264, "text": "We just pick them at random from the space of possibilities."}, {"time": 13267, "text": "But what I think is happening is, and that's a case where you just fell off into this ocean of sort of irreducibility and so on."}, {"time": 13275, "text": "What's happening is human mathematics is a story of building a path."}, {"time": 13279, "text": "You started off, you're always building out on this path where you are proving things."}, {"time": 13285, "text": "You've got this proof trajectory and you're basically, the human mathematics is the sort of the exploration of the world

often you'll see a little piece of undecidability and you'll avoid that part of the path."}, {"time": 13317, "text": "But that's basically the story of why human mathematics has seemed to be doable."}, {"time": 13322, "text": "It's a story of exploring these paths that are by their nature, they have been constructed to be paths that can be followed."}, {"time": 13330, "text": "And so you can follow them further."}, {"time": 13332, "text": "Now, why is this relevant to anything?"}, {"time": 13334, "text": "So, okay, so here's my belief."}, {"time": 13339, "text": "The fact that human mathematics works that way is I think there's some sort of connections between the way that observers work in physics and the way that the axiom systems of mathematics are set up to make mathematics be doable in that kind of way."}, {"time": 13356, "text": "And so, in other words, in particular, I think there is an analog of causal invariance, which I think is, and this is again, it's sort of the

mathematics."}, {"time": 13378, "text": "Mathematics itself is an abstraction, but it's an abstraction of the abstraction of mathematics."}, {"time": 13383, "text": "And there is the thing called the

this?"}, {"time": 13403, "text": "There's a statement of it that's fairly accessible."}, {"time": 13405, "text": "I mean, the statement of it is, basically it says things which are equivalent can be considered to be identical."}, {"time": 13415, "text": "In which space?"}, {"time": 13418, "text": "Yeah, it's in higher category."}, {"time": 13420, "text": "In category."}, {"time": 13421, "text": "Okay, so it's a, but I mean, the thing just to give a sketch of how that works."}, {"time": 13426, "text": "So category theory is an attempt to idealize, it's an attempt to sort of have a formal theory of mathematics that is at a sort of higher level than mathematics."}, {"time": 13435, "text": "It's where you just think about these mathematical objects and these categories of objects and these morphisms, these connections between categories."}, {"time": 13445, "text": "Okay, so it turns out the morphisms and categories, at least weak categories, are very much like the paths in our hypergraphs and things."}, {"time": 13454, "text": "And it turns out, again, this is where it all gets crazy."}, {"time": 13458, "text": "I mean, the fact that these things are connected is just bizarre."}, {"time": 13462, "text": "So category theory, our causal graphs are like second order category theory."}, {"time": 13469, "text": "And it turns out you can take the limits of infinite order category theory."}, {"time": 13474, "text": "So just give roughly the idea."}, {"time": 13476, "text": "This is a roughly explainable idea."}, {"time": 13479, "text": "So a mathematical proof will be a path that says you can get from this thing to this other thing."}, {"time": 13485, "text": "And here's the path that you get from this thing to this other thing."}, {"time": 13488, "text": "But in general, there may be many paths, many proofs that get you many different paths that all successfully go from this thing to this other thing, okay?"}, {"time": 13497, "text": "Now you can define a higher order proof, which is a proof of the equivalence of those proofs."}, {"time": 13503, "text": "Okay, so you're saying there's a... A path between those proofs essentially."}, {"time": 13507, "text": "Yes, a path between the paths, okay?"}, {"time": 13509, "text": "And so you do that."}, {"time": 13510, "text": "That's the sort of second order thing."}, {"time": 13512, "text": "That path between the paths is essentially related to our causal graphs."}, {"time": 13518, "text": "Then you can take the limit."}, {"time": 13520, "text": "The path between path, between path, between path."}, {"time": 13523, "text": "The infinite limit."}, {"time": 13524, "text": "That infinite limit turns out to be our Rulial Multiway System."}, {"time": 13528, "text": "Yeah, the Rulial Multiway System, that's a fascinating, both in the physics world and as you're saying now, that's fast."}, {"time": 13536, "text": "I'm not sure I've loaded it in completely, but...

13547, "text": "No, but the thing which is sort of interesting to me is that there's sort of an upper reach of mathematics, of the abstraction of mathematics."}, {"time": 13555, "text": "This thing, there's this mathematician called Grothendieck who's generally viewed as being sort of one of the most abstract, sort of creator of the most abstract mathematics of 1970s ish timeframe."}, {"time": 13569, "text": "And one of the things that he constructed was this thing he called the Infinity Grupoid."}, {"time": 13573, "text": "And he has this sort of hypothesis about the inevitable appearance of geometry from essentially logic in the structure of this thing."}, {"time": 13582, "text": "Well, it turns out this Rulial Multiway System is the Infinity Grupoid."}, {"time": 13586, "text": "So it's this limiting object."}, {"time": 13589, "text": "And this is an instance of that limiting object."}, {"time": 13593, "text": "So what to me is, I mean, again, I've been always afraid of this kind of mathematics because it seemed incomprehensibly abstract to me."}, {"time": 13602, "text": "But what I'm sort of excited about with this is that we've sort of concretified the way that you can reach this kind of mathematics, which makes it, well, both seem more relevant and also the fact that I don't yet know exactly what mileage we're gonna get from using the sort of the apparatus that's been built in those areas of mathematics to analyze what we're doing."}, {"time": 13626, "text": "But the thing that's."}, {"time": 13627, "text": "So both ways."}, {"time": 13628, "text": "So using mathematics to understand what you're doing and using what you're doing computationally to understand that."}, {"time": 13633, "text": "Right, so for example, the understanding of metamathematical

have an incredibly minimal model, and this happened with cellular automata as well, cellular automata are an incredibly minimal model."}, {"time": 13876, "text": "And so it's inevitable that it gets

theory be?"}, {"time": 14153, "text": "And should that theory be one that, where I think the point is, if it's simple, it's almost inevitably somewhat beautiful in the sense that, because all the

inhale, this isn't breath work."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "We're not going to do breath work."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "But when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "The

flagging, you do not have the energy to get up, it's like, okay, it's time to go and you're exhausted, you want to draw more oxygen into the system, get your heart rate going faster."}, {"time": 2864,

{"time": 2903, "text": "What this will do is that when you do the double inhale has the effect of reopening the alveoli of the lungs, your lungs are filled with tons of little sacks, when they tend to

3000, "text": "So double inhale, exhale while you're in steady effort."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "And then if you really feel like you need to gas it and you're pushing, the data show that then just

think is an excellent conversationalist, you just lose track of time."}, {"time": 8547, "text": "It can be three, four, five hours and you lose track of time."}, {"time": 8550, "text": "I'm still not there."}, {"time": 8551, "text": "I find that it's still painful."}, {"time": 8554, "text": "Like the conversation is still challenging sometimes."}, {"time": 8556, "text": "You don't lose quite as much of track of time."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "It's still an intellectual effort."}, {"time": 8560, "text": "And I think it might always be as it would be with you because you're talking about difficult topics, maybe that require more brain."}, {"time": 8567, "text": "You're not just shooting the shit with like a Brian Red Band or somebody like comedians or just joking."}, {"time": 8573, "text": "What's like, remember those shows, like where those shows where someone would come out and like spin plates and they're running back and forth."}, {"time": 8582, "text": "Really good scientific discussion is like that."}, {"time": 8585, "text": "You have to be maintaining three or four different logical arguments and jumping back and forth."}, {"time": 8590, "text": "It's occasionally get into like a real streak of linearity."}, {"time": 8593, "text": "But as we found today that typically there's three or four different things that we're bouncing back and forth from."}, {"time": 8599, "text": "And that requires a lot of updating of these, you know, forebrain circuits."}, {"time": 8603, "text": "It's not a passive listening experience."}, {"time": 8605, "text": "But I like to think that the brain likes that."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "I do want to ask just cause we all, I don't want to forget the question came up to me is your podcast has the same kind of rigor that I think like a Dan Carlin podcast has who's a history podcaster."}, {"time": 8626, "text": "Well, that's a definitely a compliment."}, {"time": 8628, "text": "Dan's way, you know, he's something for me to aspire to."}, {"time": 8632, "text": "He goes through hell to prepare."}, {"time": 8634, "text": "He spends months preparing."}, {"time": 8636, "text": "It feels like you've had to really prepare for your podcast."}, {"time": 8641, "text": "I definitely prepare hard."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "How does that?"}, {"time": 8647, "text": "I mean, how much effort does that take?"}, {"time": 8649, "text": "It feels like a conference presentation."}, {"time": 8652, "text": "So we record once a week and in the intervening time, I listened to many university level lectures."}, {"time": 8661, "text": "So NIH has a bank of lectures."}, {"time": 8665, "text": "I have some sources of recorded university seminars."}, {"time": 8668, "text": "I'm trying to find the points of intersection."}, {"time": 8672, "text": "So like for four episodes on sleep, it's not like I'm going to just regurgitate a popular book or take one lecture and just poach the content."}, {"time": 8679, "text": "I'm going to find the overlap in the different elements."}, {"time": 8683, "text": "I also, so what I'll do is I'll generally read 10 or 15 papers and generally those are good reviews, annual reviews, any review of neuroscience, annual review of physiology, those kinds of things."}, {"time": 8695, "text": "I'll chase a few references."}, {"time": 8696, "text": "I'll listen to some YouTube videos, but of university level lectures."}, {"time": 8700, "text": "And then I throw all that on a whiteboard."}, {"time": 8703, "text": "Usually while I work out in the morning, I'll just be working out."}, {"time": 8706, "text": "I have a gym in my house and I'll just put up all these random ideas."}, {"time": 8710, "text": "I want to cover that dreams, hallucination."}, {"time": 8712, "text": "And then I take that and I start to eliminate, I draw lines between the common points of intersection."}, {"time": 8717, "text": "And then from that, I distill out an outline."}, {"time": 8721, "text": "And then I basically think about what I want to say on my walks with my dog."}, {"time": 8727, "text": "And I bother a couple of people and blab to them."}, {"time": 8729, "text": "So I would say each podcast, yeah, I put in 10 to 15 hours at least of passive listening preparation and maybe five or six of active preparation."}, {"time": 8738, "text": "So I do prepare quite a lot, but it has a certain reward component for me."}, {"time": 8744, "text": "To come up at the end with something that's somewhat crystallized for me is just so satisfying."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "It feel like there's something about my dopamine circuits that just love that."}, {"time": 8754, "text": "And the only pain is that a year later after I've talked about the stuff a bunch of times, it's so much more succinct, but that's life."}, {"time": 8764, "text": "At some point you got to pull the trigger."}, {"time": 8765, "text": "Well, I don't know what you think, but for me, YouTube is, that's why I'm sad that Joe left YouTube."}, {"time": 8773, "text": "There's a archival nature to YouTube that's kind of magical."}, {"time": 8776, "text": "And so I'm really glad you're now, you're doing a lot of educational content on Instagram and Instagram before, but now I'm doing this podcasting on YouTube."}, {"time": 8789, "text": "It's like, you know, it's like Feynman lectures."}, {"time": 8792, "text": "Like, I'm not saying every podcast, but there will be, you will have some, I could already tell there'll be some lectures which are like definitive, like really special ones."}, {"time": 8808, "text": "And there's some aspect that's archival to YouTube where at least I hope like 20 years from now, some kid is gonna watch a lecture of yours and it'll create the next Nobel prize, right?"}, {"time": 8822, "text": "It'll create another dream that then becomes a reality."}, {"time": 8828, "text": "And then that's a special thing that YouTube provides."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "So I'm really excited that you're on YouTube."}, {"time": 8834, "text": "And at the same time, I'm excited to see where this thing goes because it seems like change is the cliche thing, that change is the only constant in these times because you're paving with this podcast, with this creativity, what you were doing on Instagram as well, you're paving the new era of what it means to do science."}, {"time": 8857, "text": "So actively doing research and actively explaining that research in new media."}, {"time": 8862, "text": "It's very interesting to see."}, {"time": 8864, "text": "I'm genuinely inspired by you."}, {"time": 8867, "text": "We had this discussion last time after the podcast recording, and it's clear that communication of science cannot be left to the existing institutions."}, {"time": 8878, "text": "And I'm not talking about universities."}, {"time": 8879, "text": "I just mean that the science section of newspapers is, sometimes there's some gems there, but generally it goes, you know?"}, {"time": 8888, "text": "And I think you really have to know a field in order to extract the best things from that field."}, {"time": 8893, "text": "And my hope is that other practicing scientists and people finishing their PhD and postdoc and people who are running labs or working at companies will start to do this."}, {"time": 8902, "text": "I mean, how amazing would it be, for instance, if someone at Neuralink was giving us hints about not necessarily what they're developing because that's complicated for all sorts of reasons, but would talk to us about what the real challenges of building futuristic brain machine interface are like and what it means to understand a clinical problem and address it."}, {"time": 8927, "text": "I mean, my hope is somebody there might eventually do that, that somebody in the world of chemistry or synthetic materials or whatever it is will do this in a way that I could understand because I don't have expertise in those."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "I think it would be marvelous."}, {"time": 8942, "text": "And you were tip of the spear, you were out first, and I'm just happily trying to move along in the direction I'm going."}, {"time": 8950, "text": "But I think the future of science education is online."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "And I think that's gonna be scary to a lot of existing institutions, but it's not about disrupting anything."}, {"time": 8961, "text": "It's just about trying to do things better."}, {"time": 8963, "text": "Yeah, some of the best interviews, some of the best investigative journalism is done by people inside the field."}, {"time": 8973, "text": "Comes to mind a guy by the name of Elon Musk, who I love the possibility that he gets a Pulitzer for that interview."}, {"time": 8981, "text": "But he grilled the crap out of Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood."}, {"time": 8986, "text": "I'm not sure if you're familiar."}, {"time": 8987, "text": "Oh, on Clubhouse the other night."}, {"time": 8990, "text": "Yeah, I saw you guys in there."}, {"time": 8991, "text": "I was kept out, I wasn't quick enough."}, {"time": 8993, "text": "My thumbs don't go fast enough."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "So I was, and I wasn't about to sit in the waiting room."}, {"time": 8997, "text": "Have you tried that social network, by the way, the Clubhouse?"}, {"time": 8999, "text": "I've gone in there a few times and checked some things out."}, {"time": 9003, "text": "I'm there, I have a few questions about it that like if I'm in there, how one can participate or not participate."}, {"time": 9011, "text": "I like being a fly on the wall for those conversations."}, {"time": 9013, "text": "I've been very curious as to what's going on in there."}, {"time": 9015, "text": "Oh, it's quite, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts."}, {"time": 9018, "text": "Maybe it's useful to comment."}, {"time": 9020, "text": "I also have a Discord server that has a few tens of thousands of people on it."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "And then they have also a voice chat capability."}, {"time": 9031, "text": "So there's these get togethers."}, {"time": 9033, "text": "And I was using it in the spring and summer, like actively on those voice discussions."}, {"time": 9040, "text": "And it's anywhere from 10 to like 1,000 people all together in voice."}, {"time": 9046, "text": "Like anyone can speak anytime, right?"}, {"time": 9049, "text": "But there's this weird dynamic that people stay quiet."}, {"time": 9052, "text": "Only one person speaks at a time because they're all like respectful."}, {"time": 9055, "text": "And it's a community of like fundamentally respectful people, even though they're all anonymous."}, {"time": 9061, "text": "So like, except like me and a few others, it's all anonymous people."}, {"time": 9066, "text": "It's so interesting and it works."}, {"time": 9068, "text": "But the magical thing to me about that community was how intimate voice only communication can be."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "It felt as intimate as like a small get together at a home with close friends."}, {"time": 9087, "text": "It felt like there's a calmness to it."}, {"time": 9089, "text": "And you're revealing things about, you know, somebody suffering from depression or being suicidal."}, {"time": 9097, "text": "So those are the dark things or being super excited, getting a new girlfriend or boyfriend."}, {"time": 9102, "text": "Like just the depth of human experience shared on voice without video is, I was really surprised how intimate that is for human connection, especially in this time of COVID, it replaced that."}, {"time": 9114, "text": "So just to give you some context, there's something there."}, {"time": 9119, "text": "There's definitely something there."}, {"time": 9120, "text": "One thing that comes to mind is when like in Clubhouse, you have your little icon."}, {"time": 9124, "text": "So they don't actually, you don't see your face moving."}, {"time": 9126, "text": "I think when people see their own image, it puts them in a state of self consciousness that is eliminated by just having an icon or an avatar."}, {"time": 9135, "text": "So like Zoom is dreadful because if I'm not used to talking to people and seeing a little image of myself staring back at me in the mirror."}, {"time": 9144, "text": "And it's just, I know there are ways that you can adjust that, but it's really awful."}, {"time": 9149, "text": "And I think that when I get on Zooms now, I say hello and then I shut down the video component."}, {"time": 9154, "text": "And then I just talk in the end."}, {"time": 9155, "text": "I come back on just to show that still there, it's still me."}, {"time": 9158, "text": "But I think that voice only is really interesting."}, {"time": 9162, "text": "Eddie Chang would be an interesting person to talk to about this because he understands so much about how inflection communicates emotionality in deeper state."}, {"time": 9170, "text": "But there's a balance between, I think, just like you said, this is the privacy somehow allows for the intimacy."}, {"time": 9179, "text": "So like being able to, as opposed to putting on an act, which I realize we do when we're visually presenting ourselves in remote communication."}, {"time": 9188, "text": "But I think that there's so few places where people can actually communicate without the fear of penalty."}, {"time": 9195, "text": "That's woefully absent these days."}, {"time": 9199, "text": "And so maybe people are just relieved to be in a place where they feel like I can say what I want or not say anything and it's okay."}, {"time": 9206, "text": "And so Clubhouse, to answer your kind of question is, there was a big improvement to me over Discord, which is it has tiers, it has a stage where people, the person that created the room can invite people up that would like to speak potentially, have the opportunity to speak."}, {"time": 9223, "text": "And then there's a bigger audience that don't get a chance to speak unless they click raise their hand and they get called on."}, {"time": 9231, "text": "So there's like a tier system that allows for there to be a group of like five, 10, 20, 30 people talking and a lot larger amount in the audience, which in Discord was the problems that everybody could talk."}, {"time": 9246, "text": "And the other thing about Clubhouse is everybody is strongly encouraged to represent themselves."}, {"time": 9251, "text": "So you're using your real name, it's not anonymous."}, {"time": 9254, "text": "And how many people were in that GameStop discussion the other day?"}, {"time": 9258, "text": "They currently limit rooms to 5,000."}, {"time": 9263, "text": "So I'm sure maxed out at 5,000."}, {"time": 9265, "text": "There's a lot of overflow rooms."}, {"time": 9267, "text": "This is the cool thing about Clubhouse, really big people were on there all tuned in and having a conversation, having all from, all these different worlds being able to connect, even though without the niceties of like arranging the meeting, you could just show up and leave, which is really nice."}, {"time": 9285, "text": "But the reason for my lessons from Discord, I'm going to mostly stay away from Clubhouse."}, {"time": 9296, "text": "Or go in there under another name."}, {"time": 9300, "text": "I'll pretend I know the actual, your actual name."}, {"time": 9302, "text": "Yeah, it's, I've learned, it's quite addicting."}, {"time": 9306, "text": "It's a time sink."}, {"time": 9308, "text": "It's so, the intimacy of it is you find yourself wasting quite a bit of time on there."}, {"time": 9314, "text": "It pulls you in."}, {"time": 9316, "text": "They would in sort of going back to the podcast or earlier, we're talking about books or creating a technology."}, {"time": 9324, "text": "One thing that's absolutely clear is that anything that's easy to reproduce is probably not worth much effort and time."}, {"time": 9335, "text": "I mean, most posts could be easily reproduced."}, {"time": 9339, "text": "You just repost them."}, {"time": 9341, "text": "So now there are some original posts that for which the attribution goes to the original person and it's clear it came from you."}, {"time": 9348, "text": "But anything that can be easily reproduced is, doesn't really expand us very much as individuals or as groups."}, {"time": 9355, "text": "And most of what I see on social media is stuff that is purely reproduced."}, {"time": 9361, "text": "But I think Clubhouse, I mean, it could be that some real magic emerges on there."}, {"time": 9368, "text": "So in moderation could be good."}, {"time": 9370, "text": "The magic is, this is another thing that I've found through COVID that maybe you can think about is live."}, {"time": 9380, "text": "I used to be, not understand the appeal of live video or live connection or like in this Clubhouse live events."}, {"time": 9388, "text": "Because Clubhouse is technically, for the most part, it's not supposed to be recorded."}, {"time": 9394, "text": "Most people don't record most conversations."}, {"time": 9396, "text": "It's a one time live event."}, {"time": 9398, "text": "And there's a magic to that."}, {"time": 9401, "text": "That's not captured by like your podcast or my podcast produced video that's like recorded, like packaged up."}, {"time": 9410, "text": "Well, anything can happen."}, {"time": 9412, "text": "It's that anything can happen."}, {"time": 9414, "text": "And that's the kind of thing like live concerts."}, {"time": 9417, "text": "I definitely, I love live music."}, {"time": 9420, "text": "And it's the idea that, cause you can always listen to the album."}, {"time": 9423, "text": "Actually the album usually sounds cleaner and better, but it's just this idea that anything can happen."}, {"time": 9428, "text": "And then you listen to like the parts, I don't know, you like a Costello did something weird."}, {"time": 9433, "text": "Your dog did something weird."}, {"time": 9435, "text": "And then you have to go, God damn it."}, {"time": 9437, "text": "You have to go to the kitchen or something to get something."}, {"time": 9439, "text": "And then you come back and it's funny."}, {"time": 9442, "text": "I watched live video like that of people and I'll be there for the whole time."}, {"time": 9446, "text": "I'll wait for them to go to the kitchen and come back."}, {"time": 9448, "text": "It's not like I tune out."}, {"time": 9450, "text": "And that makes it like a richer experience for some reason."}, {"time": 9454, "text": "Well, it humanizes it."}, {"time": 9455, "text": "Yeah, humanizes it."}, {"time": 9456, "text": "And I think there is this weird effect of whether or not it's a podcast, Instagram or Twitter or anything else."}, {"time": 9461, "text": "There's kind of like two people shouting into a tunnel and then a bunch of people with ears at the other end of those tunnels and shouting some things back."}, {"time": 9469, "text": "You know, that's kind of the format we're in."}, {"time": 9472, "text": "I think I'll check out Clubhouse again."}, {"time": 9474, "text": "I've gone in there a few times during the day and I was surprised to see how many people were in there in the middle of the day."}, {"time": 9478, "text": "I was like, aren't these people supposed to be working?"}, {"time": 9481, "text": "But maybe that is their work."}, {"time": 9482, "text": "Well, be very careful about the time sink of it."}, {"time": 9487, "text": "But yeah, if you want to, you and I go together, we'll have a conversation on there."}, {"time": 9490, "text": "But one of the things you have to figure out, I don't still know how to do it, but how to exit."}, {"time": 9497, "text": "Which is like."}, {"time": 9498, "text": "And you just do the, isn't there the leave quietly button?"}, {"time": 9500, "text": "Yeah, no, but like when you and I are on stage having a conversation, okay, you and I is harder."}, {"time": 9507, "text": "But like you really, if it's just you and I, then it's the usual human communication of like, all right, I gotta go."}, {"time": 9515, "text": "Like, but when it's like four people, you don't want to interrupt everyone and announce you're leaving."}, {"time": 9521, "text": "You just have to, I mean, there's a weird dynamic that I haven't quite figured out of."}, {"time": 9525, "text": "The etiquette isn't clear."}, {"time": 9527, "text": "The etiquette is not clear."}, {"time": 9528, "text": "Well, the etiquette on different platforms and how that changes is really interesting."}, {"time": 9534, "text": "You know, how YouTube has one etiquette, which is kind of, it's a lot of harshness is tolerated on YouTube video comments."}, {"time": 9541, "text": "Twitter seems a bit harsher than Instagram."}, {"time": 9544, "text": "Instagram, there's kind of, it seems to be a little."}, {"time": 9545, "text": "People are nice."}, {"time": 9546, "text": "People are really nice."}, {"time": 9547, "text": "People are really nice on Instagram for the most part, except for those phishing things."}, {"time": 9553, "text": "I actually know someone who had their quite sizable account poached by those copyright."}, {"time": 9558, "text": "They come in with those like, you violated copyright thing."}, {"time": 9561, "text": "There's all sorts of harshness in there that if you think about it in the real world, I like to think about Instagram as if it was the real world."}, {"time": 9568, "text": "Someone comes over and is basically saying like, hey, can I hold your wallet and go into the bank and I'll get some money out for you?"}, {"time": 9573, "text": "And like, but there's this trust based on the format it comes in that it can almost get past your radar unless you're suspicious."}, {"time": 9580, "text": "If you took comments, like, you know, you're posting a lot of comments and you said, you just walk past 500 random people on the street and just listen to what they say, it's like, that's ridiculous."}, {"time": 9592, "text": "I don't have time for that."}, {"time": 9593, "text": "But the comments somehow take on this importance and this relevance."}, {"time": 9596, "text": "And you feel, we feel obligated to give them value, right?"}, {"time": 9600, "text": "And so the online communities, the rules really are different."}, {"time": 9606, "text": "And they evolve with time, which is fascinating."}, {"time": 9608, "text": "With Clubhouse, it's a new social network, so it's evolving and people are figuring it out as you go."}, {"time": 9613, "text": "And the same thing with podcasting on video and like scientific podcasting."}, {"time": 9618, "text": "This is the cool thing when I look at what you've created, I'm learning, I'm thinking like, hmm, that's interesting to do it this way."}, {"time": 9626, "text": "Because like, I have nobody to copy."}, {"time": 9629, "text": "Not many people to copy, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 9631, "text": "Well, you threw out an idea."}, {"time": 9632, "text": "I'm not gonna put it out here now, cause I don't wanna, cause knowing you, you'll hold yourself to it no matter what."}, {"time": 9638, "text": "But when we talked about this issue of the challenge of staying on a particular topic for a while, I mean, you do have some cool stuff brewing in there."}, {"time": 9646, "text": "Oh, no, no, no."}, {"time": 9647, "text": "That's separate from this format."}, {"time": 9648, "text": "And I love your interview format, but when you told me about that, I got really excited that you might go forward."}, {"time": 9654, "text": "I'm not gonna tell your audience what it is, but I will say this, it is super cool."}, {"time": 9658, "text": "I would have never thought about it."}, {"time": 9660, "text": "It's distinctly different than what I'm doing or what Lex is currently doing."}, {"time": 9663, "text": "And if you decide to do that podcast, I will be your first and your number one fan."}, {"time": 9669, "text": "And I know there are gonna be millions of other people interested in that."}, {"time": 9672, "text": "It would be amazing."}, {"time": 9673, "text": "So if you decide to go forward with the idea, that would be awesome."}, {"time": 9679, "text": "I was gonna say what it is, but now I'm not going to because, cause that's even more interesting."}, {"time": 9684, "text": "I brought up the clubhouse thing actually in Elon, because I just wanted to get your thoughts about something he's said a few times to me and in general, is that he's under a huge amount of stress."}, {"time": 9700, "text": "And I'm thinking of doing a startup now and kind of thinking about all of this."}, {"time": 9707, "text": "Cause I enjoy podcasts, I enjoy science, but he says that his life is basically hell."}, {"time": 9717, "text": "He looks happy, but he's probably very good at."}, {"time": 9719, "text": "He's fulfilled."}, {"time": 9721, "text": "He's fulfilled, but the stress levels, the constant fires that he has to put out."}, {"time": 9728, "text": "And he says that most people wouldn't want to be me."}, {"time": 9731, "text": "And that basically the reason he does what he does is because there's probably something wrong with

have good internet on Tuesday, but not any other day."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "So when you live in that kind of environment, you really do need to think carefully about a whole new class of protocols."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And then you need to think carefully about a whole new class of tools and techniques to test the reliability of those systems."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And you need to separate the world and say, what is high assurance and cannot fail?"}, {"time": 1255, "text": "Because if it fails, people lose money."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "And what is low assurance?"}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And it's okay if that falls apart."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "The other thing I'll mention is there are perverse financial incentives in our industry."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "Because the reality is when something blows up, the people who built those things that blow up usually get paid upfront."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "So what they're focusing on is time to market, speed to market, and getting tokens out and getting them liquid."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "And then people come in, they buy it, but if there's a nascent bug in some DeFi protocol, it'll probably be discovered six months later or something like that."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "It blows up, who suffers?"}, {"time": 1287, "text": "The users."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "The people that created that already got paid."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "Exactly, that's why you pay the guy who makes the breaks software for your train last."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And you make sure he rides the train every day."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "So you're basically describing the complexity of a distributed system that's fundamentally game theoretic."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "And like, if we think about turtles all the way down, it's humans all the way down."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "I mean, at the very bottom is still human nature."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "Is there something you can say formally about human nature to try, you said you can't, there's certain parts of the system that can't fail."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "Some people talk about nuclear war in that same kind of way, that there's this game theoretic construction of mutually assured destruction."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "Oh, that rhymes, see, I'm a poet."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "That system can't fail because you're gonna blow everyone up but you can't formally say for sure it's not going to fail."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "So like, you're basically trying to chase, like statistically reduce the probability that these particular critical aspects will fail."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "And then you test, I guess, by deploying in the real world at small scale to see where things go wrong."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "Yeah, it's a great question."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "And the problem with game theory and mechanism design is that you can develop this concept of a rational actor."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "And I don't think in my life I've ever met a rational actor."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "There's a rational actor on Tuesday, but any other day of the week, who the hell knows?"}, {"time": 1369, "text": "And there's even, I think there was a book Freakonomics and there's a few of these things where it just shows again and again where people behave in ways that are against their best interest."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "So then you have these protocol designers and they say, well, we need an honest majority for this thing to work."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "And they say, okay, well, we'll create this incentive model and rational actors will behave with that incentive model."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "And they say, well, the individual won't do that but the firm, the government, the entity will."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "The problem with that is we have a lot of counter examples where the system was actually behaving in weird ways."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "Like we almost completely eradicated the human population twice in the 20th century, once during the Cuban missile crisis."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "And again, in the 1980s, there was a Russian Colonel and they installed a new satellite system and it said, hey, the Americans are launching missiles at us."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "You need to turn the key in, launch all the missiles in the silo."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "And he said, oh, that's not right."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "That doesn't seem right."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And he was reprimanded for not launching the missiles."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "So in both cases, a single person stood against the systems of superpowers between us and nuclear annihilation."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So in general, we're really bad at building these types of things."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "So what you look for instead is say, can the system be self correcting?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "It's not about avoiding a problem."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "It's more about can the problem be resolved?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And that's how nature engineers things."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "It gives you an immune system."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "It gives you the ability to heal."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "If a rainforest has a fire or some catastrophic event, the ecosystem will find a way to patch things up."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "So it's a better question of how do you align the incentives over the longterm of a system where all the actors within the system, when an event occurs that disrupts it, have an incentive to push it back into a healthy, productive, useful state, which is going back kind of to that complexity theory stuff that we began with and a little bit about, how do you handle modern economics?"}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Like for example, we knew this coming into the COVID crisis that there would be catastrophic economic disruption throughout the entire world."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "In the developed world, it was print lots of money and hope to God it works."}, {"time": 1489, "text": "In the developing world is try not to starve to death."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "Over 100 million people were pushed into acute starvation."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "So acute hunger, it's a terrible situation."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "But every economist knew we were going into that."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "So the question is how do you restart the system?"}, {"time": 1502, "text": "How do you realign the system and so forth and make sure that it doesn't collapse at some point."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "So it's an imperfect, inexact science."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "And that's actually one of the things that makes our industry so much fun is that these are kind of like micro experiments for the macro."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "In the years past, you never got a chance to experiment with monetary policy."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "I mean, it's like every 20 years, 30 years, you'd have some conference, usually in a cool island like Jamaica and be like, okay, let's go talk about monetary policy and like amend the Bretton Woods Agreement."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "And these would be nation states, invitation only."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And now you have over 8,000 cryptocurrencies floating around all with their own monetary policy and their rules and it's very Darwinian."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "A lot are dying, some are succeeding."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "Anomalies happen like Dogecoin and you say, God, is this temporary, is this permanent?"}, {"time": 1548, "text": "Why doesn't this horrible thing die?"}, {"time": 1551, "text": "And then other things you think would be absolutely successful and just take off and be in the top 10 don't really get as much traction."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "Like Al Grant is a great example of that."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "I mean, Silvio, he's an incredibly bright guy."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Every time I go to MIT, we have dinner and his work is legendary and it's just beautiful and elegant and he literally has all the people."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "He went and hired Tal Robin and she got at IBM Research and Craig Gentry, the guy who did homomorphic encryption under Dan Boneh is there."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "There's all these amazing people on that team and they have money in the VCs."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So you'd say, okay, that's a contender."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "But if you look at market adoption, Ethereum Classic sometimes is above it and other things are above it."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "And then there's this weird Darwinian evolution produced Dogecoin organism that's just stomping all around."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "Evolution doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "Exactly, but maybe it's worth the problem, not evolution, because the market's the market and you can scream and cry and pout and stamp your foot and say this makes no sense, but that's the way the world works."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "There's plenty of mountain climbers that didn't want gravity to apply to them and it's the same situation here."}, {"time": 1618, "text": "There's plenty of people in these marketplaces that had the best of intentions, the best team, the best technology, and for whatever reason, they didn't get that adoption."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "So the question isn't the local, it should be the longterm and will the system over time converge to a state that actually is useful and meaningful to society and actually solve problems for it and that's what we try to figure out is how do we perturb these things in a way to kind of push them in that direction."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "So before we go into this fascinating Darwinian evolution of cryptocurrencies, let me ask you sort of a basic programming question."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "Yeah, so there's the pedagogy of learning how to program and to express the theory of computer science."}, {"time": 1717, "text": "I still love Lisp."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "Oh man, it's great, these are your father's parentheses, they're elegant weapons from a time long ago."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "But that's a great starting point and it's not about falling in love with a language, it's just falling in love with computing, it's about falling in love with having a dialogue with a computer and thinking about, well, how would I solve that?"}, {"time": 1736, "text": "How would I interact with that?"}, {"time": 1737, "text": "What does this need to look like?"}, {"time": 1768, "text": "You might think that what you've built is the paper but the computer's not going to tell you that because the paper's written in prose and maybe typed up in LaTeX or something but there's no proof chain, evidence chain that you can show that there's no ambiguity."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "When you look at a functional language, you're a little closer to math and so as a consequence, the translation of the papers that we spent so damn long writing and writing proofs about and so forth to code is much smaller."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "Now the downside is these functional languages tend to be a bit more academic and they tend to have not necessarily the best Windows support and the libraries aren't so good and also they tend to be a little slower when compared as a whole on average to languages like C for example."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "So it's really a question of okay, what are you designing for for version one?"}, {"time": 1814, "text": "Are you designing for performance and are you designing for developer accessibility or are you designing for correctness and are you designing for a high fidelity representation of the protocol?"}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Okay, so Haskell was chosen as kind of the version one because we knew that the kinds of people who think about that are also the kinds of people that would have an easy time reading a paper like Ouroboros and working their way through all of this and they would do a pretty good job running a formal specification and then translating that into running code."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "Then once you have that, you have a blueprint that you can actually reason about, maintain and if you really wanted to, you could then turn that into a Rust code base or into a Java code base."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "Going the other way around would be kind of pointless and counterproductive."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "The other side of it is that Haskell code or functional code tends to be significantly more concise and I actually have a real life example of that."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "So if you take a look at Mantis, we implemented a full Ethereum node in Scala."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "It's only about 14 or 15,000 lines of code and you compare that with like C++ Bitcoin, I think that's 120, 150,000 lines of code."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "So it's almost 10 times smaller and so less code, less to read and you tend to read code significantly more than you would read write code."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "So it's always an advantage for a maintenance, understandability, documentation and other sort of things when you have more concise code bases and also it's a lot easier for you to apply stronger tools to a functional code base like static analysis or property based testing or these types of things than an imperative code base."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "But the thing is, it's almost like a religion or language, it's like saying, French versus Russian versus English, everybody has their adherence."}, {"time": 1925, "text": "They say, oh, they have the best poetry here."}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Russian, yeah, wins."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "There you go, always a Russian."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "Everybody has their favorite tools and their favorite languages, but it just comes down to what problems are you trying to solve and what problem domain do you live in?"}, {"time": 1938, "text": "If you're inventing new protocols based on science, you're gonna take the time to write a paper, go through the peer review process as you've done personally, you know how hard it can be to get into a conference and go through that and get your ass kicked."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "Then you also have to apply the exact same level of care to the engineering side in terms of implementation of that or else you will make a mistake and that mistake will probably be an exploit in the system that destroys the security properties of the system."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "So we really had no choice but to go to some notion of functional."}, {"time": 1968, "text": "The question was, what's the Goldilocks language?"}, {"time": 1970, "text": "Do you use a hybrid language like Scala and F Sharp or Clojure where you still have some connection to understandable things like.NET or the JVM?"}, {"time": 1980, "text": "Or do you go to an overly academic language like Idris or Agda or, you know, Isabel?"}, {"time": 1986, "text": "And there you can really dial up the correctness and write all kinds of crazy proofs."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "But by the way, it's like the seven people who write your code, they go on vacation a lot, you'll never get anything done."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "So Haskell kind of felt like a nice mill ground between those two where if we needed to pull into the left, we could, if you wanted to pull into the right, you could as well."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "That said, it's really amazing to see what the hybrid languages have done."}, {"time": 2008, "text": "If I was a new student in computer science and I said, you know, learn any language to grow your career from, Scala 3 is probably the language to go with."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "Yeah, it's great, because it's like you want it to be like Java, it's Java."}, {"time": 2021, "text": "And it looks kind of like a Java program."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "You want it to be like Python and scripted and you reuse a REPL, you can do that."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "You want to go hardcore dot, you know, dependent object types and do like weird proofs and stuff and the functional, you do all that."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "You have access to all of these things and Martin Niederski is a brilliant guy."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "He's done some phenomenal work basically, because he was one guy who created the JVM and he's worked on compilers for over 20 years."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "He did a lot of really hardcore work in trying to build a concise, nice, modern language that does a little bit of everything."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And it's got great applications in data science and AI."}, {"time": 2057, "text": "It's also heavily used in modern companies, like Netflix uses Scala for all of their microservice architecture."}, {"time": 2063, "text": "Yeah, so that's a great language and it's easy to pick up and it's easy to hire people into it."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "You just find these Eastern European guys who were Java programmers for 10 years, 15 years, they got tired of making $20 an hour, so they picked up Scala so they can make $35 an hour and they're really good at it."}, {"time": 2079, "text": "And that's a great gateway drug because you have like QuickCheck and Haskell, you have ScalaCheck and Scala."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "You can also do model checking."}, {"time": 2087, "text": "You can also go and use a TLA spec and make it work with Scala and so forth."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "So it gets you a little bit of everything and you can then move around that entire design space in a beautiful way."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So the recommendation is maybe if you wanna go vanilla, you go Python and JavaScript."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "When you're getting started."}, {"time": 2108, "text": "It's the getting started."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "That'll get you everything."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "You can do web scrapers and anything."}, {"time": 2111, "text": "It's just fun."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "All this experiment with drugs in undergrad, this was where Scala 3 comes in, it's a gateway drug to then potentially more hardcore functional languages like Haskell."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "Do you think C and C++, C++ still has a role?"}, {"time": 2124, "text": "No, I think Rust is completely replaced, a need for them."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "Go and Rust, those are the two twins of doom."}, {"time": 2130, "text": "I mean, Google created Go just to get rid of C. They hated C that much."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "And then Rust is just a phenomenal language as well."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "Hate can be a great motivator."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "Let me ask a question from Reddit on this topic."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "We're going depth first today."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "As a developer, why should I be incentivized to create Cardano based applications?"}, {"time": 2150, "text": "What is on the Cardano developer roadmap?"}, {"time": 2152, "text": "Any other language, I guess this is the key question I wanna ask."}, {"time": 2155, "text": "Any other language support other than Haskell?"}, {"time": 2158, "text": "The example this person gives is TypeScript, Go, Java, Python, et cetera."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "Also, have you considered a yearly conference focused around developers?"}, {"time": 2167, "text": "Ha ha, yeah, we saw the Plutus Fest."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "And we did the first one in 2018, 2019, I can't remember."}, {"time": 2174, "text": "And we were gonna do one last year, but then COVID hit."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "So we'll bring it back and we'll probably do it annually at the University of Wyoming for their hackathon there."}, {"time": 2182, "text": "In fact, it just so happens that coincides with the Goguen Summit."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "So we're doing that, I think the third week of September."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "But yeah, it's great to do an annual conference."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "You can bring a lot of cool people together and you can do hackathons and awards and so forth."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "But to the question in particular, Plutus is like any other language."}, {"time": 2198, "text": "Plutus core, you can compile things into it."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "So it's entirely possible to write a Scala to Plutus core compiler or TypeScript compiler or something like that."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "But I'm a big believer of separation of concerns and we don't live in a single chain model anymore."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "So you have a situation where you probably wanna have different execution environments and different chains."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "So you have different virtual machines there."}, {"time": 2223, "text": "And that's why we work so closely with the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Kagori Roshu's team at runtime verification."}, {"time": 2229, "text": "What they did is they said, let's start with something very familiar, LLVM, which has been around for a really long time and they happened to have created it there with Apple."}, {"time": 2237, "text": "And let's take that and translate that into the blockchain space."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "Okay, then once you have it, then it's very easy to modify compilers of standard languages like the C's and C++'s and other things that do compile to LLVM already and have them run there."}, {"time": 2253, "text": "So that's a different execution model than what we tried to build for Plutus, which focuses on correctness, okay?"}, {"time": 2258, "text": "So then all you have to really do is say, can both of these models coexist within the same ecosystem?"}, {"time": 2264, "text": "Because then you kind of, and I did a video, it was called like the island, the ocean, the pond."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "And the basic idea was say, you have an island where everything's perfect."}, {"time": 2271, "text": "Calypso lives there, life is great."}, {"time": 2274, "text": "People feed you grapes every day, but maybe you can't do everything on the island."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "And the ocean's big, it has everything, but the ocean's got sea monsters and sharks and Boaty McBoatface and all kinds of crazy stuff, right?"}, {"time": 2288, "text": "So that's what Yella is about."}, {"time": 2290, "text": "It's basically this bring LLVM into our world."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "And at some point in the next three to five year time horizon, we can bring modern programming languages in, but they're gonna come in with all their flaws and their warts and their problems."}, {"time": 2302, "text": "And then the pond was the idea of the Ethereum virtual machine."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "There's some network effect around it and there's some great tooling that's materialized and evolved."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "And it's not clear if that's the standard yet, or if like MySpace or Blackberry or all of these other things, it'll fade away."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "Well, if it becomes the standard, okay, don't fight nature, just support it."}, {"time": 2322, "text": "And the same thing that gives you the ability to bolt on the LLVM will also give you the ability to bolt on the EVM and they can run with their own models and they're encapsulated, bulkheaded, separated systems, but you can move ADA applications, information between those two systems."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "And so your main chain will always stay somewhat conservative and have the minimum viable amount of expressiveness required on it to do all kinds of interesting things."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "And also for interoperability, be able to talk to all kinds of interesting things, but it's not trying to be everything to everyone."}, {"time": 2355, "text": "There's never gonna be an ice cream store in the island."}, {"time": 2358, "text": "You'll have the grapes and the beautiful women, but no ice cream."}, {"time": 2361, "text": "Now you're just like distracting me with the ice cream."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "So just for, because we'll throw around a bunch of terms, for the record, what is Plutus?"}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So Plutus is a programming language."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "It's kind of a DSL that we built on top of Haskell."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "And basically we wrote it after spending about three years thinking about all smart contracts."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "We were trying to figure out like, what is the ideal language to express a smart contract?"}, {"time": 2384, "text": "And then we started thinking, well, what is a smart contract?"}, {"time": 2386, "text": "Is it the whole application, or is it just like a sub module within an application?"}, {"time": 2390, "text": "And usually it's the latter more than the former."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "You can build a self contained program like a script, but usually what's happening is you'll have it like a video game, let's say World of Warcraft or something like that."}, {"time": 2401, "text": "You say, hey, maybe I wanna actually create gold in World of Warcraft that's actually a currency."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "Okay, so I'm gonna issue a token."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "Well, and then maybe I wanna create some mechanics behind how people are gonna trade that amongst each other."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "So that would be like a smart contract layer and issue an asset."}, {"time": 2417, "text": "So you have this centralized server running and proprietary software controlled by a single company, but then you've opened your application up to a broader world."}, {"time": 2427, "text": "And what we've done now is added a blockchain layer and the blockchain handles the accounting of that asset and the spending policy of that stuff."}, {"time": 2434, "text": "So that is a much smaller program than what Blizzard is doing with World of Warcraft."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "So the point of Plutus was let's create a language where you can write these small to midsize programs and have a high degree of confidence that they behave with correctness and also they give you deterministic results on the consumption of resources."}, {"time": 2454, "text": "You can run things locally and you actually understand what it costs to run and that doesn't change when you deploy it on the system."}, {"time": 2461, "text": "If you dial up the expressiveness of the system and like Ethereum does and these big mutable account systems, the problem is you have to have global state."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "So whatever you test locally doesn't actually necessarily translate to what you've deployed, okay?"}, {"time": 2475, "text": "So we spent a long time asking like where's the Goldilocks zone?"}, {"time": 2479, "text": "Bitcoin script was too restrictive and every single time Satoshi tried to dial it up, it led to mega problems."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "Like there was a beautiful thing called the value overflow incident in 2010, which led to the creation of billions of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "They had to quickly clean that up and sweep it under the rug and pretend like it didn't exist."}, {"time": 2496, "text": "But that was mostly because of an issue with how the scripting language was implemented."}, {"time": 2501, "text": "And when you look at Ethereum, it's like this pure game of stomping down these skirmishers where every update there's something they have to change or tune and then it's not clear how you shard such a model."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "So we said, let's build something that's in the middle of this and that's what Plutus basically is."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "And it's really designed to play very nicely with off chain infrastructure as much as on chain infrastructure."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "So you can look at all those different examples, whether it's Wolfram wants to auction off their universes or Blizzard wants to issue an in game currency or your Uber and you wanna start putting peer to peer dynamics inside your system, you're gonna gracefully connect to that on chain code."}, {"time": 2540, "text": "And it's very clear how those two things connect together."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "Just so happens Haskell's really good for this."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "They have template Haskell and it makes it very easy to embed domain specific languages."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "And it makes it very easy to wire your Haskell code onto off chain infrastructure."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "So in the future, you'll be able to have your off chain run a node or the Java virtual machine or a.NET application and there'll just be this beautiful interface and then it can talk to all your on chain code and that's written in that DSL and you have a high degree of assurance that it's right."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "Is there like a Hello World program in Plutus that reveals the beauty of this balance that you're referring to?"}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Sort of simple but not too simple, the Einstein idea?"}, {"time": 2579, "text": "Yeah, so we did do our first Hello World program actually today."}, {"time": 2583, "text": "Yeah, I heard about this."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "Yeah, but you know, there you'd want to have the whole round trip."}, {"time": 2588, "text": "So you'd like to have an interaction and I think a video game would probably show it the best."}, {"time": 2592, "text": "Like if we could re implement CryptoKitties or something like that on it and you have this off chain infrastructure and you have your GUI in your front end, it's running on your phone or a browser and most of that lives off chain."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "And then, but your CryptoKitties, they'd live on the blockchain."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "The whole round trip end to end with relatively low fees and low latency and high availability of service, it never goes down."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "That would probably be the best thing to do and we'll have something like that by August."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "It's pretty easy to build this stuff."}, {"time": 2619, "text": "So what kind of off chain interactions are supported with Plutus?"}, {"time": 2621, "text": "What are the limits you want to put on the thing so it doesn't get chaotic?"}, {"time": 2625, "text": "That's the beautiful thing."}, {"time": 2626, "text": "When you have a less expressive model on chain, it means you can do anything you want off chain."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "So you started talking about smart contracts, but let's zoom back out and ask the big question here is what is a blockchain and what is a cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 2642, "text": "So a blockchain is just a ledger and really it has three nice properties."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "You're timestamped, you're immutable and auditable, either in a global or a local sense."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "And so there's all kinds of things mankind has invented where it's really important that when you put some information down, it doesn't change and other people can see it and that you know when it was put down."}, {"time": 2663, "text": "For example, a property ledger."}, {"time": 2664, "text": "So when you buy land or you have rights associated with land like mineral rights or water rights or these things, you'd like to transitively see how does it go from Alice to Bob to Charlie to Jim and so forth and what was the state of these things as they were transitioning?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "So how much did they pay, when did it occur, et cetera, et cetera, the metadata that follows that."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "Okay, well normally these types of ledgers are so important that they're managed either by governments or regulated entities."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "And the issues are that while they can be efficient, they're generally brittle to political manipulation and they're brittle to geopolitical events."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "For example, when Syria fell apart, the very first thing ISIS did, they started saying, hey, the ownership of the land, it's gonna fundamentally change."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "We've decided that this guy over here now owns all these things and then when peace comes, how do you unwind all of that, put it all back together?"}, {"time": 2718, "text": "So the power of a blockchain is that it gives you a transnational way of sorting all these details out, putting all together in a place that you know that even if it's inconvenient to a very powerful actor, that it will still stay preserved."}, {"time": 2735, "text": "This is an asymmetry we haven't had as a society."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "Usually kings and empires, they have the ability to decide what's true."}, {"time": 2743, "text": "And then suddenly you have this asymmetrical thing that is above them, kind of like a synthetic laws of physics and once something goes in there, you know that that's there."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "Okay, so that's the first part of it."}, {"time": 2754, "text": "The second part of it is that it's auditable, meaning that instead of saying only the high cleric or the president or some very special club of people get to see what's going on, suddenly now all the people can actually see who owns what where."}, {"time": 2773, "text": "Like imagine a tax system where the public club just leaked the taxes of all these different billionaires and said, well, how much do they make and how much do they pay?"}, {"time": 2781, "text": "Well, imagine a tax system where that's just done by default or other social systems where this type of information is put in by default."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "So it's tremendously useful, this type of structure and all kinds of things, medical records, supply chains, just a good thought experiment is I travel a lot, I've been to 52 countries in the last five years."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "Imagine if I got sick in Zimbabwe, I get hit by a car or something and I'm unconscious and a Zimbabwean doctor calls my doctor in Colorado and says, hey, I need all Charles's medical records."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "He's unconscious right now, but I need it to treat him because he's quite ill."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "They'd say, who is this person in Zimbabwe?"}, {"time": 2818, "text": "I don't know you, I can't give you his records, I need his consent."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "Oh no, he's unconscious in the hospital, I can't do it."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "Well, a broker system that would allow the movement of medical records would be an example of what a blockchain could potentially do in the foreseeable future."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "Cryptocurrency is just an application that runs on top of blockchain because it turns out that when you issue property, you also can issue tokens of value and then you could have a monetary policy, it could be inflationary or deflationary, you know, demurrage where it decays over time or whatever have you."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "And the very same mechanics that would ensure your property records are secure, your medical record access is secure, could also be applied for the ownership of the cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "And again, you can either be completely transparent and everybody can see what everybody owns and that's what Bitcoin does, or you can be as opaque as you seek to be, that's what Zcash basically attempts to do."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "It says, hey, let's keep these things as private as possible."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "But they have relatively the same mechanics in terms of those properties of auditability and timestamping and immutability."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "You know things won't be reversed, you know, that people aren't gonna manipulate the timestamps and you can audit at least enough to know that the ownership is right."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "But the way, if you think about physics and the universe, the universe has figured out a way to update the ledger of physics in a way where like a lot of people can be updating it and it stays consistent."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "Is there something you can say about the task of updating the ledger when a bunch of people are trying to do it or a bunch of entities are trying to do it?"}, {"time": 2904, "text": "Oh yeah, that's the whole point of a consensus algorithm."}, {"time": 2906, "text": "So whatever ledger you're running, there has to be some mechanism to decide who's in charge."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "And that's what proof of work does and proof of stake does and all these other systems."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "And you break them down to basically three steps."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "And so we'll use Eve for kind of step number one."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "Hi, Eve, how are you doing?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And we're gonna use Wally for step number two."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "And I need the monkey, give me the monkey."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "What's the monkey's name?"}, {"time": 2929, "text":

pondering its own mortality."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "And so anyway, the first step is all about basically deciding who's in charge for that moment."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "So blockchain is just a sequence of events."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "The heart has to beat, the metronome has to click."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "So somebody has to be in charge."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "And so generally you have this notion of a resource."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "So there's some pool of resource out there and it can be a token."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "And in that case, it's a plutocratic system and that's what proof of stake does or it can be computation, but there can be other resources."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "But computation is what proof of work does."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "And so you make so many hashes and then eventually somebody wins."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "And that person who wins is now the person who basically gets to decide the order of transactions and put them all together from their perspective in the system."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "Then once that person wins, they'll make the block."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "That's step two."}, {"time": 2978, "text": "And after it's made, transmit it and it gets validated and accepted."}, {"time": 2983, "text": "So actually it's quite fortuitous you have the magnifying glass because at this stage people are trying to decide is what I'm looking at correct or not."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "Now, there are other ways to potentially conceive of this, but this particular model gives you a kind of a way of thinking of all consensus algorithms in one setting."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "You can be Algorand, you can be a classic BFT protocol, you can be Paxos, you can be Raft, you can be proof of work, you can be proof of stake."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "It's always the same idea."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "You have to find someone or some group to be in charge."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "They'll reach a consensus on order."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "They have to then do some work, change the state of the system, update it, and then the network has to accept that that's valid."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "So even if this process works well, this side will say, oh, you created a Bitcoin at a thin air, you're not allowed to do that."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "So that's rejected."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "So there's checks and balances and guards all the way through."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "There's a meta question of fairness in all of this."}, {"time": 3039, "text": "So the proof of work people, they're kind of a cult and they say that this is the only truth and everything out here, any other resource is not legitimate or valid."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "And there's not a lot of evidence to that, but that's what they believe."}, {"time": 3052, "text": "The proof of stake people, the downside and weakness they have is it's a plutocratic model."},

suffer from, whereas you may maximize short term gain over the long term viability of the system."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "So a really cool question is, can you build systems that are multi resource?"}, {"time": 3074, "text": "So instead of just pulling from one resource to select who wins, this 25% of the time and maybe this 25%, you can do that."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "In fact, the cryptocurrency space did that a long time ago."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "There was a cryptocurrency called Peercoin in 2011, and it was a hybrid proof of work proof of stake."}, {"time": 3090, "text": "So some of the blocks were made with the token ownership distribution and some of the blocks were made with proof of work, but you could keep adding."}, {"time": 3098, "text": "You could put in like, hey, I want hard disk in my thing."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "You can put Permacoin in or something like that."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "So it created incentive for hard drives."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "And then you could say, oh no, I want to do like a human system, like a proof of merit."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "Oh my God, now we're up to four."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "And you just keep adding."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "And each of these pools will have different adherence and actors, and then you can actually balance out the whole thing."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "So as

least."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "Nature is a cult."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "Nature is metal, I saw it on Instagram."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "So that's really the crux of it."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "You have a ledger and the ledger is just all about saying, hey, we need to put some stuff in here."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "And once it's put in here, you can't turn it back."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "And you know when it was put in and everybody can see it or some group can see it."}, {"time": 3149, "text": "And then you need to pick somebody to modify that."}, {"time": 3151,

beautiful paper from Lamport that kind of talks about this from the 70s."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "It's like one of the most classic papers ever in computer science."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "I think it's been cited like 50,000 times or something like that."}, {"time": 3167, "text": "It's a crazy paper."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "But basically you have to figure out, okay, well, somebody has to be in charge."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "Some group has to be in charge."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "And you can do it with a meritocratic, hashocratic computation thing."}, {"time": 3178, "text": "You can say, well, if you have coins 25% of supply, 25% of the time on average, you'll be selected to have the right to do this or give it to somebody else."}, {"time": 3186, "text": "Or you could search for other resources."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "And they can even be human resources, like some notion of merit or social benefit."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "Maybe you get a token for that and you can weight it with these other systems."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "And that's where kind of where everything's going."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "We're getting to a point where we've really optimized all the properties here."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "We've proven all these nice things about it."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "And there's a lot of competition to basically build like the perfect proof of stake system, whether you're Polkadot or Algorand or any of these other guys."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "But now the next step is say, well, why don't we just have one?"}, {"time": 3216, "text": "We should have multiple resources."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "And the point is each of these has different trade off profiles."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "And so they balance each other and you end up building a much more resilient system."}, {"time": 3225, "text": "So it's not winner take all with one particular demand."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "Okay, so there's a million questions that spring up right there."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "But first linger on this topic and say, what is proof of work?"}, {"time": 3235, "text": "What is proof of stake?"}, {"time": 3236, "text": "Just zooming in on each of those."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "And what are the differences?"}, {"time": 3241, "text": "Okay, so they all have the same three properties of pick someone in charge, do something and validate it."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "The difference is that the picking mechanism for proof of work is you have to solve a puzzle."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "So it's basically like buying lottery tickets and you can buy a certain amount every second with your computing devices."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "And some of them are ASIC resistant."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "So you run them on like a laptop or a GPU."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "And some of them are you specialized hardware that you have to either manufacturer or buy from someone who sells it to you."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "And that's just how many tickets per second you can get."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And eventually you hit those magic numbers."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "When you do, it means you have the right to make the block and generally you bundle the block making with the proof of work system."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "Now you can do this looking for a single or you can do this to actually shard it and look for multiple block makers at the same time."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "So there are sharded proof of work protocols like Prism is an example of that."}, {"time": 3290, "text": "And actually Ethereum got started this way with Spectre and Ghost and Phantom, the Aviz Ahar's work and Yonatan Sonlopinsky."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "But the basic idea is you pick some collection of people, they make some collection of things and there's some way to sort it all out, serialize it and prevent double spends, great."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "Proof of stake is the same, but it's a synthetic resource."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "So instead of doing things, they say, well, if you had 25% of the hash power on average over a long period of time, you'd probably win 25% of the time."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "Well, why don't we just introduce some randomness in from some source and then 25% of the time on average over a long period of time, you'll win."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "So it's a synthetic resource, but you still have to do the other two things."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "You still have to make the block and you still have to validate the block."}, {"time": 3333, "text": "The big difference is this step in the proof of work world is horrendously expensive."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "You use more energy than the nation of Switzerland."}, {"time": 3341, "text": "And the problem with that is that you have less resources for the other two."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "And the other problem with that is that if this is horrendously expensive, you have an economy of scale kick in."}, {"time": 3350, "text": "So what ends up happening is the system becomes less decentralized over time because you have these vertically integrated operations."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "I mean, not everybody can go build a mining facility on a volcano in El Salvador."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "Not everybody can go to Mongolia and set up a five gigawatt power plant and a huge data thing."}, {"time": 3366, "text": "Not everybody has access to the patented basics that people produce."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "Because what if I don't sell it to you and I have the patent on it?"}, {"time": 3372, "text": "Or what if I control the supply chain for these things?"}, {"time": 3375, "text": "So you'll end up having centralization around maybe 10 or five major operations as we've seen historically with proof of work."}, {"time": 3383, "text": "And that means you end up having like a ruling class of a mining oligarchy in the system."}, {"time": 3389, "text": "Proof of stake, if you design the parameters correctly, you actually get more decentralized over time because as the currency goes up in value, the distribution of the currency tends to get more egalitarian."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "For example, Bill Gates, when he started Microsoft, he had 64% of the shares."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "Now he has less than 5% of the shares."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "So this founder drift over time, as the value goes up, divestment occurs, you have more and more and more people coming in."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "That means there's more people who can participate in the consensus."}, {"time": 3419, "text": "You can even tune economic parameters."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "And this is what we did with Cardano and Ouroboros."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "We created this concept of K in the system and it's just a parameter."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "And it's like a forcing factor that tends to accumulate a certain amount of stake pools."}, {"time": 3432, "text": "So you can set it to 200 and then 500 and 1000 and so forth."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "But the basic idea is as the price of ADA goes up, you make K larger and then you end up in practical terms having a larger and larger set of actors making blocks that are unique and distinct."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "And the other good thing is this is a virtual resource instead of a physical resource, which means it's portable by the click of a button."}, {"time": 3455, "text": "So let's say China says, mining is bad, we're gonna shut it all down."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "And it looks like they're moving in that direction."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "You have all these people in WeChat, just like trying to sell miners or trying to figure out how the hell do I move miners, because they have these huge data centers they've constructed."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "You can't exactly go and grab a server and like take it with you, it's huge."}, {"time": 3472, "text": "It's a lot of work."}, {"time": 3473, "text": "And if the government sees it, well, it's their property now."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "A virtual resource, you can click a button and redeploy it to a different jurisdiction."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "So to me, for a virtual asset, it makes a lot more sense to try to tie your security to something endogenous, something within the system, because it's just like the asset, it can move anywhere at a click of a button and human beings have a much harder time attacking something like that."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "Well, so people, maybe you could sort of play devil's advocate and say, what is the strength of proof of work system?"}, {"time": 3501, "text": "Because some people would argue that proof of work has, because it's outside the system, it's tied to physical resources, it's more secure."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "It's less prone to attack by large groups of people."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "And the first question we had was, could proof of stake actually work or not?"}, {"time": 3521, "text": "So the problem was that the engineers kind of led when the science should have led."}, {"time": 3526, "text": "And so there were all these POS protocols that came out in the early 2010s, like Peercoin was the first and then NXT and others came out."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "And there they had suffered from things like the random number generation wasn't good."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "They had grinding attacks and nothing at stake and all these other things."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "And there's a lot of beautiful properties for proof of work from a theoretical sense."}, {"time": 3544, "text": "We even wrote a paper called GKL, named after the authors, Juan Gray, Niko Leonardis and Agelos Gassis, our chief scientist."}, {"time": 3553, "text": "It's got 1100 citations now and it was published in 2015."}, {"time": 3557, "text": "But basically all it did is just model the blockchain and created some security properties for it."}, {"time": 3561, "text": "And then it started talking about, well, what does proof of work actually do for you?"}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And it turns out it does a lot."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "It's an asynchronous system."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "You can bootstrap from Genesis."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "So if Eve joins the network and Wally joins the network and Daisy joined the network, then you give them some different chains, like five or 10 different chains."}, {"time": 3581, "text": "They can run a calculation and they will always pick the longest chain, the heaviest chain inside the system."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "That's a great property of proof of work."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "Until we published Ouroboros Genesis in 2018, you actually needed to solve that in proof of stake with a trusted checkpoint."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "So some actor had to be observing, watching the whole thing and creating checkpoints."}, {"time": 3600, "text": "And then when new people joined in, they would only be able to distinguish between a chain based upon a checkpoint telling them that."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "So you have to do a lot of really wonky, crazy math to show and create this notion of like density to be able to show that that's possible."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "But there's a lot of properties of proof of work that were super hard to replicate and emulate in the proof of stake world."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "Macaulay kind of revolutionized the whole VRF thing."}, {"time": 3624, "text": "There was a group out of Cornell that talked about better network conditions."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "They wrote a paper called Sleepy."}, {"time": 3630, "text": "We did Genesis."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "We also did the very first proofably secure protocol, but that was six years of work and like 12 papers."}, {"time": 3637, "text": "And it's still not done."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "There's still a few polishing things that have to be cleaned up because this is a physical resource and there's something there."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "But there's a flaw to proof of work that is a little problematic."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "It's a winner take all type of a system."}, {"time": 3651, "text": "So maximalism is kind of philosophically and computationally built into it."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "Let's say you have two proof of work systems and they have roughly the same market cap and hash rate."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "And they use the same algorithm."}, {"time": 3665, "text": "Then the problem is if the miner comes in and let's say the miner has enough resources to have 51% for any of these chains, they actually have a perverse incentive to come and destroy one chain and short sell the asset, it's called a gold finger attack, and then go mine the other asset because they're not bound to that asset."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "They're not loyal to it."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "And they can make just as much profit mining this as they can make mining the other system and the markets allow them to profit from the destruction of a system."}, {"time": 3695, "text": "So that's something that proof of stake doesn't suffer from because the only way you can participate in a proof of stake system is you have to actually own equity and you have to have ownership in that system."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "So if you go and destroy Daisy's chain, it would just be a net loss for the most part, unless you have really messed up markets or something like that."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "So there's always trade offs and all these things."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "And this is why I like this concept of going one to end and having multiple resources, because why not have proof of work and proof of stake together?"}, {"time": 3722, "text": "If the proof of work is useful, not wasted computation, and why not add other things like create incentives for network relay?"}, {"time": 3728, "text": "Right now there's no incentives in the system for you to run peer to peer nodes and the shared data."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "Right now it's not a problem, but if you're running like Amazon web services level of bandwidth, it could cost you like $5,000 a month in bandwidth just to run a full node or something like that."}, {"time": 3741, "text": "No one would do it."}, {"time": 3742, "text": "So then your system will centralize along the weakest link, whether it be the storage layer, the computation layer, or the network layer of the system."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "So if you can incentivize the resources differently, then you'll be in a beautiful position where you end up having a resilient system that pays its own bills."},

work?"}, {"time": 3770, "text": "Yeah, this was a philosophical difference between Vitalik and myself."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "The problem with the people in the Ethereum side is they're really bright."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "And these really bright people, what they do is they try to do everything all at once because they're really, really smart and they keep going until they run up against the wall and they realize the problem is a lot harder."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "If you're more experienced, and that's why we brought in proper academics like Aggelos and others, because they've been beaten up through life, Aggelos worked with David Chom and these other, it's really hard work with those guys."}, {"time": 3799, "text": "And they'd already been humiliated and yelled at

even try."}, {"time": 3808, "text": "What you do is you decompose it and you say, okay, what's the first problem to solve in a chain of problems that you can compose your way up to a working

Ouroboros protocol in 2017."}, {"time": 3839, "text": "And that protocol was like a synchronous system and it assumed the nodes were always on and it worked, but it was useless because that's not real life."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "Then Prowse came out and then suddenly we relaxed things."}, {"time": 3850, "text": "So these are all, by the way, names for consensus algorithms."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "Yeah, papers that we published and they were all peer reviewed."}, {"time": 3855, "text": "Like GKL was EuroCrypt."}, {"time": 3857, "text": "That's a very hard conference to get into."},

that there was some merit to the work that was done."}, {"time": 3871, "text": "Second, it solved a particular class of problems, either showing the feasibility of the entire problem."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "Because when I said, let's do the model first because let's see if we can do an FLP thing."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "Let's see if we can get them a possibility theorem."}, {"time": 3882, "text": "That's great because you're done."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "It's like those short math papers were like, I found a counterexample."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "It's like, oh, okay, this whole thing has fallen apart because you have a two line proof, thank you."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "So that's what we were looking for in the beginning of the agenda was, let's either prove it's possible in a straw man case or show that there exists an impossibility result, in which case we can just abandon the entire inquiry."}, {"time": 3902, "text": "Proof of stake is impossible."},

3910, "text": "Are you okay with living with an external clock or do you wanna build time from within?"}, {"time": 3915, "text": "How are you generating random numbers, et cetera, et cetera."},

little dirtier."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "Because Algorand actually did some great work there."}, {"time": 3952, "text": "There was some good knowledge there."}, {"time": 3953, "text": "What are the really hard problems that you, maybe if you just linger on a little bit, what are some of the really hard problems you have to solve along this chain of papers, ideas, the evolution of the consensus algorithm?"}, {"time": 3963, "text": "Yeah, not only are they really hard problems, they actually require different cryptographers because you're moving from mathematician style cryptographers like the Neil Koblitz's and the Addie Shamir's and the people that like start as proper mathematicians."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "They really love theory and that's their thing."}, {"time": 3977, "text":

that."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "I know how to think about that."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "So that transition from GKL to Ouroboros Classic to Prowse, I'd say the biggest leap was Classic to Prowse

"text": "And so this is a beautiful kind of interdisciplinary notion that layers computer science and biology together."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "And minute that complexity starts going up, you start seeing cell specialization."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "So you go from single cell organisms to organisms where you have eyeballs and brains and hearts and each of these tissues do different things."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "Well, analogously, complex distributed systems start getting specialization."}, {"time": 4071, "text": "So you introduce this concept of the stake pool and suddenly now you

deeply and carefully about, okay, well, can this now introduce a new attack vector that we didn't have before?"}, {"time": 4102, "text": "So that leap from classic to Prowse and adding in stake pools and figuring out how to handle the game theory there was exceedingly hard."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "It took two years to do that."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "So stake pools allow for multiple parties to delegate their staking capabilities to others."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "Can you describe a little bit how this works?"}, {"time": 4119, "text": "It's a super simple concept."}, {"time": 4120, "text": "So you register a pool and then the pool is there and basically they advertise and they're actually registered on chain with a certificate."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "And then in the wallet software itself, you can see all of the pools that have registered."}, {"time": 4133, "text": "There's over 3000 of them now inside the system."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "And then you can click a little tile and it shows you all the metadata that's in the certificate and says, hey, I have my own pool."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "It's called rats, king of the rats."}, {"time": 4145, "text": "So you can see all this stuff that's described there and pools have an operating fee cause they're like a business."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "And they say, well, if you delegate to me, I'll charge this much."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "So if you get like a hundred bucks in rewards, I'll give you 90 and I'll take 10 or something like that."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "And then you make your decision and whichever one you select, you click delegate, push the button and then you have now given your staking rights to them until revoked."}, {"time": 4169, "text": "Okay, so it lives there."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "And then the stake pools weight in the system is proportional to the amount of stake that they have delegated to them."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "And then we have this other limiting factor K, which says that you get diminishing returns with the more stake you have."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "So it's kind of like an S function."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "So you kind of go up and up and then eventually caps and then at some point you get no rewards beyond a certain threshold."}, {"time": 4189, "text": "So there's an incentive to split pools to different owners after some point."}, {"time": 4194, "text": "Yeah, and so that's a complex thing and you have to actually model the game theory out to understand where those parameters should be set."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "And we didn't know how to do that."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "So what we did is we bought talent."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "We went to Oxford and we hired this guy named Elias Kasupis, he's an algorithmic game theorist."}, {"time": 4208, "text": "We said, hey, would you like to do some game theory work in crypto?"}, {"time": 4212, "text": "And he's like, that sounds fun."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "So he spent a year and a half, we built all these beautiful models and we kind of figured out what those curves needed to look like."}, {"time": 4219, "text": "So figure out like the S curve that would result in a nice distribution of responsibility."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "So not everybody delegates to the king of the rats."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "How does it feel to be royalty, by the way?"}, {"time": 4228, "text": "It's not a very impressive kingdom, but you're nevertheless a king."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "I'll take it, because I think it's the kindest thing people call me in this space."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "Yeah, people love you."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "So, okay, so that, I mean, so is that, would you say a solved problem?"}, {"time": 4243, "text": "The game theory of stake pools?"}, {"time": 4245, "text": "No, it's the starting, and I was getting back to my original point that you build things in iterations."}, {"time": 4250, "text": "Every step, if you've done it right, is an invitation for 10 more sexy, fascinating, fun problems."}, {"time": 4256, "text": "And this is why we have such a great time building labs."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "We started in Edinburgh, now we're at Tokyo Tech and University of Wyoming and Athens, and we're setting up more labs this year."}, {"time": 4265, "text": "And all these academics wanna work with us, hey, because we write a lot of really fascinating papers, but B, because we're focused on all these really cool, sexy, interdisciplinary problems."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "We're actually running into problems where we don't even know where to publish the paper."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "Because you'll have this paper where there's like these PL guys working with crypto guys, working with systems guys, working with economists."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "And you put it all together and you have this Frankenstein paper monster, and we're like, where do we submit this?"}, {"time": 4287, "text": "Where does this go?"}, {"time": 4289, "text": "Yeah, there we go."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "Nature or quanta or something, I don't know."}, {"time": 4292, "text": "It'll write a nice little."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "So the sexy problems multiply exponentially."}, {"time": 4296, "text": "Exactly, and we've now gotten to a point where we're starting to work on refinements to the system rather than fundamental things that are like, if you don't solve it, the system just simply doesn't work."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "For example, you can run all of this with NTP as your clock server, but you actually can create a notion of time with N. We wrote a paper called the Workforce Chronos for that."}, {"time": 4315, "text": "But that's not necessary for the system."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "It's just a nice to have thing."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "It's a nice property."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "Optimization of the random number generation is another example of that."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "You can run it with a heavier thing."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "You just have more blockchain bloat and slower time and transition."}, {"time": 4328, "text": "We have this concept in Epic."}, {"time": 4329, "text": "So you elect leaders to run the system every five days with Cardano, but there's been derivative work."}, {"time": 4337, "text": "We didn't even do this."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "This work occurred at University of Illinois."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "And that derivative work said, well, you don't actually need to do that."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "You can do it on a block by block basis."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "It's like, ooh, that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "So that's the other point about doing things in a very rigorous way is that that way creates a lingua franca for what you're trying to solve with the totality of the academic community."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "So suddenly people that you've never met, you know nothing about have read your papers, cited your papers and start writing their own papers, either to try to attack and destroy things you've done or to build on top of the things that you've done."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "So people are trying to figure out ways to attack this."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "As rigorous as you are trying to build up."}, {"time": 4372, "text": "And I don't have to pay them."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "It's fun to try to destroy and that's how we grow stronger."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "And it's how you build your career too."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "There's plenty of people that they've gotten tenure just kicking the hell out of Intel SGX."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "You go to CCS every year, there's some guy there and he's having a hell of a time making Intel cry."}, {"time": 4391, "text": "Can we pull back historically speaking and in terms of the big picture of cryptocurrency real quick and ask the question, what is Cardano?"}, {"time": 4399, "text": "We started talking about already the consensus algorithm Cardano takes."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "But maybe when you look at the history books, you know, sort of a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Cardano will have one sentence."}, {"time": 4411, "text": "What's that one sentence going to be?"}, {"time": 4413, "text": "And in general, what's like the vision in the context of the history of cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 4417, "text": "You have like this whiteboard overview video that you talk about the three generations of cryptocurrency where Cardano is the third."}, {"time": 4424, "text": "So that's like five different questions way of asking the exact same thing you can answer however the hell you want."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "You know, I always termed Cardano as like a FOSS, a financial operating system and nobody likes it and everybody picks on me for using that term."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "But basically the idea is that, you know, the world runs on systems, especially the financial world."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "You have, you know, the BIS and Swift and all this other stuff."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "And these protocols allow you to move value around and represent things like identity."}, {"time": 4453, "text": "And allow you to express yourself in some way."}, {"time": 4457, "text": "And those protocols for the most part work well for people in rich countries."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "And they don't work so well for people who aren't in rich countries."}, {"time": 4465, "text": "And so the point of what we do, or at least what I do and what my company does is we think a lot about how do we build a universal protocol that does all the stuff the legacy system has but just does it better, faster and cheaper for everybody in the world."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "And everybody has equal access to it, you know?"}, {"time": 4482, "text": "So it's the people's protocol."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "You know, you have a situation where the guy in Senegal has the same access that I do or Bill Gates does or someone else who's kind of higher on the spectrum of wealth and power."}, {"time": 4492, "text": "And so that is what we seek to achieve."}, {"time": 4496, "text": "But then the question is well, is Cardano the solution?"}, {"time": 4499, "text": "You know, is that that thing?"}, {"time": 4501, "text": "And the answer is no, because you need a lot more evolution."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "You need decades of evolution to kind of work your way there."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "And in many ways the work is never quite done but it's better than what came before."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "Because you have a realization that first the control of the system needs to be more balanced and nuanced and it needs to be more democratic."}, {"time": 4523, "text": "So there's this sustainability component of who's in charge and how do you pay for things?"}, {"time": 4528, "text": "Well, the system can print its own money so it always has the ability to have a budget."}, {"time": 4531, "text": "Okay, so there's a treasury idea."}, {"time": 4534, "text": "And then there's a voting thing."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "Well, the same things that allow you to move money around allow you to represent votes."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "So you can do eVoting with the type of system, okay."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "And you know, if you played Gnomic in the 1980s or Peter

great."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "Okay, so that exists there."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "And then you say, okay, well, but this thing still has to touch the legacy world."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "There has to be cash in and cash out and these types of things."}, {"time": 4562, "text": "So there's just this interoperability thing that you need a wifi or a Bluetooth moment for the industry because nothing understands each other right now."}, {"time": 4568, "text": "There are all these chains are blind, deaf and dumb to each other."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "And then there's this thing that it has to work at a huge scale, like billions of people."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "And we've done that, but we've done that with large multinational trillion dollar companies with centralized infrastructure."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "We've never really done that with one master protocol that somehow does it for everyone."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "The closest approximation is probably BitTorrent."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "And there's, you know, there was, it's a cool protocol, but it doesn't have all the oomph necessary to, necessary to do something like this."}, {"time": 4596,

lesson of Satoshi."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "It doesn't need founders to be able to get there."}, {"time": 4622, "text": "So, you know, if you look at the academic side, that's very decentralized."},

the first generation is Bitcoin."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "And really the problem Bitcoin was trying to solve is saying every time we wanna represent or move value, we need some sort of trusted third

minute you have that, and suddenly you have ICOs and DeFi and STOs and NFTs and all these word salads of things and then people start using it, they get frustrated."}, {"time": 5114, "text": "Because

no group of people you can bring in and thus the internet evolves very slowly, you see?"}, {"time": 5178, "text": "And so that's the problem is that you have this situation where you wanna do lots of utility, you wanna do a lot of things, you wanna be a financial operating system and be everything to everyone but then your rate of evolution slows down as your rate of adoption speeds up."},

with a beautiful interlocking design for all of them."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "And again, the point is not to get it perfect but rather get those just right set of evolutionary factors that when you

use and utility?"}, {"time": 5336, "text": "You know, all these layer two protocols and these DeFi applications in five years, they're completely protocol and blockchain agnostic because at the end of the day, they care about liquidity, operating cost and user experience."}, {"time": 5347, "text": "It's so a preposterous and absurd for somebody to say, oh, well, I'm gonna go build my application,

DeFi providers are if they're getting successful into a certain network effect, they're having the multi chain conversation."}, {"time": 5380, "text": "So I don't really believe in a winner takes all maximums view of, well, there's gonna be some protocol that becomes the God protocol first because they evolved too quickly."}, {"time": 5388, "text": "Second, the incentives aren't aligned for that."}, {"time": 5390, "text": "TCPIP didn't have a token connected to it."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "There was no financial incentive where if TCPIP got adopted over something else, they'd make some big company crazy amounts of money."}, {"time": 5400, "text": "It was a useful piece of infrastructure."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "So I think that the third generation is gonna be as defined by the social components and the usability components as it is by the technological capabilities of the system."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "Really what these technological capabilities gave you was the ability to demonstrate a proof of concept and say these things are possible."}, {"time": 5419, "text": "Kind of like Xerox PARC, when Steve and Bill came in, they said, wow, you have networked

"text": "But none of that was an actual product."}, {"time": 5433, "text": "That wasn't a Macintosh, but it was enough to get the idea."}, {"time": 5437, "text": "And then it was a race to how do we productize something like that."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "And in that case, it actually took several decades to roll out that vision that those guys had."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "And I think that's what Bitcoin and Ethereum did."}, {"time": 5447, "text": "But what's unique about this is normally you throw away the prior experiments."}, {"time": 5451, "text": "With these things, these are self evolving systems."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "So it's entirely possible to, Joe Rogan quote, to evolve Bitcoin to a point where it could become a third generation system if desired, as some amalgamation of layer one and layer two protocols."}, {"time": 5465, "text": "And it's the same for Ethereum."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "In fact, Vitalik is throwing away Ethereum and replacing with Ethereum too, because he recognizes he needs to upgrade and evolve the system."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "And that's what makes it fun because the techniques and methodologies that they've chosen to evolve and upgrade this system are distinctly different from the ones that we've chosen."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "And we have no idea which one's actually going to win, but we learn from each other and we co evolve from each other."}, {"time": 5490, "text": "So you're running like all these experiments in real time in a giant marketplace, and maybe they'll consolidate, maybe they'll stay divergent."}, {"time": 5496, "text": "I mean, look at big tech, you have Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, they all coexist and they're trillion dollar companies."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "Some cases with TCP, it consolidates to one standard."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "And that's what we ended up using."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "So what's your intuition with Cardano having the proof of stake, and then eventually smart contracts versus the Bitcoin with layer two technologies, this kind of evolving creature."}, {"time": 5522, "text": "Again, you said you can't really predict the future, but what's your intuition why one might be more successful than the other?"}, {"time": 5530, "text": "So the problem with Bitcoin is it is so slow."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "It's like the mainframe programming of the past."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "And the only reason it's still around is because there was so much invested in keeping it around that we just kind of have to leave it

thing."}, {"time": 5583, "text": "And it really, we're all here because of Bitcoin."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "But the problem is you have to upgrade the damn thing."}, {"time": 5588, "text": "You

ways to extend what Bitcoin has."}, {"time": 5635, "text": "Keep the philosophy, the accounting, the way of thinking about transactions."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "But then suddenly you can now do

the network effect, it has the brand name, it has the regulatory approval, but there's no way to change the system, even correcting obvious downsides in that system."}, {"time": 5696, "text": "Now,

say, okay, the script is correct, but you don't have to run the whole program."}, {"time": 6547, "text": "So there's a lot, I'm not doing the topic justice, there's a lot more to it, but that's the basic concept."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "And in a Redeemer validator model, you need stuff like that, because as your model gets more complex and a lot more things happen, you don't want to have a situation where I have to run, replay a huge amount of the UTXO graph to be able to get to a point where I have the state of the system."}, {"time": 6570, "text": "You need some mathematical artifact

that have explored that."}, {"time": 6608, "text": "Like my favorite came out of Microsoft research is a project called Pinocchio, and there was a followup called Geppetto."}, {"time": 6613, "text":

to check the proof of work."}, {"time": 6637, "text": "Cryptography also works this way."}, {"time": 6638, "text": "You have some trap door where you can verify something's correct, but to get that thing done, if you're doing it brute force, it takes an enormous amount of computation."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "Well, not all problems are like this, like protein folding, to verify the protein is folded correctly, you have to fold the protein."}, {"time": 6652, "text": "So you have to redo the work."}, {"time": 6653, "text": "But what if for arbitrary computation, you could take a problem, and then you could generate a proof that you've done that computation correctly, and the proof validates in logarithmic time or constant time."}, {"time": 6665, "text": "Wow, that's incredible, right?"}, {"time": 6666, "text": "Well, Microsoft actually wrote a paper on how to do that."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "It's called Pinocchio."}, {"time": 6670, "text": "So that's another example of these types of things, these rollups of things where instead of doing the computation on chain or trying to create some sort of replicated machine that does all this stuff, you instead just say, okay, only thing I'm gonna use the blockchain for is to check your proof."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "But I'm gonna turn it into a distributed computing problem, and any person in the world can do the problem on any server, untrusted server even, because you don't have to trust the output, you trust the proof, and the proof is deterministic."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "It tells you these things."}, {"time": 6697,

from I'm doing the work to I'm checking that the work was done correctly."}, {"time": 6710, "text": "And all of a sudden, we're back to the P equals NP thing where for many very interesting problems, the checking is efficient, is much more efficient than the solving."}, {"time": 6721, "text": "Right, and also do you want complete determinism or is it probabilistic?"}, {"time": 6725, "text": "Because if you relax that requirement a little bit, then suddenly actually you have a broader class of things you can construct this stuff for."}, {"time": 6732, "text": "You mentioned UTXO."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "There's a paper titled the Extended UTXO Model."}, {"time": 6738, "text": "It writes in the introduction, Bitcoin and Ethereum hosting the two currently most valuable and

differ strongly in the expressiveness of the smart contracts that they support."}, {"time": 6761, "text": "This is no coincidence."}, {"time": 6762, "text": "Ethereum chose the account model explicitly to facilitate more expressive smart contracts."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "On the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTXO also for good reasons, including that its semantic model stays simple in a complex concurrent and distributed computing environment."}, {"time": 6777, "text": "This raises the question of whether it is possible to have expressive smart contracts while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "So what's the fuck that mean?"}, {"time": 6789, "text": "What is UTXO, what is the account model, and what is the idea of the Extended UTXO model?"}, {"time": 6797, "text": "So I guess the easiest way of visualizing it is that UTXO is kind of like cash register accounting."}, {"time": 6802, "text": "So let's assume you don't have credit cards, you just have cash."}, {"time": 6805, "text": "And so when you go and buy some milk and potatoes or whatever and you go to the cashier, you pull out your $20 bill, you give it to them, unless it comes up to 17.50, they have to make change."}, {"time": 6816, "text": "So you don't tear your $20 bill, cut a piece of it off and say, here's part of my 20."}, {"time": 6822, "text": "You give them the entire $20 bill and then they give you something back."}, {"time": 6826, "text": "And the things that they give you back are also atomic units, they don't cut those things up."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "So that's kind of what UTXO is all about in a nutshell is that there's inputs and outputs, your inputs that 20 and your outputs will be the 17.50 that goes to them and then the remaining change that goes back to you, okay?"}, {"time": 6843, "text": "The problem with this particular model is that the way it was implemented with Bitcoin, there was no notion of how do we run complex predicates, complex contracts on this thing, where instead of just saying, okay, I'm just gonna push value to you, I wanna put lots of terms and conditions into the movement of that value."}, {"time": 6862, "text": "Like you only get this if I mow your lawn on Tuesday or you only get this if some event happens like the Broncos win the Super Bowl or something like that."}, {"time": 6872, "text": "Okay, so you need some notion of programmability with it."}, {"time": 6875, "text": "So a lot of people are trying to figure out in the early days of Bitcoin, how could we improve the expressiveness of the system?"}, {"time": 6881, "text": "And one of ways of doing it is you can go to a different accounting model, bank style accounting."}, {"time": 6888, "text": "So in a bank ledger, every time you do a withdrawal, a deposit, it's a mutable system."}, {"time": 6894, "text": "With the cash register accounting, you don't tear up the bills, but the bank you can deduct or add ledger all the time."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "So Ethereum kind of works in that bank accounting system where you just, you send messages, you send transactions and you're going up or down."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "And so you can trigger programs the same way."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "So what we did is we said, okay, if you take the UTXO model and you have some data to it, and instead of saying it's just a digital signature, but it's in a script, you can basically create something that's still the same as cash register, but now you have programmability and the big difference is local versus global."}, {"time": 6928, "text": "So in the case of UTXO, your scripts are your concerns."}, {"time": 6932, "text": "So whatever's going on in that cash register has no bearing or impact on the other cash registers."}, {"time": 6937, "text": "But when you look at bank accounting, you have to know the state of the entire banking world to be able to make that work."}, {"time": 6944, "text": "Because if that transaction is inbound, that wire transfer is inbound, you have to know those funds are actually there, that thing is actually happening."}, {"time": 6950, "text": "So when you have a global state for a program, it's like you could do a lot more with it, but it's a lot more dangerous."}, {"time": 6955, "text": "And so you have to build all these mechanisms to try to protect yourself from it."}, {"time": 6958, "text": "So what we did is we said, okay, add data, add a programmability, and you're kind of in this nice Goldilocks zone between what Ethereum did with an account style model and a global state system."}, {"time": 6968, "text": "And you're not as restrictive as Bitcoin, but you're still in a Turing complete world, you can still run all kinds of things."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "And then any standard mathematician, they'll say, okay, well, is it isomorphic?"}, {"time": 6979, "text": "Is there a mapping between this?"}, {"time": 6981, "text": "What type of function can I actually take something expressed in one structure and transmit it to the other structure and properties are preserved?"}, {"time": 6988, "text": "So we wrote a paper, it's called Climatic Ledgers, where we actually showed that UTXO, Extended UTXO and accounts are somewhat similar in that you could map things that happen in one system to the other system, the properties are preserved between the two."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "So in practice, what's nice about Extended UTXO is that you can put infrastructure on top of it to make the development experience relatively similar to the development experience of what you would do with Ethereum, but you don't have to worry about this global state."}, {"time": 7018, "text": "So when you talk about sharding, it's a lot easier to do that."}, {"time": 7021, "text": "It's a lot more conceivable to that."}, {"time": 7022, "text": "And also you get determinism in the system."}, {"time": 7025, "text": "So when I have a Plutus smart contract, whatever I run locally is exactly what I expect to run in the system."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "When you have a concept of this mutable global state in the system, whatever you run locally is not necessarily what you're gonna get when you actually push it into the system."}, {"time": 7038, "text": "So you may misprice things and the contract will fail."}, {"time": 7041, "text": "It doesn't ever happen in the Plutus world."}, {"time": 7043, "text": "So you got a lot of advantages with this particular model."}, {"time": 7046, "text": "The downside is that it's a little bit less expressive on the boundaries and a little bit harder to write certain types of software with it."}, {"time": 7054, "text": "But again, how you resolve that is you kind of build higher level languages and other such things that compensate for these types of things and design patterns that compensate for these types of things."}, {"time": 7065, "text": "The other advantage that we have that's really fun and exciting is that Bitcoin lives in this model and there are other UTXO based systems."}, {"time": 7072, "text": "And so they're all talking about smart contracts as well."}, {"time": 7075, "text": "And they would like to continue working in the UTXO model."}, {"time": 7078, "text": "So if you're a Bitcoin contract developer or other things, there's actually already a group of people that understand this very well."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "And that's still a fairly large part of the mindshare of the entire space."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "So there are no silver bullets."}, {"time": 7089, "text": "And anytime you pick a particular model, there's an upside and a downside."}, {"time": 7093, "text": "And there's different ways of doing things from cash register accounting or bank accounting."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "You can even do different accounting models."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "But we felt this was kind of the best first step to go into because we started with something very familiar that had a long history behind it."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "And it maps very beautifully to functional programming principles."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "This concept of immutability and these things and much more strict management of state and no notion of having this global concept that you have to kind of manage as you break up the system."}, {"time": 7123, "text": "Now in practice, what does this mean to the developer when they actually start real writing an application?"}, {"time": 7130, "text": "Not too much."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "There's gonna be a little bit of retooling and some new patterns you have to learn."}, {"time": 7134, "text": "But in practice, you can still do the same things."}, {"time": 7136, "text": "You can implement a Uniswap style thing."}, {"time": 7139, "text": "In fact, we even wrote that code with the Plutus Pioneers program."}, {"time": 7141, "text": "So you can go to YouTube and watch a lecture and see how that's done."}, {"time": 7145, "text": "You can do a stable coin."}, {"time": 7146, "text": "You can do an Oracle."}, {"time": 7147, "text": "You can do interactive contracts."}, {"time": 7150, "text": "It's just, it has to be done a little differently than the way that you would do it in an account style model."}, {"time": 7154, "text": "Just like you could run an application in Java, you can run an application in Haskell."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "They both can do the same thing, but the code is gonna look different."}, {"time": 7161, "text": "And the canonical way of looking at things is different."}, {"time": 7165, "text": "So in terms of Oracle, Oracle networks, what are your thoughts about chain link and external off chain data sources?"}, {"time": 7172, "text": "And everything we've been talking about now with the external, with the extended UTXO model."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "Yeah, I mean, trying to do smart contracts without Oracle is like trying to have sex with your pants on."}, {"time": 7183, "text": "I mean, it's not really fun."}, {"time": 7185, "text": "It's not exactly the best of things."}, {"time": 7187, "text": "That's the way I've been doing it all these years."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "For any other person, Lex, I wouldn't believe you, but for you."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "That's why I'm single."}, {"time": 7195, "text": "This makes so much sense now."}, {"time": 7197, "text": "Okay, so anyway, you need the outside world to be injected into your system, right?"}, {"time": 7203, "text": "I'm trying to keep a straight face."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "You need the outside world to make your system useful."}, {"time": 7209, "text": "It's like all the kinds of things that you care to do with a smart contract usually involve human beings and information streams aggregating and doing something."}, {"time": 7217, "text": "So the Oracle is a super important component in practice for any smart contract involving any notion of value."}, {"time": 7224, "text": "You need to know when things have happened, how they happen, who won, who lost, et cetera, et cetera."}, {"time": 7228, "text": "So first, where do you get the data from?"}, {"time": 7231, "text": "So what's the aggregator?"}, {"time": 7232, "text": "This is why we love our relationship with Wolfram because one of the things you'll know about Wolfram as you get to know the guy is he's a data pack rat."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "Every email, every communication, every interaction, he's archived somewhere."}, {"time": 7243, "text": "Like last time I talked to him, oh, yeah, I have emails from you from 2012."}, {"time": 7246, "text": "It's like, you still have those?"}, {"time": 7248, "text": "Yeah, every keystroke is written down and stored somewhere."}, {"time": 7251, "text": "So if you use Wolfram Alpha, it's a simulacrum of the way his mind thinks."}, {"time": 7255, "text": "And so you can query the system and be like, oh, how many shipwrecks have happened in Florida between 1950 and 2000 that have resulted more than a billion dollars of cargo loss and at least one fatality?"}, {"time": 7266, "text": "And it'll return an answer."}, {"time": 7268, "text": "I mean, it's an incredible source of data that's computable."}, {"time": 7271, "text": "For people who don't know, Wolfram Alpha is more than just the thing that assists you with your math homework in high school."}, {"time": 7278, "text": "It's actually this giant network of data of like weather data, of location data, just statistic, all kinds of, it's doing the aggregation in a way that you can query across data sets."}, {"time": 7290, "text": "And it's exactly this kind of idea."}, {"time": 7294, "text": "It basically represents the very kind of thing you would hope to be able to query off chain as part of the smart contracts."}, {"time": 7301, "text": "Right, but the only downside is it's centralized."}, {"time": 7304, "text": "And that's always the Achilles heel of Wolfram is he tends to like proprietary things and he tends to like centralizing things and mostly because he likes running the things."}, {"time": 7313, "text": "And everybody can have an opinion on that."}, {"time": 7316, "text": "The thing though is that after you've done aggregation, there's a question of injection."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "How do you get that data into the system?"}, {"time": 7324, "text": "And you can do that in a very naive way where you can say, oh, I'm just gonna attach a public key to it and it'll sign for that data feed, that injection."}, {"time": 7330, "text": "And then somehow I'll just trust it as it is."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "Or you could try to make it more complicated."}, {"time": 7336, "text": "You could wait data feeds from different sources and have some notion of truthiness or a veracity metric or something like that."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "So Chainlink is just one of many different philosophies that was born out of the academy."}, {"time": 7349, "text": "I believe Ari Jewell was connected to it and there's some good people on that side."}, {"time": 7353, "text": "And it has a philosophy about how do you aggregate, a philosophy about how do you inject and how do you create incentives so that that process over time gets more federated or more decentralized instead of centralizing around one particular setup."}, {"time": 7367, "text": "Now, closely related corollary to this is computation off chain."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "So as I mentioned, smart contracts are intimately connected to our Oracle."}, {"time": 7376, "text": "The question is how much pre processing and state management are you gonna do outside of the system versus what do you do inside of the system?"}, {"time": 7383, "text": "So it's a very interesting balance between these two."}, {"time": 7387, "text": "And they were thinking about this stuff for a long time."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "There's a great paper called Town Crier, came out way back in the day at Cornell."}, {"time": 7393, "text": "And that was all about using like SGX to scrape things and you can rely on trusted hardware to give you good data."}, {"time": 7400, "text": "But you could also use those SGX cores to do contract processing, because if it runs in trusted hardware, then it's very unlikely to be tampered with or manipulated."}, {"time": 7408, "text": "And because of that, you don't have to federate it or decentralize it, you can run it on a single device as if it was running on a cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "So there seems to be a desire in that community to capture more and more of the smart contract stack and pull more and more of that stack into that layer two infrastructure from running on layer one."}, {"time": 7427, "text": "Because you have cost reduction and potentially because your trust model collapses to whatever Chainlink is offering, you're not gaining anything by doing the computation on Ethereum or another platform."}, {"time": 7440, "text": "Because you ever watched The Simpsons?"}, {"time": 7442, "text": "There was this beautiful episode where Mr. Burns wants to turn the power off in Springfield."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "It is the perfect analogy for information security."}, {"time": 7449, "text": "So he and Smithers, they go through this elaborate series of doors and secret passages and guard dogs and robots and shit to get to the center of the power plant to turn off the power."}, {"time": 7460, "text": "And when they arrive at the center of the plant, there's like this stray dog that's inside the room."}, {"time": 7465, "text": "And there's this wicker screen door that leads to the outside."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "And you're like, well, why the hell did you go through this elaborate series of doors and things if there's like a backdoor into your system?"}, {"time": 7474, "text": "Well, that's basically a real life analogy of the relationship between the Oracle and the smart contract."}, {"time": 7480, "text": "You're only as good in your infrastructure model as your weakest link."}, {"time": 7483, "text": "And it doesn't matter if all of your computation is decentralized, if you're at the mercy of your data feed."}, {"time": 7488, "text": "Because I can just manipulate that and break the entire security model of the system, okay?"}, {"time": 7492, "text": "You'll perfectly execute the wrong answer."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "So they say, well, if you're trusting us anyway, why don't you pull more of what you're doing on chain into our stack, which creates more transaction fees for them and more value for them."}, {"time": 7504, "text": "But there are many different ways you can do oracles."}, {"time": 7506, "text": "And earlier I was talking about the biology of these things, the cell differentiation."}, {"time": 7511, "text": "The minute that you admit heterogeneity in your system and you start having cells like stake pools or things that are on 24 seven, then you can start asking the what if question."}, {"time": 7522, "text": "Why don't you guys just also provide data feeds?"}, {"time": 7526, "text": "Why don't you guys also provide state channels or payment channels or generate random numbers from here or whatever?"}, {"time": 7531, "text": "And you're now a service provider."}, {"time": 7532, "text": "You're making the blockchain full time, but part time you're doing this."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "And if you're making bagels, you could probably make donuts, that type of a concept."}, {"time": 7539, "text": "So I think that type of competition is going to be very difficult for a lot of these layer two protocols that aren't tightly coupled with the protocol because the ones that are tightly coupled with the protocol, they have a built in trust advantage."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "They've already built a commercial reputation."}, {"time": 7556, "text": "There's already an increasingly more decentralized set."}, {"time": 7558, "text": "The other thing is you don't need a token."}, {"time": 7561, "text": "You can just use ADA."}, {"time": 7562, "text": "You don't need an oracle coin for these types of things to work."}, {"time": 7565, "text": "And by the way, that's just for the injection component and the veracity attestation."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "So is it true or not?"}, {"time": 7572, "text": "That's not about the aggregation."}, {"time": 7573, "text": "That's still a tremendously time intensive, expensive proposition."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "There's only a few people in the world that have what Steve has with Wolfram."}, {"time": 7581, "text": "And those guys by just cutting off those supply to replicate what they have is something that would cost hundreds of millions or billions of dollars."}, {"time": 7589, "text": "And so it's an interesting question of how do you incentivize decentralized aggregation of information?"}, {"time": 7593, "text": "And that's kind of what town crier and other protocols we're trying to achieve."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "So maybe you can say how town crier works because it's like, what's your vision?"}, {"time": 7601, "text": "You're now partnering with Wolfram and Wolfram Alpha in sort of exploring this partnership of data and the blockchain."}, {"time": 7611, "text": "What's your vision for a possible distributed version of Wolfram Alpha?"}, {"time": 7616, "text": "Well, the first step is just say, can we use this as a feed?"}, {"time": 7619, "text": "And they can be what Bloomberg is to the financial markets."}, {"time": 7622, "text": "So you have a terminal and you have something and there's always a value of at least offering choice."}, {"time": 7626, "text": "And so it's not like we're anti chain link or picking winners and losers."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "It's an open protocol, it's an open system."}, {"time": 7631, "text": "So if we're successful, chain link will migrate or it will at least support us because they like money."}, {"time": 7637, "text": "They like users, they like liquidity."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "It's a disservice to their community not to support a potential customer set, but you're gonna have a spectrum from the desire to do a completely decentralized aggregation, curation, injection and veracity attestation to a completely centralized vertically integrated set."}, {"time": 7656, "text": "You need to be able to have that whole spectrum and offer that to the smart contract developer to decide what makes sense."}, {"time": 7662, "text": "By the way, a lot of cases, they're gonna be their own Oracle."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "So for example, the World of Warcraft example that I gave, well, it's a completely centralized thing."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "It's a video game run by a single company."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "There's no sense in saying that we're somehow going to decentralize that."}, {"time": 7677, "text": "What they're just trying to do is extend their currency or NFTs or whatever into new marketplaces."}, {"time": 7682, "text": "So the minting of that is controlled by a single entity and the world state of that, you just have to trust Blizzard to inject that into the system."}, {"time": 7692, "text": "You could try to imagine some sort of like, Sentinel group of people within the game who keep Blizzard honest, but it's completely unnecessary because they can change the rules of the system arbitrarily."}, {"time": 7702, "text": "So in that case, you're optimizing around efficiency and cost reduction."}, {"time": 7707, "text": "So you'd want a single feed that gets injected into the system from them."}, {"time": 7712, "text": "If you look at a stable coin that's algorithmic and it's basing its value on the aggregation of many different exchanges, that's the polar opposite example."}, {"time": 7721, "text": "Because there you're saying, okay, what's the price of my asset relative to some basket?"}, {"time": 7725, "text": "But how do I know that the price feeds I'm looking at are accurate?"}, {"time": 7729, "text": "You'd have to look at Binance and Bittrex and all these other things, or maybe there's conventional Forex exchanges or something like that."}, {"time": 7734, "text": "Okay, well, how do you weight that?"}, {"time": 7737, "text": "And how do you clip outliers and these types of things?"}, {"time": 7739, "text": "That's a completely different conversation."}, {"time": 7741, "text": "There's a lot more mechanics you have to put in for that bundling and attestation of the veracity of the data feed."}, {"time": 7748, "text": "And what happens if you get it wrong?"}, {"time": 7749, "text": "Your stable coin gets mispriced and everything goes to hell."}, {"time": 7753, "text": "And the markets will eventually correct it for arbitrage seeking behavior, but anything that was built on that will fail in the short term."}, {"time": 7761, "text": "So Oracle is really just a game of, you have to build a standardized interfaces and make it as easy as possible for people to do that."}, {"time": 7767, "text": "And then let people choose how they wanna inject data and what level of assurance do they need behind that?"}, {"time": 7774, "text": "And the question is, how much do you leave to the user versus how much does the protocol take care of for you?"}, {"time": 7778, "text": "And it's a difficult design question."}, {"time": 7780, "text": "For our part, we love working with Steve and Wolfram and they're a great company and they really have some bright people there."}, {"time": 7787, "text": "And we know on the data set, they're second to none because not only do they have it, it's computable."}, {"time": 7791, "text": "You can do all kinds of things and manipulate with a very rich query language."}, {"time": 7796, "text": "And we wanna make sure that that's accessible to developers and Cardano."}, {"time": 7800, "text": "Remember, they're like Bloomberg."}, {"time": 7801, "text": "It's a centralized speed in that respect."}, {"time": 7804, "text": "So if you wanna build a Chainlink S competitor, there's other protocols you could do for that."}, {"time": 7809, "text": "Now you asked about Tom Cryer and that was an attempt to kind of sweep the oceans with the net, get the data through a decentralized way."}, {"time": 7819, "text": "And that was just saying, hey, let's use trusted hardware to go read all kinds of websites and other things."}, {"time": 7824, "text": "And because it's trusted hardware, the scraping is nonbiased."}, {"time": 7828, "text": "If you find something inconvenient to whatever the person who's scraping is, trusted hardware will still do it and it can't be changed."}, {"time": 7835, "text": "You'd have to manipulate SGX to do that."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "So that's great, but you still run into the problem of how do you wire that together?"}, {"time": 7842, "text": "The underlying websites still don't have any notion of veracity or reputation behind them."}, {"time": 7847, "text": "And then you also have the issue of storage."}, {"time": 7849, "text": "Where the hell do you put all of it?"}, {"time": 7851, "text": "If you have exabytes of data, what's the incentive for that?"}, {"time": 7854, "text": "That's the dream of the Semantic Web."}, {"time": 7856, "text": "I still think is a fascinating idea how to basically convert the internet into a core, like a knowledge base that you can query, you can integrate in the same way you did with Wolfram Alpha, but much bigger."}, {"time": 7871, "text": "But that means basically revolutionizing the way we put the internet together, which I think these ideas of off chain data will motivate people, because there's a lot of money to be made."}, {"time": 7887, "text": "Finally, there's money to be made with the Semantic Web."}, {"time": 7890, "text": "So that'll be an interesting kind of future."}, {"time": 7892, "text": "I do want to ask you about video games really quick as a small tangent, because you said this really interesting idea of Blizzard being centralized control."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "Is it possible to have items in the game that are not controlled by Blizzard?"}, {"time": 7909, "text": "Being controlled in a decentralized fashion that you can, like what is it, the grandfather sword in Diablo?"}, {"time": 7916, "text": "Hmm, what was it really?"}, {"time": 7918, "text": "Somebody was criticizing me."}, {"time": 7919, "text": "I was saying all these kinds of nice things about Diablo III, and they said Diablo II Resurrected is coming out, they need to check it out."}, {"time": 7925, "text": "There's a lot of camps and wars that need to be done."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "Come on, we both know that Diablo II is far better than Diablo III."}, {"time": 7930, "text": "That's what they're saying."}, {"time": 7931, "text": "This is the war that they're having."}, {"time": 7932, "text": "Okay, so we'll play it, it's coming out soon, I'll play it, fine."}, {"time": 7937, "text": "But nevertheless, those items are owned by Blizzard."}, {"time": 7940, "text": "Is it possible to create video games where items are owned by the people outside of Blizzard, and do you think in like a half century from now we will all live in those games, and we'll forget the physical space even exists?"}, {"time": 7955, "text": "Well, yeah, that's definitely possible."}, {"time": 7957, "text": "I look at CryptoKitties, that's a great example of that."}, {"time": 7959, "text": "Can you explain what CryptoKitties is?"}, {"time": 7961, "text": "Well, it's basically just a video game that kind of lives on a blockchain, and the creatures within the game can breed with each other and create new CryptoKitties, and you can own them."}, {"time": 7970, "text": "So it's like some sort of dystopian Tamagotchi with lots of money behind it."}, {"time": 7974, "text": "But anyway, the thing is those assets actually have a blockchain based representation."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "And so whether the infrastructure that hoists up that game off chain goes on or off, because that ledger exists outside of the game, any person can come in and replicate it, restore it, and turn it back on sans intellectual property."}, {"time": 7996, "text": "So yeah, it's completely possible to break your architecture up where you have a notion of the player part, and then you have a notion of the experience part, and you can interchange experiences, almost like you do cascading style sheets or something for different presentations, and the ownership of the underlying layers, the players."}, {"time": 8016, "text": "So yeah, that's definitely doable."}, {"time": 8018, "text": "And frankly, that's what's gonna happen in the gaming world, because there's so much value in that."}, {"time": 8022, "text": "I mean, everybody wants play, and right now the model is you make a game, you sell licenses, and you have a huge surge of people at the beginning of the game buying the video game, and then you have this long tail, but you've gotten almost 95% of your value in the first six months, and you have a huge churn rate."}, {"time": 8038, "text": "The odds are the vast majority of people won't be playing the game within 12 months."}, {"time": 8042, "text": "But if you can create an interactive game where there's an actual economy inside the game, then you have EVE Online, or Second

"It's like it's in your house."}, {"time": 8485, "text": "So it's gonna be a hard fork."}, {"time": 8486, "text": "It's like when I got my blue check mark on Twitter, I woke up, and I had it."},

away, Flex?"}, {"time": 8502, "text": "Oh, but that'd be like a hard fork backwards, I guess."}, {"time": 8507, "text": "Okay, so great."}, {"time": 8508, "text": "So that's, but currently, there's a testing procedure going on to see what does that look like, and what will give you confidence that things are working well."}, {"time": 8520, "text": "Yeah, so first, you start with the marry era, which is where we're right now multi assets."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "So you can do metadata and issue tokens on Cardano, but you'd have limited programmability on chain."}, {"time": 8531, "text": "Alonzo adds the programmability in, but we already have most of the foundations of the extended UTXO model, and the smart contract model is just, those things aren't ready."}, {"time": 8539, "text": "So the first step is, say, fork it, so all those rules are now there, okay?"}, {"time": 8543, "text": "That's what we did with Alonzo Blue."}, {"time": 8545, "text": "We forked a testnet base layer, and it successfully survived going from marry to Alonzo, which means that you can move transactions from one side to the other."}, {"time": 8554, "text": "Both systems work."}, {"time": 8555, "text": "And then the next step is, say, okay, well, are the stake pool operators, people who run the infrastructure, able to run this testnet just like they run Cardano?"}, {"time": 8562, "text": "And that's what we're doing right now with Blue."}, {"time": 8564, "text": "We're bringing all these SPOs in, and then are we able to submit and run smart contracts on the system?"}, {"time": 8569, "text": "And they actually return a round trip."}, {"time": 8571, "text": "You send something, you get something back."}, {"time": 8573, "text": "Yay, okay."}, {"time": 8575, "text": "And then what you do is each step, so the next is white, you go from like 50 people to several hundred, and then purple's an open testnet where we want every single person in the entire ecosystem to use it, and it's also a DevNet."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "So that means that people who are writing with Pluse Playground and local interpreters, their smart contracts can actually start testing them now on the public infrastructure."}, {"time": 8597, "text": "So it's kind of like releasing dev kits to the Xbox or something like that."}, {"time": 8601, "text": "You send them out to game developers before you release the Xbox, so they can test their video games in anticipation of the release of the system."}, {"time": 8607, "text": "So you run that for at least a month, and as long as it doesn't blow up in your face, and oh God, what have we done, Hindenburg, oh the humanity, you release it and you ship it."}, {"time": 8617, "text": "The problem is it's no longer in our control."}, {"time": 8619, "text": "There's over 100 exchanges that have listed Cardano."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "There's lots of wallet infrastructure."}, {"time": 8623, "text": "There are thousands of different constituencies."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "So it's less of a technological problem now, and it's more of a coordination problem."}, {"time": 8631, "text": "So you have to evolve in a very methodical way, and each step of the way you bring new actors in, they get ready for it."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "They upgrade their infrastructure to it, and then like shells, eventually, you get to the outer shell, which is the hard fork for the general public."}, {"time": 8645, "text": "And if we've done it right, like that blue check mark, they wake up and it's exactly the same."}, {"time": 8651, "text": "They just get a little update thing, update your client."}, {"time": 8654, "text": "And they start demanding Wagyu beef."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "Is there stuff you're worried about in

"Is there, like we said, there's game theoretic aspects, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 8672, "text": "Like what worries you the most?"}, {"time": 8673, "text": "I mean, I sleep like a baby."}, {"time": 8675, "text": "I wake up every two hours crying."}, {"time": 8686, "text": "And what makes no sense, I slept like a baby."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "But go ahead."}, {"time": 8689,

{"time": 8696, "text": "You know, it's like you're in a cold sweat everyday when you have an ecosystem like this, cause you, you, the other thing is you're judged as much by the applications people build on the platform as you are by the platform you've constructed."}, {"time": 8708, "text": "So, you know, one of the most unfair things that happened in our industry was blaming Vitalik for the DAO hack."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "He didn't write the code, he wasn't responsible for it."}, {"time": 8716, "text": "It was a completely independent, different team."}, {"time": 8718, "text": "And because it blew up, a lot of people just developed this idea, Ethereum is not secure, the EBM is fundamentally broken."}, {"time": 8724, "text": "And it's true, there are some issues there, but come on, that's like saying, oh, well, Photoshop didn't work, fuck Bill Gates."}, {"time": 8732, "text": "And that's the issue is you get, as a platform developer, coupled with the wins and losses of your application developer."}, {"time": 8741, "text": "So if they go do amazing things, it's like, oh yeah, Windows is great, we love it."}, {"time": 8745, "text": "And if they go do terrible things, they're like, oh man, I guess he's trying to kill all of us."}, {"time": 8750, "text": "So what we're kept up a night about is not just what we've constructed, but also how do we curate an ecosystem and foster the development of an ecosystem where you have assurance baked into the application, and that's somehow expressible to the user."}, {"time": 8764, "text": "So when you download your smart contract or you click your one click install, you use your unit swap clone or whatever the hell it is that's deployed on Cardano, you have a little green check mark or something that indicates to you that somebody audited the code or followed a specification."}, {"time": 8778, "text": "The lack of that is problematic because then first there's impersonations, the whole MyEtherWallet thing, like your videos or my videos are the same."}, {"time": 8786, "text": "Every comment, there's a bot that says, hey, give me some money or something like that."}, {"time": 8790, "text": "That kind of stuff happens."}, {"time": 8791, "text": "But then just protocol level flaws, like what happened with the DAO hack, that's what really keeps me up at night."}, {"time": 8797, "text": "How do you resolve that problem?"}, {"time": 8798, "text": "Because I don't hire these people."}, {"time": 8800, "text": "I don't tell them what to do."}, {"time": 8801, "text": "I didn't tell them how to build things on the platform."}, {"time": 8804, "text": "They may have tons of experience and knowledge."}, {"time": 8806, "text": "They could be Simon Payton Jones or they could have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever and they read one tutorial and they've written three lines of code their entire life and they've deployed something horribly broken, copy paste, and suddenly it all goes to hell."},

ecosystem, trying to figure out standards."}, {"time": 8826, "text": "Like at University of Wyoming, we're setting up the Smart Contract Engineering Institute."}, {"time": 8830, "text": "We're negotiating with them right now."}, {"time": 8832, "text": "And the goal there is just to create some standards for how to certify smart contracts so that you can get that green check mark and know that it actually has some assurance level behind it."}, {"time": 8842, "text": "But God, that's a huge coordination problem and it's a huge information presentation problem and incentives problem and so forth."}, {"time": 8849, "text": "And unfortunately, people who value being first to market will kind of piss in the pool for everybody else."}, {"time": 8855, "text": "In terms of, maybe you can comment on the topic of decentralized exchanges."}, {"time": 8860, "text": "What kind of decentralized exchanges, DEXs, what are they, first of all, and what kind would you like to see built around Cardano?"}, {"time": 8868, "text": "Yeah, so people want to create exchanges that don't have custodial risk."}, {"time": 8872, "text": "The point of exchange is to build you a marketplace where bids and asks can find each other, people can meet and trade."}, {"time": 8880, "text": "You can find a price and you can get liquidity."}, {"time": 8882, "text": "So you got gold, you wanna turn your gold into dollars."}, {"time": 8885, "text": "Okay, well, somebody has to create a marketplace for that."}, {"time": 8888, "text": "So like Coinbase is an example of a marketplace."}, {"time": 8889, "text": "But it's centralized."}, {"time": 8891, "text": "But the problem is you have custodial risk."}, {"time": 8893, "text": "So when you put your gold and your dollars or your digital representations of these things into the exchange, what if Wally, Eve broke up with him and now he's really sad and he's gone to the dark side and he's become Wally the hacker."}, {"time": 8907, "text": "Okay, so he can go and sneak his way in and hack into Coinbase and steal all your gold and your tokens."}, {"time": 8912, "text": "So instead of you actually being able to swap these things, you've lost all your money."}, {"time": 8916, "text": "And there's other problems too."}, {"time": 8917, "text": "Like let's say Daisy has now come in and become a regulator and said, oh, I don't like these exchanges anymore."}, {"time": 8924, "text": "I'm just gonna shut them all down."}, {"time": 8926, "text": "Yeah, and then you have no access to it."}, {"time": 8927, "text": "So you have sovereign risk, you have the risk of threat, you have regulatory risk, you have the issue of banks maybe cutting you out."}, {"time": 8934, "text": "So it's been in our industry for more than 10 years."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "Mt."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "Gox was the most famous example of that."}, {"time": 8939, "text": "They collapsed, I believe in 2013 and hundreds of millions of dollars was lost over the course of a while."}, {"time": 8946, "text": "So the point of a DEX is saying, can we do what a marketplace does, but not have Coinbase, not have a central actor run this thing?"}, {"time": 8955, "text": "And there's a lot of problems with that because exchanges are generally creatures of latency."}, {"time": 8961, "text": "You know, high frequency trading, for example, the things that nanosecond, they co locate their infrastructure with the exchange software just so they can front run orders over other people."}, {"time": 8971, "text": "I mean, it's crazy the amount of technology that they put in."}, {"time": 8974, "text": "So the traditional Wall Street version of an exchange is very centralized, very fast, very optimized and kind of behaves by a very closed set of rules."}, {"time": 8984, "text": "When you look at a DEX, you have to accept that you're gonna have to have slightly different rules because you're operating in a global systems latency and you're operating in a system that has different behaviors."}, {"time": 8995, "text": "However, that said, there's a lot of great protocols that have been built for it."}, {"time": 8998, "text": "You know, Uniswap has kind of evolved a lot over the years and we've seen a huge competition and a lot of evolution to basically build out protocols that kind of excuse some of these security problems, enjoy high liquidity and then also have this beautiful concept of openness."}, {"time": 9015, "text": "One of the gatekeepers to crypto when you're a cryptocurrency developer are the exchanges."}, {"time": 9019, "text": "I remember when we first created Cardano, you know, the Bitfinex guys reached out to the Cardano Foundation."}, {"time": 9024, "text": "They said, oh, we'd be happy to list ADA."}, {"time": 9027, "text": "And they said, yeah, we want $5 million to do it."}, {"time": 9030, "text": "You know, so there was kind of some Italian for go fuck yourself in those email conversations."}, {"time": 9036, "text": "Fuck, hula is what I said."}, {"time": 9039, "text": "But anyway, that kind of back and forth happens all the time."}, {"time": 9042, "text": "And because these guys are gatekeepers, they have this nepotistic control information asymmetries and so forth."}, {"time": 9048, "text": "So having a DEX, you don't have that problem."}, {"time": 9050, "text": "You have open listing and you basically just put the asset into it."}, {"time": 9054, "text": "And if anybody wants to trade it, they will."}, {"time": 9056, "text": "And if it seems like it's a good idea, a natural market will form, market making will occur and you get liquidity with it."}, {"time": 9061, "text": "So there's no barrier to entry for that type of system."}, {"time": 9065, "text": "The biggest existential problem for DEXs right now is the concept of regulation."}, {"time": 9070, "text": "So basically right now, when you use Binance or Coinbase or these other guys, you have to go through KYC and AML, know your customer and anti money laundering."}, {"time": 9078, "text": "So basically who are you and you know, is your money real or not, or are you a drug dealer or something?"}, {"time": 9084, "text": "So normally you do that by saying, okay, I'm gonna give them my copy of my passport and maybe they're gonna request some tax records or whatever the best practices are for the particular jurisdiction."}, {"time": 9094, "text": "And then that exchange is liable if that's fucked up."}, {"time": 9097, "text": "So if the government comes in and says, hey guys, you know, pull your compliance records and they find discrepancies, they'll actually put the exchange out of business or fine them very heavily."}, {"time": 9108, "text": "JP Morgan Chase got $19 billion in fines over the last 20 years for various compliance issues amongst other things."}, {"time": 9116, "text": "So it's expensive, very difficult thing."}, {"time": 9119, "text": "And at DEX, it's open system."}, {"time": 9121, "text": "You just have value coming in, not identity."}, {"time": 9123, "text": "And so all these things are trading amongst anonymous accounts."}, {"time": 9126, "text": "And so there's no notion of compliance right now for that."}, {"time": 9129, "text": "So a lot of regulators are coming in and saying, oh, well, this is just a cesspool for terrorism and drug dealing and bad stuff."}, {"time": 9135, "text": "And they're word salad of bullshit."}, {"time": 9138, "text": "But you know, it is what it is."}, {"time": 9139, "text": "You have to deal with these guys."}, {"time": 9140, "text": "And so there's been a lot of discussions of, can we take DEXs and keep the openness and keep the liquidity and no counterpart or custodial risk?"}, {"time": 9149, "text": "And can we add some notion of compliance to that in a decentralized way that doesn't require a single actor to be a gatekeeper?"}, {"time": 9157, "text": "So I think actually by combining DIDs, decentralized identifiers, that's the way to do it."}, {"time": 9161, "text": "But it's actually the next generation of the technology is the regulated DEX and who regulates that, how does that work and so forth."}, {"time": 9167, "text": "But I think ultimately those are gonna be the only marketplaces that end up surviving in this current environment if your desire is to exit to a dollar."}, {"time": 9176, "text": "If you don't really care about the fiat side, like a traditional legacy currency, you can always do things in a shadowy, unregulated way."}, {"time": 9185, "text":

some way, and then do it in a different system where it's fast and cheap."}, {"time": 10507, "text": "And what I'm doing with that is I'm losing some of the security guarantees of the base layer and

is just the next generation of that."}, {"time": 10548, "text": "When you have the ability to tinker with the accounting model and the layer two solution is co designed with the layer one solution."}, {"time": 10555, "text": "So it's like what Lightning would have been had Lightning been co developed when Bitcoin came out."}, {"time": 10560, "text": "There would have been special provisions made in Bitcoin, specifically to accommodate Lightning, and it would have made it very easy for you then to move inside the system, outside of the system, and have security properties preserved, like availability, for example, or fraud resistance, say, oh, you can't steal the money or these types of things."}, {"time": 10578, "text": "Where things get really complex, and this is why Hydra's novel over Lightning, is when you wanna move beyond payments to state management."}, {"time": 10585, "text": "Okay, so payments are just, I wanna move between Alice to Bob as quickly as possible, as low cost as possible."}, {"time": 10591, "text": "So for example, I have a micro tipping application, like change tip on Twitter, or like a video, I'm watching YouTube video, like maybe this video in the future, and people really like it, and they click tip, and you get five cents or something like that."}, {"time": 10603, "text": "Okay, so that's an example of a perfect payment application, and that's great, but what happens when you actually have a rich smart contract, like a DEX, or you wanna do a video game, or something like that, you wanna run that off chain, but then there's some reconciliation on chain that happens."}, {"time": 10619, "text": "So a state channel basically lets you do that, but it's a lot more complicated, and there's a lot more to think about."}, {"time": 10625, "text": "So Hydra basically just has in its design, a collection of ideas of how to do that."}, {"time": 10631, "text": "And the current paper is for a single head."}, {"time": 10635, "text":

back?"}, {"time": 10650, "text": "And you can create all kinds of guarantees that your funds won't be lost, or locked forever, or things like that."}, {"time": 10655, "text": "There's a failure recovery mode for this type of stuff."}, {"time": 10657, "text": "And basically the idea is leverage what Lightning has already achieved with Bitcoin, but then take advantage of the fact that you have a more expressive accounting model, and a more expressive programming model, so you can just physically do more, and you can put more crypto into that thing."}, {"time": 10672, "text": "Now contrast it with rollups, really that is just saying, you're gonna take some thing, batch a bunch of transactions together, and you're gonna generate a proof."}, {"time": 10680, "text": "And then what you can do is whenever you see some part of that history, you can check it against that proof that's rolled up."}, {"time": 10685, "text": "And they're closely related concept of recursive snarks that you'll see a lot."}, {"time": 10689, "text": "Things like the MENA protocol, or other things."}, {"time": 10691, "text": "And basically the idea is that whenever you see something, you can always generate two proofs."}, {"time": 10696, "text": "An existential proofs that the coins exist, and a non existence of a double spend."}, {"time": 10701, "text": "So you can always check those two properties."}, {"time": 10703, "text": "And the proof is verifiable in logarithmic time, ideally."}, {"time": 10707, "text": "So you can have giant amounts of data, but it's very small."}, {"time": 10710, "text": "The actual proof is concise, okay?"}, {"time": 10713, "text": "So they're just different boats for different floats."}, {"time": 10715, "text": "The advantage of a layer two network where there's actual channels, and there's interaction, and there's service providers, is the channels can eventually scale in the collection of things that they can do."}, {"time": 10726, "text": "And eventually they can become interoperability networks between cryptocurrencies."}, {"time": 10731, "text": "So at some point, we could modify the bolt spec, and make it somewhat interoperable with Hydra."}, {"time": 10736, "text": "And then what you could happen is you could use it as a bridge to actually do cross chain traffic, and send transactions between the systems."}, {"time": 10742, "text": "You don't really think about that too much when you're talking about roll ups."}, {"time": 10744, "text": "That's more of optimizing what you have within the system."}, {"time": 10747, "text": "Within the chain, so can you elaborate how it's possible to do cross chain traffic?"}, {"time": 10752, "text": "Well, you already have the intermediary, you have the channel operator, and you already have lightning protocol, right?"}, {"time": 10758, "text": "And you just build a dex that runs within that system, and they can swap assets, or you can do wrapped assets."}, {"time": 10764, "text": "So you lock it."}, {"time": 10764, "text": "So it would be like low cost?"}, {"time": 10766, "text": "I guess you could just switch low."}, {"time": 10768, "text": "Yeah, the same thing lets you batch things on one, will let you batch the other."}, {"time": 10771, "text": "So if lightning works on Bitcoin, and Hydra works on Cardano, you can eventually bridge these two together, and create a way of moving back and forth."}, {"time": 10777, "text": "And the same things that make transactions in and out of that network cheap, will make creating wrapped assets cheap."}, {"time": 10783, "text": "At least on the Bitcoin to Cardano side, you can't create assets on Bitcoin."}, {"time": 10787, "text": "Another flaw of Bitcoin that they've never fixed."}, {"time": 10789, "text": "What's your thought about layer two technologies in general?"}, {"time": 10792, "text": "Is there stuff you're excited about?"}, {"time": 10793, "text": "We talked quite a bit about Lightning Network, Hydra, and these ideas."}, {"time": 10797, "text": "Do you think there'll be somebody that wins out, or is this gonna be this kind of dynamic thing that we just keep building different ideas, and they all interact with each other?"}, {"time": 10805, "text": "It goes back to biology, that cell differentiation concept, is you have to build specialized tissue to do these things."}, {"time": 10811, "text": "The point of layer two is to extend the network."}, {"time": 10813, "text": "It's adding a foot, it's adding an arm, it's adding a brain, it's adding a heart, it's adding eyes, giving you additional senses, you have ears now."}, {"time": 10820, "text": "So when you add these layer two protocols, like Atala Prism is a perfect example of that."}, {"time": 10824, "text": "We don't have identity at the base layer of Cardano."}, {"time": 10827, "text": "It's a real bad deal to do that, because then China will come in, or US will come in and tell you how to do that."}, {"time": 10832, "text": "What you do is you build a layer two protocol that's blockchain agnostic, and then the user can decide when and where they need an identity, and then bring that identity into the system."}, {"time": 10841, "text": "And if you designed it right, when they bring it in, it's very easy, very fluid, and suddenly the experience enhances."}, {"time": 10847, "text": "Everything just gets better."}, {"time": 10849, "text": "Oh, wow, okay, now I can use all these regulated things."}, {"time": 10851, "text": "They go from gray to green in the App Store."}, {"time": 10855, "text": "Or, oh, wow, now I can send to human readable addresses, because if I have an identity and you have an identity, we can alias them with some namespace, and now I sent a Lex instead of some horrible back 32 address structure."}, {"time": 10868, "text": "Okay, so that's really what you need to do with layer two is say, okay, each layer two protocol is meant to do something."}, {"time": 10874, "text": "Either it gives me payments, or lower cost smart contracts, or interoperability, or identity, and then it's a marketplace."}, {"time": 10881, "text": "So you should have blockchain agnosticism with your layer two solutions."}, {"time": 10885, "text": "And so you can mix and match and choose whichever collection of services you need."}, {"time": 10889, "text": "And that's actually how IT works these days with microservices and these other things, and cloud software, you know."}, {"time": 10895, "text": "Every firm is an aggregation of dozens of providers, and basically that composition of them is your software stack."}, {"time": 10903, "text": "Jumping around back to proof of work."}, {"time": 10905, "text": "What are non interactive proofs of proof of work?"}, {"time": 10913, "text": "NIPOPOWS, it's fun to say, right?"}, {"time": 10915, "text": "It's just one of those things that you notice that certain proofs of work, when you solve them, come up less frequently than other ones."}, {"time": 10922, "text": "And just by that nature, you can sample them and then construct proofs from them."}, {"time": 10927, "text": "So you can, with that just set, have a more concise representation of an amount of work for a range of the chain."}, {"time": 10934, "text": "So that works."}, {"time": 10935, "text": "Yeah, I was gonna say that word salad, basically the idea is, okay, so let's say that this block, and I'm just simplifying the concept a lot."}, {"time": 10942, "text": "This block, you get a regular green type of proof of work, and then this block, you get a green, and you keep going, and then suddenly you get a red one."}, {"time": 10951, "text": "So it's still a valid proof of work, but it's more rare than the other ones."}, {"time": 10955, "text": "So if you notice that particular pattern, what you can do is you can just start not caring so much about the green ones, and you can just bookend your chain with red."}, {"time": 10964, "text": "And then you can just repeat that, and repeat that, repeat that, and you can collect, and you can create this really compressed representation of these things."}, {"time": 10971, "text": "So what does it mean?"}, {"time": 10972, "text": "It means that suddenly when you have that, now you have a way of representing a long range of history with a very small proof."}, {"time": 10980, "text": "So you can use it for light wallets, and you also can use it for side chains, if both side chains use proof of work."}, {"time": 10987, "text": "So when you see a transaction come in, you don't have a copy of the side chain, but you have a copy of the proof of work, and it has the same algorithmic weight as the normal longest chain, because you don't have all the greens, but the reds only occur with a certain sampling frequency."}, {"time": 11001, "text": "So this is the brainchild of Dionysus Zintros and Agelos, and it's just an amazing paper, and what's so cool about it is it doesn't require any structural changes to proof of work."}, {"time": 11011, "text": "It's just something you notice as an off gas of proof of work."}, {"time": 11014, "text": "It's like you're watching an engine operate, and you notice like every 500 times a piston will do a certain weird thing, and so you take advantage of that."}, {"time": 11022, "text": "You say, well, if I count 10 of them, now I have 5,000 pistons, strikes, as I observed that pattern."}, {"time": 11028, "text": "And so it's the same concept there, and it's just a property of the engine."}, {"time": 11032, "text": "So you don't really need to hard fork it in."}, {"time": 11034, "text": "It's just there, and because you can build proofs that way, now you can use those proofs to do like clients, and you can use those proofs to do other things, because you can just use that as something that comes with the history."}, {"time": 11043, "text": "You don't have to have the whole blockchain."}, {"time": 11044, "text": "Now, is this a weird property of multiple proof of work chains?"}, {"time": 11048, "text": "It has to be key to the particular consensus algorithm, but usually there's some portability in this type of thing."}, {"time": 11055, "text": "Like we're right now exploring, can you do NIPA piles with Prism or any of these sharded proof of work protocols, but it looks like you can."}, {"time": 11061, "text": "The closely related is log space mining."}, {"time": 11063, "text": "So you can use this concept, and instead of having the entire blockchain to be able to mine, you can use a compressed representation of it."}, {"time": 11069, "text": "We wrote a paper called Log Space Mining that basically explains how to do that."}, {"time": 11073, "text": "So your miner only has this very small micro ledger as opposed to the entire ledger."}, {"time": 11080, "text": "How does it connect back to the entire ledger?"}, {"time": 11083, "text": "How does the compressed?"}, {"time": 11083, "text": "Because you have those red blocks."}, {"time": 11085, "text": "You have those special things, and so you know that the state you're working on is actually legitimate, right?"}, {"time": 11091, "text": "So the map goes both ways?"}, {"time": 11092, "text": "Yep, it's pretty cool."}, {"time": 11095, "text": "Wow, that's really interesting."}, {"time": 11096, "text": "Yeah, and Denis is a genius."}, {"time": 11098, "text": "He's a really, really smart kid, and he got his PhD under us."}, {"time": 11101, "text": "He went to University of Athens, and he was Agelos's graduate student, and now he's doing a postdoc at Stanford under David Shi, and this is literally the only thing he does."}, {"time": 11110, "text": "He does interoperability, sidechain stuff, NIPA piles and so forth, and he's written a lot of great papers on it."}, {"time": 11116, "text": "And that was a testimony to hard work for getting the paper published, because the paper came out in 2016, but I think it took three or four years for it to go through peer review."}, {"time": 11125, "text": "He kept trying to push it one conference after another rejection, after another rejection, but he got it through."}, {"time": 11130,

right?"}, {"time": 13439, "text": "Like Bob is in charge."}, {"time": 13441, "text": "It's like whether you like Bob or not, he's in charge."}, {"time": 13444, "text": "That's not very legitimate."},

something like that."}, {"time": 13454, "text": "So there's a spectrum there between absolute power to one and perfectly egalitarian power to every single potential participant inside the system."},

asking your people about a subset of questions related to a particular set of topics, but then they're not allowed to talk about other topics?"}, {"time": 13478, "text": "Like for example, are they allowed to change the tax rate, but they can't change freedom of speech, that kind of a thing."}, {"time": 13483, "text": "So the first thing you have to do when you build these types of systems and they get to a certain scale is you have to build some mechanism for people who are interested in governance to self select and participate."}, {"time": 13494, "text": "Just create a collection bucket."}, {"time": 13496, "text": "In Bitcoin, we had Bitcoin talk and Bitcoin Reddit and these things."}, {"time": 13499, "text": "And eventually the GitHub repos and these things, there was a place to go if you were interested."}, {"time": 13504, "text": "And you need some sort of change management system where people who want to evolve the system can write it down in a very careful way."},

us, it's the SIP, the Cardano Improvement Proposal."}, {"time": 13518, "text": "But just a structured way of discussing how you wish to change."}, {"time": 13521, "text": "Then there's a question of, do you want to do this implicitly or explicitly?"}, {"time": 13525, "text": "The case of Bitcoin in Ethereum, it's an implicit system."}, {"time": 13528, "text": "So there's no on chain voting."},

doing foundational research in eVoting."}, {"time": 13547, "text": "We're building new voting systems, we're exploring preference voting and quadratic voting."}, {"time": 13551, "text": "And the long and the short is that we want more and more people to participate in voting for things."}, {"time": 13557, "text": "And you just have to start somewhere."}, {"time": 13559, "text": "So our hypothesis is we can bootstrap the system with the treasury system."}, {"time": 13565, "text": "So in Cardano, some of the inflation goes to the block producers, just like any other cryptocurrency, but some goes into a decentralized treasury, which now has over a billion dollars of ADA in it."}, {"time": 13577, "text": "So it's a lot of money."}, {"time": 13578, "text": "And that treasury is not under my control or the foundation's control, it's actually controlled by the community as a whole through a program called Catalyst."}, {"time": 13586, "text": "And so all these people can come together and they can submit spending ballots and other people who hold ADA can vote to approve that."}, {"time": 13592, "text": "What's nice about it is you have a growth engine to improve two accesses."}, {"time": 13596, "text": "One is absolute participation."}, {"time": 13598, "text": "So increase the amount of people who hold ADA participating."}, {"time": 13602, "text": "So the absolute number of people participating."}, {"time": 13604, "text": "And the other is meaningful participation."}, {"time": 13606, "text": "So the depth of participation."}, {"time": 13608, "text": "Did you just show up and vote?"}, {"time": 13609, "text": "Or did you spend hours debating things on idea scale, the innovation management platform, interacting with the funding proposal, going back and forth."}, {"time": 13617, "text": "And there's dozens of little things like that."}, {"time": 13620, "text": "Now, my hypothesis is if you run this with enough iterations, eventually you get to a certain critical mass, like over 50% absolute participation and a high level of meaningful participation, where you can move beyond funding and you can start actually having meaningful questions about protocol design and improvement proposals and so forth."}, {"time": 13638, "text": "And then what you can do is you can roll out new voting systems and new social structures, and you can let them start voting on training wheels like system parameters."}, {"time": 13646, "text": "Like for example, the minimum transaction fee or that K parameter for the amount of stake pools or these types of things."}, {"time": 13652, "text": "Then they build enough competency there and they move up a next level."}, {"time": 13655, "text": "And they actually start talking about hard forks using the update system, the hard fork combinator system."}, {"time": 13660, "text": "See, so that's how you."}, {"time": 13661, "text": "Voting on a hard fork."}, {"time": 13664, "text": "You can't do it unless your social dynamics are right and your voting system is right."}, {"time": 13667, "text": "And by the way, you also need to write a constitution around the same time because not all hard forks are created equally."},

system."}, {"time": 13682, "text": "So the constitution would be written, and maybe you can comment on what is the innovation management proposal system?"}, {"time": 13689, "text": "So we partnered with a company called Ideascale and they run a kind of a side platform."}, {"time": 13693, "text": "So people who are interested, that's kind of our version of a forum."}, {"time": 13696, "text": "They sign up and there's special tools in that platform for discussions that are productive."}, {"time": 13701, "text": "So they don't descend into kind of like trolly Reddit style conversations, but they're much more focused around how is your product building out."}, {"time": 13708, "text": "And by the way, we're gonna add more infrastructure over time."}, {"time": 13710, "text": "Our chief of staff, Tamara Hasson, she's working on setting up an incubator and accelerator."}, {"time": 13715, "text": "And we have lots of cool partners we've talked with in that space."}, {"time": 13718, "text": "And it's the same concept."}, {"time": 13719, "text": "Your idea comes in, what enters the system should not be what gets approved on the other side."}, {"time": 13724, "text": "It should go through some sort of gauntlet, some sort of crucible where you iterate your way through and there's all kinds of optimizations and upgrades and evolutions and combinations and destructions that occur."}, {"time": 13735, "text": "And then by the time you get to the other side, either the idea just dies on the vine because it was a bad idea, or it's a significantly stronger, far more fundable thing and potentially even gets attached with accountability."}, {"time": 13745, "text": "So you don't just fund the idea, you'd actually fund the auditor at the same time who actually holds the person accountable because the blockchain is not a real company."}, {"time": 13752, "text": "It's an ethereal thing."}, {"time": 13754, "text": "You need a counterparty to hold someone accountable who's real for that type of stuff and that type of funding."}, {"time": 13759, "text": "So that's what we're doing this year."}, {"time": 13761, "text": "So we have a whole team of people, partners like Governance Live and IdeaScale and papers we've written and about 30, 40,000 people regularly participating in this."}, {"time": 13770, "text": "So it's a huge social experiment and we're learning an enormous amount."}, {"time": 13774, "text": "And then our goal is by the end of the year to have a meaningful percentage of the entire Cardinal population inside of it, like 40, 50%."}, {"time": 13781, "text": "Then once you're at that threshold, now you have democratic majority of the entire system and you can have a real conversation about, okay, how do we write a constitution for this type of a system?"}, {"time": 13791, "text": "And sorry to interrupt, but so the constitution, people still argue about it because natural language, much like poetry, lends itself to multiple interpretations."}, {"time": 13800, "text": "Is it possible to formalize some of these ideas that reduce the ambiguity?"}, {"time": 13807, "text": "Everything's old is new again."}, {"time": 13809,

is why I'm so interested in things like Idris and Koch and Acta and theorem proving, because that's exactly what you're attempting to do is to express some concept or desire or construction in a language that's machine understandable and manipulatable."}, {"time": 13830, "text": "In particular, how does the system know its own design?"}, {"time": 13833, "text": "So what is the reference of a cryptocurrency?"}, {"time": 13835, "text": "Usually it's a canonical code base, like here's Bitcoin core and the C++ code is that is the canonical code base."}, {"time": 13842, "text": "But actually that's not right."}, {"time": 13843, "text": "You should have specifications, blueprints that are implementation agnostic as your canonical code base."}, {"time": 13849, "text": "And can your system know those specifications, understand those specifications, and can your change management system be for that?"}, {"time": 13855, "text": "And then can you provide a proof that your client is by similar to that specification?"}, {"time": 13860, "text": "So yeah, that's 10 years in the future, but that's where you would go with that kind of a concept."}, {"time": 13865, "text": "But you're tending towards a formalism."}, {"time": 13868, "text": "Eventually, but that's not necessary for the system in the short term."}, {"time": 13872, "text": "It's good enough just to have, I know in a winter and say the Haskell client is that, and then what you basically do is you vote on a SIP and then once it's approved, then you go and implement that."}, {"time": 13884, "text": "And there's some mechanism to trigger the update system, to update the reference client."}, {"time": 13887, "text": "Do you have an example of a SIP, a Cardano Improvement Proposal?"}, {"time": 13891, "text": "Yeah, like the Curb Benefit Pledge, SIP 007."}, {"time": 13894, "text": "So the... 007."}, {"time": 13898, "text": "Yeah, everybody loves that."}, {"time": 13900, "text": "Yeah, key."}, {"time": 13901, "text": "I'm gonna change my luggage code now, Lex."}, {"time": 13905, "text": "So basically it just has to do with the pledge."}, {"time": 13910, "text": "So a pledge is a certain amount of ADA that a stake pool operator will set aside and connect to his pool in order to be listed in the registry."}, {"time": 13919, "text": "And actually it's connected to how much income you make as a pool operator."}, {"time": 13923, "text": "So if you set it too high, you have a consolidation, you have lots of pools."}, {"time": 13928, "text": "If you set it too low, what will happen is larger pools will tend to fragment and actually run multiple instances of themselves."}, {"time": 13935, "text": "And so this is delicate parameter that you have to tweak."}, {"time": 13938, "text": "And so we have a formula for it, our formal specification that's quite involved."}, {"time": 13942, "text": "And so one of the community members came and said, well, I think we can massively simplify this design and actually get a better result for smaller stake pool operators."}, {"time": 13950, "text": "And so it's SIP 007."}, {"time": 13953, "text": "And there's actually a lot of conversation and people are thinking about it."}, {"time": 13955, "text": "And it was just stunning for me because to understand how to write a SIP like this, you actually have to read like a hundred pages of mathematical prose in the formal specification."}, {"time": 13964, "text": "So the guys who wrote it, I was like, fuck yeah."}, {"time": 13968, "text": "I'll just say an example of a SIP, but that's one thing, but it could be as big as, hey, I wanna add like quantum resistance to the system."}, {"time": 13975, "text": "And here's how you do that, like quantum VRF and I wanna put XMSS and all this other stuff."}, {"time": 13980, "text": "So there's a lot you can do and you can do it indirectly or implicitly where there's some social process outside of the system where you eventually approve a SIP, or you can do it explicitly where you directly vote or some representative democracy, some group of representatives directly votes."}, {"time": 13999, "text": "And then once you've decided it's there."}, {"time": 14001, "text": "The constitution is necessary because you need to know the decision threshold."}, {"time": 14004, "text": "Is it super majority or majority?"}, {"time": 14006, "text": "And also the voting process."}, {"time": 14009, "text": "Like a lot of policy experts believe that if Brexit was a multi stage vote, it would have never passed because people would have done the initial stage and all the horrors of Brexit would have been broadcast to society."}, {"time": 14019, "text": "And then there would have been some reluctance and buyer's remorse on it."}, {"time": 14022, "text": "And then the second round would have failed or something like that."}, {"time": 14025, "text": "But because it was just a singular event, it's like they passed it now, British are all passive aggressive about it with no sign."}, {"time": 14032, "text": "Very well, we shall remove from Europe."}, {"time": 14035, "text": "And so your voting system has a lot to do with the outcome you get."}, {"time": 14039, "text": "The other thing is, what type of voting?"}, {"time": 14041, "text": "Is it just an absolute or is it a preference voting?"}, {"time": 14044, "text": "So you pick your favorite SIP, follow your second favorite SIP or something like that."}, {"time": 14048, "text": "So Condorcet or Borda are two examples of systems like that."}, {"time": 14051, "text": "Are you a fan of those, like the ranked choice vote?"}, {"time": 14053, "text": "I love them so much, especially for political diversity because this whole concept of throwing your vote away, if it's Alice or Bob,

preference voting, you never have that situation because you always pick your favorite and you get a lot more diversity on the ballot."}, {"time": 14078, "text": "But then you have arrows paradox and all these other things that come up."}, {"time": 14081, "text": "So there's no perfect system."}, {"time": 14084, "text": "And really you have to be comfortable with governance in a game of inches."},

interactions."}, {"time": 14097, "text": "And you have to be able to quantify those things."}, {"time": 14098, "text": "As long as you have an engine that allows you to grow in those directions, then you have a lot more people on for the ride when you actually start talking about these bigger and bigger things."}, {"time": 14107, "text": "The other challenge was that we had to decentralize development of the protocol and the brain of the protocol."}, {"time": 14112, "text": "We have fully decentralized the brain of the protocol."}, {"time": 14115, "text": "The peer review academic process means that there's now an academic incentive for graduate students, postdocs, and professors to spend enormous amounts of time writing papers in our ecosystem because they want tenure."},

sometime in the next few years to make sure there's at least three independent clients, so three completely independent dev teams and code bases, and also to get a separation of the commercial clients

infinite amount of memory, and an infinite clock speed, then they're universal, but that cannot exist."}, {"time": 391, "text": "So they're not universal in practice."}, {"time": 393, "text": "And they actually are, in practice, a very particular sort of machine within the constraints, within the conservation principles of any reality that's worth being in, probably."}, {"time": 406, "text": "And so I think universality of a particular model is probably a deceptive way to think, even though at some sort of limit, of course something like that's gotta be true at some sort of high enough limit, but it's just not accessible to us, so what's the point?"}, {"time": 430, "text": "Well, to me, the question of whether we're living inside a computer or a simulation is interesting in the following way."}, {"time": 438, "text": "There's a technical question that's here."}, {"time": 440, "text": "How difficult is it to build a machine, not that simulates the universe, but that makes it sufficiently realistic that we wouldn't know the difference, or better yet, sufficiently realistic that we would kinda know the difference, but we would prefer to stay in the virtual world anyway?"}, {"time": 461, "text": "I wanna give you a few different answers."}, {"time": 462, "text": "I wanna give you the one that I think has the most practical importance to human beings right now, which is that there's a kind of an assertion sort of built into the way the questions usually asked that I think is false, which is a suggestion that people have a fixed level of ability to perceive reality in a given way."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And actually, people are always learning, evolving, forming themselves."}, {"time": 489, "text": "We're fluid, too."}, {"time": 490, "text": "We're also

instance, there was a peer review paper that showed that an early wire recorder playing back an opera singer behind a curtain was indistinguishable from a real opera singer."}, {"time": 511, "text": "And so now, of course, to us, it would not only be distinguishable, but it would be very blatant because the recording would be horrible."}, {"time": 517, "text": "But to the people at the time, without the experience of it, it seemed plausible."}, {"time": 523, "text": "There was an early demonstration of extremely crude video teleconferencing between New York and DC in the 30s, I think so, that people viewed as being absolutely realistic and indistinguishable, which to us would be horrible."}, {"time": 539, "text": "And there are many other examples."}, {"time": 541, "text": "Another one, one of my favorite ones, is in the Civil War era, there were itinerant photographers who collected photographs of people who just looked kind of like a few archetypes."}, {"time": 550, "text":

great examples of how in the early days of different media, we perceived the media as being really great, but then we evolved through the experience of the media."}, {"time": 577, "text": "This gets back to what I was saying."}, {"time": 578, "text": "Maybe the greatest gift of photography is that we can see the flaws in a photograph and appreciate reality more."}, {"time": 584, "text": "Maybe the greatest gift of audio recording is that we can distinguish that opera singer now from that recording of the opera singer on the horrible wire recorder."}, {"time": 593, "text": "So we shouldn't

important question."}, {"time": 618, "text": "That's profound, yeah."}, {"time": 620, "text": "But can you, the second question, which you're now making me realize is way different."}, {"time": 626,

else, is obviously motivated in a sense by a hope that whatever that is will survive death and continue."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "And that's a very core aspect of a lot of the world religions, not

it."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "In a sense, we're motivated in the same way with a remarkably similar chain of arguments, which is no, the brain's a computer and I'm gonna figure it out in my lifetime

this huge deconstruction."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Should I do it?"}, {"time": 1279, "text": "Yes, what's the chasm?"}, {"time": 1281, "text": "Let us travel across this vast chasm."}, {"time":

idea at all, but he certainly populated AI culture with most of its tropes, I would say, because a lot of the people will say, oh, did you hear this new idea about AI?"}, {"time": 1318, "text": "And I'm like, yeah, I heard it in 1978."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Sure, yeah, I remember that."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "So Marvin was really the person."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And Marvin and I used to argue all the time about this stuff because I always rejected it."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "And of all of his, of all of his, I wasn't formally his student, but I worked for him as a researcher,

would have loved to hear that conversation."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "It was fun."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Did you ever converse to a place?"}, {"time": 1357, "text": "So the very last time I saw

"text": "He's such an amazing person for that."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "So it's hard to summarize this because it's decades of stuff."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "The first thing to say is that nobody can claim absolute knowledge about whether somebody or something else is conscious or not."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "This is all a matter of faith."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "And in fact, I think the

conscious."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And then I used to frame this as a thing called the circle of empathy in my old papers."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And then it turned into a thing for the animal

times."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "People say, but aren't you afraid if you exclude AI, you'd be cruel to some consciousness?"}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And then I would say, well, if you include AI,

humans and cameras, et cetera."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "See, I think that's why we've talked offline about this."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "That's why I love robots, is I think there's certain

I know, very imaginatively named."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Part of that is literally every name ever is now taken, registered and all that stuff."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "So we're a holding company."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "What's a holding company?"}, {"time": 2058, "text": "So instead of being a fund that has money flowing in and out of it, and there's what's called a vintage year, I

holding company is more permanent capital."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "So the idea was, behind Tolko, was to buy almost always whole companies or majority stakes with great management teams in spaces

be able to bring that wherewithal to that company."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "So to provide them with the right capital and to provide them with access to technology, that would be hard to individually recruit for that company."}, {"time": 2117, "text": "So I would say that the thesis was to look for industries that were large enough, that hadn't traditionally had access to that type of technology or innovation, and to try to look for companies that not only looked that part, but had management teams that embraced this and wanted to take that kind of journey."}, {"time": 2141,

successful company or person or whatever it might be."}, {"time": 2201, "text": "And the second thing is that especially if you're a public company and you're being weighed and measured every quarter,

and then ask them to go break stuff, that's hard, I think."}, {"time": 2261, "text": "So you're saying like, so the talker approach to this, the private investment is the best way or perhaps the only way to enable this kind of long term innovation, investment, taking big risks, investing in innovation."}, {"time": 2277, "text": "Well, look, we certainly are not, by any means, the only one doing it."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "I'm just saying that when you think about big companies, more successful, you know, that are in old line businesses, and I hear people sort of talk about, well, why can't they just pivot?"}, {"time": 2295, "text": "They recognize they need to be in the technology business because it's hard, it's hard to steer a ship and turn it that big, and especially if it's not part of your DNA at that company."}, {"time": 2308, "text": "So, you know, I just think that what we tried to do is to enable management teams that know where they wanna go and to be patient with

ecosystem."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "So that's one of the things I love about America is the ability, and that really is, I think, in the American DNA, to create things and invent things, and I just,

way that we do that is provide capital, provide training."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "To me, this is also fertile ground for good, sustainable, high paying jobs."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And we have to make it economically feasible to do that, again, here in this country."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "And not to say to companies that, again, are being weighed and measured quarter by quarter."},

really have to consider."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "And so if you really consider that cost, it makes a lot of sense to invest especially long term in building up manufacturing in a way where like you're making most of the stuff in one place."}, {"time": 2620, "text": "Sort of bringing it all, not all, but as much in as possible."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "And building it almost like from scratch here in the United States."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "I mean, what I guess your thought is with innovation, it's possible to sort of revolutionize the way we do manufacturing."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "So reduce the amount of supply chain stuff and like build stuff from scratch."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "Like do high tech manufacturing."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "So like optimize all aspects of the manufacturing and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "Yeah, and I think where technology is the most efficient is the human machine interface, right?"}, {"time": 2663,

good experience in life?"}, {"time": 2758, "text": "So I think, and then when you think about everything from military applications, you know, rescue, we're already seeing a bunch of those things."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "And then just lastly, when you talk about that human interaction with robots, when you start to have the combination, so you have some level of intelligence and interaction, I mean, that's why we always love the droids in Star Wars, right?"}, {"time": 2786, "text": "I mean, it's exciting, it captures the imagination."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "And I think, look, many, many hours have been spent on debating artificial intelligence and the ramifications, if things go sideways and so forth."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "And I think those are all, you know, those are appropriate conversations to be having."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "AI is happening."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "I think it's actually happening slower than most people realize, because there are tasks that humans do every minute of every day, standing up without losing your sense of balance."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "I mean, these are really hard things, but I think there's enough investment, both in private industry as well as nation states now on artificial intelligence that it is coming."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "So both in the software space, in the digital space and in the physical space."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "So we talk about manufacturing, so industrial robotics is very true that even in the factory, even the tasks that you think are pretty basic, you know, the amount of small intuitive decisions that humans make is quite incredible."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "So we have to be kind of explicit about saying which tasks are actually really hard and humans are just really good at them."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "And so on the flip side in the digital space with social networks, we recommend our systems with all kinds of like personal assistance in terms of voice based AI systems, all of that."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "There's opportunities there to find niches where AI can really have a transformative effect."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "I think one of the places that really haven't, this is where like you're worried to say stupid things, but I believe this very much that when we have AI systems in the home currently, you have somebody like Alexa and Google Home and so on, they're kind of very basic servants."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "They tell you about the weather, they can play some music, they can turn the lights on and off, all the kind of like smart home stuff."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "I think there's a lot of value in systems that form relationships with us in the way that pets do, dogs and cats."}, {"time": 2938, "text": "I don't know, just for people who have cats, cats don't care about you."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "They really don't, they don't form any kind of relationship."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "I don't know why you have relationship with them."}, {"time": 2948, "text": "Anyway, sorry, I threw out some shade."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "I'm just kidding by the way."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "That's a basic kind of connection you have with another living being."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "Then there's also just friends."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "You have different levels of friends, acquaintances, you have lifelong friends, all that."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "That friendship you have, I really believe that there is some aspect of the human experience that is deeply enriched by interacting with other beings."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "And for systems, computing systems, artificial intelligence systems in our world, to have the capability to engage in some of that, I think is not just an opportunity to help people grow, become better people, but it's also just a good business opportunity too."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "And that hasn't really been explored enough."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "So that to me is really, that's a whole exciting space that I think will enable better industrial robotics."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "It will empower a better Facebook or a better social network, a competitor to Facebook that overthrows Facebook."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "So it'll create better technologies that currently don't have that human robot interaction touch."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "So I don't know, that's super exciting to me, but that has to deal with the mess of human nature."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "The reason that most robotics people and AI people stay away from humans, they stay away from the human robot interaction problem, is because humans are complicated."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "They're messy, they're hard to control, they're hard to predict stuff about, they're hard to make sense of or like test repeatedly because one human can be drastically different from another human."}, {"time": 3062, "text": "And so to deal with that as a robotics problem is super hard."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "And so one of the questions is which problems can you remove the human from consideration when you're trying to solve the problem?"}, {"time": 3075, "text": "So like Elon Musk is an example of somebody who believes autonomous driving, we can remove the human from consideration, we can solve autonomous driving as a robotics problem."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "It's stay in the lane."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "When there's a red light, you stop at a red light."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "If there is humans in the picture like pedestrians,

smaller probability that might stop or turn."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "Just do some basic models about them and you'll be able to do just fine."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "So I tend to believe that

to play, do that kind of dance."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "In Tolko, there's the labs."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "So there's a data science component, there's an AI component."}, {"time": 3152,

things come together, you get the result that we did at Figs."}, {"time": 3204, "text": "We have a company called Acashure, which it's AI lab and base is down here in Austin, Texas."}, {"time": 3211,

driven."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "And in that case, you basically put the team inside the company, right?"}, {"time": 3232, "text": "Because it's a massive company and we've gone into all kinds of things."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "So it just depends on the different situations."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "But the biggest thing was just to make sure whatever the company needed, they had access to the talent."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "Sometimes we'd build it, sometimes we'd help recruit for it."}, {"time": 3255, "text": "You know how in technology, it's whatever works, right?"}, {"time": 3258, "text": "There's no one way to do things."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "Well, Acashure is really interesting as an example."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "So insurance is a fascinating space."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "It seems like very ripe still for disruption across the board."}, {"time": 3272, "text": "So how do you, it seems like a lot of the disruption has to do with almost the first dump step of we've been using mostly paper."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "It's not digitized."}, {"time": 3287, "text": "You have to basically create a infrastructure and a framework where everybody is

words are prolonged, groups, and violent."}, {"time": 328, "text": "Can you maybe linger on each of those words?"}, {"time": 331, "text": "What does prolonged mean?"}, {"time": 333, "text": "Where's the line between short and long?"}, {"time": 336, "text": "What does groups mean, and what does violent mean?"}, {"time": 339, "text": "So let me, you know, I have a friend who, someone who's become a friend through the process of my work and writing this book also, who was 20, 30 years ago, was a gang leader in Chicago."}, {"time": 353, "text": "So this guy named Napoleon English, or NAP."}, {"time": 355, "text": "And I remember one time he was saying, well you know, when I was young I used to, I was 15, 16, and he'd go to the neighboring gang's territory, he says I'd go gang banging, and I said, well, I didn't know what that meant."}, {"time": 366, "text": "I said, what does that mean?"}, {"time": 367, "text": "And he said, oh, that just meant I'd shoot him up."}, {"time": 369, "text": "Like I'd shoot at buildings, I might shoot at people."}, {"time": 373, "text": "I wasn't trying to kill, he wasn't trying to kill them."}, {"time": 375, "text": "He was just trying to sort of send a signal that he was a tough guy, and he was fearless, and he was someone who they should be careful with."}, {"time": 384, "text": "And so I didn't want to call that war, right?"}, {"time": 387, "text": "That was, that's something different."}, {"time": 390, "text": "That was, it was short, it was kind of sporadic, and he wasn't, and he was basically trying to send them information."}, {"time": 397, "text": "And this is what countries do all the time, right?"}, {"time": 400, "text": "We have military parades, and we might have border skirmishes, and I wanted to sort of, so what's short is a three month border skirmish, a war, I mean, I don't try to get into those things."}, {"time": 415, "text": "I don't want to, but I want to point out that like, these long, grueling months and years of violence are like the problem and the puzzle."}, {"time": 424, "text": "And I just, I didn't want to spend a lot of time talking about the international version of gang banging."}, {"time": 432, "text": "It's a different phenomenon."}, {"time": 433, "text": "So what is it about Napoleon that doesn't nap, let's call him, not to add confusion, that doesn't qualify for war?"}, {"time": 441, "text": "Is it the individual aspect?"}, {"time": 443, "text": "Is it that violence is not the thing that is sought, but the communication of information is what is sought?"}, {"time": 455, "text": "Or is it the shortness of it?"}, {"time": 457, "text": "Is it all of those combined?"}, {"time": 459, "text": "It's a little bit, I mean, he was the head of a group, or he's becoming the head of a group at that point."}, {"time": 465, "text": "And that group eventually did go to war with those neighboring gangs, which is to say it was just long, drawn out conflict over months and months and months."}, {"time": 473, "text": "But I think one of the big insights from my fields is that you're constantly negotiating over something, right?"}, {"time": 482, "text": "Whether you're officially negotiating or you're all posturing, you're bargaining over something and you should be able to figure out a way to split that pie."}, {"time": 492, "text": "And you could use violence."}, {"time": 494, "text": "But violence is, everybody's miserable."}, {"time": 496, "text": "Like if you're nap, like if you start a war, one, there's lots of risks."}, {"time": 499, "text": "You could get killed, that's not good."}, {"time": 502, "text": "You could kill somebody else and go to jail, which is what happened to him, that's not good."}, {"time": 506, "text": "Your soldiers get killed, no one's buying your drugs in the middle of a gunfight, so it interrupts your business."}, {"time": 511, "text": "And so on and on, it's really miserable."}, {"time": 512, "text": "This is what we're seeing right now, as we're recording the Russian invasion of Ukraine is now at the fourth or fifth week."}, {"time": 520, "text": "Everybody's, if it didn't dawn on them before, it's dawned on them now just how brutal and costly this is."}, {"time": 527, "text": "As you describe for everybody."}, {"time": 529, "text": "So everybody is losing in this war."}, {"time": 531, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's maybe the insight."}, {"time": 533, "text": "Everybody loses something from war."}, {"time": 536, "text": "And there was usually, not always, but the point is there was usually a way to get what you wanted or be better off without having to fight over it."}, {"time": 545, "text": "So there's this, fighting is just politics by other means."}, {"time": 550, "text": "And it's just inefficient, costly, brutal, devastating means."}, {"time": 554, "text": "And so that's like the deep insight."}, {"time": 556, "text": "And so I kind of wanted to say, so I guess like what's not war?"}, {"time": 560, "text": "I mean, I don't try to belabor the definitions because there's reams and reams of political science papers written on like what's a war, what's not a war."}, {"time": 570, "text": "People disagree."}, {"time": 574, "text": "I just wanted to say, war is the thing that we shouldn't be doing."}, {"time": 578, "text": "Or war is the violence that doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 581, "text": "There's a whole bunch of other violence, including gang banging and skirmishes and things that might make sense, precisely because they're cheap ways of communicating or they're not particularly costly."}, {"time": 593, "text": "War is the thing that's just so costly we should be trying to avoid is maybe like the meta way I think about it."}, {"time": 600, "text": "Nevertheless, definitions are interesting."}, {"time": 602, "text": "So outside of the academic bickering, every time you try to define something, I'm a big fan of it, the process illuminates."}, {"time": 613, "text": "So the destination doesn't matter because the moment you arrive at the definition, you lose the power."}, {"time": 620, "text": "Yeah, one of the interesting thing, I mean, so people, if you wanna do, some of what I do is just quantitative analysis of conflict."}, {"time": 626, "text": "And if you wanna do that, if you wanna sort of run statistics on war, then you have to code it all up."}, {"time": 632, "text": "And then lots of people have done that."}, {"time": 634, "text": "There's four or five major data sets where people or teams of people have over time said, we're gonna code years of war between these groups or within a country."}, {"time": 644, "text": "And what's interesting is how difficult, these data sets don't often agree."}, {"time": 648, "text": "You have to make all of these, the decision gets really complicated."}, {"time": 651, "text": "Like when does the war begin, right?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "Does it begin when a certain number of people have been killed?"}, {"time": 658, "text": "Did it begin, what if there's like lots of skirmishing and sort of little terror attacks or a couple bombs lobbed and then eventually turns into war?"}, {"time": 668, "text": "Do we backdate it to like when the first act of violence started?"}, {"time": 673, "text": "And then what do we do with all the times when there was like that low scale, low intensity violence or bombs lobbed and do we call those wars or maybe only if they eventually get worse?"}, {"time": 684, "text": "Like, so you get, it actually is really tricky."}, {"time": 686, "text": "And the defensive and the offensive aspect."}, {"time": 688, "text": "So everybody, Hitler in World War II, it seems like he never attacked anybody."}, {"time": 694, "text": "He's always defending against the unjust attack of everybody else as he's taken over the world."}, {"time": 701, "text": "So that's like information propaganda that every side is trying to communicate to the world."}, {"time": 708, "text": "So you can't listen to necessarily information like self report data."}, {"time": 712, "text": "You have to kind of look past that somehow."}, {"time": 715, "text": "Maybe look, especially in the modern world as much as possible at the data."}, {"time": 718, "text": "How many bombs dropped?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "How many people killed?"}, {"time": 723, "text": "How the number of estimates of the number of troops moved from one location to another and that kind of thing."}, {"time": 729, "text": "And the other interesting thing is there's quantitative analysis of war."}, {"time": 733, "text": "So for example, I was looking at just war index or people trying to measure, trying to put a number on what wars are seen as just and not."}, {"time": 744, "text": "Oh really, I've never seen that."}, {"time": 746, "text": "It's, there's numbers behind it."}, {"time": 750, "text": "So it's great because again, as you do an extensive quantification of justice, you start to think what actually contributes to our thought that for example, World War II is a just war and other wars are not."}, {"time": 769, "text": "A lot of it is about intent and some of the other factors like that you look at which is prolonged, the degree of violence that is necessary versus not necessary given the greater good, some measure of the greater good of people, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 786, "text": "Then there's reasons for war, you know, looking to free people or to stop a genocide versus conquering land, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 797, "text": "And people try to put a number behind it."}, {"time": 799, "text": "And a lot of."}, {"time": 800, "text": "It's based on, I mean, what I'm trying to imagine is, I mean, suppose I wake up and, or whatever, suppose I think my God tells me to do something or my God thinks that, or my moral sense thinks that something that another group is doing is repugnant."}, {"time": 816, "text": "I'm curious, are they evaluating the validity of that claim or just the idea that like, well, you said it was repugnant, you deeply believe that, therefore it's just?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "I think, and that could be corrected on a lot of this, but I think this is always looking at wars after they happened and trying to take a global perspective from all sort of a general survey of how people perceive."}, {"time": 840, "text": "So you're not weighing disproportionately the opinions of the people who waged the war."}, {"time": 845, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I kind of ended up dodging that because, I mean, one is to just point out that wars, actually most wars aren't necessary."}, {"time": 856, "text": "And so in the sense that there's another way to get what you wanted."}, {"time": 862, "text": "And so on one level, there's no just war."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Now that's not true because take an example like the US invasion of Afghanistan."}, {"time": 870, "text": "The United States has been attacked."}, {"time": 872, "text": "There's a culpable agent, reliable evidence that this is Al Qaeda."}, {"time": 879, "text": "They're being sheltered in Afghanistan by the Taliban."}, {"time": 883, "text": "And then the Taliban, this is a bit murky."}, {"time": 886, "text": "It seems that there was an attempt to say hand him over or else and they said, no way."}, {"time": 893, "text": "Now you can make an argument that invading and attacking is strategically the right thing to do in terms of sending signals to your future enemies or if you think it's important to bring someone to justice, in this case, Al Qaeda, then maybe that's just war or that's a just invasion."}, {"time": 911, "text": "But it hinges on the fact that the other side just didn't do the seemingly sensible thing, which is say, okay, we'll give them up."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And so it was completely avoidable in one sense."}, {"time": 926, "text": "But if you believe, and I think it's probably true, if you believe that for their own ideological and other reasons, you know, Mullah Omar in particular and Taliban in general decided we're not going to do this, then now you're not left with very many good choices."}, {"time": 945, "text": "And now, you know, I didn't wanna talk about is that a just war or is that, what's justice or not?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "I just wanted to point out that like one side's intransigence, if that's indeed what happened, one side's intransigence sort of maybe compels you to basically eliminates all of the reasonable bargains that you could be satisfied with and now you're left with really no other strategic option but to invade."}, {"time": 968, "text": "I think that's a slight oversimplification, but I think that's like one way to describe what happened."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So your book is fascinating and your perspective on this is fascinating."}, {"time": 978, "text": "I'll try to sort of play devil's advocate at times to try to get a clarity."}, {"time": 982, "text": "But the thesis is that war is costly, usually costly for everybody."}, {"time": 990, "text": "So that's what you mean when you say nobody wants war because you're going to, from a game theoretic perspective, nobody wins."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "And so war is essentially a breakdown of reason, a breakdown of negotiation, of healthy communication or healthy operation of the world, some kind of breakdown."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "You list all kinds of ways in which it breaks down."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "But there's also human beings in this mix."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "And there is ideas of justice."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "So for example, I don't want to, my memory doesn't serve me well on which wars were seen as justice, very, very few in the 20th century of the many that have been there."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "The wars that were seen as just, first of all, the most just war seen is World War II by far."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "It's actually the only one that goes above a threshold that's seen as just, everything that's seen as unjust."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "It's less, it's like degrees of unjustness."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And I think the ones that are seen as more just are the ones that are fast, that you have a very specific purpose, you communicate that purpose honestly with the global community, and you strike hard, fast, and you pull out to do sort of, it's like rescue missions."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "It's almost like policing work."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "If there's somebody suffering, you go in and stop that suffering directly, and that's it."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "I think World War II is seen in that way, that there's an obvious aggressor that is causing a lot of suffering in the world and looking to expand the scale of that suffering."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And so you strike, I mean, given the scale, you strike as hard and as fast as possible to stop the expansion of the suffering."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "So that's kind of how they see."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "I don't know if you can kind of look with this framework that you've presented and look at Hitler and think, well, it's not in his interest to attack Czechoslovakia, Poland, Britain, France, Russia, the Soviet Union, America, the United States of America, same with Japan."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "Is it in their long term interest?"}, {"time": 1144, "text": "So for me, who cares about alleviating human suffering in the world, yes, it's not."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "It seems like almost no war is just."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "But it also seems somehow deeply human to fight."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "And I think your book makes the case, no, it's not."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "Can you try to get at that?"}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Because it seems that war, there is some, that drama of war seems to beat in all human hearts."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Like it's in there somewhere."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "Maybe it's, maybe that's like a relic of the past and we need to get rid of it."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "It's deeply irrational."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "Okay, so obviously we go to war and obviously there's a lot of violence."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And so we have to explain something and some of that's going to be aspects of our humanness."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "So I guess what I wanted us to sort of start with, I think it was just useful to sort of start and point out, actually, there's really, really, really, really strong incentives not to go to war because it's gonna be really costly."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "And so all of these other human or strategic things, all these things, the circumstantial things that will eventually lead us to go to war have to be pretty powerful before we go there."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And most of the time."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "And that's why you also describe very importantly that war throughout human history is actually rare."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "We usually avoid it."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "You know, most people don't know about the US invasion of Haiti in 1994."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "I mean, a lot of people know about it, but people just don't pay attention to it."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "We don't, we're gonna, you know, the history books and school kids are gonna learn about the invasion of Afghanistan for decades and decades, and nobody's going to put this one in the history books."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And it's because it didn't actually happen because before the troops could land, the person who'd taken power in a coup basically said fine."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "There's this famous story where Colin Powell goes to Haiti, to this new dictator who's refused to let a Democratic president take power."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "And tries to convince him to step down or else."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "And he says, no, no, no."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "And then he shows him a video, and it's basically troop planes and all these things taking off."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "And he's like, this is not live."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "This is two hours ago."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "So it's a, and basically he basically gives up right there."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "So that was."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "That's a powerful move."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "I think Powell might've been one of his teachers in like a US military college, because a lot of these military dictators trained at some point."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "So they had some, there was some personal relationships at least between people in the US government and this guy that they were trying to use."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "The point is, and that's like what should have happened."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "That makes sense, right?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "Like, yeah, maybe I could mount an insurgency and yeah, I'm not gonna bear a lot of the cost of war cause I'm the dictator."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "And maybe he's human and he just wants to fight or gets angry or it's just in his mind, whatever he's doing."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "But at the end of the day, it's like, this does not make sense."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "And that's what happens most of the time, but we don't write so many books about it."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "And now some political scientists go and they count up all of the nations that could fight cause they have some dispute and they're right next to one another, or they look at the ethnic groups that could fight with one another cause there's some tension and they're right next to one another."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "And then whatever, some number like 999 out of 1000 don't fight because they just find some other way."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "They don't like each other, but they just loathe in peace because that's the sensible thing to do."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "And that's what we all do, we loathe in peace."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "And we loathed the Soviet Union in relative peace for decades and India loathes Pakistan in peace."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "I mean, two weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, again, it was in the newspapers, but most people didn't, I think, take note."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "India accidentally launched a cruise missile at Pakistan and common suit."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "So they were like, yeah, this is, we do not want to go to war."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "This will be bad."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "We'll be angry, but we'll accept your explanation that this was an accident."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "And so these things find to the radar."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And so we overestimate, I think, how likely it is the sides are gonna fight."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "But then of course, things do happen."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "Like Russia did invade the Ukraine and didn't find some negotiated deal."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "And so then the book is sort of about half the book is just sort of laying out, actually like there's just different ways this breaks down."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And some of them are human."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Some of them are this, I actually don't think war beats in our heart."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "It does a little bit, but we're actually very cooperative."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "As a species, we're deeply, deeply cooperative."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "We're really, really good."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "So the thing we're not, we're okay at violence and we're okay getting angry and vengeance and we have principles that will sometimes lead us, but we're actually really, really, really good at cooperation."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "And so that's, again, I'm not trying to write some big optimistic book where everything's gonna be great and we're all happy and we don't really fight."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "It's more just to say, let's start, let's be like a doctor."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "As a doctor, we're gonna focus on the sick, right?"}, {"time": 1450, "text": "I'm gonna try, I know there's sick people, but I'm gonna recognize that the normal state is health and that most people are healthy."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And that's gonna make me a better doctor."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And that's, I'm kind of saying the same thing."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "Let's be better doctors of politics in the world by recognizing that like normal state is health."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "And then we're gonna identify like what are the diseases that are causing this warfare."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So yeah, the natural state of the human body with the immune system and all the different parts wants to be healthy and is really damn good at being healthy, but sometimes it breaks down."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "Let's understand how it breaks down."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "So what are the five ways that you list that are the roots of war?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, they're kind of like buckets."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "They're sort of things that rhyme, right?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "In the interview, because it's not all the same."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "There's like lots of reasons to go to war."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "There's this great line, there's a reason for every war and a war for every reason."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And it's kind of overwhelming, right?"}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And it's overwhelming for a lot of people."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "It was overwhelming for me for a lot of time."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And I think one of the gifts of social science is actually people have started to organize this for us."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "And I just tried to organize it like a tiny bit better."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "Buckets that rhyme."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "Buckets with some economics."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "Yeah, the terrible metaphor, right?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "And bad at metaphors."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So the idea was that like that basic, like something overrides these incentives."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "And I guess I was saying there's five ways that they get overrided."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "And three are, I'd call strategic."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Like they're kind of logical."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "There's circumstances that, and this is, they're sort of, where strategic is, strategy is like game theory."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "You could use those two things interchangeably."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "But game theory is sort of making it sound more complicated, I think, than it is."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "It's basically saying that there's times when this is like the optimal choice because of circumstances."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "And one of them is when the people who are deciding don't bear those costs."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "So that's, or maybe even have a private incentive that's gonna, that's, if they don't, if they're ignoring the cost, then maybe the costs of war are not so material."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "That's a contributing factor."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "Another is just, there's uncertainty, and we could talk about that, but there's just the absence of information means that it actually, there's circumstances where it's your best choice to attack."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "There's this thing that political economists call commitment problems, which are basically saying there's some big power shift that you can avoid by attacking now."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So it's like a dynamic incentive."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "It's sort of saying, well, in order to keep something from happening in the future, I can attack now."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And because of the structure of incentives, it actually makes sense for me, even though war is, in theory, really costly, or it is really costly nonetheless."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And then there's these sort of human things."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "One's a little bit like just war."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "One sort of thing, there's like ideologies or principles or things we value that weigh against those costs, like exterminating the heretical idea or standing up for a principle might be so valuable to me that I'm willing to use violence, even if it's costly."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "And there's nothing irrational about that."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "And then the fifth bucket is all of the irrationalities, all the passions and all of the most importantly, I think, like misperceptions, the way we get, like we basically make wrong calculations about whether or not war is the right decision."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "We misunderstand or misjudge our enemy or misjudge ourselves."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So if you put all those things into buckets, how much can it be modeled in a simple game theoretic way and how much of it is a giant human mess?"}, {"time": 1652, "text": "So four of those five are really, on some level, easy to think strategically and model in a simple way in the sense that any of us can do it."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "We do this all the time."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "Think of bargaining in a market for a carpet or something or whatever you bargained for, you're thinking a few steps ahead about what your opponent's going to do."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "And you stake out a high price, like a low price, and the seller stakes out a high price."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "And you might both say, oh, I refuse to, I could never accept that."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "And there's all this sort of cheap talk, but you kind of understand where you're going and it's efficient to like find a deal and buy the market, buy the carpet eventually."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "So we all understand this game theory and the strategy, I think intuitively."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "Or maybe even a closer example is like, suppose, I don't know, you have a tenant you need to evict or any normal kind of legal, it's not yet a legal dispute, right?"}, {"time": 1713, "text": "Like we just have a dispute with a neighbor or somebody else."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "Most of us don't end up going to court."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "Going to court is like the war option."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "That's the costly thing that we just ought to be able to avoid."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "We ought to be able to find something between ourselves that doesn't require this hiring lawyers and a long drawn out trial."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And most of the time we do, right?"}, {"time": 1735, "text": "And so we all understand that incentive."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And then for those five buckets, so everything except all the irrational and the misperceptions are really easy to model."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "Then from a technical standpoint, it's actually pretty tricky to model the misperceptions."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And I'm not a game theorist."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And so I'm more channeling my colleagues to do this and what I know, but it's not rocket science."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "I mean, I think that's what I try to lay out in the book is like there's all these ideas out there that can actually help us just make sense of all these wars and just bring some order to the morass of reasons."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "Well, to push back a lot of things in one sentence."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So first of all, rocket science is actually pretty simple."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "I'll defer to you actually."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "Well, I think it's because unfortunately it's very like engineering, it's very well defined."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "The problem is well defined."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "The problem with humanity is it's actually complicated."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "So it is true it's not rocket science, but it is not true."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "It's easy because it's not rocket science."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "But the problem, the downside of game theory is not that it helps us make sense of the world."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "It projects a simple model of the world that brings us comfort in thinking we understand."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And sometimes that simplification is actually getting at the core first principles on understanding of something."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "And sometimes it fools us into thinking we understand."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So for example, I mean, mutually shared destruction is a very simple model and people argue all the time whether that's actually a good model or not, but there's empirical fact that we're still alive as a human civilization."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And also in the game theoretic sense, do we model individual leaders and their relationships?"}, {"time": 1847, "text": "Do we, the staff, the generals, or do we also have to model the culture, the people, the suffering of the people, the economic frustration or the anger or the distrust?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "Do you have to model all those things?"}, {"time": 1864, "text": "Do they come into play?"}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And sometimes, I mean, again, we could be romanticizing those things from a historical perspective, but when you look at history and you look at the way wars start, it sometimes feels like a little bit of a misunderstanding escalates, escalates, escalates, and just builds on top of itself and all of a sudden it's an all out war."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "It's the escalation with nobody hitting the brakes."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "So, I mean, you're absolutely right in the sense that it's totally possible to oversimplify these things and take the game theory too seriously."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "And some, and people who study those things and write those models and people like me who use them can sometimes make that mistake."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "I think that's not the mistake that most people make most often."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "And what's actually true is I think most people, we're actually really quick, whether it's the US invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq, we're really quick to blame that on the humanness and the culture."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "So we're really quick to say, oh, this was George W. Bush's either desire for revenge and vengeance or some private agenda or blood for oil."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "So we're really quick to blame it on these things."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "And then we're really, we tend to overlook the strategic incentives to attack, which I think were probably dominant."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "I think those things might've been true to a degree, but I don't think they were enough to ever bring those wars about."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Just like, I think people are very quick to sort of, in this current invasion to sort of talk about Putin's grand visions of being the next Catherine the Great or nationalist ideals and the mistakes and the miscalculations are really quick to sort of say, oh, that must be, and then kind of pause or not pause, but maybe even stop there and not see some of the strategic incentives."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And so, I guess we have to do both, but the strategic, I guess I would say like the war is just such a big problem."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "It's just so costly that the strategic incentives and the things that game theory has given us are like really important in understanding why there was so little room for negotiation and a bargain that things like a leader's mistakes start to matter or a leader's nationalist ideals or delusions or vengeance actually matters."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "Cause those do matter, but they only matter when the capacity to find a deal is so narrow because of the circumstances."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And so let's not, it's sort of like saying like an elderly person who dies of pneumonia, right?"}, {"time": 2032, "text": "Pneumonia killed them, obviously, but that's not the reason pneumonia was able to kill them."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "All of the fundamentals and the circumstances were like made them very fragile."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "And that's how I think all the strategic forces make that situation fragile."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "And then the miscalculations and all of these things you just said, which are so important are kind of like the pneumonia."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And let's sort of, let's pay attention to both."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "And you're saying that people don't disproportionately pay attention to the leaders."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "I mean, it wasn't, it took me a long time to learn to recognize them."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "And it takes many people, you know, it took and it took generations of social scientists years and years to figure some of this out and to sort of help people understand it and clarify concepts."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "So it's not, it's just not that easy."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "No, it's not hard."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "I think it's possible to, just as I was taught a lot of the stuff I write in the book in graduate school or from reading and it's possible to communicate and learn this stuff, but it's still really hard."},

street and he's talking on two cell phones at once for some reason and a mugger stops him and demands the phones."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "And it's sort of like dead pan way, Konstantin says, and because he was Ukrainian, he decided to fight."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "And I think that's a little bit like what happened."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "Most of us in that situation would hand over cell phones."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "And so in this situation, Putin's like the mugger and the Ukrainian people are being asked to hand over this thing and they're saying, no, we're not gonna hand this over."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "And the fact is most people do."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "Most people faced with a superpower or a tyrant or an autocrat or a murderous warlord who says, hand

2177, "text": "Empire is success of people saying, fine, we'll give up our some degree of freedom or sovereignty because you're too powerful."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "And the Ukrainian said, no way, this is just too precious."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And so I said, one of those buckets were that there's a set of values."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "There's sometimes there's something that we value that is so valuable to us and important."}, {"time": 2197, "text": "Sometimes it's terrible, sometimes it's the extermination of another people, but sometimes it's something noble like liberty

American Revolution."}, {"time": 2247, "text": "It was the ideological origins, this attachment, this idea of liberty."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "And so I start, now there's lots of other reasons I think why this happened, but I think for me, it starts with Ukrainians failing to make that sensible quote unquote rational deal that says we should relinquish some of our sovereignty because Russia is more powerful than we are."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "So there's a very clinical look at the war."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "Meaning there is a man and a country, Vladimir Putin, that makes a claim

to understand and we won't know this but which path minimizes human suffering in the long term?"}, {"time": 2389, "text": "Well, on the eve of the war, Ukraine was poorer in the per person terms than

degree."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "I mean, certainly because of oil and gas but also for a variety of other reasons and Putin's consolidated political control."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "And from a very cold blooded and calculated point of view, I think one way Putin and Russia could look at this is says, look, we were temporarily weak after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the rest in the West

regained some of our strength."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "We've consolidated political control, we've count our people, we have a stronger economy and we somehow got Germany and other European nations

enough to demand it."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And you've been taking advantage of the situation which is maybe a fair impartial analysis."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "And in the West, but more

that their power said they quote unquote deserve."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "Just like Americans said to the Britain, yeah, of course we ought to accept semi sovereignty but we refuse and we'd rather endure a bloody fight that we might lose than take this."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "And so you need some of these other five buckets, you need them to understand the situation, you need to sort of,

people are cowed and lots of people have appeased and lots of people hear that speech and think I would like to do that, but don't."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "And so, and my point is that sadly we live in a world where a lot of people get stepped on by tyrants and empire and whatnot and don't rise up."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "And so I think we could admire, especially when they stand up for these reasons."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "And I think we can admire Churchill for that reason."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "I think we could, that's why we admire the leaders of the American Revolution

the suffering."}, {"time": 3557, "text": "And so they were too quick to go to war."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "And so that's, I think that detachment of leaders, combined with, you mingle it with this,

conflicts as well."}, {"time": 3583, "text": "And that's a good illustration of why I think autocracy and unaccountable power is, I could make that story for all of the things, all five buckets,

of different stuff in there."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "And I'm just trying to say, like, let's be clear that just about the shared logic of these things is maybe just, you know, they're really dissimilar, but let's be clear about the shared logic."}, {"time": 3704, "text": "And if it were true that deep down, we were aggressive people who just liked violence and enjoyed the blood, or some percentage of us do, that would be there too."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "And so I just want to say that's, but you know, we're really quick to recognize those, right?"}, {"time": 3722, "text": "When

war?"}, {"time": 3758, "text": "So...

war."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "And so you still internalize that a little bit."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "If I had to say like, you know, in my three buckets or through my buckets so far, I sort of started with like Ukrainian intransigence, and then I jumped, and then I said the essentially, then you really have to understand Russian autocracy just to understand why they would ask something so cruel."}, {"time": 3809, "text": "But I mean, I think the uncertainty is really important here as well."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "Like if you think of it, like think of all of the things, the way this has played out, and just in some ways how many, in how many ways we've been surprised."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "We've been surprised by the unity and the coherence of the West and the sanctions."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "That's sort of what's happened is it was in the realm of possibility, but it was sort of like the best case scenario from the perspective of the West and the worst case scenario for the Russians."}, {"time": 3836, "text": "The second thing is just the pluckiness and the effectiveness and the intransigence and the nobility of this Ukrainian resistance."},

Russia, the best realization in some sense for in terms of revealed strength and resolve."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "And then the other thing that's been revealed is just how like the corruption and ineptitude and problems on the Russian military side."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "Again, within the realm of possibility, maybe people who really knew the Russian military are less surprised than the rest of us, but also one of the worst possible draws for Russia."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "And so Putin asking this terrible price and expecting Ukraine to roll over or the West to roll over at least to a degree was based on like a different set of, was based on just expecting something in the middle of the probability distribution and not one of all these different tale events."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And so the fact that the world's so uncertain and the fact that Putin can come with a different set of expectations than the Ukrainians and the West and all these players can just have a hard time agreeing on just what the facts are because we live in an uncertain world."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "Everyone's quick to say, oh, he miscalculated."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "Well, I'm not, I don't know if he miscalculated."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "I think he just, he got a really bad draw in terms of what the realized outcomes are here."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "And so, I mean, good for everybody else in some sense, except the fact that it's involving a lot of violence is the tragedy."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "Well, there's also economic pain, not just for the Russian people and the Ukrainian people, but the whole world."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "So it, you know, you could talk about things that we are surprised from an analysis perspective of small victories here or there, but I think it's universally true that everybody loses once again in this war."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "Right, and so the question is just like, when does it, you know, why did Russia choose to invade when Ukraine didn't give this up?"}, {"time": 3962, "text": "Well, Russia anticipated that it would be able to seize what it wanted, the available bargain that it deserved, quote unquote, based on its power in the world, it wasn't getting, and so it thought it could take that."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "And the uncertainty around that made it potentially more likely that he would choose to do this."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "But in particular, one of the other things that I think is probably less important in this context, but still plays a role, but less important than many wars, is the fact that it's really hard to resolve that uncertainty, right?"}, {"time": 3994, "text": "In theory, Ukraine should be able to say, look, this is exactly how resolved we are, we're super resolved, and your military is not as strong as you think it is."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "You mean before the conflict even begins?"}, {"time": 4007, "text": "Everybody should be like, you know what?"}, {"time": 4008, "text": "You lay on the table, here's my cards, here's your cards."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "Exactly, like that's, as a competitor in this, you can use that uncertainty to your advantage."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "I can try to convince you, I can bluff, right?"}, {"time": 4020, "text": "And so anyone who's ever played poker and bluffed or called a bluff, that's the inefficiency, that's the analogy in some ways to war."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "It's not the perfect analogy, but the uncertainty and the circumstance, you don't have to miscalculate."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "The fact that if you bluff and lose, it doesn't mean that you miscalculated."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "You made an optimal choice, given the uncertainty of the situation, to take a gamble."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "And that was a wiser thing for you to do than to not bluff and just to fold or to just not ping in that round."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "And so the uncertainty of the situation gives both sides incentives to bluff, gives neither side an incentive to try to reveal the truth."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "And then at some point, the other side says, you know what, you say you're resolved."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "You say you're gonna mount an insurgency."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "Every other, you know, people on my border has folded and you're gonna fold too, the minute the tanks roll in and the minute the Air Force comes in, I'm gambling that you're bluffing."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "And so that inherent uncertainty of the situation just causes a lot of short wars, actually, because it's this sort of bluff and call dynamic that goes on."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "And, you know, the thing that's worth thinking is we might end up at a place in a few months where the thing that Ukraine concedes is not so far from what Russia demanded in the first place."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "Russia's on it, I want a neutral, I mean, who knows how, it's not the ambitious thing the Russians wanted."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And that sadly is like the best case, that feels like the best case scenario right now, which is the war is just five months and not five years."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "Given the current situation."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "Because the suffering has already happened, and lost homes, people moving, having to see their home in rubble, and millions of people, refugees having to escape the country, and hate flourishes versus the common humanity as it does with war."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "And on top of all of that, if we talk from a geopolitical perspective, the warmongers all over the world are sort of drooling."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "They've now got narratives, and they got that whatever narratives, you can go shopping for the narratives."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "The United States has its narratives for whatever geopolitical thing it wants to do in that part of the world."}, {"time": 4250, "text":

way that I think they believed and was noble, but there's a lot of manufacturing and creation of these values and principles that is not noble, and that is exactly what Hitler did so well."}, {"time": 4330, "text": "The anti Semitism was present throughout the world, but the more subtle thing that I feel like may be more generally applicable is this kind of pacifism that I think people in the

fighting that, the general... Apathy."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "It's the apathy of rational calculus, like what are we going to gain if we fight back?"}, {"time": 4370, "text": "Hitler seems to be pretty reasonable."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "He's saying he's going to stop the bombing, that you're still going to maintain your sovereignty as the great people of Britain."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "Like why are we fighting again?"}, {"time": 4386, "text": "And that's the thing that's hard to break because you have to say, well, you have to speak the principle, you have to speak at some greater sort of long term vision of history."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "So like, yes, now it may seem like it's a way to avoid the fight, but you're actually just sort of putting shackles on yourself."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "You're destroying the very greatness of our people if we don't fight back."}, {"time": 4415, "text": "And to think about this with like the current case with Russia, I mean, some people look at Putin's speeches and papers he's written on Ukraine historically being a part of Russia and trying to deny the... basically create all these nationalist narratives and they think, well, Putin really believes, and he might, Putin really believes this and that's why he's invading."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "And that might also be true and that would contribute to... just make a peaceful bargain even harder to find."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "But I suspect what's at least a minimum true is Putin's trying to manufacture support for an invasion in the population through propaganda."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "And so he's doing on some level the same thing that Winston Churchill was doing in mechanical terms, which is to try to manipulate people's references."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "But

human thing is like there's moments in World War II where Hitler's propaganda, he began to believe his own propaganda."}, {"time": 4490, "text": "I think he probably always believed..."}, {"time": 4491, "text": "I think he was a sincere believer."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "Well no, no, no, but there's a lot of places where there was uncertainty and they decided to do propaganda and that propaganda resolved the uncertainty in his own mind."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "So for example, he believed until very late that America is a weakling, militarily and as an economic power and just the spirit of the people."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "And that was part of the propaganda they were producing and because of that propaganda when he became the head of the army, he was making military

thought, eh, whatever."}, {"time": 4537, "text": "They're easy."}, {"time": 4539, "text": "So I think that propaganda first, belief second."}, {"time": 4542, "text": "And I think as a human being, as

point."}, {"time": 4590, "text": "It's to say actually that like the fundamental problem that all autocrats have is an information problem because nobody wants to give them the right information."},

solution."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "All right, if that's the core problem."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "And so that's why, you know, in Medellin, you know, the oficina can do that."}, {"time": 7088,

deal made to a bunch of states that knew they were going to be weak in future because of economic and demographic trends, or guess they might be."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "And it said, listen, you

7158, "text": "It was part of the deal that meant that there actually would be a union."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "And so we do this all the time."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "So a constitution is a good example of how every country's constitution, especially a country who's writing a constitution after a war, that constitution and all of the other institutions they're building are an attempt to like provide commitment to groups who are worried about future shifts in power."}, {"time": 7182, "text": "And does that help with avoid civil war?"}, {"time": 7182, "text": "So could you speak to lessons you learned from civil wars, perhaps the American Civil War or any others?"}, {"time": 7192, "text": "So Lebanon, one of the ways Lebanon had tried for a long time to preserve the interests of minority groups, powerful minority groups who were powerful at the time and knew that the demographics were working against them, was to guarantee, you know, this ethnic religious group gets the presidency and this ethno religious group gets the prime ministership and this ethno."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "And a lot of countries will apportion seats in the parliament to ethno religious groups."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "And that's an attempt to like give a group that's temporarily powerful some assurances that when they're weak in the future that they'll still have a say, right?"}, {"time": 7240, "text": "Just like we apportioned seats in the Senate in a way that's not demographically representative but is like unequal, quote unquote, in a sense to help people be confident that there won't be a tyranny of the majority."}, {"time": 7251, "text": "And now that just happens to have been like a really unstable arrangement in Lebanon because eventually like the de facto power on the ground just gets so out of line with this really rigid system of the presidency goes to this ethno religious group and this prime ministership goes, that it didn't last, right?"}, {"time": 7269, "text": "But you can think of every post conflict agreement and every constitution is like a little bit of humans best effort to find an agreement that's going to protect the interests of a group that temporarily has an interest in violence in order to not be violent."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "And so there's a lot of ingenuity and it doesn't always work, right?"}, {"time": 7300, "text": "Which actually from a perspective of the group, threatening violence or actually doing violence is one way to make progress for your group."}, {"time": 7308, "text": "We're talking about groups bargaining over stuff, right?"}, {"time": 7308, "text": "We're talking about Russians versus Ukraine or Russians versus the West or maybe it's managing games versus one another."}, {"time": 7317, "text": "Like a lot of their bargaining power comes from their ability to burn the house down, right?"}, {"time": 7317, "text": "And so if I want to have more bargaining power, I can just arm a lot and I can threaten violence."}, {"time": 7328, "text": "And so the strategically wise thing to do, I mean, it's terrible, it's a terrible equilibrium for us to be forced into, but the strategically wise thing to do is to build up lots of arms to threaten to use them, to credibly threaten to use them."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "But then trust or hope that like your enemy is going to see reason and avoid this really terrible, inefficient thing, which is fighting."}, {"time": 7352, "text": "But the thing that's going on the whole time is both of you arming and spending like 20% of GDP or whatever on arms, that's pretty inefficient."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "That's the tragedy."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "We don't have war and that's good, but we have really limited abilities to like incentivize our enemies not to arm and to keep ourselves from arming."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "We'd love to agree to just like both disarm, but we can't."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "And so the mess is that we have to arm and then we have to threaten all the time."}, {"time": 7381, "text": "Yeah, so the threat of violence is costly nevertheless."}, {"time": 7381, "text": "You've actually pulled up that now disappeared a paper that said the big title called Civil War and your name is on it."}, {"time": 7395, "text": "Well, that was, I mean, when I was finishing graduate school and this was a paper with my advisor at

looking at like the late 20th century."}, {"time": 7435, "text": "I mean, I was trained as a what's called development economist, which is somebody who studies why some places are poor and why some countries are rich."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "And I, like a number of people around that time, stumbled into violence."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "I mean, people have been studying the wealth and

flourishing area of study in economics, but at the time it wasn't."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "And so there were people like me and Ted who were sort of part political scientists, because political scientists obviously had been studying this for a long time, who started bringing economic tools and expertise and partnerships with political scientists and adding to it."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "And so we wrote this."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "So after like people have been doing this for five or 10 years in our field, we wrote like a review article telling economists like what was going on."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "And so this was like a summary for economists."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "So the book in some ways is a lot in the same spirit of this article."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "This article, I mean, it's designed to be not written as like a boring laundry list of studies, which is what, that's the purpose this article was for."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "It was for graduate students and professors who wanted to think about what to work on and what we knew."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "This book is like now trying to like not just say what economists are doing, but sort of say what economists, political scientists, psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, like how do we bring some sense to this big project?"}, {"time": 7524, "text": "And policymakers, like what do we know?"}, {"time": 7524, "text": "And what do we know about building peace?"}, {"time": 7524, "text": "Because if you don't know what the reason for wars are, you're probably not going to design the

repression, it can be denying people the vote, it can be rattling sabers, all these things that are happening, right?"}, {"time": 7671, "text": "And it can be sporadic three week wars or sporadic, you

certainly no stable agreement, right?"}, {"time": 7690, "text": "So a stable agreement and amity and any ability to move on from this extreme hostility, we're not there yet and that's maybe very far away."}, {"time": 7690, "text": "But this is a good example of two rivals who most of the time have avoided really intense violence."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "So you talked about this, like most of

talk about why we fight, then the question we have to ask is like why, you know, like the Second Intifada, like that was the most violent episode."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "Like why did that happen and why did that last several years?"}, {"time": 7815, "text": "That would be like, we could analyze that and we could say, what was it about these periods of violence that led there to be prolonged

7852, "text": "And so like a lot of my time, I decided actually last year to teach a class where I'd take all these contemporary conflicts I wasn't working on the book and where I wasn't really an expert, whether it's India, Pakistan, China, Taiwan, Israel, Palestine, Mexican cartel state drug wars and a few others."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "And then teach a class on them with students and we'd work through it."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "We'd read the book and then we'd say, all right, none of us are experts."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "How do we make sense of these places?"}, {"time": 7881, "text": "And we focused in the Israel Palestine case of mostly trying to understand why it got so violent and spend a little bit of time on what the prospects are for something that's more

two ways."}, {"time": 8151, "text": "One is, remember when we were talking about this really simple strategic game where whether I'm Russia or Ukraine or whatever, any two rivals, I want more of the

a disincentive."}, {"time": 8204, "text": "And if we're socially entwined because we have great social relationships and linkages and family or we're intermarriage or whatever, all these things will

my own problem, but there seems to be a bigger cultural gap than there is with other superpowers throughout history where it's almost like this own world happening in China, its own world in the

gods of music production."}, {"time": 571, "text": "Like he's one of the people who first, you know, who like made music production, you know, made the production as important as the actual lyrics or the notes."}, {"time": 581, "text": "But the thing he does, which is interesting, I don't know if you can speak to that, but just hanging out with him, he seems to just sit there in silence, close his

you."}, {"time": 629, "text": "But I usually just like do stuff myself."}, {"time": 632, "text": "So you're the engineer, the producer and the artist."}, {"time": 638, "text": "Yeah, I guess I would say I'm in the era, like the post Rick Rubin era."}, {"time": 641, "text": "Like I come from the kind of like Skrillex school of thought, which is like where you are."}, {"time": 649, "text": "Yeah,

rhetoric of how we just discuss the creation of art."}, {"time": 893, "text": "We just sort of like don't consider the music producer because I think the music producer used to be more just simply recording things."}, {"time": 903, "text": "Yeah, that's interesting because when you think about movies, we talk about the actor and the actresses, but we also talk about the directors."}, {"time":

like weird bitterness and like agronus in art about authenticity."}, {"time": 967, "text": "But I had this kind of like weird realization recently where I started thinking that like art is sort of a decentralized collective thing."}, {"time": 980, "text": "Like art is kind of a conversation with all the artists that have ever lived before you."}, {"time": 988, "text": "You know, like it's like,

kinds of music, make it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist and have fun with all that."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "It was so liberating to let go."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "You know, I used to collect, you know, albums and CDs and so on, like horde albums."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "Like they matter."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "But the reality you could, you know, that was really liberating that I could let go of that."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "And letting go of the albums you're kind of collecting allows you to find new music, exploring new artists and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "But I know from a perspective of an artist that could be, like you mentioned, competition could be a kind of constraint because there's more and more and more artists on the platform."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "I think it's better that there's more artists."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "I mean, again, this might be propaganda because this is all from a conversation with Daniel Ek."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "So this could easily be propaganda."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "We're all a victim of somebody's propaganda."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So let's just accept this."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you know, at the, because I, you know, when I met him, I came in all furious about Spotify and like I grilled him super hard."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "So I've got his answers here."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "But he was saying like at the sort of peak of the CD industry, there was like 20,000 artists making millions and millions of dollars."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "Like there was just like a very tiny kind of 1%."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "And Spotify has kind of democratized the industry because now I think he said there's about a million artists making a good living from Spotify."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "And when I heard that, I was like, honestly, I would rather make less money and have just like a decent living and have more artists be able to have that, even though I like, I wish it could include everyone, but."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "Yeah, that's really hard to argue with."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "YouTube is the same."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "It's YouTube's mission."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "They want to basically have as many creators as possible and make a living, some kind of living."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "And that's so hard to argue with."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "But I think there's better ways to do it."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "My manager, I actually wish he was here."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "Like I would have brought him up."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "My manager is building an app that can manage you."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So it'll like help you organize your percentages and get your publishing and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "So you can take out all the middlemen so you can have a much bigger, it'll just like automate it."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "So you can get."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "So automate the manager?"}, {"time": 1284, "text": "Automate management, publishing, and legal, it can read, the app he's building can read your contract and like tell you about it."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "Because one of the issues with music right now, it's not that we're not getting paid enough, but it's that the art industry is filled with middlemen because artists are not good at business."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "And from the beginning, like Frank Sinatra, it's all mob stuff."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "Like it's the music industry is run by business people, not the artists and the artists really get very small cuts of like what they make."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And so I think part of the reason I'm a technocrat, which I mean, your fans are gonna be technocrats."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "So no one's, they're not gonna be mad at me about this, but like my fans hate it when I say this kind of thing or the general public."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "They don't like technocrats."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "Like when I watched Battle Angel Alita and they were like the Martian technocracy and I was like, yeah, Martian technocracy."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "And then they were like, and they're evil."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "And I was like, oh, okay."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "I was like, cause Martian technocracy sounds sick to me."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Yeah, so your intuition as technocrats would create some kind of beautiful world."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "It can remove some of the bureaucracy, some of the inefficiencies that make life not as great as it could be."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "Yeah, I think the issue isn't that there's not enough."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "Like the issue is that there's inefficiency and I'm really into this positive sum mindset, you know, the win, win mindset of like, instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps, how do we make the, or worrying about scarcity, like instead of a scarcity mindset, why don't we just increase the efficiency and, you know, in that way."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Expand the size of the pie."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "Let me ask you about experimentation."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "So you said, which is beautiful, being a musician is like having a conversation with all those that came before you."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "How much of creating music is like kind of having that conversation, trying to fit into the cultural trends and how much of it is like trying to, as much as possible, be an outsider and come up with something totally new."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "It's like when you're thinking, when you're experimenting, are you trying to be totally different, totally weird?"}, {"time": 1448, "text": "Are you trying to fit in?"}, {"time": 1452, "text": "Man, this is so hard because I feel like I'm kind of in the process of semi retiring from music, so this is like my old brain."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "Yeah, bring it from like the shelf, put it on the table for a couple minutes, we'll just poke it."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "I think it's a bit of both because I think forcing yourself to engage with new music is really great for neuroplasticity."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Like I think, you know, as people, part of the reason music is marketed at young people is because young people are very neuroplastic."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "So like if you're 16 to like 23 or whatever, it's gonna be really easy for you to love new music."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "And if you're older than that, it gets harder and harder and harder."}, {"time": 1493, "text": "And I think one of the beautiful things about being a musician is I just constantly force myself to listen to new music and I think it keeps my brain really plastic."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "And I think this is a really good exercise."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "I just think everyone should do this."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "You listen to new music and you hate it, I think you should just keep, force yourself to like, okay, well why do people like it?"}, {"time": 1509, "text": "And like, you know, make your brain form new neural pathways and be more open to change."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "That's really brilliant actually."}, {"time": 1518, "text": "Sorry to interrupt, but like that exercise is really amazing to sort of embrace change, embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "Because like that's one of the things, you fall in love with a certain band and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life and then you never understand the modern music."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "That's a really good exercise."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "Most of the streaming on Spotify is like classic rock and stuff."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "Like new music makes up a very small chunk of what is played on Spotify."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "And I think this is like not a good sign for us as a species."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "So it's a good measure of the species open mindedness to change is how often you listen to new music."}, {"time": 1561,

have no clue, you do have a song called Player of Games."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "Yes, oh yeah."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "So Iain Banks, Surface Detail is in my opinion the best future that I've ever read about or heard about in science fiction."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "Basically there's the relationship with super intelligence, like artificial super intelligence is just, it's like

think there's a fine balance of, I think we maybe also overvalue the idea that the old systems are always bad."}, {"time": 5891, "text": "And I think there are things that we are perfecting and we

6438, "text": "But you also don't know, like you're a fascinating mind to explore."}, {"time": 6443, "text": "So you don't realize as you're talking about stuff, the stuff you've taken for granted is

cool."}, {"time": 6467, "text": "So yeah, Dan Carlin retelling of history."}, {"time": 6470, "text": "By the way, his retelling of history is very, I think what's exciting is not the history, is his

like, you know, and it sort of made me feel like one of the things we could do with education is like find like the world's great, the teachers that like create passion for the topic because autodidactricism, I don't know how to say that properly, but like self teaching is like much faster than being lectured to."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "Like it's much more efficient to sort of like be able to teach yourself and then ask a teacher questions when you don't know what's up."}, {"time": 6544, "text": "But like, you know, that's why it's like in university and stuff, like you can learn so much more material so much faster because you're doing a lot of the learning on your own and you're going to the teachers for when you get stuck."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "But like these teachers that can inspire passion for a topic, I think that is one of the most invaluable skills in our whole species."}, {"time": 6563, "text": "Like, because if you can do that, then you, it's like AI, like AI is going to teach itself so much more efficiently than we can teach it."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "We just needed to get it to the point where it can teach itself."}, {"time": 6575, "text": "It finds the motivation to do so, right?"}, {"time": 6578, "text": "So like you inspire it to do so."}, {"time": 6580, "text": "And then it could teach itself."}, {"time": 6582, "text": "What do you make of the fact, you mentioned Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."}, {"time": 6588, "text": "Yeah, I read it twice."}, {"time": 6588, "text": "You read it twice?"}, {"time": 6590, "text": "Okay, so no one

of."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "You know, you start being like, how could this possibly happen?"}, {"time": 6608, "text": "And then when you read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, it's like, people

"text": "Such a good."}, {"time": 6651, "text": "And then there's also the role of, that's a really heavy burden, which is from a geopolitical perspective, the role of leaders to see evil before it truly becomes evil, to anticipate it, to stand up to evil."}, {"time": 6665, "text": "Because evil is actually pretty rare in this world at a scale that Hitler was."}, {"time": 6669, "text": "We tend to, you know, in the modern discourse kind of call people evil too quickly."}, {"time": 6674, "text": "If you look at ancient history, like there was a ton of Hitlers."}, {"time": 6715, "text": "Just like people, cities used to get leveled all the fucking time."}, {"time": 6720, "text": "Okay, get into the Bronze Age collapse."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "It's basically, there was like almost like Roman level like society."}, {"time": 6727, "text": "Like there was like all over the world, like global trade, like everything was awesome through a mix of, I think a bit of climate change and then the development of iron because basically bronze could only come from this, the way to make bronze, like everything had to be funneled through this one Iranian mine."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "And like the thing that seems to cause Dark Ages is mass supply chain collapse."}, {"time": 6768, "text": "But the Bronze Age collapse happened like, it was sort of like this ancient collapse that

flourishing society, like we were almost coming to modernity and everything got leveled."}, {"time": 6788, "text": "And they had this mini Dark Ages, but it was just like, there's so little writing or

"But it just happened, I don't know the years, but like thousands of years earlier."}, {"time": 6806, "text": "And then we sort of like recovered from the Bronze Age collapse, empire reemerged, writing and trade and everything reemerged."}, {"time": 6816, "text": "And then we of course had the more contemporary Dark Ages."}, {"time": 6820, "text": "And then over time, we've designed mechanism to lessen and lessen the capability for the destructive power centers to emerge."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "There's more recording about the more contemporary Dark Ages."}, {"time": 6834, "text": "So I think we have like a better understanding of how to avoid it, but I still think we're at high risk for it."}, {"time": 6838, "text": "I think that's one of the big risks right now."},

{"time": 6859, "text": "We're kind of like slowly incrementally, like moving towards like not scary old school war stuff."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "And I think seeing it happen in some of the countries that at least nominally are like supposed to have moved past that, that's scary because it reminds us that it can happen like in the places that have moved supposedly, as hopefully moved past that."}, {"time": 6887, "text": "And possibly at a civilization level, like you said, supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint, might make people desperate, angry, hateful, violent, and drag us right back in."}, {"time": 6901, "text": "I mean, supply chain collapse is how, like the ultimate thing that caused the Middle Ages was supply chain collapse."}, {"time": 6908, "text": "It's like people, because people were reliant on a certain level of technology, like people, like you look at like Britain, like they had glass, like people had aqueducts, people had like indoor heating and cooling and like running water and like buy food from all over the world and trade and markets."}, {"time": 6926, "text": "Like people didn't know how to hunt and forage and gather."}, {"time": 6928, "text": "And so we're in a similar situation."}, {"time": 6929, "text": "We are not educated enough to survive without technology."}, {"time": 6933, "text": "So if we have a supply chain collapse that like limits our access to technology, there will be like massive starvation and violence and displacement and war."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "Like, you know, it's like, yeah."}, {"time": 6947, "text": "In my opinion, it's like the primary marker of like what a dark age is."}, {"time": 6952, "text": "Well, technology is kind of enabling us to be more resilient in

catastrophic."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "What do you think is the coolest invention humans come up with?"}, {"time": 6971, "text": "The wheel, fire, cooking meat."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "Freaking computers."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "Internet or computers?"}, {"time": 6979, "text": "What do you think the?"}, {"time": 6980, "text": "Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo tech now."}, {"time": 6987, "text": "I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation."}, {"time": 6990, "text": "And so it like allows for actual evolution."}, {"time": 6993, "text": "Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated."}, {"time": 6998,

{"time": 7006, "text": "I think most of us are."}, {"time": 7009, "text": "Like, as I said, like, I think if you like looked at brain scans of us versus humans a hundred years ago, it would look very different."}, {"time": 7020, "text": "I think we are physiologically different."}, {"time": 7023, "text": "Just even the interaction with the devices has changed our brains."}, {"time": 7026, "text": "Well, and if you look at, a lot of studies are coming out to show that like, there's a degree of inherited memory."}, {"time": 7033, "text": "So some of these physiological changes in theory should be, we should be passing them on."}, {"time": 7038, "text": "So like that's, you know, that's not like a, an instance of physiological change that's gonna fizzle out."}, {"time": 7044, "text": "In theory, that should progress like to our offspring."}, {"time": 7049, "text": "Speaking of offspring, what advice would you give to a young person, like in high school, whether there be an artist, a creative, an engineer, any kind of career path, or maybe just life in general, how they can live a life they can be proud of?"}, {"time": 7068, "text": "I think one of my big thoughts, and like, especially now having kids, is that I don't think we spend enough time teaching creativity."}, {"time": 7076, "text": "And I think creativity is a muscle like other things."}, {"time": 7079, "text": "And there's a lot of emphasis on, you know, learn how to play the piano."}, {"time": 7082, "text": "And then you can write a song or like learn the technical stuff."}, {"time": 7085, "text": "And then you can do a thing."}, {"time": 7087, "text": "But I think it's, like, I have a friend who's like world's greatest guitar player, like, you know, amazing sort of like producer, works with other people, but he's really sort of like, you know, he like engineers and records things and like does solos, but he doesn't really like make his own music."}, {"time": 7103, "text": "And I was talking to him and I was like, dude, you're so talented at music."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "Like, why don't you make music or whatever?"}, {"time": 7108, "text": "And he was like, cause I got, I'm too old."}, {"time": 7112, "text": "I never learned the creative muscle."}, {"time": 7114, "text": "And it's like, you know, it's embarrassing."}, {"time": 7116, "text": "It's like learning the creative muscle takes a lot of failure."}, {"time": 7120, "text": "And it also sort of, if when you're being creative, you know, you're throwing paint at a wall and a lot of stuff will fail."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "So like part of it is like a tolerance for failure and humiliation."}, {"time": 7133, "text": "And that's somehow that's easier to develop when you're young or be persist through it when you're young."}, {"time": 7138, "text": "Everything is easier to develop when you're young."}, {"time": 7143, "text": "And the younger, the better."}, {"time": 7144, "text": "It could destroy you."}, {"time": 7145, "text": "I mean, that's the shitty thing about creativity."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "If, you know, failure could destroy you if you're not careful, but that's a risk worth taking."},

the time."}, {"time": 7162, "text": "Like in public, in private, I get canceled for, I've make all kinds of mistakes, but I just like am very resilient about making mistakes."}, {"time": 7170, "text": "And so then like I do a lot of things that like other people wouldn't do."}, {"time": 7174, "text": "And like, I think my greatest asset is my creativity."}, {"time": 7177, "text": "And I like, I think pain, like tolerance to failure is just a super essential thing that should be taught before other things."}, {"time": 7185, "text": "Brilliant advice."}, {"time": 7187, "text": "I wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more as opposed to kind of."}, {"time": 7192, "text": "Cause we like punish failure."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "We're like, no, like when we were teaching kids, we're like, no, that's wrong."}, {"time": 7196, "text": "Like that's, you know, like X keeps like will be like wrong."}, {"time": 7204, "text": "Like he'll say like crazy things."}, {"time": 7205,

doesn't like, but I don't want to be like, no, you're wrong."}, {"time": 7217, "text": "I'm like, you're thinking of weird, crazy shit."}, {"time": 7220, "text": "Like, I don't know what a bubble car is, but like."}, {"time": 7222, "text": "It's creating worlds and they might be internally consistent."}, {"time": 7225, "text": "And through that, you might discover something fundamental about this
