a planet."}, {"time": 317, "text": "Well, I mean, actually we can touch more on that."}, {"time": 320, "text": "That's another discussion."}, {"time": 322, "text": "So in some sense, earlier in the century, Pluto represented kind of our ignorance about the edges of the solar system."}, {"time": 331, "text": "And perhaps planet nine is the thing that represents our ignorance about now the modern set of ignorances about the edges of our solar system."}, {"time": 342, "text": "By the way, just imagining this belt of astral debris at the edge of our solar system is incredible."}, {"time": 349, "text": "Can you talk about it a little bit?"}, {"time": 351, "text": "What is the Kuiper belt and what is the Oort cloud?"}, {"time": 358, "text": "So look, the simple way to think about it is that if you imagine, you know, Neptune's orbit like a circle, right?"}, {"time": 365, "text": "Kind of maybe a factor of one and a half, 1.3 times bigger on a radius of 1.3 times bigger, you've got a whole collection of icy objects."}, {"time": 378, "text": "Most of these objects are sort of the size of Austin, you know, maybe a little bit smaller."}, {"time": 386, "text": "If you then zoom out and explore the orbits of the most long period Kuiper belt object, these are the things that have the biggest orbits and take the longest time to go around in, then what you find is that beyond a critical orbit size, beyond a critical orbit period, which is about 4,000 years, you start to see weird structure, like all the orbits sort of point into one direction."}, {"time": 418, "text": "And all the orbits are kind of tilted in the same way by about 20 degrees with respect to Sun."}, {"time": 425, "text": "This is particularly pronounced in orbits that are not heavily affected by Neptune."}, {"time": 431, "text": "So there you start to see this weird dichotomy where they're objects which are stable, which Neptune does not mess with gravitationally, and unstable objects."}, {"time": 442, "text": "The unstable objects are basically all over the place because they're being kicked around by Neptune."}, {"time": 448, "text": "The stable orbits show this remarkable pattern of clustering."}, {"time": 453, "text": "We back, I guess, five years ago interpreted this pattern of clustering as a gravitational one way sign, the existence of a planet in a distant planet, right?"}, {"time": 465, "text": "Something that is shepherding and confining these orbits together."}, {"time": 470, "text": "Of course, right, you have to have some skepticism when you're talking about these things."}, {"time": 477, "text": "You have to ask the question of, okay, how statistically significant is this clustering?"}, {"time": 481, "text": "And there are many authors that have indeed called that into question."}, {"time": 486, "text": "We have done our own analyses and basically, just like with all statistics where there's kind of multiple ways to do the exercise, you can either ask the question of if I have a telescope that has surveyed this part of the sky, what are the chances that I would discover this clustering?"}, {"time": 510, "text": "That basically tells you that you have zero confidence, right?"}, {"time": 516, "text": "That does not give you a confident answer one way or another."}, {"time": 520, "text": "Another way to do the statistics, which is what we prefer to do, is to say we have a whole night sky of discoveries in the Kuiper Belt, right?"}, {"time": 530, "text": "And if we have some object over there, which has right ascension and declination, which is a way to say it's there on the sky, and it has some brightness, that means somebody looked over there and discovered an object, was able to discover an object of that brightness or brighter."}, {"time": 549, "text": "Through that analysis, you can construct a whole map on the sky of kind of where all of the surveys that have ever been done have collectively looked."}, {"time": 558, "text": "So if you do the exercise this way, the false alarm probability of the clustering on which the Planet Nine hypothesis is built is about 0.4%."}, {"time": 568, "text": "Wow, okay, so there's a million questions here."}, {"time": 572, "text": "One, when you say bright objects, why are they bright?"}, {"time": 575, "text": "Are we talking about actual objects within the Kuiper Belt or the stuff we see through the Kuiper Belt?"}, {"time": 579, "text": "This is the actual stuff we see in the Kuiper Belt."}, {"time": 582, "text": "The way you go about discovering Kuiper Belt objects is pretty easy."}, {"time": 586, "text": "I mean, it's easy in theory, right?"}, {"time": 589, "text": "Hard in practice."}, {"time": 590, "text": "All you do is you take snapshots of the sky, right?"}, {"time": 594, "text": "Use that direction, say, and take a high exposure snapshot."}, {"time": 599, "text": "Then you wait a night and you do it again, and then you wait another night and you do it again."}, {"time": 605, "text": "Objects that are just random stars in the galaxy don't move on the sky, whereas objects in the solar system will slowly move."}, {"time": 611, "text": "This is no different than if you're driving down the freeway, it looks like trees are going by you faster than the clouds, right?"}, {"time": 619, "text": "This is parallax."}, {"time": 622, "text": "It's they're reflecting light off of the sun and it's going back and hitting this."}, {"time": 627, "text": "There's a little bit of a glimmer from the different objects that you can see based on the reflection from the sun."}, {"time": 632, "text": "So like there's actual light, it's not darkness."}, {"time": 637, "text": "These are just big icicles basically that are just reflecting sunlight back at you."}, {"time": 641, "text": "It's then easy to understand why it's so hard to discover them because light has to travel to something like 40 times the distance between the earth and the sun and then get reflected back."}, {"time": 655, "text": "Was that like an hour travel?"}, {"time": 658, "text": "That's something like that because the earth to the sun is eight minutes, I believe."}, {"time": 664, "text": "Something in that order of magnitude."}, {"time": 669, "text": "So you have to account for all of that."}, {"time": 672, "text": "And then there's a huge amount of data, pixels that are coming from the pictures and you have to integrate all of that together to paint a sort of like a high estimate of the different objects."}, {"time": 685, "text": "Can you track them?"}, {"time": 686, "text": "Can you be like, that's Bob?"}, {"time": 687, "text": "Like, can you like?"}, {"time": 690, "text": "In fact, one of them is named Joe Biden."}, {"time": 693, "text": "I mean, I'm not like, this is not even a joke, right?"}, {"time": 696, "text": "Is there a Trump one or no?"}, {"time": 701, "text": "I don't know for that."}, {"time": 703, "text": "But like the way it works is if you discover one, you right away get a license plate for it."}, {"time": 711, "text": "So like the first four numbers is the first year that this object has appeared on, you know, in the data set, if you will."}, {"time": 720, "text": "And then there's like this code that follows it, which basically tells you where in the sky it is, right?"}, {"time": 728, "text": "So one of the really interesting Kuiper Belt objects, which is very much part of the Planet Nine story is called VP113, because Joe Biden was vice president at the time, you know, got nicknamed Biden."}, {"time": 742, "text": "VP113?"}, {"time": 744, "text": "He got nicknamed Biden."}, {"time": 748, "text": "What's the fingerprint for any particular object?"}, {"time": 752, "text": "Like how do you know it's the same one?"}, {"time": 754, "text": "Or you just kind of like, yeah, from night to night, you take a picture, how do you know it's the same object?"}, {"time": 760, "text": "So the way you know is it appears in almost exactly the same part of the sky except for move, but it moves."}, {"time": 766, "text": "But this is why actually you need at least three nights because oftentimes asteroids, which are much closer to the earth, like will appear to move only slightly, but then on the third night will move away."}, {"time": 783, "text": "So that third night is really there to detect acceleration."}, {"time": 787, "text": "Now the thing that I didn't really realize until, you know, I started observing together with my partner in crime in all this, Mike Brown, is just the fact that for the first year when you make these detections, the only thing you really know with confidence is where it is on the night sky and how far away it is, okay?"}, {"time": 811, "text": "It's all about the orbit because over three days the object just moves so little, right?"}, {"time": 818, "text": "That whole motion on the sky is entirely coming from motion of the earth, right?"}, {"time": 823, "text": "So the earth is kind of the car, the object is the tree and you see it move."}, {"time": 827, "text": "So then to get some confident information about what its orbit looks like, you have to come back a year later and then measure it again."}, {"time": 837, "text": "So three nights then come back a year later and do another three nights so you get the velocity of the acceleration from the three nights and then you have the maybe the additional information."}, {"time": 848, "text": "Because an orbit is basically described by six parameters."}, {"time": 851, "text": "So you at least need six independent points, but in reality you need many more observations to really pin down the orbit well."}, {"time": 860, "text": "And from that you're able to construct for that one particular object and orbit and then there's of course, like how many objects are there?"}, {"time": 867, "text": "There's like four ish thousand now."}, {"time": 871, "text": "But like the, in the future that could be like millions."}, {"time": 876, "text": "Oh sure, oh sure."}, {"time": 879, "text": "So in fact these things are hard to predict, but there's a new observatory called the Vera Rubin Observatory, which is coming online maybe next year."}, {"time": 888, "text": "I mean with COVID these things are a little bit more uncertain, but they've actually been making great progress with construction."}, {"time": 896, "text": "And so that telescope is just going to sort of scan the night sky every day automatically and just, it's such an efficient survey that it might increase the census of the distant Kuiper Belt, the things that I'm interested in by a factor of a hundred."}, {"time": 915, "text": "I mean that would be, that would be really cool."}, {"time": 918, "text": "And yeah, that's a, that's an incredible..."}, {"time": 922, "text": "I mean they might just find planet nine."}, {"time": 926, "text": "I mean that's... Like almost like literally pictures, like visually."}, {"time": 931, "text": "Like the first detection you make, all you know is where it is in the sky and how far away it is."}, {"time": 935, "text": "If something is, you know, 500 times away from the sun, as far away from the sun as is the earth, you know that's planet nine."}, {"time": 942, "text": "That's when the story concludes and then you can study it."}, {"time": 945, "text": "Now you can study it."}, {"time": 947, "text": "By the way, I'm going to use that as like, I don't know, a pickup line or a dating strategy, like see the person for three days and then don't see them at all and then see them again in a year to determine the orbit."}, {"time": 959, "text": "And over time you figure out if sort of from a cosmic perspective, this, this whole thing works."}, {"time": 968, "text": "I have no dating advice to give."}, {"time": 969, "text": "I was going to use this as a metaphor to somehow map it onto the human condition."}, {"time": 977, "text": "You mentioned the Kuiper Belt."}, {"time": 978, "text": "What's the Oort cloud?"}, {"time": 979, "text": "If you look at the Neptune orbit as a one, then the Kuiper Belt is like 1.3 out there and then we get farther and farther into the darkness."}, {"time": 989, "text": "So okay, you've got the kind of main Kuiper Belt, which is about say 1.3, 1.5."}, {"time": 996, "text": "Then you have something called the scattered disc, which is kind of an extension of the Kuiper Belt."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "It's a bunch of these long, very elliptical orbits that hug the orbit of Neptune, but come out very far."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So that, the scattered disc with the current senses, like the, some of the longest orbits we know of have a semi major axis."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "So half the orbit length, roughly speaking of about a thousand, thousand times the distance between the earth and the sun."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "Now if you keep moving out, okay, eventually once you're at sort of 10,000 to 100,000 roughly, that's where the Oort cloud is."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "Now the Oort cloud is a distinct population of icy bodies and is distinct from the Kuiper Belt."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "In fact, it's so expansive that it ends roughly halfway between us and the next star."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "It's edge is just dictated by to what extent does the solar gravity reach."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "Solar gravity reaches that far?"}, {"time": 1067, "text": "So it has to, wow, imagining this is a little bit overwhelming."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "So there's like a giant, like vast icy rock thingy."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "It's like a sphere."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "It's like, it's an almost spherical structure that engulfs, that encircles the sun and all the long period comets come from the Oort cloud."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "They come, the way that they appear, I mean, for already, I don't know, hundreds of years we've been detecting and occasionally like a comet will come in and it seemingly comes out of nowhere."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "The reason these long period comets appear on very, very long timescales, right?"}, {"time": 1148, "text": "They look beautiful in the night sky, et cetera, but they're all coming from really, really far away."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "So is there, are any of them coming our way from collisions?"}, {"time": 1159, "text": "Like how many collisions are there or is there a bunch of space for them to move around?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "Yeah, there's zero."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "It's completely collisionless out there."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "The physical radii of objects are so small compared to the distance between them, right?"}, {"time": 1173, "text": "It's just, it is truly a collisionless environment."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "I think that probably in the age of the solar system have literally been zero collisions in the Oort cloud."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "So if you like draw a picture of the solar system, everything's really close together."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "So everything I guess here is spaced far apart."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "Do rogue planets like fly in every once in a while and join?"}, {"time": 1201, "text": "Not rogue planets, but rogue objects from out there."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "Join the party?"}, {"time": 1209, "text": "We've seen a couple of them in the last three or so years, maybe four years now."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "The first one was the one called Uamuamua and it's been all over the news."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "The second one was Comet Borisov discovered by a guy named Borisov."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "Yeah, so the way you know they're coming from elsewhere is unlike solar system objects which travel on elliptical paths around the sun, these guys travel on hyperbolic paths."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "So they come in, say hello and then they're gone."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And the fact that they exist is totally like not surprising, right?"}, {"time": 1252, "text": "The Neptune is constantly ejecting Kuiper belt objects into interstellar space."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "Our solar system itself is sort of leaking icy debris and ejecting it."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "So presumably every planetary systems around other stars do exactly the same thing."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "Let me ask you about the millions of objects that are part of the Kuiper belt and part of the Oort cloud."}, {"time": 1278, "text": "Do you think some of them have primitive life?"}, {"time": 1280, "text": "It kind of makes you sad if there's like primitive life there and they're just kind of like lonely out there in space."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "Like how many of them do you think have life, like bacterial life?"}, {"time": 1290, "text": "Probably a negligible amount."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "Zero with like a plus on top."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Zero plus plus."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "So, you know, if you and I took a little trip to the interstellar medium, I think we would develop cancer and die real fast, right?"}, {"time": 1311, "text": "It's a pretty hostile radiation environment."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "You don't actually have to go to the interstellar medium."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "You just have to leave the earth's magnetic field too."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And then you're not doing so well suddenly."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "So you know, this idea of, you know, life kind of traveling between places, it's not entirely implausible, but you really have to twist, I think, a lot of parameters."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "One of the problems we have is we don't actually know how life originates, right?"}, {"time": 1342, "text": "So it's kind of a second order question of survival in the interstellar medium and how resilient it is because we think you require water, but, and that's certainly the case for the earth, but you know, we really don't know for sure."}, {"time": 1363, "text": "That said, I will argue that the question of like, are there aliens out there is a very boring question because the answer is, of course there are."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "I mean, like we know that there are planets around almost every star."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "Of course there are other life forms."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "Life is not some specific thing that happened on the earth and that's it, right?"}, {"time": 1391, "text": "That's a statistical impossibility."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "Yeah, but the difficult question is before even the fact that we don't know how life originates, I don't think we even know what life is like definitionally, like formalizing a kind of picture of, in terms of the mechanism we would use to search for life out there or even when we're on a planet to say, is this life?"}, {"time": 1416, "text": "Is this rock that just moved from where it was yesterday life or maybe not even a rock, something else?"}, {"time": 1423, "text": "I got to tell you, I want to know what life is, okay?"}, {"time": 1426, "text": "And I want you to show me."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "I think there's a song to basically accompany every single thing we talk about today and probably half of them are love songs and somehow we'll integrate George Michael into the whole thing."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "So your intuition is there's life everywhere in our universe."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "Do you think there's intelligent life out there?"}, {"time": 1450, "text": "I think it's entirely plausible."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "I mean, it's entirely plausible."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "I think there's intelligent life on earth and so yeah, taking that, like say whatever this thing we got on earth, whether it's dolphins or humans, say that's intelligent."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "Definitely dolphins."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "I mean, have you seen the dolphins?"}, {"time": 1474, "text": "Well, they do some cruel stuff to each other."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "So if cruelty is a definition of intelligence, they're pretty good and then humans are pretty good in that regard."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And then there's like pigs are very intelligent."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "So all that to say is if we have intelligent life here on earth, if you take dolphins, pigs, humans, from the perspective of like planetary science, how unique is earth?"}, {"time": 1534, "text": "So earth is not a common outcome of the planet formation process."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "It's probably a something on the order of maybe a 1% effect."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "And by earth, I mean not just an earth mass planet, okay?"}, {"time": 1553, "text": "I mean the architecture of the solar system that allows the earth to exist in its kind of very temperate way."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "One thing to understand and this is pretty crucial, right, is that the earth itself formed well after the gas disk that formed the giant planets had already dissipated."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "You see stars start out with, you know, the star and then a disk of gas and dust that encircles it, okay?"}, {"time": 1590, "text": "From this disk of gas and dust, big planets can emerge."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "And we have over the last two, three decades discovered thousands of extra solar planets as an orbit or other stars."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "What we see is that many of them have these expansive hydrogen helium atmospheres."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "The fact that the earth doesn't is deeply connected to the fact that earth took about 100 million years to form."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "So we missed that, you know, train, so to speak, to get that hydrogen helium atmosphere."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "That's why actually we can see the sky, right?"}, {"time": 1630, "text": "That's why the sky is, well, at least in most places, that's why the atmosphere is not completely opaque."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "With that, you know, kind of thinking in mind, I would argue that we're getting the kind of emergent pictures that the earth is not, you know, everywhere, right?"}, {"time": 1653, "text": "There's sort of the sci fi view of things where we go to some other star and we just land on random planets and they're all earth like."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "That's totally not true."}, {"time": 1662, "text": "But even a low probability event, even if you imagine that earth is a one in a million or one in 10 million occurrence, there are 10 to the 12 stars in the galaxy, right?"}, {"time": 1678, "text": "So you just, you always win by, that's right, by supply."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "They save you."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "Well, you've hypothesized that our solar system once possessed a population of short period planets that were destroyed by the evil Jupiter migrating through the solar nebula."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Well, if I was to say what was the kind of the key outcome of searches for extra solar planets, it is that most stars are encircled by short period planets that are, you know, a few earth masses, right?"}, {"time": 1713, "text": "So a few times bigger than the earth and have orbital periods that kind of range from days to weeks."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "Now if you go and ask the solar system what's in our region, right, in that region, it's completely empty, right?"}, {"time": 1730, "text": "It's just, it's astonishingly hollow."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And think, you know, from the sun is not some, you know, special star that decided that it was going to form the solar system."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "So I think, you know, the natural thing to assume is that the same processes of planet formation that occurred everywhere else also occurred in the solar system."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Following this logic, it's not implausible to imagine that the solar system once possessed a system of intra Mercurian, like, you know, compact system of planets."}, {"time": 1768, "text": "So then we asked ourselves, would such a system survive to this day?"}, {"time": 1773, "text": "And the answer is no, at least our calculations suggested it's highly unlikely because of the formation of Jupiter."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "And Jupiter's primordial kind of wandering through the solar system would have sent this collisional field of debris that would have pushed that system of planets onto the sun."}, {"time": 1791, "text": "So was Jupiter, this primordial wandering, what did Jupiter look like?"}, {"time": 1796, "text": "Like, why was it wandering?"}, {"time": 1798, "text": "It didn't have the orbit it has today?"}, {"time": 1800, "text": "We're pretty certain that giant planets like Jupiter, when they form, they migrate."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "The reason they migrate is, you know, on a detailed level, perhaps difficult to explain, but just in a qualitative sense, they form in this fluid disk of gas and dust."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "So it's kind of like, okay, if I plop down a raft somewhere in the ocean, will it stay where you plop it down or will it kind of get carried around?"}, {"time": 1830, "text": "It's not really a good analogy because it's not like Jupiter is being advected by the currents of gas and dust, but the way it migrates is it carves out a hole in the disk and then by interacting with the disk gravitationally, it can change its orbit."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "The fact that the solar system has both Jupiter and Saturn here complicates things a lot because you have to solve the problem of the evolution of the gas disk, the evolution of Jupiter's orbit in the gas disk, plus evolution of Saturn's and their mutual interaction."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "The common outcome of solving that problem, though, is pretty easy to explain."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "Jupiter forms, its orbit shrinks, and then once Saturn forms, its orbit catches up basically to the orbit of Jupiter and then both come out."}, {"time": 1884, "text": "So there's this inward outward pattern of Jupiter's early motion that happens sort of within the last million years of the lifetime of the solar system's primordial disk."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "So while this is happening, if our calculations are correct, which I think they are, you can destroy this inner system of, you know, few Earth mass planets."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "And then in the aftermath of all this violence, you form the terrestrial planets."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "Where would they come from in that case?"}, {"time": 1920, "text": "So Jupiter clears out the space, and then there's a few terrestrial planets that come in and those come in from the disk somewhere, like one of the larger objects?"}, {"time": 1932, "text": "What actually happens in these calculations, you leave behind a rather mass depleted, like remnant

"Is there some tricks, is there some hacks to being a lifelong musician while being like super busy?"}, {"time": 8351, "text": "So I would say, you know, the way that I optimize my life is I try to do, you know, the thing that I'm passionate about in a moment and put that at the top of the priority list."}, {"time": 8366, "text": "There are moments when, you know, you just, you feel inspired to play music and if you're in the middle of something, if you can avoid, if that can be put on hold, just do it, right?"}, {"time": 8375, "text": "There are times when you get inspired about something scientific, you know, I do my best to drop everything, go into that, you know, mode of, that isolated mode and execute upon that."}, {"time": 8392, "text": "It's a chaotic, you know, I think I have a pretty chaotic lifestyle where I'm always doing kind of multiple things and jumping between what I'm doing."}, {"time": 8403, "text": "But at the end of the day, it's not like, you know, those moments of inspiration are actually kind of rare, right?"}, {"time": 8414, "text": "Like most of the time, all of us are just doing kind of, doing the stuff that needs to get done."}, {"time": 8423, "text": "If you do the disservice to yourself of saying, oh, I'm inspired to, you know, do this calculation, figure this out, but I've got to answer email or just like do something silly, you know, that is nothing more than disservice."}, {"time": 8440, "text": "And also, like I have some social media presence, but I mostly stay off of, you know, social media to, you know, just frankly, cause like, I don't kind of, I don't enjoy the mental cycles that it, that it takes over."}, {"time": 8457, "text": "Yeah, it robs you of that, the, yeah, those precious moments that could be filled with inspiration in your, in your other pursuits."}, {"time": 8468, "text": "But there's something to, maybe you and I are different in this, like I tried to play at least 10 minutes of guitar every day, like almost on the technical side, like keeping that base of basic competence going."}, {"time": 8487, "text": "And I mean, the same way like writers will get in front of a paper no matter what, that kind of thing, it just feels like that for my life has been essential to the daily ritual of it."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "Why does days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months, and you haven't played guitar for months?"}, {"time": 8505, "text": "No, no, I, I, I understand."}, {"time": 8507, "text": "For me, I think it's, it's been like, if we have a gig coming up, we'll definitely You need deadlines."}, {"time": 8515, "text": "No, like we, we will, we will sharpen up definitely, you know, especially coming up to a gig."}, {"time": 8523, "text": "It's like, you know, we're not trying to make money with this."}, {"time": 8526, "text": "This is like, just for the, for that satisfaction of doing something and doing something well, right?"}, {"time": 8535, "text": "But overall, I would say most, I play guitar most days, most days."}, {"time": 8542, "text": "And you know, when I put kids to sleep, I play guitar, you know, with them and we like, just make up random songs about, you know, about our cat or something, you know, like we just do kind of random stuff."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "But you know, music is always involved in that process."}, {"time": 8561, "text": "Yeah, keeping it fun."}, {"time": 8563, "text": "You have Russian roots?"}, {"time": 8566, "text": "I was."}, {"time": 8568, "text": "When did you come here?"}, {"time": 8569, "text": "So, I came to the US in very, the very end of 99."}, {"time": 8575, "text": "But so I was like, almost 14 years old."}, {"time": 8579, "text": "But along the way, we spent six years in Japan."}, {"time": 8583, "text": "So like, we moved from Russia to Japan in 94, and then to the US in 99."}, {"time": 8590, "text": "So did like elementary school, middle school in Japan."}, {"time": 8594, "text": "So elementary school in Japan."}, {"time": 8597, "text": "So, that's interesting, dad."}, {"time": 8599, "text": "Do you still speak Russian?"}, {"time": 8611, "text": "It'd be interesting to hear you speak Russian."}, {"time": 8670, "text": "So for people who don't speak Russian, Konstantin was talking about basically his first, in 1992, interaction with capitalism, which is Pepsi, and at first he discovered Pepsi, and then he discovered Coke, and he was confused how such, how such theft could occur."}, {"time": 8688, "text": "Yeah, like an intellectual property theft."}, {"time": 8690, "text": "And remember, Pepsi arrived to the Soviet Union first, and there was some, there's some complicated story which I don't quite understand the details of."}, {"time": 8700, "text": "For a while, Pepsi like commanded submarines or something."}, {"time": 8706, "text": "Yeah, Pepsi had like a fleet of Soviet submarines that it was."}, {"time": 8710, "text": "They were sponsoring tanks and this fascinating."}, {"time": 8713, "text": "And I remember, there's certain things that trickled in, like McDonald's, I remember that was a big deal."}, {"time": 8719, "text": "Certain aspects of the West."}, {"time": 8721, "text": "So, I mean, we went to McDonald's, and we stood on, I mean, this is, this is absurd, right, from, kind of looking at it from today's perspective, but we stood in line for like six hours to get into this McDonald's, and I remember inside it was just like a billion people, and I'm just taking a bite out of that Big Mac, and we're like, wow."}, {"time": 8747, "text": "What was it, an incredible experience for you?"}, {"time": 8749, "text": "So, like, what is this taste of the West like?"}, {"time": 8752, "text": "Did you enjoy it?"}, {"time": 8753, "text": "I enjoyed the fact that, I mean, this is like, this is getting into the weeds, but I really enjoyed the fact that the top of the bun had those seeds, you know, like, and I remember how on the commercials, like, the Big Mac would kind of bounce."}, {"time": 8768, "text": "I was like, the seeds, how do they inject the seeds into the bread?"}, {"time": 8773, "text": "Like, amazing."}, {"time": 8776, "text": "So, I think it was... Artistry."}, {"time": 8779, "text": "But you enjoyed the artistry of the culinary experience."}, {"time": 8782, "text": "It was the, you know, it was the food art that is the Big Mac."}, {"time": 8785, "text": "Actually, I still don't know the answer to that."}, {"time": 8787, "text": "How do they get the sesame seeds on the bun?"}, {"time": 8788, "text": "It's better to not know the answer."}, {"time": 8791, "text": "You just wander the mystery of it all."}, {"time": 8793, "text": "Yeah, I remember it being exceptionally delicious, but I'm with you, I don't know, you didn't mention how transformative Pepsi was, but to me, basically sugar based stuff, like Pepsi was, or Coke, I don't remember which one we partook in, but that was an incredible experience."}, {"time": 8811, "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, absolutely."}, {"time": 8813, "text": "And, you know, I think it's, you know, it was an important and formative period."}, {"time": 8824, "text": "I sometimes, I guess, rely on that a little bit, you know, in my daily life, because I remember, like, the early 90s were real rough, you know, like my parents were kind of on the bottom of the spectrum in terms of, you know, in terms of financial well being."}, {"time": 8846, "text": "So kind of like just when I run into trouble, not like, you know, money trouble, just any kind of trouble these days, it just kind of is not particularly meaningful when you compare it to that turbulent time of the early 90s."}, {"time": 8865, "text": "And the other thing is, I think there's like an advantage to being, you know, an immigrant, which is that you go through the mental exercise of changing your environment completely early in your life, right?"}, {"time": 8880, "text": "You go, it's by no means, you know, pleasant in the moment, right, but like going into Japanese elementary school, right, like, I didn't go to some, like, private, you know, thing, I just went to a regular, like, Japanese public elementary school, and I was the non Japanese person in my class."}, {"time": 8902, "text": "So just like to learn Japanese and just kind of."}, {"time": 8906, "text": "So that's a super humbling experience in many ways was when you like made fun of all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 8912, "text": "Being the outsider."}, {"time": 8914, "text": "But, you know, you kind of do, you kind of do that, and then you kind of, then you just kind of are okay with stuff, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 8924, "text": "And so like doing that, again, in middle school in the US, it was arguably easy, because I was like, yeah, well, I've already done this before."}, {"time": 8933, "text": "So I think it kind of prepares you mentally a little bit for switching up for whatever, you know, changes that will come up for the rest of your life."}, {"time": 8942, "text": "So I wouldn't trade that, that experience really for anything."}, {"time": 8948, "text": "It's a huge aspect of who I am, and I'm sure you can relate to a lot of this."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "Is there advice from your life that you can give to young people today, high school, college, you know, about their career, or maybe about life in general?"}, {"time": 8966, "text": "I'm not like a career coach, but I'm definitely not a life coach."}, {"time": 8972, "text": "I don't have it all figured out."}, {"time": 8973, "text": "But I think there's a perpetual cycle of, you know, thinking that there is a, there's kind of like a template for success, right?"}, {"time": 8988, "text": "Maybe there is, but in my experience, I haven't seen it, right?"}, {"time": 8996, "text": "You know, I would say people in high school, right?"}, {"time": 9001, "text": "So much of their focus is on getting straight A's, filling their CV with this and this and this so that it looks impressive, right?"}, {"time": 9013, "text": "That is not, I think, a good way to optimize your life, right?"}, {"time": 9017, "text": "Do the thing that fills your life with passion."}, {"time": 9020, "text": "Do the thing that fills your life with interest."}, {"time": 9024, "text": "And you know, do that perpetually, right?"}, {"time": 9028, "text": "A straight A student, you know, is really impressive, but also, you know, somewhat boring, right?"}, {"time": 9037, "text": "So, I think, you know, injection of more of that kind of interest into the lives of young people would go a long way in just both upping their level of happiness and then just kind of ensuring that, looking forward, they are not suffering from a, you know, perpetual condition of, oh, I have to satisfy these, like, you know, check boxes to do well, right?"}, {"time": 9064, "text": "Because you can lose yourself in that whole process for the rest of your life, but it's nice if it's possible, like Max Tegmark was exceptionally good at this at MIT, figure out how you can spend a small part of your, percent of your efforts that, such that your CV looks really impressive."}, {"time": 9083, "text": "There's no, like, without a doubt, like, that's a baseline that you need to have."}, {"time": 9091, "text": "And then, so like, spend most of your time doing like amazing things you're passionate about, but such that it kind of like Planet Nine produces objects that feed your CV, like, slowly over time."}, {"time": 9105, "text": "Like getting good grades in high school, maybe doing extracurricular activities or in terms of like, you know, for programmers that's producing code that you can show up on GitHub, like leaving traces, like, throughout your efforts, such that your CV looks impressive to the rest of the world."}, {"time": 9122, "text": "In fact, I mean, this is somewhat along the lines of what I'm talking about, see, like, getting like good grades is important, but grades are not a tangible, like, product."}, {"time": 9134, "text": "You cannot, you know, show your A and have your A live a separate life from you."}, {"time": 9141, "text": "Code very much does, right?"}, {"time": 9144, "text": "Music very much takes on, you know, provided somebody else listens to it, like, takes on a life of its own."}, {"time": 9153, "text": "That's kind of what I mean, right?"}, {"time": 9156, "text": "Creating stuff that can then get separated from you is exceptionally attractive, right?"}, {"time": 9165, "text": "It's like a fun and... And it's also very impressive to others."}, {"time": 9170, "text": "I think we're moving to a world where grades mean less and less, like certifications mean less and less."}, {"time": 9175, "text": "If you look at, especially again in the computing fields, getting a degree, finishing your, especially just finishing your degree, whether it's bachelor's or master's or PhD is less important than the things you've actually put out into the world."}, {"time": 9191, "text": "And that's a fascinating kind of, that's great that in that sense, the meritocracy is in its richest, most beautiful form is starting to win out."}, {"time": 9200, "text": "Yeah, it's weird because like, you know, my understanding, and I'm not like, I don't know the history of science well enough to speak very confidently about this, but, you know, the advisor of my advisor of my advisor from undergrad, like didn't have a PhD, right?"}, {"time": 9219, "text": "So I think it was a more common thing back in the day, even in the academic sector to, you know, not have, you know, Faraday, like Faraday didn't know algebra and drew diagrams about, you know, magnetic fields and Faraday's law was derived entirely from intuition."}, {"time": 9243, "text": "So it is interesting to how the world of academia has evolved into a, you've got to do this and then get PhD, then you have to postdoc once and twice and maybe thrice and then like you move on."}, {"time": 9258, "text": "So, you know, it does, I do wonder, you know, if we're, you know, if there's a better approach."}, {"time": 9265, "text": "I think we're heading there, but it's a fascinating historical perspective, like that we might have just tried this whole thing out for a while where we put a lot more emphasis on grades and certificates and degrees and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 9278, "text": "I think the difference historically is like we can actually, using the internet, show off ourselves and our creations better and better and more effectively, whether that's code or producing videos or all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 9295, "text": "I want to become a certified drone pilot."}, {"time": 9300, "text": "Of all the things you want to pick, yeah, for sure."}, {"time": 9303, "text": "Or you could just fly and make YouTube videos against hundreds of thousands of views with your drone and never getting a certificate."}]}]
