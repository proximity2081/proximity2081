[{"title": "Lu\u00eds and Jo\u00e3o Batalha: Fermat's Library and the Art of Studying Papers | Lex Fridman Podcast #209", "id": "ndMahzDCH1Y", "quotes": [{"time": 299, "text": "And he tries to be as descriptive as possible, every single step, how he got to the Fields Medal."}, {"time": 305, "text": "And it's interesting also to see just the amount of random interactions and discussions with other researchers, sometimes over coffee, and how it led to like fundamental breakthroughs and some of his most important papers."}, {"time": 322, "text": "So I think it's super interesting to have that context of the backstory."}, {"time": 325, "text": "Well, the Ian Goodfellow story is kind of interesting, and perhaps that's true for Feynman as well."}, {"time": 329, "text": "I don't know if it's romanticizing the thing, but it seems like just a few little insights and a little bit of work does most of the leap required."}, {"time": 335, "text": "Do you have a sense that for a lot of the stuff you've looked at, just looking back through history, it wasn't necessarily the grind of like Andrew Wiles or the Fermat's Last Theorem, for example."}, {"time": 349, "text": "It was more like a brilliant moment of insight."}, {"time": 355, "text": "In fact, Ian Goodfellow has a kind of sadness to him almost, in that at that time in machine learning, like at that time, especially for GANs, you could code something up really quickly in a single machine and almost do the invention, go from idea to experimental validation in like a single night, a single person could do it."}, {"time": 378, "text": "And now there's kind of a sadness that a lot of the breakthroughs you might have in machine learning kind of require large scale experiments."}, {"time": 387, "text": "So it was almost like the early days."}, {"time": 387, "text": "So I wonder how many low hanging fruit there are in science and mathematics and even engineering where it's like you could do that little experiment quickly, like you have an insight in a bar."}, {"time": 401, "text": "Why is it always a bar?"}, {"time": 401, "text": "But you have an insight at a bar and then just implement and the world changes."}, {"time": 406, "text": "It's a good point."}, {"time": 406, "text": "I think it also depends a lot on the maturity of the field."}, {"time": 413, "text": "When you look at a field like mathematics, like it's a pretty mature field, a field like machine learning, it's growing pretty fast."}, {"time": 419, "text": "And it's actually pretty interesting."}, {"time": 427, "text": "I looked up like the number of new papers on archive with the keyword machine learning and like 50% of those papers have been published in the last 12 months."}, {"time": 434, "text": "So you can see just the 5.0, 50%."}, {"time": 440, "text": "So you can see the magnitude of growth in that field."}, {"time": 440, "text": "And so I think like as fields mature, like those types of moments, I think naturally are less frequent."}, {"time": 449, "text": "It's just a consequence of that."}, {"time": 457, "text": "The other point that is interesting about the backstory is that it can really make it more memorable in a way."}, {"time": 462, "text": "And by making it more memorable, it kind of sediments the knowledge more in your mind."}, {"time": 467, "text": "I remember also reading the sort of the backstory to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm."}, {"time": 474, "text": "He came up with it essentially while he was sitting down at a coffee shop in Amsterdam."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And he came up with that algorithm over 20 minutes."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And one interesting aspect is he didn't have any pen or paper at the time."}, {"time": 489, "text": "And so he had to do it all in his mind."}, {"time": 489, "text": "And so there's only so much complexity that he can handle if you're just thinking about it in your mind."}, {"time": 493, "text": "And that like when you think about the simplicity of Dijkstra's shortest path finding algorithm, it's knowing that backstory helps sediment that algorithm in your mind so that you don't forget about it as easily."}, {"time": 510, "text": "It might be from you that I saw a meme about Dijkstra."}, {"time": 510, "text": "It's like he's trying to solve it and he comes up with some kind of random path."}, {"time": 518, "text": "And then it's like my parents aren't home."}, {"time": 518, "text": "And then he does."}, {"time": 525, "text": "He figures out the algorithm for the shortest path."}, {"time": 525, "text": "He tried through words to convey memes, but it's hilarious."}, {"time": 533, "text": "I don't know if it's in post that we construct stories that romanticize it."}, {"time": 539, "text": "Apparently with Newton, there was no apple."}, {"time": 539, "text": "Especially when you're working on problems that have a physical manifestation or a visual manifestation, it feels like the world could be an inspiration to you."}, {"time": 552, "text": "So it doesn't have to be completely on paper."}, {"time": 552, "text": "Like you could be sitting at a bar and all of a sudden see something and a pattern will spark another pattern and you can visualize it and rethink a problem in a particular way."}, {"time": 565, "text": "Of course, you can also load the math that you have on paper and always carry that with you."}, {"time": 571, "text": "So when you show up to the bar, some little inspiration could be the thing that changes it."}, {"time": 575, "text": "Is there any other people almost on the human side, whether it's physics with Feynman, Dirac, Einstein, or computer science, Turing, anybody else?"}, {"time": 585, "text": "Any backstories that you remember that jump out?"}, {"time": 591, "text": "Because I'm also referring to not necessarily these stories where something magical happens, but these are personalities."}, {"time": 598, "text": "They have big egos."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Some of them are super friendly."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Some of them are like self obsessed."}, {"time": 604, "text": "Some of them have anger issues."}, {"time": 604, "text": "Some of them, how do I describe Feynman?"}, {"time": 611, "text": "But he appears to have a appreciation of the beautiful in all its forms."}, {"time": 611, "text": "He has a wit and a cleverness and a humor about him."}, {"time": 619, "text": "So does that come into play in terms of the construction of the science?"}, {"time": 624, "text": "Well, I think you brought up Newton."}, {"time": 624, "text": "Newton is a good example also to think about his backstory because there's a certain backstory of Newton that people always talk about, but then there's a whole another aspect of him that is also a big part of the person that he was, but he was really into alchemy and that he spent a lot of time thinking about that and writing about it and he took it very seriously."}, {"time": 648, "text": "He was really into Bible interpretation, trying to predict things based on the Bible."}, {"time": 653, "text": "And so there's also a whole backstory then and of course you need to look at it in the context and the time that when Newton lived, but it adds to his personality and it's important to also understand those aspects that maybe people are not as proud to teach to little kids, but it's important."}, {"time": 672, "text": "It was part of who he was and maybe without those, who knows what he would have done otherwise."}, {"time": 678, "text": "Well, the cool thing about alchemy, I don't know how it was viewed at the time, but it almost like to me symbolizes dreaming of the impossible."}, {"time": 690, "text": "Like most of the breakthrough ideas kind of seem impossible until they're actually done."}, {"time": 696, "text": "It's like achieving human flight."}, {"time": 696, "text": "It's not completely obvious to me that alchemy is impossible or putting myself in the mindset of the time."}, {"time": 700, "text": "And perhaps even still, everything that some of the most incredible breakthroughs would seem impossible."}, {"time": 716, "text": "And I wonder the value of believing, almost like focusing and dreaming of the impossible, such that it actually is possible in your mind and that in itself manifests whether the accomplishing that goal or making progress in some unexpected direction."}, {"time": 734, "text": "So alchemy almost symbolizes that for me."}, {"time": 734, "text": "I distinctly remember having the same thought of thinking, when I learned about atoms and that they have protons and electrons, I was like, okay, to make gold, you just take whatever has an atomic weight below it and then shove another proton in there and then you have a bunch of gold."}, {"time": 748, "text": "So like, why don't people do that?"}, {"time": 753, "text": "It seemed like conceptually is like, this sounds feasible."}, {"time": 753, "text": "You might be able to do it, you might be able to do it."}, {"time": 757, "text": "And you can actually, it's just very, very expensive."}, {"time": 761, "text": "So in a sense we do have alchemy and maybe even back then it wasn't as crazy that he was so into it, but people just don't like to talk about that as much."}, {"time": 768, "text": "But Newton in general was a very interesting fellow."}, {"time": 774, "text": "Anybody else come to mind?"}, {"time": 774, "text": "In terms of people that inspire you, in terms of people that you just are happy that they have once or still exist on this earth?"}, {"time": 788, "text": "I think, I mean, Freeman Dyson for me."}, {"time": 792, "text": "Yeah, Freeman Dyson was, I've had a chance to actually exchange a couple of emails with him."}, {"time": 797, "text": "It was probably one of the most humble scientists that I've ever met."}, {"time": 797, "text": "And that had a big impact on me."}, {"time": 803, "text": "We were trying, we're actually trying to convince him to annotate a paper on Fermat's library."}, {"time": 809, "text": "And I sent him an email asking him if he could annotate a paper."}, {"time": 809, "text": "And his response was something like, I have very limited knowledge."}, {"time": 817, "text": "I just know a couple of things about certain fields."}, {"time": 822, "text": "I'm not sure if I'm qualified to do that."}, {"time": 822, "text": "That was his first response."}, {"time": 822, "text": "And this was someone that should have won an Obel prize and worked on a bunch of different fields, did some really, really great work."}, {"time": 833, "text": "And then just the interactions that I had with him, every time I asked him a couple of questions about his papers, and he always responded saying, I'm not here to answer your questions."}, {"time": 845, "text": "I just want to open more questions."}, {"time": 845, "text": "And so that had a big impact on me."}, {"time": 845, "text": "It was like just an example of an extremely humble, yet accomplished scientist."}, {"time": 853, "text": "And Feynman was also a big, big inspiration in the sense that he was able to be, again, extremely talented and scientist, but at the same time, socially, he was able to, he was also really smart from a social perspective."}, {"time": 875, "text": "And he was able to interact with people."}, {"time": 875, "text": "He was also a really good teacher and was also to did awesome work in terms of explaining physics to the masses and motivating and getting people interested in physics."}, {"time": 889, "text": "And that for me was, was also a big inspiration."}, {"time": 894, "text": "I liked the childlike curiosity of some of those folks that you mentioned, Feynman."}, {"time": 897, "text": "I've, Daniel Kahneman, I got a chance to meet and interact with some of these truly special scientists."}, {"time": 903, "text": "What makes them special is that even in older age, there's still like, there's still that fire of childlike curiosity that burns."}, {"time": 910, "text": "And some of that is like not taking yourself so seriously that you think you've figured it all out, but almost like thinking that you don't know much of it."}, {"time": 921, "text": "And that's like step one in having a great conversation or collaboration or exploring a scientific question."}, {"time": 931, "text": "And it's cool how the very thing that probably earned people the Nobel prize or, or work that's seminal in some way is the very thing that still burns even after they've won the prize."}, {"time": 945, "text": "It's cool to see."}, {"time": 945, "text": "And they're rare humans, it seems."}, {"time": 950, "text": "And to that point, I remember like the last email that I sent to Freeman Dyson was like in his last birthday, he was really into number theory and primes."}, {"time": 954, "text": "So what I did is I took like a photo of him picture, and then I turned that into like a giant prime number."}, {"time": 960, "text": "So I converted the picture into a bunch of one and eights."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And then I moved some numbers around until it was a prime."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And then I sent him that."}, {"time": 973, "text": "Oh, so the, the visual, like it's still look like the picture, it's made up of a prime."}, {"time": 978, "text": "That's tricky to do."}, {"time": 978, "text": "It's hard to do."}, {"time": 978, "text": "It looks harder than it actually is."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So the way you do it is like you convert the darker regions into eights and the lighter regions in ones."}, {"time": 990, "text": "And then there's... And then just keep flipping numbers until..."}, {"time": 990, "text": "But there's like some primality tests that are cheaper from a computational standpoint."}, {"time": 995, "text": "But what it gives you is like it excludes numbers that are not prime."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Then you end up with a set of numbers that you don't know if they are prime or not."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "And then you run the full primality test on that."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So you just have to keep iterating on that."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And it was, it's funny because when you got the picture, it was like, how did you do that?"}, {"time": 1015, "text": "It was super curious too."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And then we got into the details."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And again, this was, it was already 90, I think 92 or something."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "And that curiosity was still there."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "So you can really see that in some of these scientists."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "So could we talk about Fermat's library?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "What's the main goal?"}, {"time": 1033, "text": "What's the dream?"}, {"time": 1038, "text": "It is a platform for annotating papers in its essence, right?"}, {"time": 1038, "text": "And so academic papers can be one of the densest forms of content out there and generally pretty hard to understand at times."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "And the idea is that you can make them more accessible and easier to understand by adding these rich annotations to the site, right?"}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And so we can just imagine a PDF view on your browser, and then you have annotations on each side."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "And then when you click on them, a sidebar expands and then you have annotations that support LaTeX and Markdown."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "And so the idea is that you can, say, explain a tougher part of a paper where there's a step that is not completely obvious."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "And then you can add more context to it."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "And then over time, papers can become easier and easier to understand and can evolve in a way."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "But it really came from myself, Luis, and two other friends."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "We've had this long running habit of kind of running a journal club amongst us."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "We come from different backgrounds, right?"}, {"time": 1097, "text": "I studied CS, we studied physics."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And so we'd read papers and present them to the each other."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And then we tried to bring some of that online."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "And that's when we decided to build Fermat's library."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And then over time, it kind of grew into something with a broader goal."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "And really, what we're trying to do is trying to help move science in the right direction."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "That's really the ultimate goal and where we want to take it now."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "Well, so there's a lot to be said."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So first of all, for people who haven't seen it, the interface is exceptionally well done."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "Execution is really important here."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "The other thing is just to mention for a large number of people, apparently, which is new to me, don't know what LaTeX is."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So it's spelled like LaTeX."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So be careful googling it if you haven't before."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "It's a, sorry, I don't even know the correct terminology."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Type setting language?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "It's a type setting language where you're basically program, writing a program that then generates something that looks, from a typography perspective, beautiful."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And so a lot of academics use it to write papers."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "I think there's like a bunch of communities that use it to write papers."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "I would say it's mathematics, physics, computer science."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "That's, yeah, that's the main."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Because I'm collaborating currently on a paper with two neuroscientists from Stanford."}, {"time": 1194, "text": "And they don't know LaTeX."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "So I'm using Microsoft Word and Mendeley, and like all of those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "And I'm being very zen like about the whole process, but it's fascinating."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "It's a little heartbreaking actually, because it actually, it's funny to say, but, and we'll talk about open science, actually, the bigger mission behind Fermat's library is like, really opening up the world of science to everybody."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "Is these silly two facts of like one community uses LaTeX and another uses Word, is actually a barrier between them."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "That's like, it's like boring and practical in a sense, but it makes it very difficult to collaborate."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "Just on that, like, I think there are some people that should have received like a Nobel Prize, but will never get it."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "And I think one of those is like Donald Knuth, because of tech and LaTeX."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "And then, because it had a huge impact in terms of like just making it easier for researchers to put their content out there, like making it uniform as much as possible."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Oh, you mean like a Nobel Peace Prize?"}, {"time": 1265, "text": "Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "I mean, he at a very young age, got the Turing Award for his work in algorithms and so on."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "So like an incredibly, I think it's in, it might be even the sixties, but I think it's the seventies."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "So when he was really young and then he went on to do like incredible work with his book and yeah, with tech that people don't know."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "And going back just on the reason why we ended up, because I think this is interesting."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "The reason why we ended up using the name Fermat's Library, this was because of Fermat's Last Theorem."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And Fermat's Last Theorem is actually a funny story."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "So Pierre de Fermat, he was like a lawyer and he wrote like on a book that he had a solution to Fermat's Last Theorem, which, but that didn't fit the margin of that book."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "And so Fermat's Last Theorem basically states that there's no solution."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "If you have integers a, b and c, there's no solution to a to the power of n plus b to the power of n equals to c to the power of n, if n is bigger than two."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "So there's no solutions."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And he said that, and that problem remained open for almost 300 years, I believe."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And a lot of the most famous mathematicians tried to tackle that problem."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "No one was able to figure that out until Andrew Wiles, I think was in the 90s, was able to publish the solution, which was, I believe, almost 300 pages long."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "And so it's kind of an anecdote that, you know, there's a lot of knowledge and insights that can be trapped in the margins."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "And there's a lot of potential energy that you can release if you actually spend some time trying to digest that."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "And that was the origin story for for the name."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "Yes, you can share the contents of the margins with the world that could inspire a solution or a communication that then leads to a solution."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And if you think about papers, like papers are, as Joan was saying, probably one of the densest pieces of text that any human can read."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "And you have these researchers, like some of the brightest minds in these fields, working on like new discoveries and publishing these work on journals that are imposing them restrictions in terms of the number of pages that they can have to explain a new scientific breakthrough."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "So at the end of the day, papers are not optimized for clarity and for a proper explanation of that content because there are so many restrictions."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "So there's, as I mentioned, there's a lot of potential energy that can be freed if you actually try to digest a lot of the contents of papers."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "Trey Lockerbie Can you explain some of the other things?"}, {"time": 1437, "text": "So margins, librarian, journal club?"}, {"time": 1442, "text": "Ofer Yusuf So journal club is what a lot of people know us for, where we every week, we release an annotated paper and in all sorts of different fields, but physics, CS, math, margins is kind of the same software that we use to run the journal club and to host the annotations."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "But we've made that available for free to anybody that wants to use it."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And so folks use it at universities and for running journal clubs."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "And so we've just made that freely available."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "And then librarian is a browser extension that we developed that is sort of an overlay on top of archive."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "So it's about bringing some of the same functionality around comments, plus adding some extra niceties to archive, like being able to very easily extract the references of a paper that you're looking at or being able to extract the bib deck in order to cite that paper yourself."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "So it's an overlay on top of archive."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "The idea is that you can have that commenting interface without having to leave archive."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "Trey Lockerbie It's kind of incredible."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "I didn't know about it."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "And once I learned of it, it's like, holy shit."}, {"time": 1501, "text": "Why isn't it more popular, given how popular archive is?"}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Like everybody should be using it."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "Archive sucks in terms of its interface."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "Let me rephrase that."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "It's limited in terms of its interface."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "Archive is a pretty incredible project."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "And it is, in a way, the growth has been completely linear over time."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "If you look at the number of papers published on archive, it's pretty much a straight line for the past 20 years."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "Especially if you're coming from a startup background and then you were trying to do archive, you'd probably try all sorts of growth acts and try to then maybe have paid features and things like that."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And that would kind of maybe ruin it."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And so there's a subtle balance there."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "And I don't know what aspects you can change about it."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "For some tools in science, it just takes time for them to grow."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "Archive has just turned 30, I believe."}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And for people that don't know, archive is these kind of online repositories where people put preprints, which are versions of the papers, before they actually make it to journals."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "A R X I V, for people who don't know."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "And it's actually a really vibrant place to publish your papers in the aforementioned communities of mathematics, physics, and computer science."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "It started with mathematics and physics, and then over the last 30 years, it evolved."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "And now, actually computer science now, it's a more popular category than physics and math on archive."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And there's also, which I don't know very much about, like a biology, medical version of that."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Bioarchive."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "Yeah, bioarchive."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "It's interesting because if you look at these platforms for preprints, they actually play a super important role."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "Because if you look at a category like math, for some papers in math, it might take close to three years after you click upload paper on the journal website, and the paper gets published on the website of the journal."}, {"time": 1628, "text": "So this is literally the longest upload period on the internet."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And during those three years, their content is just locked."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "And so that's why it's so important for people to have websites that are open to people to have websites like archive so that you can share that before it goes to the journal with the rest of the world."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "There was actually on archive that Perelman published the three papers that led to the proof of the Poincare conjecture."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "And then you have other fields like machine learning, for instance, where the field is evolving at such a high rate that people don't even wait before the papers go to journals before they start working on top of those papers."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "So they publish them on archive, then other people see them, they start working on that."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "And archive did a really good job at building that core platform to host papers."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "But I think there's a really, really big opportunity in building more features on top of that platform, apart from just hosting papers."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "So collaboration, annotations, and having other things apart from papers like code and other things."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "Because, for instance, in the field like machine learning, there's a really big, as I mentioned, people start working on top of preprints, and they are assuming that preprint is correct."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "But you really need a way, for instance, to maybe, it's not peer review, but distinguish what is good work from bad work on archive."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "So like a commenting interface like librarian, it's useful for that so that you can distinguish that in a field that is growing so fast as machine learning."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "And then you have platforms that focus, for instance, on just biology."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "BioArchive is a good example."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "BioArchive is also super interesting because there's actually an interesting experiment that was run in the 60s."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So in the 60s, the NIH supported this experiment called the Information Exchange Group, which at the time was a way for researchers to share biology preprints via mail or using libraries."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "And that project in the 1960s got canceled six years after it started."}, {"time": 1767, "text": "And it was due to intense pressure from the journals to kill that project because they were fearing competition from the preprints for the journal industry."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "Crick was one of the famous scientists that opposed to the Information Exchange Group."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "And it's interesting because right now, if you analyze the number of biology papers that appear first as preprints, it's only 2% of the papers."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "And this was almost 50 years after that first experiment."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "So you can see that pressure from the journals to cancel that initial version of a preprint repo had a tremendous impact on the number of papers that are showing up in biology as preprints."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So it delayed a lot that revolution."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "But now platforms like BioArchive are doing that work."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "But there's still a lot of room for growth there."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "And I think it's super important because those are the papers that are open that everyone can read."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "But if we just look at the entire process of science as a big system, can we just talk about how it can be revolutionized?"}, {"time": 1833, "text": "So you have an idea, depending on the field, you want to make that idea concrete, you want to run a few experiments in computer science, there might be some code, there'd be a data set for, you know, some of the more sort of biology, psychology, you might be collecting the data set that's called, you know, a study, right?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "So that's part of that, that's part of the methodology."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And so you are putting all that into a paper form."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And then you have some results."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "And then you submit that to a place for review through the peer review process."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "And there's a process where, how would you summarize the peer review process?"}, {"time": 1883, "text": "But it's really just like a handful of people look over your paper and comment."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "And based on that, decide whether your paper is good or not."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "So there's a whole broken nature to it."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "At the same time, I love the peer review process when I buy stuff on Amazon, like for like the commenting system, whatever that is."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "So there's a bunch of possibilities for revolutions there."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "And then there's the other side, which is the collaborative aspect of the science, which is people annotating, people commenting, sort of the low effort collaboration, which is a comment."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "Sometimes, as you've talked about, a comment can change everything."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "But, you know, or a higher effort collaboration, like more like maybe annotations, or even like contributing to the paper, you can think of like, collaborative updating of the paper over time."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "So there's all these possibilities for doing things better than they've been done."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Can we talk about some ideas in this space?"}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Some ideas that you're working on, some ideas that you're not yet working on, but should be revolutionized?"}, {"time": 1951, "text": "Because it does seem that archive and like open review, for example, are like the craigslist of science."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Like, like, yeah, okay."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "I'm very grateful that we have it."}, {"time": 1965, "text": "But it just feels like, it's like 10 to 20 years."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "Like, it doesn't feel like that's a feature."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "The simplicity of it is a feature."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "It feels like it's a, it's a bug."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "But then again, the pushback there is Wikipedia has the same kind of simplicity to it."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "And it seems to work exceptionally well in the crowdsourcing aspect of it."}, {"time": 1987, "text": "So I'm sorry, there's a bunch of stuff going on on the table."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "Let's just pick random things that we can talk about."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "Wikipedia, you know, for me, it's the cosmological constant of the internet."},

sense."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "It's like having a Google doc that everybody on the internet can edit."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And like, that will be like the most reliable source for knowledge."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And I don't know how many, but hundreds of thousands of topics."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And like you have, and then you have users, like there's one single user that edited one third of the articles on Wikipedia."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "So we have these really, really big power users."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "There are a substantial part of like what makes Wikipedia successful."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "And so like, no one would have ever imagined that that could happen."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "And so that's one thing."}, {"time": 2058,

the discussion of everything else."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "I also believe, I've seen that with Stack Overflow, that one individual or a small collection of individuals contribute or revolutionized most of the community."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "Like if you create a really powerful system for archive or like open review and made it really easy and compelling and exciting for one person who is like a 10x contributor to do their thing, that's going to change everything."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "It seems like that was the mechanism that changed everything for Wikipedia."}, {"time": 2097,

papers."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "No, Stack Overflow is another great example of that."}, {"time": 2125, "text": "And it's just, and those are both to do incredibly productive communities that generate a ton of value and capture almost none of it."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "And it's in a way, it's almost like, it's very counterintuitive that these communities would exist and thrive."}, {"time": 2149, "text": "And it's really hard to, there aren't that many communities like that."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "So how do we do that for science?"}, {"time": 2157, "text": "Do you have ideas there?"}, {"time": 2161, "text": "Like what are the biggest problems that you see?"}, {"time": 2161, "text": "You're working on some of them."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "Like just on that, there are a couple of really interesting experiments that people are running."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "An example would be like the Polymath projects."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "So this is a kind of a social experiment that was created by Tim Gowers, Fields Medalist."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "And his idea was to try to prove that, is it possible to do mathematics in a massively collaborative way on the internet?"}, {"time": 2182, "text": "So he decided to pick a couple of problems and test that."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "And they found out that it actually is possible for specific types of problems, namely problems that you're able to break down in little pieces and go step by step."}, {"time": 2202, "text": "You might need, as with open source, you might need people that are just kind of reorganizing the house every once in a while."}, {"time": 2208, "text": "And then people throw a bunch of ideas and then you make some progress, then you reorganize, you reframe the problem and you go step by step."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "But they were actually able to prove that it is possible to collaborate online and do progress in terms of mathematics."}, {"time": 2227, "text": "And so I'm confident that there are other avenues that could be explored here."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "Can we talk about peer review, for example?"}, {"time": 2236, "text": "I think in terms of the peer review, I think it's important to look at the bigger picture here of what the scientific publishing ecosystem looks like."}, {"time": 2243, "text": "Because for me, there are a lot of things that are wrong about that entire process."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "So if you look at what publishing means in a traditional journal, you have journals that pay authors for their articles, and then they might pay reviewers to review those articles."}, {"time": 2268, "text": "And finally, they pay people or distributors to distribute the content."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "In the scientific publishing world, you have scientists that are usually backed by government grants."}, {"time": 2282, "text": "They are giving away their work for free in the form of papers."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "And then you have other scientists that are reviewing their work."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "This process is known as the peer review process, again for free."}, {"time": 2293, "text": "And then finally, we have government backed universities and libraries that are buying back all that work so that other scientists can read."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "So this is, for me, it's bizarre."}, {"time": 2309, "text": "You have the government that is funding the research, it's paying the salaries of the scientists, it's paying the salaries of the reviewers, and it's buying back all that product of their work again."}, {"time": 2317, "text": "And I think the problem with this system and it's why it's so difficult to break this suboptimal equilibrium is because of the way academia works right now and the way you can progress in your academic life."}, {"time": 2332, "text": "And so in a lot of fields, the competition in academia is really insane."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "So you have hundreds of PhD students, they are trying to get to a professor position and it's hyper competitive."}, {"time": 2346, "text": "And the only way for you to get there is if you publish papers, ideally in journals with a high impact factor."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "In computer science, it's often conferences are also very prestigious or actually more prestigious than journals now."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So that's the one discipline where, I mean, that has to do with the thing we've discussed in terms of how quickly the field turns around."}, {"time": 2373, "text": "But like NeurIPS, CVPR, those conferences are more prestigious, or at the very least as prestigious as the journals."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "But it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "The process is what it is."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So for people that don't know, the impact factor of a journal is basically the average number of citations that a paper would get if it gets published on that journal."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "But so you can really think that the problem with the impact factor is that it's a way to turn papers into accounting units."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "And let me unpack this because the impact factor is almost like a nobility title."}, {"time": 2411, "text": "Because papers are born with impact even before anyone reads them."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "So the researchers, they don't have the incentive to care about if this paper is going to have a long term impact on the world."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "What they care, their goal, their end goal is the paper to get published so that they get that value upfront."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "So for me, that is one of the problems of that."}, {"time": 2437, "text": "And that really creates a tyranny of metrics."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "Because at the end of the day, if you are a dean, what you want to hire is people, researchers that publish papers on journals with high impact factors because that will increase the ranking of your university and will allow you to charge more for tuition, so on and so forth."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "And that, especially when you are in super competitive areas, that people will try to gamify that system and misconduct starts showing up."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "There's a really interesting book on this topic called Gaming the Metrics."}, {"time": 2474, "text": "It's a book by a researcher called Mario Biagioli."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "It goes a lot into how the impact factor and metrics affect science negatively."}, {"time": 2489, "text": "And it's interesting to think, especially in terms of citations, if you look at the early work of looking at citations, there was a lot of work that was done by a guy called Eugene Garfield."}, {"time": 2499, "text": "And this guy, the early work in terms of citation, they wanted to use citations from a descriptive point of view."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "So what they wanted to create was a map."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "And that map would create a visual representation of influence."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "So citations would be links between papers."}, {"time": 2512, "text": "And ideally, what they would show, they would represent is that you read someone else's paper and it had an impact on your research."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "They weren't supposed to be counted."}, {"time": 2525, "text": "I think this inspired Larry and Sergey's work for Google."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "I think they even mentioned that."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "But what happens is, as you start counting citations, you create a market."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "And the work of Eugene Garfield was a big inspiration for Larry and Sergey and for the PageRank algorithm that led to the creation of Google."}, {"time": 2545, "text": "And they even recognized that."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "And if you think about it, it's like the same way there's a gigantic market for search engine optimization, SEO, where people try to optimize the PageRank and how a web page will rank on Google."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "The same will happen for papers."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "People will try to optimize the impact factors and the citations that they get."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And that creates a really big problem."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And it's super interesting to actually analyze them."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "If you look at the distribution of the impact factors of journals, you have like Nature."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "Nature, I believe, is in the low 40s."}, {"time": 2585, "text": "And then you have, I believe, Science is high 30s."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "And then you have a really good set of good journals that will fall between 10 and 30."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And then you have a gigantic tale of journals that have impact factor below 2."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "And you can really see two economies here."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "You see the universities that are maybe less prestigious, less known, where the faculty are pressured to just publish papers regardless of the journal."}, {"time": 2615, "text": "What I want to do is increase the ranking of my university."}, {"time": 2621, "text": "And so they end up publishing as many papers as they can in journals with low impact factor."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "And unfortunately, this represents a lot of the global south."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "And then you have the luxury good economy."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "And there are also problems here in the luxury good economy."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "So if you look at the journal like Nature, so with impact factor in the low 40s, there's no way that you're going to be able to sustain that level of impact factor by just grabbing the attention of scientists."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "What I mean by that is for the journals, the articles that get published in Nature, they need to be New York Times grade."}, {"time": 2662, "text": "So they need to make it to the big media."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "They need to be captured by the big media."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "And because that's the only way for you to capture enough attention to sustain that level of citations."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "And that, of course, creates problems because people then will try to, again, gamify the system and have like titles or abstracts or that are bigger, make claims that are bigger than what is actually can be, you know, sustained by the data or the content of the paper."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "And you'll have clickbait titles or clickbait abstracts."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "And again, this is all a consequence of science or metrics."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "And this is a very dangerous cycle that I think it's very hard to break, but it's happening in academia in a lot of fields right now."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "Is it fundamentally the existence of metrics or the metrics just need to be significantly improved?"}, {"time": 2721, "text": "Because like I said, the metrics used for Amazon for purchasing, I don't know, computer parts is pretty damn good in terms of selecting which are the good ones, which are not."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "In that same way, if we had Amazon type of review system in the space of ideas, in the space of science, it feels like that those metrics would be a little bit better."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "Sort of when it's significantly more open to the crowdsource nature of the internet, of the scientific internet, meaning as opposed to, like my biggest problem with peer review has always been that it's like five, six, seven people, usually even less."}, {"time": 2762, "text": "And it's often, nobody's incentivized to do a good job in the whole process."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "Meaning it's anonymous in a way that doesn't incentivize, like doesn't gamify or incentivize great work."}, {"time": 2777, "text": "And also it doesn't necessarily have to be anonymous."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "Like there has to be, the entire system is, doesn't encourage actual sort of rigorous review."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "For example, like open review does kind of incentivize that kind of process of collaborative review, but it's also imperfect."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "But it just feels like the thing that Amazon has, which is like thousands of people contributing their reviews to a product, it feels like that could be applied to science where the same kind of thing you're doing with Fermat's library, but doing at a scale that's much larger."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "It feels like that should be possible given the number of grad students, given the number of general public that's getting, for example, I personally, as a person who got an education in mathematics and computer science, like I can be a quote unquote, like reviewer on a lot bigger set of things than is my exact expertise."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "If I'm one of thousands of reviewers, if I'm the only reviewer, one of five, then I better be like an expert in the thing."}, {"time": 2863, "text": "But if I, and I've learned this with COVID, which is like, you can just use your basic skills as a data analyst to contribute to the review process and a particular little aspect of a paper and be able to comment, be able to sort of draw in some references that challenge the ideas presented or to enrich the ideas that are presented."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "It just feels like crowdsourcing the review process would be able to allow you to have metrics in terms of how good a paper is that are much better representative of its actual impact in the world, of its actual value to the world, as opposed to some kind of arbitrary, gamified version of its impact."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "I think there's definitely the possibility, at least for a more resilient system than what we have today."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "And I think that's kind of what you're describing, Alex."}, {"time": 2921, "text": "I mean, to an extent, we kind of have like a little bit of a Heisenberg uncertainty principle."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "When you pick a metric, as soon as you do it, then maybe it works as a good heuristic for a short amount of time, but soon enough, people would start gamifying."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "But then you can definitely have metrics that are more resilient to gamification and they'll work as a better heuristic to try to push you in the best direction."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "But I guess down the line, the underlying problem you're saying is there's a shortage of positions in academia."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "That's a big problem for me."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "And that, and so they're going to be constantly gamifying the metrics."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "It's a bit of a zero sum game."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "It's a very competitive field."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "And that's what usually happens in very competitive fields."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "But I think some of the peer review problems, like scale helps, I think."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "And it's interesting to look at what you're mentioning, breaking it down, maybe in like smaller parts and having more people jumping in."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "But this is definitely a problem."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "And the peer review problem, as I mentioned, is correlated with the problem of academic career progression."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "And it's all intertwined."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "And that's why I think it's so hard to break it."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "There are a couple of really interesting things that are being done right now."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "There are a couple of, for instance, journals that are overlay journals on top of platforms like archive and bio archive that want to remove like the more traditional journals from the equation."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "So essentially a journal is just a collection of links to papers."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "And what they're trying to do is like removing that middleman and trying to make the review process a little bit more transparent

problem there is getting to critical mass."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "So it's again, convincing the researchers and especially the young researchers that need that impact factor, need those

high profile scientists of people like Tim Gowers."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "They are trying to incentivize like famous scientists that already have tenure and that don't need that to publish that to increase the reputation of those journals."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "So that other maybe younger scientists can start publishing on those as well."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "And so that you can try to break that vicious cycle of the more traditional journals."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "I mean, another possible way to break this cycle is to like raise public awareness and just by force, like ban paid journals."}, {"time": 3099, "text": "Like what exactly are they contributing to the world?"}, {"time": 3099, "text": "Like basically making it illegal to forget the fact that it's mostly

everything."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "Like people should be outraged that there's these gates."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "Because, so the moment you dissolve the journals, then there will be an

really tried to make science accessible in the following way."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "Like, besides doing Google Scholar, they haven't like delved into the papers, right?"}, {"time": 3234, "text":

connected with how papers reference each other and like building a network out of that."}, {"time": 3244, "text": "Interestingly enough, like Google, I think there was a, there was not intended, Google Plus was like the Google social network that got cancelled, was used by a lot of researchers."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "Which I think was just a, you know, side, kind of a side effect."},

haven't gone past Google Scholar and I don't know why."}, {"time": 3263, "text": "Well, that said, Google Scholar is incredible."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "For people who are not familiar, it's one of the best aggregation of all the scientific work that's out there and especially the network that connects to all of them."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "What sites, what."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "And also trying to aggregate all of the versions of the papers that are available there and trying to merge them in a way that one particular work, even though it's available in a bunch of places, counts as, you know, like a central hub of what that work is, according to multiple versions."}, {"time": 3296, "text": "But that almost seems like a fun pet project of a couple of engineers within within Google, as opposed to a serious effort to make the world science accessible."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "But going back to just the journals, when you're talking about that, Lex, I believe that in that front, I think we might be past the event horizon."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "So I think the model, the business model for the journals, you know, doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "They're a middle layer that is not adding a lot of value."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "And you see a lot of motions, whereas like in Europe, a lot of the papers that are funded by the European Union,

serves to show that there should be other ways to publish like scientific discoveries that don't fit the paper format."}, {"time": 3577, "text": "Well, but so even with the Twitter thread, it would be nice to have some mechanism of formalizing it and making it into an NFT."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "Like a concrete thing that you can reference as a link that's unique."}, {"time": 3592, "text":

you, constraints forces you to narrow down your thing and literally put it on paper."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "But, you know, make concrete."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "And that's why, I mean, it's not broken."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "It just could be better."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "And that's the main idea."}, {"time": 3629, "text": "I think there's something about writing, whether it's a blog post or Twitter thread or a paper, that's really nice to concretize a particular little idea that can then be referenced by other ideas, then it can be built on top of with other ideas."},

itself."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "How do you advise people read papers?"}, {"time": 3661, "text": "Or maybe you want to broaden it beyond just papers, but just read concrete pieces of information to understand the insights that labeled in."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "I would say for paper specifically, I would bring back kind of what Louise was talking about, is that it's important to keep in mind that papers are not optimized for ease of understanding."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "And so, right, there's all sorts of restrictions and size and format and language that they can use."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "And so it's important to keep that in mind."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "And so that if you're struggling to read a paper, that might not mean that the underlying material is actually that hard."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "And so that's definitely something that, especially for us, that we read papers and most of the time the papers are completely outside of our comfort zone, I guess."}, {"time": 3713, "text": "And so it would be completely new areas to us."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "So I always try to keep that in mind."}, {"time": 3719, "text": "So there's usually a certain kind of structure, like abstract introductions, methodology, depending on the community and so on."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "Is there something about the process of how to read it, whether you want to skim it to try to find the parts that are easy to understand or not, reading it multiple times?"}, {"time": 3739, "text": "Is there any kind of hacks that you can comment on?"}, {"time": 3746, "text": "I remember like Feynman had this kind of hack when he was reading papers, where you would basically, I think I believe you would read the conclusion of the paper."}, {"time": 3759, "text": "And we would try to just see if he would be able to figure out how to get to the conclusion in like a couple of minutes by himself."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "And he would read a lot of papers that way."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "And I think Fermi also did that almost."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "And Fermi was known for doing a lot of back of the envelope calculation."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "So he was a master at doing that."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "And in terms of like, especially when reading a paper, I think a lot of times people might feel discouraged about the first time you read it."}, {"time": 3788, "text": "You know, it's very hard to grasp or you don't understand a huge fraction of the paper."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And I think it's having read a lot of papers in my life, I think I'm in peace with like the fact that you might spend hours where you're just reading a paper and jumping from paper to paper, reading citations."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "And like your level of understanding sometimes of the paper is very close to 0%."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "And all of a sudden, you know, everything kind of makes sense in your mind."}, {"time": 3818, "text": "And then, you know, you have this quantum jump where all of a sudden you understand the big picture of the paper."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "And this is an exercise that I have to do when reading papers and especially like more complex papers, like, okay, you don't understand because you're just going through the process and just keep going."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "And like, it might feel super chaotic, especially if you're jumping from reference to reference."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "You know, you might end up with like 20 tabs open and you're reading a ton of other papers, but it's just trusting that process that at the end, like you'll find light."}, {"time": 3852, "text": "And I think for me, that's a good framework when reading a paper."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "It's hard because, you know, you might end up spending a lot of time and it looks like you're lost, but that's the process to actually, you know, understand what they're talking about in the paper."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Yeah, I think that process, I enjoy, I've found a lot of value in the process, especially for things outside my field of reading a lot of related work sections and kind of going down that path of getting a big context of the field."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "Because what's, especially when they're well written, there's opinions injected into the really related work."}, {"time": 3892, "text": "Like what work is important, what is not."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "And if you read multiple related work sections that cite or don't cite each other, like the papers, you get a sense of where the field, where the tensions of the field are, where the field is striving."}, {"time": 3909, "text": "And that helps you put into context, like whether the work is radical, whether it's overselling itself, whether it's underselling itself, all those things."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "And added on top of that, I find that often the related work section is the most kind of accessible and readable part of a paper because it's kind of, it's brief to the point, it's like summarizing, it's almost like a Wikipedia style article."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "The introduction is supposed to be a compelling story or whatever, but it's often like overselling, there's like an agenda in the introduction."}, {"time": 3949, "text": "The related work usually has the least amount of agenda except for the few like elements where you're trying to talk shit about previous work where you're trying to sell that you're doing much better."}, {"time": 3958, "text": "But other than that, when you're just painting where the field came from or where the field stands, that's really valuable."}, {"time": 3965, "text": "And also again, just to agree with Fionn in the conclusion, I get a lot of value from the breadth first search, kind of read the conclusion, then read the related work, and then go through the references in the related work, read the conclusion, read the related work, and just go down the tree until you like hit dead ends or run out of coffee."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "And then through that process, you go back up the tree and now you can see the results in their proper context, unless of course the paper is truly revolutionary, which even that process will help you understand that is in fact truly revolutionary."}, {"time": 4002, "text": "You've also, you talked about just following your Twitter thread in depth first search."}, {"time": 4010, "text": "You talked about that you read the book on Grisha Perlman, Grigori Perlman,

{"time": 4033, "text": "Whether it's we're talking about annotations or just for yourself to try to put on paper ideas as you progress through the work in order to then like understand the work better."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "For me, I always try not to underestimate how much you can forget within six months after you've read something."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "I thought you were going to say five minutes, but yeah, six months is good."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "Yeah, or even shorter."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "And so that's something that I always try to keep in mind."}, {"time": 4054, "text": "And it's often, I mean, every once in a while I'll read back a paper that I annotated on Fermat and I'll read through my own annotations and I've completely forgotten what I had written."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "But it's interesting because in a way, after you just understood something, you're kind of the best possible teacher that can teach your future self."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "After you've forgotten it, you're kind of your own best possible teacher at that moment."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "And so it can be great to try to capture that."}, {"time": 4099,

{"time": 4113, "text": "That's under explored, but it's super powerful because you were the person that you can, if you look at the scale from one not knowing anything about the topic and 10, you are the one that progressed from one to 10 and you know which steps you struggled with."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "So you're really the best person to help yourself make that transition from one to 10."}, {"time": 4133, "text": "And a lot of the times, I really believe that the framework that we have to expose ourselves to be talking to us when we were an expert, when we were taking that class and we knew everything about quantum mechanics."}, {"time": 4147, "text": "And then six months later, you don't remember half of the things."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "How could we make it easier to have those conversations between you and your past expert self?"}, {"time": 4159, "text": "I think there might be, it's an under explored idea."}, {"time": 4159, "text": "I think notes on paper are probably not the best way."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "I'm not sure if it's a combination of video, audio, where it's like you have a guided framework that you follow to extract information from yourself so that you can later kind of revisit to make it easier to remember."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "But that's, I think it's an interesting idea worth exploring that I haven't seen a lot of people kind of trying to distill that problem."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "Yeah, I'm creating the kind of tools."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "I find if I record, it sounds weird, but I'll take notes, but if I record audio, like little clips of thoughts, like rants, that's really effective at capturing something that notes can't."}, {"time": 4209, "text": "Because when I replay them, for some reason, it loads my brain back into where I was when I was reading that in a way that notes don't."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "Like when I read notes, I'll often be like, what?"}, {"time": 4222, "text": "What was I thinking there?"}, {"time": 4222, "text": "But when I listened to the audio, it brings you right back to that place."}, {"time": 4229, "text": "And maybe with video, with visual, that might be even more powerful."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "And I think just the process of verbalizing it, that alone kind of makes you have to structure your thought and put it in a way that somebody else could come and understand it."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "And just the process of that is useful to organize your thoughts and yeah, just that alone."}, {"time": 4258, "text": "Does the Fermat's Library

that happening too much."}, {"time": 4276, "text": "But we were actually playing around with the idea of creating some sort of podcast version where we try to distill the paper on an audio format that

even bring the authors to the conversation, but it's tricky."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "And especially for like more technical papers."}, {"time": 4304, "text": "We've thought about doing that, but we haven't converged."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "I'm not sure if you have any tips."}, {"time": 4315, "text": "Well, I'm going to take that as a small project to take one of the Fermat's almost like half

they were under a siege, they could just easily destroy that aqueduct, and then the water wouldn't have any water supply."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "The city wouldn't have any water supply."}, {"time": 4611, "text": "And so they decided to build a tunnel, and they decided to try to do it quickly."}, {"time": 4617, "text": "And so they started digging from both ends at the same time through the mountain."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "And so when you start thinking about this, it's a fairly difficult problem."}, {"time": 4632, "text": "And this is like sixth century BC, so you had very limited access to the mathematical tools that you had at the time, were very limited."}, {"time": 4640, "text": "And so what this paper is about is about the story of how they built it and about the fact that for about 2000 years, kind of the accepted explanation of how they built it was actually wrong."}, {"time": 4652, "text": "And so this tunnel has been famous for a while."}, {"time": 4658, "text": "There are a number of historians that talked about it since ancient Egypt."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "And the method that they described for building it was just wrong."}, {"time": 4663, "text": "And so these researchers went there and were able to figure that out."}, {"time": 4674, "text": "And so basically, kind of the way that they thought they had built it was basically, if you can imagine looking at the mountain from the top, and you have the mountain and then you have both entrances."}, {"time": 4686, "text": "And so what they thought, and this is what the ancient historians described, is that they effectively tried to draw a right angle triangle with the two entrances at each end of the hypotenuse."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "And the way they did it is like they would go around the mountain and kind of walking in a grid fashion."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "And then you can figure out the two sides of the triangle."}, {"time": 4712, "text": "And then after you have that triangle, you can effectively draw two smaller triangles at each entrance that are proportional to that big triangle."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "And then you kind of have arrows pointing in each way."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "And then you know at least that you have a line going through the mountain that connects both entrances."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "The issue with that is like once you go to this mountain and you start thinking of doing this, you realize that especially given that the tools that they had at the time, that your error margin would be too small."}, {"time": 4746, "text": "You wouldn't be able to do it."}, {"time": 4754, "text": "Just the fact of trying to build this triangle in that fashion, the error would accumulate and you would end up missing."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "You'd start building these tunnels and they would miss each other."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "So the task ultimately is to figure out like really perfectly as close as possible the direction you should be digging."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "First of all that it's possible to have a straight line through and then what that the direction would be."}, {"time": 4775, "text": "And then you are trying to infer that by constructing a right triangle by doing."}, {"time": 4782, "text": "I'm not exactly sure about how to do that rigorously like by tracing the mountain, by walking along the mountain."}, {"time": 4789, "text": "You said grids?"}, {"time": 4789, "text": "Yeah you kind of walk as if you were in a grid and so you just walk in right angles."}, {"time": 4795, "text": "But then you have to walk really precisely then."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "You have to use tools to measure this and the terrain is probably a mess."}, {"time": 4800, "text": "So this makes more sense in 2D and 3D gets even weirder."}, {"time": 4807, "text": "So okay gotcha."}, {"time": 4807, "text": "But so this method was described by like an ancient Egyptian historian."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "I think hero of Alexandria."}, {"time": 4814, "text": "And then for about like yeah for about 2000 years that's how we thought that they had built this tunnel."}, {"time": 4820, "text": "And then these researchers went there and found out that actually they must have had to use other methods."}, {"time": 4828, "text": "And then in this paper they describe these other methods and of course they can't know for sure."}, {"time": 4835, "text": "But there's they present a bunch of plausible alternatives."}, {"time": 4841, "text": "The one that for me was is the most plausible is that what they probably must have done is to use something that is similar to an iron sight on a rifle."}, {"time": 4852, "text": "The way you can line up your rifle with a target off in the distance by having an iron sight."}, {"time": 4860, "text": "And they must have done something similar to that effectively with three sticks."}, {"time": 4868, "text": "And that way they were able to line up sticks along the side of the mountain that were all on the same height."}, {"time": 4876, "text": "And so that then you could get to the other side and you could and then you could draw that line."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "So this for me is the most plausible way that they might have done that."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "But then they described this in detail and other possible approaches in this paper."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "So this is a mathematician doing this?"}, {"time": 4894, "text": "Yeah this is a mathematician that did this."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "Which I suppose is the right mindset instead of skills required to solve an ancient problem right?"}, {"time": 4906, "text": "There's mathematicians and engineers a lot of things."}, {"time": 4906, "text": "Because they didn't have computers or drones or lidar back then or whatever technology you would use modern day for the civil engineering."}, {"time": 4918, "text": "Another fascinating thing is that like you know after effectively after the the downfall of the Roman civilization people didn't build tunnels for about a thousand years."}, {"time": 4929, "text": "We go a thousand years without tunnels and then like only in like in late middle ages that we start doing them again."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "But here is the tunnel like sixth century BC like incredibly limited mathematics and they and they build it in this way."}]}]
