[{"title": "Chris Blattman: War and Violence | Lex Fridman Podcast #273", "id": "DbXjoXnIxQo", "quotes": [{"time": 308, "text": "Two gangs going to war you'd think is really different, and of course it is, but there are some common principles."}, {"time": 313, "text": "You can just think about conflict and the use of violence and not learn everything, but just get a lot, just get really, really far by sort of seeing the commonalities rather than just focusing on the differences."}, {"time": 324, "text": "So again, those words are prolonged, groups, and violent."}, {"time": 328, "text": "Can you maybe linger on each of those words?"}, {"time": 331, "text": "What does prolonged mean?"}, {"time": 333, "text": "Where's the line between short and long?"}, {"time": 336, "text": "What does groups mean, and what does violent mean?"}, {"time": 339, "text": "So let me, you know, I have a friend who, someone who's become a friend through the process of my work and writing this book also, who was 20, 30 years ago, was a gang leader in Chicago."}, {"time": 353, "text": "So this guy named Napoleon English, or NAP."}, {"time": 355, "text": "And I remember one time he was saying, well you know, when I was young I used to, I was 15, 16, and he'd go to the neighboring gang's territory, he says I'd go gang banging, and I said, well, I didn't know what that meant."}, {"time": 366, "text": "I said, what does that mean?"}, {"time": 367, "text": "And he said, oh, that just meant I'd shoot him up."}, {"time": 369, "text": "Like I'd shoot at buildings, I might shoot at people."}, {"time": 373, "text": "I wasn't trying to kill, he wasn't trying to kill them."}, {"time": 375, "text": "He was just trying to sort of send a signal that he was a tough guy, and he was fearless, and he was someone who they should be careful with."}, {"time": 384, "text": "And so I didn't want to call that war, right?"}, {"time": 387, "text": "That was, that's something different."}, {"time": 390, "text": "That was, it was short, it was kind of sporadic, and he wasn't, and he was basically trying to send them information."}, {"time": 397, "text": "And this is what countries do all the time, right?"}, {"time": 400, "text": "We have military parades, and we might have border skirmishes, and I wanted to sort of, so what's short is a three month border skirmish, a war, I mean, I don't try to get into those things."}, {"time": 415, "text": "I don't want to, but I want to point out that like, these long, grueling months and years of violence are like the problem and the puzzle."}, {"time": 424, "text": "And I just, I didn't want to spend a lot of time talking about the international version of gang banging."}, {"time": 432, "text": "It's a different phenomenon."}, {"time": 433, "text": "So what is it about Napoleon that doesn't nap, let's call him, not to add confusion, that doesn't qualify for war?"}, {"time": 441, "text": "Is it the individual aspect?"}, {"time": 443, "text": "Is it that violence is not the thing that is sought, but the communication of information is what is sought?"}, {"time": 455, "text": "Or is it the shortness of it?"}, {"time": 457, "text": "Is it all of those combined?"}, {"time": 459, "text": "It's a little bit, I mean, he was the head of a group, or he's becoming the head of a group at that point."}, {"time": 465, "text": "And that group eventually did go to war with those neighboring gangs, which is to say it was just long, drawn out conflict over months and months and months."}, {"time": 473, "text": "But I think one of the big insights from my fields is that you're constantly negotiating over something, right?"}, {"time": 482, "text": "Whether you're officially negotiating or you're all posturing, you're bargaining over something and you should be able to figure out a way to split that pie."}, {"time": 492, "text": "And you could use violence."}, {"time": 494, "text": "But violence is, everybody's miserable."}, {"time": 496, "text": "Like if you're nap, like if you start a war, one, there's lots of risks."}, {"time": 499, "text": "You could get killed, that's not good."}, {"time": 502, "text": "You could kill somebody else and go to jail, which is what happened to him, that's not good."}, {"time": 506, "text": "Your soldiers get killed, no one's buying your drugs in the middle of a gunfight, so it interrupts your business."}, {"time": 511, "text": "And so on and on, it's really miserable."}, {"time": 512, "text": "This is what we're seeing right now, as we're recording the Russian invasion of Ukraine is now at the fourth or fifth week."}, {"time": 520, "text": "Everybody's, if it didn't dawn on them before, it's dawned on them now just how brutal and costly this is."}, {"time": 527, "text": "As you describe for everybody."}, {"time": 529, "text": "So everybody is losing in this war."}, {"time": 531, "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's maybe the insight."}, {"time": 533, "text": "Everybody loses something from war."}, {"time": 536, "text": "And there was usually, not always, but the point is there was usually a way to get what you wanted or be better off without having to fight over it."}, {"time": 545, "text": "So there's this, fighting is just politics by other means."}, {"time": 550, "text": "And it's just inefficient, costly, brutal, devastating means."}, {"time": 554, "text": "And so that's like the deep insight."}, {"time": 556, "text": "And so I kind of wanted to say, so I guess like what's not war?"}, {"time": 560, "text": "I mean, I don't try to belabor the definitions because there's reams and reams of political science papers written on like what's a war, what's not a war."}, {"time": 570, "text": "People disagree."}, {"time": 574, "text": "I just wanted to say, war is the thing that we shouldn't be doing."}, {"time": 578, "text": "Or war is the violence that doesn't make sense."}, {"time": 581, "text": "There's a whole bunch of other violence, including gang banging and skirmishes and things that might make sense, precisely because they're cheap ways of communicating or they're not particularly costly."}, {"time": 593, "text": "War is the thing that's just so costly we should be trying to avoid is maybe like the meta way I think about it."}, {"time": 600, "text": "Nevertheless, definitions are interesting."}, {"time": 602, "text": "So outside of the academic bickering, every time you try to define something, I'm a big fan of it, the process illuminates."}, {"time": 613, "text": "So the destination doesn't matter because the moment you arrive at the definition, you lose the power."}, {"time": 620, "text": "Yeah, one of the interesting thing, I mean, so people, if you wanna do, some of what I do is just quantitative analysis of conflict."}, {"time": 626, "text": "And if you wanna do that, if you wanna sort of run statistics on war, then you have to code it all up."}, {"time": 632, "text": "And then lots of people have done that."}, {"time": 634, "text": "There's four or five major data sets where people or teams of people have over time said, we're gonna code years of war between these groups or within a country."}, {"time": 644, "text": "And what's interesting is how difficult, these data sets don't often agree."}, {"time": 648, "text": "You have to make all of these, the decision gets really complicated."}, {"time": 651, "text": "Like when does the war begin, right?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "Does it begin when a certain number of people have been killed?"}, {"time": 658, "text": "Did it begin, what if there's like lots of skirmishing and sort of little terror attacks or a couple bombs lobbed and then eventually turns into war?"}, {"time": 668, "text": "Do we backdate it to like when the first act of violence started?"}, {"time": 673, "text": "And then what do we do with all the times when there was like that low scale, low intensity violence or bombs lobbed and do we call those wars or maybe only if they eventually get worse?"}, {"time": 684, "text": "Like, so you get, it actually is really tricky."}, {"time": 686, "text": "And the defensive and the offensive aspect."}, {"time": 688, "text": "So everybody, Hitler in World War II, it seems like he never attacked anybody."}, {"time": 694, "text": "He's always defending against the unjust attack of everybody else as he's taken over the world."}, {"time": 701, "text": "So that's like information propaganda that every side is trying to communicate to the world."}, {"time": 708, "text": "So you can't listen to necessarily information like self report data."}, {"time": 712, "text": "You have to kind of look past that somehow."}, {"time": 715, "text": "Maybe look, especially in the modern world as much as possible at the data."}, {"time": 718, "text": "How many bombs dropped?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "How many people killed?"}, {"time": 723, "text": "How the number of estimates of the number of troops moved from one location to another and that kind of thing."}, {"time": 729, "text": "And the other interesting thing is there's quantitative analysis of war."}, {"time": 733, "text": "So for example, I was looking at just war index or people trying to measure, trying to put a number on what wars are seen as just and not."}, {"time": 744, "text": "Oh really, I've never seen that."}, {"time": 746, "text": "It's, there's numbers behind it."}, {"time": 750, "text": "So it's great because again, as you do an extensive quantification of justice, you start to think what actually contributes to our thought that for example, World War II is a just war and other wars are not."}, {"time": 769, "text": "A lot of it is about intent and some of the other factors like that you look at which is prolonged, the degree of violence that is necessary versus not necessary given the greater good, some measure of the greater good of people, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 786, "text": "Then there's reasons for war, you know, looking to free people or to stop a genocide versus conquering land, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 797, "text": "And people try to put a number behind it."}, {"time": 799, "text": "And a lot of."}, {"time": 800, "text": "It's based on, I mean, what I'm trying to imagine is, I mean, suppose I wake up and, or whatever, suppose I think my God tells me to do something or my God thinks that, or my moral sense thinks that something that another group is doing is repugnant."}, {"time": 816, "text": "I'm curious, are they evaluating the validity of that claim or just the idea that like, well, you said it was repugnant, you deeply believe that, therefore it's just?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "I think, and that could be corrected on a lot of this, but I think this is always looking at wars after they happened and trying to take a global perspective from all sort of a general survey of how people perceive."}, {"time": 840, "text": "So you're not weighing disproportionately the opinions of the people who waged the war."}, {"time": 845, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I kind of ended up dodging that because, I mean, one is to just point out that wars, actually most wars aren't necessary."}, {"time": 856, "text": "And so in the sense that there's another way to get what you wanted."}, {"time": 862, "text": "And so on one level, there's no just war."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Now that's not true because take an example like the US invasion of Afghanistan."}, {"time": 870, "text": "The United States has been attacked."}, {"time": 872, "text": "There's a culpable agent, reliable evidence that this is Al Qaeda."}, {"time": 879, "text": "They're being sheltered in Afghanistan by the Taliban."}, {"time": 883, "text": "And then the Taliban, this is a bit murky."}, {"time": 886, "text": "It seems that there was an attempt to say hand him over or else and they said, no way."}, {"time": 893, "text": "Now you can make an argument that invading and attacking is strategically the right thing to do in terms of sending signals to your future enemies or if you think it's important to bring someone to justice, in this case, Al Qaeda, then maybe that's just war or that's a just invasion."}, {"time": 911, "text": "But it hinges on the fact that the other side just didn't do the seemingly sensible thing, which is say, okay, we'll give them up."}, {"time": 920, "text": "And so it was completely avoidable in one sense."}, {"time": 926, "text": "But if you believe, and I think it's probably true, if you believe that for their own ideological and other reasons, you know, Mullah Omar in particular and Taliban in general decided we're not going to do this, then now you're not left with very many good choices."}, {"time": 945, "text": "And now, you know, I didn't wanna talk about is that a just war or is that, what's justice or not?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "I just wanted to point out that like one side's intransigence, if that's indeed what happened, one side's intransigence sort of maybe compels you to basically eliminates all of the reasonable bargains that you could be satisfied with and now you're left with really no other strategic option but to invade."}, {"time": 968, "text": "I think that's a slight oversimplification, but I think that's like one way to describe what happened."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So your book is fascinating and your perspective on this is fascinating."}, {"time": 978, "text": "I'll try to sort of play devil's advocate at times to try to get a clarity."}, {"time": 982, "text": "But the thesis is that war is costly, usually costly for everybody."}, {"time": 990, "text": "So that's what you mean when you say nobody wants war because you're going to, from a game theoretic perspective, nobody wins."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "And so war is essentially a breakdown of reason, a breakdown of negotiation, of healthy communication or healthy operation of the world, some kind of breakdown."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "You list all kinds of ways in which it breaks down."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "But there's also human beings in this mix."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "And there is ideas of justice."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "So for example, I don't want to, my memory doesn't serve me well on which wars were seen as justice, very, very few in the 20th century of the many that have been there."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "The wars that were seen as just, first of all, the most just war seen is World War II by far."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "It's actually the only one that goes above a threshold that's seen as just, everything that's seen as unjust."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "It's less, it's like degrees of unjustness."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "And I think the ones that are seen as more just are the ones that are fast, that you have a very specific purpose, you communicate that purpose honestly with the global community, and you strike hard, fast, and you pull out to do sort of, it's like rescue missions."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "It's almost like policing work."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "If there's somebody suffering, you go in and stop that suffering directly, and that's it."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "I think World War II is seen in that way, that there's an obvious aggressor that is causing a lot of suffering in the world and looking to expand the scale of that suffering."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And so you strike, I mean, given the scale, you strike as hard and as fast as possible to stop the expansion of the suffering."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "So that's kind of how they see."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "I don't know if you can kind of look with this framework that you've presented and look at Hitler and think, well, it's not in his interest to attack Czechoslovakia, Poland, Britain, France, Russia, the Soviet Union, America, the United States of America, same with Japan."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "Is it in their long term interest?"}, {"time": 1144, "text": "So for me, who cares about alleviating human suffering in the world, yes, it's not."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "It seems like almost no war is just."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "But it also seems somehow deeply human to fight."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "And I think your book makes the case, no, it's not."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "Can you try to get at that?"}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Because it seems that war, there is some, that drama of war seems to beat in all human hearts."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Like it's in there somewhere."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "Maybe it's, maybe that's like a relic of the past and we need to get rid of it."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "It's deeply irrational."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "Okay, so obviously we go to war and obviously there's a lot of violence."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "And so we have to explain something and some of that's going to be aspects of our humanness."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "So I guess what I wanted us to sort of start with, I think it was just useful to sort of start and point out, actually, there's really, really, really, really strong incentives not to go to war because it's gonna be really costly."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "And so all of these other human or strategic things, all these things, the circumstantial things that will eventually lead us to go to war have to be pretty powerful before we go there."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "And most of the time."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "And that's why you also describe very importantly that war throughout human history is actually rare."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "We usually avoid it."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "You know, most people don't know about the US invasion of Haiti in 1994."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "I mean, a lot of people know about it, but people just don't pay attention to it."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "We don't, we're gonna, you know, the history books and school kids are gonna learn about the invasion of Afghanistan for decades and decades, and nobody's going to put this one in the history books."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And it's because it didn't actually happen because before the troops could land, the person who'd taken power in a coup basically said fine."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "There's this famous story where Colin Powell goes to Haiti, to this new dictator who's refused to let a Democratic president take power."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "And tries to convince him to step down or else."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "And he says, no, no, no."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "And then he shows him a video, and it's basically troop planes and all these things taking off."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "And he's like, this is not live."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "This is two hours ago."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "So it's a, and basically he basically gives up right there."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "So that was."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "That's a powerful move."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "I think Powell might've been one of his teachers in like a US military college, because a lot of these military dictators trained at some point."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "So they had some, there was some personal relationships at least between people in the US government and this guy that they were trying to use."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "The point is, and that's like what should have happened."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "That makes sense, right?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "Like, yeah, maybe I could mount an insurgency and yeah, I'm not gonna bear a lot of the cost of war cause I'm the dictator."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "And maybe he's human and he just wants to fight or gets angry or it's just in his mind, whatever he's doing."}, {"time": 1318, "text": "But at the end of the day, it's like, this does not make sense."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "And that's what happens most of the time, but we don't write so many books about it."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "And now some political scientists go and they count up all of the nations that could fight cause they have some dispute and they're right next to one another, or they look at the ethnic groups that could fight with one another cause there's some tension and they're right next to one another."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "And then whatever, some number like 999 out of 1000 don't fight because they just find some other way."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "They don't like each other, but they just loathe in peace because that's the sensible thing to do."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "And that's what we all do, we loathe in peace."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "And we loathed the Soviet Union in relative peace for decades and India loathes Pakistan in peace."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "I mean, two weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, again, it was in the newspapers, but most people didn't, I think, take note."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "India accidentally launched a cruise missile at Pakistan and common suit."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "So they were like, yeah, this is, we do not want to go to war."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "This will be bad."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "We'll be angry, but we'll accept your explanation that this was an accident."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "And so these things find to the radar."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "And so we overestimate, I think, how likely it is the sides are gonna fight."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "But then of course, things do happen."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "Like Russia did invade the Ukraine and didn't find some negotiated deal."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "And so then the book is sort of about half the book is just sort of laying out, actually like there's just different ways this breaks down."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And some of them are human."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Some of them are this, I actually don't think war beats in our heart."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "It does a little bit, but we're actually very cooperative."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "As a species, we're deeply, deeply cooperative."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "We're really, really good."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "So the thing we're not, we're okay at violence and we're okay getting angry and vengeance and we have principles that will sometimes lead us, but we're actually really, really, really good at cooperation."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "And so that's, again, I'm not trying to write some big optimistic book where everything's gonna be great and we're all happy and we don't really fight."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "It's more just to say, let's start, let's be like a doctor."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "As a doctor, we're gonna focus on the sick, right?"}, {"time": 1450, "text": "I'm gonna try, I know there's sick people, but I'm gonna recognize that the normal state is health and that most people are healthy."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And that's gonna make me a better doctor."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "And that's, I'm kind of saying the same thing."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "Let's be better doctors of politics in the world by recognizing that like normal state is health."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "And then we're gonna identify like what are the diseases that are causing this warfare."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So yeah, the natural state of the human body with the immune system and all the different parts wants to be healthy and is really damn good at being healthy, but sometimes it breaks down."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "Let's understand how it breaks down."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "So what are the five ways that you list that are the roots of war?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, they're kind of like buckets."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "They're sort of things that rhyme, right?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "In the interview, because it's not all the same."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "There's like lots of reasons to go to war."}, {"time": 1495, "text": "There's this great line, there's a reason for every war and a war for every reason."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "And it's kind of overwhelming, right?"}, {"time": 1502, "text": "And it's overwhelming for a lot of people."}, {"time": 1504, "text": "It was overwhelming for me for a lot of time."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "And I think one of the gifts of social science is actually people have started to organize this for us."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "And I just tried to organize it like a tiny bit better."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "Buckets that rhyme."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "Buckets with some economics."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "Yeah, the terrible metaphor, right?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "And bad at metaphors."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So the idea was that like that basic, like something overrides these incentives."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "And I guess I was saying there's five ways that they get overrided."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "And three are, I'd call strategic."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Like they're kind of logical."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "There's circumstances that, and this is, they're sort of, where strategic is, strategy is like game theory."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "You could use those two things interchangeably."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "But game theory is sort of making it sound more complicated, I think, than it is."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "It's basically saying that there's times when this is like the optimal choice because of circumstances."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "And one of them is when the people who are deciding don't bear those costs."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "So that's, or maybe even have a private incentive that's gonna, that's, if they don't, if they're ignoring the cost, then maybe the costs of war are not so material."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "That's a contributing factor."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "Another is just, there's uncertainty, and we could talk about that, but there's just the absence of information means that it actually, there's circumstances where it's your best choice to attack."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "There's this thing that political economists call commitment problems, which are basically saying there's some big power shift that you can avoid by attacking now."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So it's like a dynamic incentive."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "It's sort of saying, well, in order to keep something from happening in the future, I can attack now."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "And because of the structure of incentives, it actually makes sense for me, even though war is, in theory, really costly, or it is really costly nonetheless."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And then there's these sort of human things."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "One's a little bit like just war."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "One sort of thing, there's like ideologies or principles or things we value that weigh against those costs, like exterminating the heretical idea or standing up for a principle might be so valuable to me that I'm willing to use violence, even if it's costly."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "And there's nothing irrational about that."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "And then the fifth bucket is all of the irrationalities, all the passions and all of the most importantly, I think, like misperceptions, the way we get, like we basically make wrong calculations about whether or not war is the right decision."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "We misunderstand or misjudge our enemy or misjudge ourselves."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So if you put all those things into buckets, how much can it be modeled in a simple game theoretic way and how much of it is a giant human mess?"}, {"time": 1652, "text": "So four of those five are really, on some level, easy to think strategically and model in a simple way in the sense that any of us can do it."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "We do this all the time."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "Think of bargaining in a market for a carpet or something or whatever you bargained for, you're thinking a few steps ahead about what your opponent's going to do."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "And you stake out a high price, like a low price, and the seller stakes out a high price."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "And you might both say, oh, I refuse to, I could never accept that."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "And there's all this sort of cheap talk, but you kind of understand where you're going and it's efficient to like find a deal and buy the market, buy the carpet eventually."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "So we all understand this game theory and the strategy, I think intuitively."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "Or maybe even a closer example is like, suppose, I don't know, you have a tenant you need to evict or any normal kind of legal, it's not yet a legal dispute, right?"}, {"time": 1713, "text": "Like we just have a dispute with a neighbor or somebody else."}, {"time": 1716, "text": "Most of us don't end up going to court."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "Going to court is like the war option."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "That's the costly thing that we just ought to be able to avoid."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "We ought to be able to find something between ourselves that doesn't require this hiring lawyers and a long drawn out trial."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And most of the time we do, right?"}, {"time": 1735, "text": "And so we all understand that incentive."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "And then for those five buckets, so everything except all the irrational and the misperceptions are really easy to model."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "Then from a technical standpoint, it's actually pretty tricky to model the misperceptions."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And I'm not a game theorist."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And so I'm more channeling my colleagues to do this and what I know, but it's not rocket science."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "I mean, I think that's what I try to lay out in the book is like there's all these ideas out there that can actually help us just make sense of all these wars and just bring some order to the morass of reasons."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "Well, to push back a lot of things in one sentence."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So first of all, rocket science is actually pretty simple."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "I'll defer to you actually."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "Well, I think it's because unfortunately it's very like engineering, it's very well defined."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "The problem is well defined."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "The problem with humanity is it's actually complicated."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "So it is true it's not rocket science, but it is not true."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "It's easy because it's not rocket science."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "But the problem, the downside of game theory is not that it helps us make sense of the world."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "It projects a simple model of the world that brings us comfort in thinking we understand."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "And sometimes that simplification is actually getting at the core first principles on understanding of something."}, {"time": 1823, "text": "And sometimes it fools us into thinking we understand."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "So for example, I mean, mutually shared destruction is a very simple model and people argue all the time whether that's actually a good model or not, but there's empirical fact that we're still alive as a human civilization."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "And also in the game theoretic sense, do we model individual leaders and their relationships?"}, {"time": 1847, "text": "Do we, the staff, the generals, or do we also have to model the culture, the people, the suffering of the people, the economic frustration or the anger or the distrust?"}, {"time": 1862, "text": "Do you have to model all those things?"}, {"time": 1864, "text": "Do they come into play?"}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And sometimes, I mean, again, we could be romanticizing those things from a historical perspective, but when you look at history and you look at the way wars start, it sometimes feels like a little bit of a misunderstanding escalates, escalates, escalates, and just builds on top of itself and all of a sudden it's an all out war."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "It's the escalation with nobody hitting the brakes."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "So, I mean, you're absolutely right in the sense that it's totally possible to oversimplify these things and take the game theory too seriously."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "And some, and people who study those things and write those models and people like me who use them can sometimes make that mistake."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "I think that's not the mistake that most people make most often."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "And what's actually true is I think most people, we're actually really quick, whether it's the US invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq, we're really quick to blame that on the humanness and the culture."}, {"time": 1930, "text": "So we're really quick to say, oh, this was George W. Bush's either desire for revenge and vengeance or some private agenda or blood for oil."}, {"time": 1940, "text": "So we're really quick to blame it on these things."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "And then we're really, we tend to overlook the strategic incentives to attack, which I think were probably dominant."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "I think those things might've been true to a degree, but I don't think they were enough to ever bring those wars about."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "Just like, I think people are very quick to sort of, in this current invasion to sort of talk about Putin's grand visions of being the next Catherine the Great or nationalist ideals and the mistakes and the miscalculations are really quick to sort of say, oh, that must be, and then kind of pause or not pause, but maybe even stop there and not see some of the strategic incentives."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "And so, I guess we have to do both, but the strategic, I guess I would say like the war is just such a big problem."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "It's just so costly that the strategic incentives and the things that game theory has given us are like really important in understanding why there was so little room for negotiation and a bargain that things like a leader's mistakes start to matter or a leader's nationalist ideals or delusions or vengeance actually matters."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "Cause those do matter, but they only matter when the capacity to find a deal is so narrow because of the circumstances."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And so let's not, it's sort of like saying like an elderly person who dies of pneumonia, right?"}, {"time": 2032, "text": "Pneumonia killed them, obviously, but that's not the reason pneumonia was able to kill them."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "All of the fundamentals and the circumstances were like made them very fragile."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "And that's how I think all the strategic forces make that situation fragile."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "And then the miscalculations and all of these things you just said, which are so important are kind of like the pneumonia."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And let's sort of, let's pay attention to both."}, {"time": 2056, "text": "And you're saying that people don't disproportionately pay attention to the leaders."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "I mean, it wasn't, it took me a long time to learn to recognize them."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "And it takes many people, you know, it took and it took generations of social scientists years and years to figure some of this out and to sort of help people understand it and clarify concepts."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "So it's not, it's just not that easy."}, {"time": 2081, "text": "No, it's not hard."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "I think it's possible to, just as I was taught a lot of the stuff I write in the book in graduate school or from reading and it's possible to communicate and learn this stuff, but it's still really hard."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "And so that's kind of what I was trying to do is like close that gap and just make it, help people recognize these things in the wild."}, {"time": 2102, "text": "Before we zoom back out, let me at a high level first ask, what are your thoughts on the ongoing war in Ukraine?"}, {"time": 2109, "text": "How do you analyze it within your framework about war?"}, {"time": 2112, "text": "A Russian colleague of mine, Konstantin Sonin tells this story about a visiting Ukrainian professor who's at the university."}, {"time": 2119, "text": "And one night he's walking down the street and he's talking on two cell phones at once for some reason and a mugger stops him and demands the phones."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "And it's sort of like dead pan way, Konstantin says, and because he was Ukrainian, he decided to fight."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "And I think that's a little bit like what happened."}, {"time": 2139, "text": "Most of us in that situation would hand over cell phones."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "And so in this situation, Putin's like the mugger and the Ukrainian people are being asked to hand over this thing and they're saying, no, we're not gonna hand this over."}, {"time": 2154, "text": "And the fact is most people do."}, {"time": 2159, "text": "Most people faced with a superpower or a tyrant or an autocrat or a murderous warlord who says, hand this over, they hand it over."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "And that's why there are so many unequal imperial relationships in the world."}, {"time": 2176, "text": "That's what empire is."}, {"time": 2177, "text": "Empire is success of people saying, fine, we'll give up our some degree of freedom or sovereignty because you're too powerful."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "And the Ukrainian said, no way, this is just too precious."}, {"time": 2187, "text": "And so I said, one of those buckets were that there's a set of values."}, {"time": 2192, "text": "There's sometimes there's something that we value that is so valuable to us and important."}, {"time": 2197, "text": "Sometimes it's terrible, sometimes it's the extermination of another people, but sometimes it's something noble like liberty

knew what they were probably risking."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "And so to me, that's not to blame the Ukrainians any more than I would blame Americans for the American Revolution."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "It's actually a very similar story."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "You had a tyrannical, militarily superior, pretty non democratic entity come and say, you're gonna have partial sovereignty."},

American Revolution."}, {"time": 2247, "text": "It was the ideological origins, this attachment, this idea of liberty."}, {"time": 2250, "text": "And so I start, now there's lots of other reasons I think why this happened, but I think for me, it starts with Ukrainians failing to make that sensible quote unquote rational deal that says we should relinquish some of our sovereignty because Russia is more powerful than we are."}, {"time": 2270, "text": "So there's a very clinical look at the war."}, {"time": 2276, "text": "Meaning there is a man and a country, Vladimir Putin, that makes a claim

to understand and we won't know this but which path minimizes human suffering in the long term?"}, {"time": 2389, "text": "Well, on the eve of the war, Ukraine was poorer in the per person terms than

degree."}, {"time": 2403, "text": "I mean, certainly because of oil and gas but also for a variety of other reasons and Putin's consolidated political control."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "And from a very cold blooded and calculated point of view, I think one way Putin and Russia could look at this is says, look, we were temporarily weak after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the rest in the West

enough to demand it."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "And you've been taking advantage of the situation which is maybe a fair impartial analysis."}, {"time": 2464, "text": "And in the West, but more

that their power said they quote unquote deserve."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "Just like Americans said to the Britain, yeah, of course we ought to accept semi sovereignty but we refuse and we'd rather endure a bloody fight that we might lose than take this."}, {"time": 2505, "text": "And so you need some of these other five buckets, you need them to understand the situation, you need to sort of,

live in a world where a lot of people get stepped on by tyrants and empire and whatnot and don't rise up."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "And so I think we could admire, especially when they stand up for these reasons."}, {"time": 2764, "text": "And I think we can admire Churchill for that reason."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "I think we could, that's why we admire the leaders of the American Revolution

the suffering."}, {"time": 3557, "text": "And so they were too quick to go to war."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "And so that's, I think that detachment of leaders, combined with, you mingle it with this,

of different stuff in there."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "And I'm just trying to say, like, let's be clear that just about the shared logic of these things is maybe just, you know, they're really

war?"}, {"time": 3758, "text": "So...

cruel."}, {"time": 3809, "text": "But I mean, I think the uncertainty is really important here as well."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "Like if you think of it, like think of all of the things, the way this has played out, and just in some ways how many, in how many ways we've been surprised."}, {"time": 3821, "text": "We've been surprised by the unity and the coherence of the West and the sanctions."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "That's sort of what's happened is it was in the realm of possibility, but it was sort of like the best case scenario from the perspective of the West and the

Russia, the best realization in some sense for in terms of revealed strength and resolve."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "And then the other thing that's been revealed is just how like the corruption and ineptitude and problems on the Russian military side."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "Again, within the realm of possibility, maybe people who really knew the Russian military are less surprised than the rest of us, but also one of the worst possible draws for Russia."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "And so Putin asking this terrible price and expecting Ukraine to roll over or the West to roll over at least to a degree was based on like a different set of, was based on just expecting something in the middle of the probability distribution and not one of all these different tale events."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "And so the fact that the world's so uncertain and the fact that Putin can come with a different set of expectations than the Ukrainians and the West and all these players can just have a hard time agreeing on just what the facts are because we live in an uncertain world."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "Everyone's quick to say, oh, he miscalculated."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "Well, I'm not, I don't know if he miscalculated."}, {"time": 3917, "text": "I think he just, he got a really bad draw in terms of what the realized outcomes are here."}, {"time": 3923, "text": "And so, I mean, good for everybody else in some sense, except the fact that it's involving a lot of violence is the tragedy."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "Well, there's also economic pain, not just for the Russian people and the Ukrainian people, but the whole world."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "So it, you know, you could talk about things that we are surprised from an analysis perspective of small victories here or there, but I think it's universally true that everybody loses once again in this war."}, {"time": 3955, "text": "Right, and so the question is just like, when does it, you know, why did Russia choose to invade when Ukraine didn't give this up?"}, {"time": 3962, "text": "Well, Russia anticipated that it would be able to seize what it wanted, the available bargain that it deserved, quote unquote, based on its power in the world, it wasn't getting, and so it thought it could take that."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "And the uncertainty around that made it potentially more likely that he would choose to do this."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "But in particular, one of the other things that I think is probably less important in this context, but still plays a role, but less important than many wars, is the fact that it's really hard to resolve that uncertainty, right?"}, {"time": 3994, "text": "In theory, Ukraine should be able to say, look, this is exactly how resolved we are, we're super resolved, and your military is not as strong as you think it is."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "You mean before the conflict even begins?"}, {"time": 4007, "text": "Everybody should be like, you know what?"}, {"time": 4008, "text": "You lay on the table, here's my cards, here's your cards."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "Exactly, like that's, as a competitor in this, you can use that uncertainty to your advantage."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "I can try to convince you, I can bluff, right?"}, {"time": 4020, "text": "And so anyone who's ever played poker and bluffed or called a bluff, that's the inefficiency, that's the analogy in some ways to war."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "It's not the perfect analogy, but the uncertainty and the circumstance, you don't have to miscalculate."}, {"time": 4031, "text": "The fact that if you bluff and lose, it doesn't mean that you miscalculated."}, {"time": 4036, "text": "You made an optimal choice, given the uncertainty of the situation, to take a gamble."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "And that was a wiser thing for you to do than to not bluff and just to fold or to just not ping in that round."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "And so the uncertainty of the situation gives both sides incentives to bluff, gives neither side an incentive to try to reveal the truth."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "And then at some point, the other side says, you know what, you say you're resolved."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "You say you're gonna mount an insurgency."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "Every other, you know, people on my border has folded and you're gonna fold too, the minute the tanks roll in and the minute the Air Force comes in, I'm gambling that you're bluffing."}, {"time": 4075, "text": "And so that inherent uncertainty of the situation just causes a lot of short wars, actually, because it's this sort of bluff and call dynamic that goes on."}, {"time": 4090, "text": "And, you know, the thing that's worth thinking is we might end up at a place in a few months where the thing that Ukraine concedes is not so far from what Russia demanded in the first place."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "Russia's on it, I want a neutral, I mean, who knows how, it's not the ambitious thing the Russians wanted."}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And that sadly is like the best case, that feels like the best case scenario right now, which is the war is just five months and not five years."}, {"time": 4190, "text": "Given the current situation."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "Because the suffering has already happened, and lost homes, people moving, having to see their home in rubble, and millions of people, refugees having to escape the country, and hate flourishes versus the common humanity as it does with war."}, {"time": 4223, "text": "And on top of all of that, if we talk from a geopolitical perspective, the warmongers all over the world are sort of drooling."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "They've now got narratives, and they got that whatever narratives, you can go shopping for the narratives."}, {"time": 4243, "text": "The United States has its narratives for whatever geopolitical thing it wants to do in that part of the world."}, {"time": 4250, "text":

fighting that, the general... Apathy."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "It's the apathy of rational calculus, like what are we going to gain if we fight back?"}, {"time": 4370, "text": "Hitler seems to be pretty reasonable."}, {"time": 4374, "text": "He's saying he's going to stop the bombing, that you're still going to maintain your sovereignty as the great people of Britain."}, {"time": 4384, "text": "Like why are we fighting again?"}, {"time": 4386, "text": "And that's the thing that's hard to break because you have to say, well, you have to speak the principle, you have to speak at some greater sort of long term vision of history."}, {"time": 4399, "text": "So like, yes, now it may seem like it's a way to avoid the fight, but you're actually just sort of putting shackles on yourself."}, {"time": 4409, "text": "You're destroying the very greatness of our people if we don't fight back."}, {"time": 4415, "text": "And to think about this with like the current case with Russia, I mean, some people look at Putin's speeches and papers he's written on Ukraine historically being a part of Russia and trying to deny the... basically create all these nationalist narratives and they think, well, Putin really believes, and he might, Putin really believes this and that's why he's invading."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "And that might also be true and that would contribute to... just make a peaceful bargain even harder to find."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "But I suspect what's at least a minimum true is Putin's trying to manufacture support for an invasion in the population through propaganda."}, {"time": 4454, "text": "And so he's doing on some level the same thing that Winston Churchill was doing in mechanical terms, which is to try to manipulate people's references."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "But

4491, "text": "I think he was a sincere believer."}, {"time": 4493, "text": "Well no, no, no, but there's a lot of places where there was uncertainty and they decided to do propaganda and that propaganda resolved the uncertainty in his own mind."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "So for example, he believed until very late that America is a weakling, militarily and as an economic power and just the spirit of the people."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "And that was part of the propaganda they were producing and because of that propaganda when he became the head of the army, he was making military

it just happens like if a nuclear war happened it would be something like a plane like in this case with Ukraine a NATO plane shut down over some piece of land by the Russian forces or so the

these times when that didn't happen when it stopped, when it escalated one step and then people paused or escalated two steps and people said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."}, {"time": 5064, "text":

know, letting Nazis march into Denmark without a fight or France folding very quickly, you can kind of see as like an appeasement or an acknowledgement of their superiority and their ability to

win a war is going to change a lot in the next decade or two, maybe even in the next few years."}, {"time": 6997, "text": "And so if we are in a much better bargaining position now, both to not use violence, but if necessarily use violence."}, {"time": 7024, "text": "Because otherwise, Russia is going to be extremely powerful in the future and they'll be able to use that power to change the

hand over something that makes us powerful because that's the bargain that would make us all better off."}, {"time": 7058, "text": "And the reason political economists call it a commitment problem is because that's a commitment that would solve the problem."}, {"time": 7070, "text": "And they can't make that commitment because there's nobody who will hold them accountable."}, {"time": 7070,

solution."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "All right, if that's the core problem."}, {"time": 7088, "text": "And so that's why, you know, in Medellin, you know, the oficina can do that."}, {"time": 7088,

strong."}, {"time": 7108, "text": "And we're gonna make sure, we're gonna promise that when these guys do get strong, we're gonna restrain what they can do."}, {"time": 7116, "text": "Most of our

apportioned power between states."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "That was a deal."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "That was a commitment."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "The Constitution in the United States was a deal made to a bunch of states that knew they were going to be weak in future because of economic and demographic trends, or guess they might be."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "And it said, listen, you cooperate and we'll commit not to basically ignore your interests over the long run."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "And now, you know, 250 years later, we're still honoring those commitments."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "It was part of the deal that meant that there actually would be a union."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "And so we do this all the time."}, {"time": 7158, "text": "So a constitution is a good example of how every country's constitution, especially a country who's writing a constitution after a war, that constitution and all of the other institutions they're building are an attempt to like provide commitment to groups who are worried about future shifts in power."}, {"time": 7182, "text": "And does that help with avoid civil war?"}, {"time": 7182, "text": "So could you speak to lessons you learned from civil wars, perhaps the American Civil War or any others?"}, {"time": 7192, "text": "So Lebanon, one of the ways Lebanon had tried for a long time to preserve the interests of minority groups, powerful minority groups who were powerful at the time and knew that the demographics were working against them, was to guarantee, you know, this ethnic religious group gets the presidency and this ethno religious group gets the prime ministership and this ethno."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "And a lot of countries will apportion seats in the parliament to ethno religious groups."}, {"time": 7219, "text": "And that's an attempt to like give a group that's temporarily powerful some assurances that when they're weak in the future that they'll still have a say, right?"}, {"time": 7240, "text": "Just like we apportioned seats in the Senate in a way that's not demographically representative but is like unequal, quote unquote, in a sense to help people be confident that there won't be a tyranny of the majority."}, {"time": 7251, "text": "And now that just happens to have been like a really unstable arrangement in Lebanon because eventually like the de facto power on the ground just gets so out of line with this really rigid system of the presidency goes to this ethno religious group and this prime ministership goes, that it didn't last, right?"}, {"time": 7269, "text": "But you can think of every post conflict agreement and every constitution is like a little bit of humans best effort to find an agreement that's going to protect the interests of a group that temporarily has an interest in violence in order to not be violent."}, {"time": 7295, "text": "And so there's a lot of ingenuity and it doesn't always work, right?"}, {"time": 7300, "text": "Which actually from a perspective of the group, threatening violence or actually doing violence is one way to make progress for your group."}, {"time": 7308, "text": "We're talking about groups bargaining over stuff, right?"}, {"time": 7308, "text": "We're talking about Russians versus Ukraine or Russians versus the West or maybe it's managing games versus one another."}, {"time": 7317, "text": "Like a lot of their bargaining power comes from their ability to burn the house down, right?"}, {"time": 7317, "text": "And so if I want to have more bargaining power, I can just arm a lot and I can threaten violence."}, {"time": 7328, "text": "And so the strategically wise thing to do, I mean, it's terrible, it's a terrible equilibrium for us to be forced into, but the strategically wise thing to do is to build up lots of arms to threaten to use them, to credibly threaten to use them."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "But then trust or hope that like your enemy is going to see reason and avoid this really terrible, inefficient thing, which is fighting."}, {"time": 7352, "text": "But the thing that's going on the whole time is both of you arming and spending like 20% of GDP or whatever on arms, that's pretty inefficient."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "That's the tragedy."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "We don't have war and that's good, but we have really limited abilities to like incentivize our enemies not to arm and to keep ourselves from arming."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "We'd love to agree to just like both disarm, but we can't."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "And so the mess is that we have to arm and then we have to threaten all the time."}, {"time": 7381, "text": "Yeah, so the threat of violence is costly nevertheless."}, {"time": 7381, "text": "You've actually pulled up that now disappeared a paper that said the big title called Civil War and your name is on it."}, {"time": 7395, "text": "Well, that was, I mean, when I was finishing graduate school and this was a paper with my advisor at Ted Miguel at Berkeley."}, {"time": 7402, "text": "Most nations, the paper opens, have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960."}, {"time": 7402, "text": "Yet while they were, you still got

teaching, so on and so forth."}, {"time": 7420, "text": "And this is looking at Civil War broadly throughout history or is it just particular civil wars?"}, {"time": 7435, "text": "We were mostly looking at like the late 20th century."}, {"time": 7435, "text": "I mean, I was trained as a what's called development economist, which is somebody who studies why some places are poor and why some countries are rich."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "And I, like a number of people around that time, stumbled into violence."}, {"time": 7446, "text": "I mean, people have been studying the wealth and poverty of nations basically since the invention of economics, but there was a big blind spot for violence."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "Now there isn't any more."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "It's like a flourishing area of study in economics, but at the time it wasn't."}, {"time": 7463, "text": "And so there were people like me and Ted who were sort of part political scientists, because political scientists obviously had been studying this for a long time, who started bringing economic tools and expertise and partnerships with political scientists and adding to it."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "And so we wrote this."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "So after like people have been doing this for five or 10 years in our field, we wrote like a review article telling economists like what was going on."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "And so this was like a summary for economists."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "So the book in some ways is a lot in the same spirit of this article."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "This article, I mean, it's designed to be not written as like a boring laundry list of studies, which is what, that's the purpose this article was for."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "It was for graduate students and professors who wanted to think about what to work on and what we knew."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "This book is like now trying to like not just say what economists are doing, but sort of say what economists, political scientists, psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, like how do we bring some sense to this big project?"}, {"time": 7524, "text": "And policymakers, like what do we know?"}, {"time": 7524, "text": "And what do we know about building peace?"}, {"time": 7524, "text": "Because if you don't know what the reason for wars are, you're probably not going to design the right cure."}, {"time": 7537, "text": "And so anyway, so that was the, but I started off studying civil wars because I stumbled into this place in Northern Uganda basically by accident."}, {"time":

10 or 15 years of pretty serious violence in that span of time."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "Most of it from 2000 to 2009 and stretching up to like 2014."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "There are like

whole bunch of like low scale sporadic violence that can be repression of civilians, it can be terror bombings and terror actions, it can be counter terror violence, it can be mass arrests, it can be repression, it can be denying people the vote, it can be rattling sabers, all these things that are happening, right?"}, {"time": 7671, "text": "And it can be sporadic three week wars or sporadic, you know, very brief episodes of intense violence before everybody sees sense and then settles down to this uneasy."}, {"time": 7671, "text": "We're right not to think of that as like a peace and there's certainly no stable agreement, right?"}, {"time": 7690, "text": "So a stable agreement and amity and any ability to move on from this extreme hostility, we're not there yet and that's maybe very far away."}, {"time": 7690, "text": "But this is a good example of two rivals who most of the time have avoided really intense violence."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "So you talked about this, like most of the time, rivals just like avoiding violence and hating each other in peace."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "So is this what peace, to answer my question, is this what peace looks like?"}, {"time": 7726,

same situation with Russia, Ukraine."}, {"time": 7771, "text": "This is where, you know, if they stop fighting one another, but Russia holds the east of the country and Crimea and nobody really acknowledges their right to that, that might, within there's just gonna be a lot of tension and skirmishing and violence, but that never really progresses to war for 30 years."}, {"time": 7790, "text": "That would be a sad, but maybe possible outcome."}, {"time": 7803, "text": "So that's kind of where Israel, Palestine looks to me."}, {"time": 7803, "text": "And so someone, if we're gonna talk about why we fight, then the question we have to ask is like why, you know, like the Second Intifada, like that was the most violent episode."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "Like why did that happen and why did that last several years?"}, {"time": 7815, "text": "That would be like, we could analyze that and we could say, what was it about these periods of violence that led there to be prolonged intense violence?"}, {"time": 7815, "text": "Because that was in nobody's interest."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "That didn't need to happen."}, {"time": 7829, "text": "And partly I don't talk about that

writes a better one."}, {"time": 7849, "text": "Or before the human civilization ends."}, {"time": 7852, "text": "And circumstances can change really quickly."}, {"time": 7852, "text": "So I wanted it to be enduring and meant partly just avoiding changing things and changing these and avoiding these controversial ones."}, {"time": 7852, "text": "But I, of course I think about them."}, {"time": 7852, "text": "And so like a lot of my time, I decided actually last year to teach a class where I'd take all these contemporary conflicts I wasn't working on the book and where I wasn't really an expert, whether it's India, Pakistan, China, Taiwan, Israel, Palestine, Mexican cartel state drug wars and a few others."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "And then teach a class on them with students and we'd work through it."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "We'd read the book and then we'd say, all right, none of us are experts."}, {"time": 7881, "text": "How do we make sense of these places?"}, {"time": 7881, "text": "And we focused in the Israel Palestine case of mostly trying to understand why it got so violent and spend a little bit of time on what the prospects are for something that's more enduring."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "It's hard to know that stuff now."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "I mean, it's easier to do the full analysis when looking back when it's over."}, {"time": 7907,

state."}, {"time": 7941, "text": "And to do anything else and to deny that denies their liberal democratic ideals."}, {"time": 7941, "text": "And that's a really hard contest of priorities to sort out."}, {"time": 7962, "text": "Of course, everything you just said probably has multiple perspectives on it from other people that would phrase all the same things, but using different words."},

more checks and balances on power."}, {"time": 8144, "text": "I think there's more, but those are two that are really fundamental here because I think those two things reduce the incentives for war in two ways."}, {"time": 8151, "text": "One is, remember when we were talking about this really simple strategic game where whether I'm Russia or Ukraine or whatever, any two rivals, I want more of the pie than you get, and the costs of war are deterrents, but only the costs of war that I feel, right?"}, {"time": 8172, "text": "I do not care about the costs of war to your side, my rival side."},

a disincentive."}, {"time": 8204, "text": "And if we're socially entwined because we have great social relationships and linkages and family or we're intermarriage or whatever, all these things will help."}, {"time": 8213, "text": "And then if we're ideologically intertwined, maybe we share notions of liberty or maybe we just share a common notion of humanity."}, {"time": 8220, "text": "So, I think the fact that we're more integrated than we've ever been on all three fronts in the world but with China is providing some insulation, which is good."}, {"time": 8230, "text": "So, I would be

to make China a more centralized and personal ruled place, which he's successfully moved in that direction, also worries me."}, {"time": 8315, "text": "So, anything that moves China in the other direction, not necessarily being democratic, but just like a wider and wider group of people holding power, like all of the business leaders and all the things that have been happening over the last

my own problem, but there seems to be a bigger cultural gap than there is with other superpowers throughout history where it's almost like this own world happening in China, its own world in the

did 34 years ago because we're so intertwined."}, {"time": 8450, "text": "So I don't know where it balances out."}, {"time": 8450, "text": "I think it balances out on better understanding than ever before."}, {"time": 8450, "text": "But you're right, there was like a big gulf there that we haven't totally bridged."}, {"time": 8461, "text": "And like I said, lots of inter Chinese in the United

I mean, the organized crime stuff has been the hardest."}, {"time": 9077, "text": "Just figuring out how to get that information took us years of just trial and error, mostly error of like just how to get people to talk to us or how to collect data in a way that's safe for me and safe for my team and safe for people to answer a survey."}, {"time": 9098, "text": "Like how do you get, how do you get the information on what gangs are doing in the community or how it's hurting or helping people?"}, {"time": 9098, "text": "Like you've got to run surveys and you've got to talk to gang members, all these things that nobody knows how to do that."}, {"time": 9113, "text": "And so we had to sort of really slowly, not nobody, there's a few other things."}, {"time": 9113, "text": "There's other

this nature."}, {"time": 9158, "text": "So they, they do have public profiles a little bit, but not, not, not so explicitly."}, {"time": 9158, "text": "So they're clandestine."}, {"time": 9171, "text": "So one of the things that's really endemic in Medellin, it's true in a lot of cities, it's true in American prisons, is gangs govern everybody's everyday life."}, {"time": 9179, "text": "So if you have a, in an American prison, particularly Illinois or California, Texas is another big one, but also in a city in Medellin, if you have a problem, a debt to collect or dispute with a neighbor

{"time": 9222, "text": "And so that's, we had to sort of figure that out."}, {"time": 9222, "text": "And that, that was, so that was just hard in a different way."}, {"time": 9234, "text": "But I don't do the most, the mostly punishing stuff I couldn't do any longer."}, {"time": 9234, "text": "So that's much easier in that sense."}, {"time": 9240, "text": "By the way, on, you know, Jorge

in a place where there's risk."}, {"time": 9368, "text": "And so I think a lot about minimizing any risks such that I think about mortality enough that I just, because I'm kind of an anxious
