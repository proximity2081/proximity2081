decrease amount of function from which you pick up one."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "Then you give a second predicate and again decrease the set of function."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "And after that you pick up the best function you can find."}, {"time": 1076, "text": "It is standard machine learning."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "So, why you need not too many examples?"}, {"time": 1083, "text":

set of function is set of function which has small capacity or small diversity, small VC dimension example."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Which contain good function inside."}, {"time": 1117, "text":

describe VC?"}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So, when you have a machine."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "So, machine capable to pick up one function from the admissible set of function."}, {"time": 1142,

pick up function."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "But it can be small."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "Small, we call it capacity but maybe better called diversity."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "So, not very different function in the set."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "It's infinite set of function but not very diverse."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "So, it is small VC dimension."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "When VC dimension is small, you need small amount of training data."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "So, the goal is to create admissible set of functions which is have small VC dimension and contain good function."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Then you will be able to pick up the function using small amount of observations."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "So, that is the task of learning?"}, {"time": 1207,

formulated yesterday."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Statistical learning theory does not involve in creating admissible set of function."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "In classical learning theory, everywhere, 100% in textbook, the set of function, admissible set of function is given."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "But this is science about nothing because the most difficult problem to create admissible set of functions given, say, a lot of functions, continuum set of function, create admissible set of functions."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "That means that it has finite VC dimension, small VC dimension and contain good function."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "So, this was out of consideration."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "So, what's the process of doing that?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "I mean, it's fascinating."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "What is the process of creating this admissible set of functions?"}, {"time": 1273, "text": "That is invariant."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "That's invariant."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "Yeah, you're looking of properties of training data and properties means that you have some function and you just count what is value, average value of function on training data."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "You have model and what is expectation of this function on the model and they should coincide."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "So, the problem is about how to pick up functions."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "It can be any function."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "In fact, it is true for all functions."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "But because when we're talking, say, duck does not jumping, so you don't ask question jump like a duck because it is trivial."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "It does not jumping and doesn't help you to recognize jump."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "But you know something, which question to ask and you're asking it seems like a duck, but looks like a duck at this general situation."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Looks like, say, guy who have this illness, this disease."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "It is legal."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "So, there is a general type of predicate looks like and special type of predicate, which related to this

about history of Second World War."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And he started this book describing that in old time when war is over, so the great kings, they gathered together, almost all of them were

more I would say that if they use deep learning, it is not the most effective way of learning theory."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And usually when people use deep learning, they're using zillions of
