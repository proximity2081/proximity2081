debilitating for each person?"}, {"time": 383, "text": "You know, if you look at the numbers, there are, if you look at how our mental health disorders are currently defined, you can look at population prevalence values for all these disorders, and you can come up with estimates that somebody will have a lifetime prevalence of having a psychiatric disorder that approaches 25% or so."}, {"time": 406, "text": "And so that's, and in some studies it could be more, some studies it could be less."}, {"time": 411, "text": "Now, what do we do with that number?"}, {"time": 414, "text": "And in some ways, that's the essence of what I was hoping to approach with the book, is to reflect on this spectrum that exists for all the disorders."}, {"time": 422, "text": "There is, and taking nothing away from the severity and the suffering that comes at the extreme end of these illnesses, but nearly every one of them exists on a spectrum of severity, from nearly functional to completely dysfunctional, life threatening, and even fatal."}, {"time": 439, "text": "And so that number, 25%, more or less, it doesn't capture that spectrum of severity."}, {"time": 447, "text": "To look at that number, where do those numbers come from?"}, {"time": 450, "text": "Is it self report?"}, {"time": 451, "text": "Is it people who show up and say, I need help?"}, {"time": 455, "text": "Is it somebody else that points out that person needs help?"}, {"time": 458, "text": "Or is it like estimates that even go beyond that for people who don't ask for help or are suffering quietly alone?"}, {"time": 465, "text": "When you look at self report numbers, then those numbers get even higher, beyond 25% or more."}, {"time": 472, "text": "Those, the most rigorous studies are done with structured psychiatric interviews where people who are trained in eliciting symptoms carefully do complete psychiatric inventories of individuals."}, {"time": 485, "text": "And these are time consuming laborious studies that are not often repeated."}, {"time": 490, "text": "When they're done, they're done well."}, {"time": 493, "text": "But very often you'll see a report or something in the news of a very high number for some disorder or symptom."}, {"time": 502, "text": "And very often, if it's shockingly high, that's coming from a self report of a person."}, {"time": 507, "text": "And so that's another issue that we have, again, take nothing away from the severity and reality and biological nature of these disorders, which are very genetic, very, you know, we understand that these are very biological."}, {"time": 520, "text": "And yet, we lack right now the lab tests and the blood draws to make the diagnoses."}, {"time": 525, "text": "We'll talk about it, just how biological they are, because that too is a mystery."}, {"time": 531, "text": "You know, in terms of from our perspective of how to probe into the disease, how to understand it, how to help it."}, {"time": 537, "text": "So some of it could be neurobiological, some of it could be just the dance of human emotion and interaction."}, {"time": 545, "text": "And it's like, is love when it works and is love when it breaks down biological or is it something else?"}, {"time": 555, "text": "So we're gonna talk about it."}, {"time": 557, "text": "But let me just like to linger in terms of disorder."}, {"time": 561, "text": "What about genius?"}, {"time": 563, "text": "You know, that sort of cliche saying, like the madness and genius that they kind of dance together."}, {"time": 570, "text": "What about if the thing we see as disorder is actually genius, unheard or misunderstood?"}, {"time": 578, "text": "Well, here again, the numbers help us."}, {"time": 580, "text": "And here's where being rigorous and quantitative actually really helps."}, {"time": 583, "text": "If you look at disorders like autism and bipolar disorder and eating disorders, anorexia nervosa, for example, these, you know, particularly bipolar and anorexia, these can be fatal, they can cause immense suffering, but they are heavily genetic, all three of these."}, {"time": 604, "text": "And what's very interesting is each one of these three is actually correlated positively, positively with measures of intelligence, of educational attainment, and even of income."}, {"time": 618, "text": "And so you look at this severe disorders in many cases causing quite an immense morbidity and mortality, and yet they are positively correlated at the population level with positive things."}, {"time": 631, "text": "Can you say the three again, autism?"}, {"time": 633, "text": "Autism, anorexia, and bipolar disorder."}, {"time": 637, "text": "Bipolar, right."}, {"time": 638, "text": "What's that book, forgot the book name, but is intelligence a burden?"}, {"time": 645, "text": "Well, you know, people can get into trouble when they think they're smarter than they are, I will say that."}, {"time": 652, "text": "Sometimes, like, in the deepest meaning of that statement, I think ignorance is bliss."}, {"time": 658, "text": "I'm a big fan of Prince Mishkin from The Idiot and Aliosha from Brother Karamazov."}, {"time": 664, "text": "Optimism can be seen as naivety and dumbness, but I think it's a kind of deep intelligence."}, {"time": 673, "text": "Maybe inability to reason sort of about the mechanics of the world, but instead kind of feel the world."}, {"time": 680, "text": "It seems like that's one of the paths to happiness."}, {"time": 685, "text": "How much you think versus how much you feel, this comes up all the time."}, {"time": 688, "text": "In medicine, we encounter this all the time."}, {"time": 691, "text": "Day after day, you encounter the abyss of suffering from patients."}, {"time": 696, "text": "How much do you let yourself feel?"}, {"time": 699, "text": "Or how much do you make it abstract and objective and try to make it clinical?"}, {"time": 706, "text": "And that range, how you're able to move yourself on that spectrum, is very important for survival as a physician, and the way you protect yourself and your feelings turns out to be very important."}, {"time": 720, "text": "You quote Finnegan's Wake, mad props for that, James Joyce book."}, {"time": 725, "text": "I took a class in James Joyce in college."}, {"time": 727, "text": "I think I read parts of Finnegan's Wake."}, {"time": 730, "text": "I might have been on drugs of some kind, or I somehow got an A in that class, which probably refers to some kind of curve where nobody understood anything."}, {"time": 739, "text": "The only thing I understood and really enjoyed is his short stories, The Dead, and then Ulysses."}, {"time": 744, "text": "I kind of, I think, read a few Cliff Notes that kind of got to the point, and then Finnegan's Wake was just a hopeless."}, {"time": 754, "text": "For people who haven't looked at it, maybe you can elucidate to me better, but I felt like I was reading things, words, and the words made sense, like standing next to each other, but when you kind of read for a while, you realize you didn't actually understand anything that was said."}, {"time": 774, "text": "Right, but did you have a feeling, though?"}, {"time": 775, "text": "That's one thing I found interesting about Finnegan's Wake."}, {"time": 779, "text": "I never fully understood it, but the words caused feelings in me, which I found fascinating, and sometimes I couldn't predict it from the semantic black and white context of what I was seeing in front of me on the page, but the rhythm or the melody would make me feel certain ways, and that was what I always was intrigued by with Joyce."}, {"time": 797, "text": "Of course, that was his, he existed on a spectrum, too, and he wrote, as you say, more accessible works."}, {"time": 804, "text": "I learned a lot about Irish history from Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and there was just, he could be as objective as he wanted to be, but then when he let himself loose, he was in this realm where the words had their own purpose separate from semantic meaning from their dry dictionary definition."}, {"time": 826, "text": "You know, there's a funny story that was told, doesn't matter if it's true or not, but they said that James Joyce, when he was young, when he was in his teen years, would go around sort of Ireland drinking and so on and telling everybody that he's going to be one of, if not the greatest writers of the 20th century, and he turned out to be that."}, {"time": 846, "text": "So I always think about that little story that somebody told me, because I have a lot of people come up to me, including myself, I'm a bit of a dreamer."}, {"time": 857, "text": "You get into certain moods where you say I'm going to be the greatest anything ever."}, {"time": 891, "text": "Maybe it's not a full requirement, but it's an interesting story."}, {"time": 897, "text": "I think when someone tells you that, then it creates, one sees an opportunity, and then it would be a tragedy if the opportunity weren't captured, right?"}, {"time": 905, "text": "And so then that creates some impetus, some motivation to do something good."}, {"time": 912, "text": "I think the mind, it's like, I guess that's what books or whatever, I don't even know if it's a book, The Secret plugs into, they kind of make a whole industry out of it."}, {"time": 923, "text": "But there is something about the mind believing something, making it a reality."}, {"time": 928, "text": "It is just time and time again with Steve Jobs, your belief in yourself, your belief in an idea, sort of embracing the me versus the world, embracing the madness of this idea and making it a life pursuit, somehow morphs reality around you for some tiny fraction of the population."}, {"time": 948, "text": "For everybody else, you descend into all the beautiful ways that failure materializes in our lifetime."}, {"time": 959, "text": "Well, you know, you mentioned love earlier."}, {"time": 960, "text": "I mean, that's a great example of how belief in something makes it real, right?"}, {"time": 965, "text": "It's not reasonable on the face of it, but because you believe it's reasonable, then it actually does become reasonable, and then it is real."}, {"time": 971, "text": "And so that's a good example."}, {"time": 973, "text": "I'm also in a bioengineering department."}, {"time": 975, "text": "We don't imagine that a bridge is soundly built and then it is soundly built."}, {"time": 979, "text": "That's something that, it doesn't come up in too many realms of human existence, but love is one of them."}, {"time": 984, "text": "And the ability to have a fixed idea and to say it's true, and then it is true."}, {"time": 992, "text": "A bridge is a kind of manifestation of love."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So maybe it does work a little bit, but it can break down like Chernobyl did."}, {"time": 998, "text": "You can't just say it's safe."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "You have to also prove it's safe."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "But on Finnegan's Wake, I think, maybe correct me if I'm wrong, you're using kind of Finnegan's Wake to give one perspective on what madness is, of what's going on in the mind."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "How much of that is that we're simply unable to communicate with the person on the other side of their mind?"}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Like there's almost like a little person inside the brain and they have some circuitry that's used to communicate emotion, communicate ideas to the outside world."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "And there's something about that circuitry that makes it difficult to communicate with the little person on the other side."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "So if you look at what shows up in schizophrenia, with many cases, what we call thought disorders, what we call the individual speech symptoms of schizophrenia, Finnegan's Wake is loaded with them."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "And it's just full of them."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "We talk about clang associations in schizophrenia where the word that is said echoes in some way the previous word."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "And we call that a clang association because there's no other reason than the similarity of the sound, like a clang of a garage door being hit."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "And it has a, and sometimes it's not even a word, and we call that a neologism, a new word being created."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "And of course, Finnegan's Wake is full of that."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "And then we also, in schizophrenia, where there's what we call loose associations or tangential thought processes, of course, full of that where things just go off in directions that are not linear or logical."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "And you can't read Finnegan's Wake, I think, without, certainly as a psychiatrist, you can't read it without thinking about schizophrenia."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "And then when we look at the families of people with schizophrenia, and Joyce was no exception, there very often are people within the family who are on the spectrum."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "Some have it."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "Some are able to see it from a distance, from a safe distance."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "There's an association between schizophrenia and what we call schizotypal personality disorder where people are not quite in this severe state of schizophrenia but have some magical thinking, have some unusual thought patterns."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "Very often, those are family members of people with schizophrenia."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "So this points to this, again, to this idea that there is a range, even along this very severe, very genetic biological illness that human beings dwell on different spots along that spectrum."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "I should mention that we have my friend, Sergey, pulling up stuff, young Sergey or old Sergey, I don't know what to call you, but there's drafts of Finnegan's Wake."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Yeah, I actually saw pictures of this from, I think it was on Instagram or something."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "These are early drafts of Finnegan's Wake."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "And it's so beautiful to see."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "For people who are just listening, there's just random paragraphs and writing all over the page with stuff crossed out."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "And it's great to see that Joyce himself was thinking in this kind of way as you're putting it together."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "How much do you think he was thinking about the schizophrenic mind?"}, {"time": 1189, "text": "I think it's known that his daughter suffered from schizophrenia."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And this is, what's depicted here on the page is something that I'm sure he either felt himself in some level was able to access this nonlinearity of processing or had seen enough in family that he knew what it was and was able to reflect it down in black and white on the paper."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "So what he was able to do was quite authentic in that sense."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "Of course, I don't want to pigeonhole him."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "He was doing much more than that."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "It was much more than talking about altered human thought processes and thought disorders."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "But that was an aspect that he was so good at representing that it had to be intentional to some extent."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "And a tiny tangent."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "What does your own writing look like for this book?"}, {"time": 1242, "text": "Because it's extremely well written."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "How many edits?"}, {"time": 1246, "text": "Did you just drink some whiskey and like I'm imagining Hemingway style?"}, {"time": 1251, "text": "What's a very different, the writing is very different."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "I mean, it's really, really well written, which was like, I was reading it."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "It makes you realize, because I was expecting sort of a science kind of, which it is like elucidating something about the human mind kind of thing."}, {"time": 1269, "text": "But you could also probably write really strong novels."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "So maybe that's in the future."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "But anyway, what is your, how many edits?"}, {"time": 1279, "text": "What's your style?"}, {"time": 1280, "text": "Does it look like that?"}, {"time": 1281, "text": "Is it more structured, organized?"}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Unfortunately, I used a laptop, so I didn't have this sort of a beautiful record."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "No typewriters, cigarette, and whiskey."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "I did explore which was their particular altered state that would help me to be most creative."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And I found actually, I actually did the best while sober, but slightly disinhibited in the late hours of the night or early morning."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "Yeah, particularly late hours of the night there."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "I have a friend who would tell me that she thought that very early in the morning, her inner critic was still asleep and she could write more effectively before her inner critic woke up."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "And I actually found that outstanding advice for me that I often found that I was looser and could write more in the morning."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "But the other interesting thing is each chapter, each story, it's about a different human being with a different class of psychiatric disorder."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "That's what each story, each chapter is anchored in."}, {"time": 1342, "text": "But I'm trying to use words and style of writing and diction that captures the feeling of the disorder."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "And so it's different in each story."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "In the story about mania, which is a very expansive, exuberant, at least briefly uplifting state where the words come out in a torrent and they're complex and pressured and elaborate."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "I try to capture that feeling with the words used in that chapter."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "And then in the schizophrenia or psychosis chapter, where things slowly fragment over time and become looser and separated, I try to capture that in the writing too."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "So for each, it wasn't as if there was a single mode I could be in for the whole book."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "For each chapter, I had to put myself into a different mode to capture that inner feeling of the disorder."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "When you put yourself in that mode, does that change you?"}, {"time": 1397, "text": "Yeah, I couldn't turn it on and off right away."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "I had to, first I would start by thinking about the person or the people, one or two people based on real patients and the stories that are put forth."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "The symptom descriptions are real, they're from the patients."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "Of course, all details change to protect privacy, but the actual symptom descriptions are real."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "And I would sit with them and really try to inhabit the space of the mind of that person that I knew."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "And that's not instantaneous."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "It would take some time."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "I needed quiet, I needed to be still."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "That's another reason late at night is good."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "Sergey posted that drowsiness gives creativity boosts, according to Andrew Huberman."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "Thank you, Andrew."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "He's not wrong, he's not wrong."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "Why projections?"}, {"time": 1444, "text": "Is it, I mean, instead of putting words into your mouth, because I can imagine a lot."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "I mean, to me, I will start putting words in your mouth, despite what I just said."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "So, I mean, to me, projections, working on neural networks, for example, from an artificial neural networks, from a machine learning perspective, it's often, that's exactly what you're doing."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "You have an incredibly complex thing and you're trying to find simple representations in order for you to make sense of it."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "So I was kind of thinking about in that way, which is like this incredibly complex neural network that is kind of projecting itself onto the world through this low bandwidth expression of emotion and speech and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "And the way it's, we only have that window into your soul, the eyes and the speech and so on."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "So in that way, when there's any kind of disorder, we get to only see that disorder through that narrow window as opposed to the full complexity of its origins."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "The word projections definitely serves that purpose here, but it's got a few other really appropriate other connotations as well."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "So the first thing is a projection in terms of neuroscience is this long range connection that goes from one part of the brain to another."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And so it's what binds two parts of our brain together."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "There are projections, long range connections of axons, these are the outgoing threads that connect one part of the brain to another part."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "There's a projection that links, for example, auditory cortex where we hear things to reward centers where we can feel, where feelings of pleasure and reward are initiated."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "And it's been shown that if you have reduced connectivity along that dimension, you are less able to enjoy music."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "And so these connections, these projections matter."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "They define how effectively two parts of the brain can engage with each other and join together to form a joint representation of something."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "So that's one meaning, it's pure neuroscience."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "The word projection is used all the time."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "And it happens to be something that optogenetics, a technique that maybe we'll talk about a little later that works particularly well with, we can use light to turn on or off the activity along these projections from one spot of the brain to another."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "And this is particularly referring to the long range connections."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "It's particularly straightforward along these long range projections that connect different parts of the brain, but it works over shorter range too."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "But then there's this other meaning of projections which you were bringing up, which is very relevant, which is at some point you can reduce something from one level of dimensionality to another, and you can project down into a lower dimensional space, for example."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "And then finally, there's a psychiatric term projections which comes up all the time, which is we very often will look at our internal states and to understand somebody else, we'll project them onto somebody else."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "We'll try to understand someone else's behavior and make sense of it by projecting our own inner feelings, our own sort of narrative onto them and use that as a way to help us understand them better."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "And we'll do the reverse too."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "We'll take things we see in the outside world and we'll bring them into ourselves and see how well they map, how well they align."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "That's called introjection."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So projections turns out to be a really rich word."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "And then finally, of course, there's the very common sense of it as a projector that illuminates by conveying information across space with light."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "So for English, for English language, perfect word to use for this book."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "But what's funny is not every, there are a lot of international translations now and all those rich connotations aren't captured in other languages."}, {"time": 1668, "text": "And so for some translations, connections is used instead of projections."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "In fact, even in England, the British version is connections instead of projections because apparently projections doesn't have the full connotation, I was told."}, {"time": 1682, "text": "So you have to sacrifice some of the rich ambiguity of meaning with connections, that's interesting."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "I mean, connect, man, words are so interesting."}, {"time": 1692, "text": "They have so many meaning."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "I love language and how much is lost in translation."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "I'm very fortunate enough to be able to speak."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "I'm not good at languages."}, {"time": 1700, "text": "I was just, I guess, forced to by life's circumstance to learn two languages, Russian and English."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "And it's just so interesting to watch how much of culture, how much of people, how much of history is lost in translation."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "The poetry, the music, the history, the pain, the way the scientists actually express themselves, which is funny."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "I mean, it's so sad to see how much brilliant work that was written in Russian."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "There's a whole culture of science in the Soviet Union that is now lost."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "It makes me wonder, in the modern day, how much incredible science is going on in China that is lost in translation."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "And I'll never, I mean, that makes me very sad because I'll never learn Chinese in the same way that I've learned English and Russian."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "Maybe, whenever I say stuff like that, people are like, well, there's still time."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "But, you know, yeah, that's actually fair, that I think the 21st century, both China and U.S. will have very important roles in the scientific development and we should actually bridge the gap through language."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "And that doesn't just mean convincing Chinese to speak English."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "That means also learning Chinese."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "Well, we need these bridge people who can do both."}, {"time": 1785, "text": "You know, Nabokov, for example, writing in English beautifully, one of my favorite poets, Borges, who I mentioned earlier, he wrote both in English and in Spanish, I think beautifully in both."}, {"time": 1800, "text": "We need those people who can serve as bridges across cultures who really can do both."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "You mentioned Borges, so you open your book with a few lines from a poem by Jorge Luis Borges, a love poem."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "I'm gonna read parts of it because it's a damn good poem."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "It's called Two English Poems."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "I mean, there's, I'd like to understand why you used it and the specific parts you used, which is interesting."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "But then when I read the full thing, so I think you used it as a sort

one of the interesting things that came from the early decades of psychiatry really was this distinction between the conscious and the unconscious mind and paying particular attention to the unconscious mind as something that was worthy of consideration that might be important in explaining people's actions and that perhaps even insight into that was valuable in its own right."}, {"time":

simplistic to call psychoanalysis conversation?"}, {"time": 2883, "text": "That's not too simplistic, but that's right."}, {"time": 2885, "text": "And I think that was valuable."}, {"time": 2886,

separating was Carl Jung felt there was a lot more to the unconscious than this libidinous aspect of it."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "And he saw it as a much more complete alternate representation of the conscious self, one that maybe reflected a whole range of different motivations and desires."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "And to properly treat it one had to consider all of them rather than the ones that Freud was focused on."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "Carl Jung, shut your mouth."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "Thank you for the high level of images that Sergei's pulling up."}, {"time": 2954,

philosophical exploration of human mind, human motivations."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "So it's not even like necessarily, it's also doubles as a methodology for helping people, but it's almost like a, it's a kind of philosophical method."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "Right, this is the fascinating thing about psychoanalysis."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "And even though it's, I would say, mostly not considered a treatment today, it persists for a couple of reasons."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "One is it's thought that it gives people some insight."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "But second, there's been a huge influence on literature, on philosophy, on art."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "And the opening up of discussion about what was below our conscious mind was so fertile in the implications that it sort of reverberated and still does throughout all these different realms of human endeavor from different artistic experiences that people have that can be colored by this concept of the unconscious."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Now, the other thing that was interesting is this distinction, you know, what are the parts of the unconscious?"}, {"time": 3057, "text": "And so there were these id and ego and superego subdivisions that, you know, that Freud, for example, would talk about them."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "And the id was the primary, the primal drives that an infant would have or that a very young child just warmth and feeding and then later the sexual or libidinous aspects."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "And for Freud, the later happened very quickly."}, {"time": 3085,

on that aspect."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "But then there was the superego, which brought on these later sort of moralistic sort of codes of conduct."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "And that, of course, was very often in tension, but all this could play out subconsciously."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "And then the ego, this third aspect was mediating, and Freud's conception mediated this tension between the different parts."}, {"time": 3126, "text": "Now, I think that's interesting."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "I will say that in some ways, it's maybe unnecessary from the perspective of modern neuroscience to divide things up that way from the moralistic drives and the primal gratification drives."}, {"time": 3147, "text": "In some ways, they're all drives, and maybe they're even all primal drives."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "The moralistic drives, they're taught, and they're taught in ways that ultimately relate back to survival, and you could even say, selfish aspects of health and life

interesting, but these categorizations of id and superego may not map onto neurobiology in any particular way."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "If there's a town hall of competing drives and desires, and they interrelate to each other, they involve different aspects of the brain and the history of the person, and actions and choices come out of the result of that overall shouting in the town hall."},

Daniel Kahneman with System One and System Two."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "There's just these very compelling categorizations of the human mind that seem to be sticky in the superego, no, in how we

cells, it seems to get farther away."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "And I'll give you an example of what I mean by that."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "So one thing I'm doing in my laboratory and many people

that cell but not these other cells?"}, {"time": 3723, "text": "Yeah, so if you could, exactly, so if you could turn on or off the brain or parts of the brain or cell types or individual cells at the

could prevent complex things from happening in a specific way."}, {"time": 3747, "text": "But right away, you've got a problem if you wanna do this and scientists, neuroscientists have wanted to do

would probably be very farfetched, but it would be a good thing."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "And so that's what you're actually saying, like if you wanna do this kind of thing and you imagine like, how do I get inside the brain?"}, {"time": 3802, "text": "It's pretty difficult."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "It's pretty difficult and then even once you get in, it's hard because all brain cells are

not built for that."}, {"time": 3879, "text": "There's no reason for them to respond to light in there, which is a great situation to start with because any light sensitivity you can provide to some cells will be a huge signal above the noise."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "And so that's what we do with optogenetics."}, {"time": 3893, "text": "We take genes, bits of DNA from microbes, single celled organisms, and these single celled organisms like algae, they make little proteins that sit in the surface of their cells that receive light, capture a photon of light and open up a little hole in the membrane of the cell and let charged particles, ions like sodium and potassium flow across the membrane of the cell."}, {"time": 3924, "text": "And that, these algae and bacteria, they do this for their own reasons because that helps them move, it helps them make and use energy."}, {"time": 3934, "text": "But that's a beautiful thing for neuroscience because movement of ions, charged particles across the membrane of the cell is exactly the kind of electricity that neurons work with."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "And so that's the essence of optogenetics is the ability to do that."}, {"time":

by our evolution as social primates."}, {"time": 10622, "text": "Now, how could that happen?"}, {"time": 10623, "text": "Well, the lacrimal gland is controlled by structures in the pons, which is a

just a little misdirection, a little missing of one sign post to stop here, going on a little farther, getting to the lacrimal gland neurons gave us crying."}, {"time": 10718, "text": "And that's, and

something is missing."}, {"time": 10805, "text": "And a lot of little stuff, it feels like it really, it's almost involuntary, I guess, but it's harder to describe as the presence or absence of tears."}, {"time": 10813, "text": "It's like something about this person, you can tell they're not bullshitting you."}, {"time": 10819, "text": "And so that was what made, presumably, that tear recruitment so powerful, is it just landed in this very high value real estate for social communication."}, {"time": 10829, "text": "If it had gone to, you know, there's a lot of neurons in the pons that control movement of large muscles elsewhere, that would have been much less effective as a social signal than something around the eye."}, {"time": 10843, "text": "So it was, however that little misdirection happened, it landed in a great area for social communication."}, {"time": 10850, "text": "And because it was coming from the fear and anxiety circuits that regulate that necessary involuntary change in heart rate and respiratory rate, it also was involuntary and that became valuable as a truth signal, as social beings."}, {"time": 10865, "text": "So very interesting when you

well, I just think, I think one of the problems that I think we need to let go of is we tend to, outside of the experience of consciousness, the hard problem of consciousness, we tend to think that we

this."}, {"time": 11392, "text": "So in fact, one really nice way to break through that is to either observe or create consciousness that spans multiple organisms."}, {"time": 11407, "text": "Sort of

the same head?"}, {"time": 11457, "text": "We don't know why that would be the case that they do."}, {"time": 11462, "text": "And so that's a huge unanswered question in the field is what is it that

your sense of self becomes separated from your body."}, {"time": 11483, "text": "Those things that were fused in a joint representation, the same concept, unitary, are now separate."}, {"time": 11491,

cortex and we got different parts of the brain to be out of sync and when they were active, never able to be active at the same time, never able to form a joint representation at the same time."},

ketamine effects."}, {"time": 11524, "text": "And you're able to find that kind of oscillation."}, {"time": 11528, "text": "Wow, wow, wow."}, {"time": 11529, "text": "I see if you get even greater and greater control with more control over individual neurons and understanding, like if you think of certain neurons that having some role to play in the sense of self, you can play like an orchestra."},

complicated light switch essentially."}, {"time": 11561, "text": "And here's the challenge is the nice thing about the thought experiment is it kind of highlights that we're gonna hit a point where

to be in sync temporarily?"}, {"time": 11601, "text": "Do they need to be, is there some other quality that we don't know about that also needs to be present to allow cells to fuse together into a

going on in the brain."}, {"time": 11626, "text": "And you're saying there could be something like a theory of everything if one to exist is to understand why, how and why signals close to each other
