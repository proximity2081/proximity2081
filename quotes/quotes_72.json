fall in love with geometry, so how do you think about geometry?"}, {"time": 333, "text": "Why is it a special field in mathematics?"}, {"time": 336, "text": "And how did you fall in love with it if you have?"}, {"time": 339, "text": "Wow, you've given me like a lot to say."}, {"time": 341, "text": "And certainly the experience that you describe is so typical, but there's two versions of it."}, {"time": 348, "text": "One thing I say in the book is that geometry is the cilantro of math."}, {"time": 351, "text": "People are not neutral about it."}, {"time": 352, "text": "There's people who like you are like, the rest of it I could take or leave, but then at this one moment, it made sense."}, {"time": 359, "text": "This class made sense, why wasn't it all like that?"}, {"time": 361, "text": "There's other people, I can tell you, because they come and talk to me all the time, who are like, I understood all the stuff where you're trying to figure out what X was, there's some mystery you're trying to solve it, X is a number, I figured it out."}, {"time": 370, "text": "But then there was this geometry, like what was that?"}, {"time": 372, "text": "What happened that year?"}, {"time": 372, "text": "Like I didn't get it."}, {"time": 374, "text": "I was like lost the whole year and I didn't understand like why we even spent the time doing that."}, {"time": 378, "text": "So, but what everybody agrees on is that it's somehow different, right?"}, {"time": 382, "text": "There's something special about it."}, {"time": 385, "text": "We're gonna walk around in circles a little bit, but we'll get there."}, {"time": 387, "text": "You asked me how I fell in love with math."}, {"time": 392, "text": "I have a story about this."}, {"time": 396, "text": "When I was a small child, I don't know, maybe like I was six or seven, I don't know."}, {"time": 402, "text": "I'm from the 70s."}, {"time": 402, "text": "I think you're from a different decade than that."}, {"time": 404, "text": "But in the 70s, we had a cool wooden box around your stereo."}, {"time": 409, "text": "That was the look, everything was dark wood."}, {"time": 411, "text": "And the box had a bunch of holes in it to let the sound out."}, {"time": 416, "text": "And the holes were in this rectangular array, a six by eight array of holes."}, {"time": 422, "text": "And I was just kind of like zoning out in the living room as kids do, looking at this six by eight rectangular array of holes."}, {"time": 429, "text": "And if you like, just by kind of like focusing in and out, just by kind of looking at this box, looking at this rectangle, I was like, well, there's six rows of eight holes each, but there's also eight columns of six holes each."}, {"time": 446, "text": "So eight sixes and six eights."}, {"time": 449, "text": "It's just like the dissection proofs we were just talking about, but it's the same holes."}, {"time": 452, "text": "It's the same 48 holes."}, {"time": 453, "text": "That's how many there are, no matter whether you count them as rows or count them as columns."}, {"time": 458, "text": "And this was like unbelievable to me."}, {"time": 461, "text": "Am I allowed to cuss on your podcast?"}, {"time": 463, "text": "I don't know if that's, are we FCC regulated?"}, {"time": 465, "text": "Okay, it was fucking unbelievable."}, {"time": 467, "text": "Okay, that's the last time."}, {"time": 468, "text": "Get it in there."}, {"time": 468, "text": "This story merits it."}, {"time": 469, "text": "So two different perspectives in the same physical reality."}, {"time": 475, "text": "And it's just as you say."}, {"time": 478, "text": "I knew that six times eight was the same as eight times six."}, {"time": 481, "text": "I knew my times tables."}, {"time": 482, "text": "I knew that that was a fact."}, {"time": 484, "text": "But did I really know it until that moment?"}, {"time": 488, "text": "I sort of knew that the times table was symmetric, but I didn't know why that was the case until that moment."}, {"time": 493, "text": "And in that moment I could see like, oh, I didn't have to have somebody tell me that."}, {"time": 497, "text": "That's information that you can just directly access."}, {"time": 500, "text": "That's a really amazing moment."}, {"time": 501, "text": "And as math teachers, that's something that we're really trying to bring to our students."}, {"time": 505, "text": "And I was one of those who did not love the kind of Euclidean geometry ninth grade class of like prove that an isosceles triangle has equal angles at the base, like this kind of thing."}, {"time": 515, "text": "It didn't vibe with me the way that algebra and numbers did."}, {"time": 519, "text": "But if you go back to that moment, from my adult perspective, looking back at what happened with that rectangle, I think that is a very geometric moment."}, {"time": 525, "text": "In fact, that moment exactly encapsulates the intertwining of algebra and geometry."}, {"time": 533, "text": "This algebraic fact that, well, in the instance, eight times six is equal to six times eight."}, {"time": 537, "text": "But in general, that whatever two numbers you have, you multiply them one way."}, {"time": 541, "text": "And it's the same as if you multiply them in the other order."}, {"time": 543, "text": "It attaches it to this geometric fact about a rectangle, which in some sense makes it true."}, {"time": 549, "text": "So, who knows, maybe I was always fated to be an algebraic geometer, which is what I am as a researcher."}, {"time": 555, "text": "So that's the kind of transformation."}, {"time": 557, "text": "And you talk about symmetry in your book."}, {"time": 560, "text": "What the heck is symmetry?"}, {"time": 562, "text": "What the heck is these kinds of transformation on objects that once you transform them, they seem to be similar?"}, {"time": 569, "text": "What do you make of it?"}, {"time": 570, "text": "What's its use in mathematics or maybe broadly in understanding our world?"}, {"time": 575, "text": "Well, it's an absolutely fundamental concept."}, {"time": 577, "text": "And it starts with the word symmetry in the way that we usually use it when we're just like talking English and not talking mathematics, right?"}, {"time": 583, "text": "Sort of something is, when we say something is symmetrical, we usually means it has what's called an axis of symmetry."}, {"time": 589, "text": "Maybe like the left half of it looks the same as the right half."}, {"time": 592, "text": "That would be like a left, right axis of symmetry."}, {"time": 595, "text": "Or maybe the top half looks like the bottom half or both."}, {"time": 597, "text": "Maybe there's sort of a fourfold symmetry where the top looks like the bottom and the left looks like the right or more."}, {"time": 603, "text": "And that can take you in a lot of different directions."}, {"time": 606, "text": "The abstract study of what the possible combinations of symmetries there are, a subject which is called group theory was actually one of my first loves in mathematics when I thought about a lot when I was in college."}, {"time": 617, "text": "But the notion of symmetry is actually much more general than the things that we would call symmetry if we were looking at like a classical building or a painting or something like that."}, {"time": 630, "text": "Nowadays in math, we could use a symmetry to refer to any kind of transformation of an image or a space or an object."}, {"time": 643, "text": "So what I talk about in the book is take a figure and stretch it vertically, make it twice as big vertically and make it half as wide."}, {"time": 658, "text": "That I would call a symmetry."}, {"time": 660, "text": "It's not a symmetry in the classical sense, but it's a well defined transformation that has an input and an output."}, {"time": 667, "text": "I give you some shape and it gets kind of, I call this in the book a scrunch."}, {"time": 672, "text": "I just had to make up some sort of funny sounding name for it because it doesn't really have a name."}, {"time": 680, "text": "And just as you can sort of study which kinds of objects are symmetrical under the operations of switching left and right or switching top and bottom or rotating 40 degrees or what have you, you could study what kinds of things are preserved by this kind of scrunch symmetry."}, {"time": 696, "text": "And this kind of more general idea of what a symmetry can be."}, {"time": 704, "text": "A fundamental mathematical idea, in some sense, I might even say the idea that dominates contemporary mathematics."}, {"time": 711, "text": "Or by contemporary, by the way, I mean like the last like 150 years."}, {"time": 714, "text": "We're on a very long time scale in math."}, {"time": 716, "text": "I don't mean like yesterday."}, {"time": 717, "text": "I mean like a century or so up till now."}, {"time": 720, "text": "Is this idea that it's a fundamental question of when do we consider two things to be the same?"}, {"time": 727, "text": "That might seem like a complete triviality."}, {"time": 730, "text": "For instance, if I have a triangle and I have a triangle of the exact same dimensions, but it's over here, are those the same or different?"}, {"time": 739, "text": "Well, you might say, well, look, there's two different things."}, {"time": 741, "text": "This one's over here, this one's over there."}, {"time": 742, "text": "On the other hand, if you prove a theorem about this one, it's probably still true about this one if it has like all the same side lanes and angles and like looks exactly the same."}, {"time": 751, "text": "The term of art, if you want it, you would say they're congruent."}, {"time": 754, "text": "But one way of saying it is there's a symmetry called translation, which just means move everything three inches to the left."}, {"time": 760, "text": "And we want all of our theories to be translation invariant."}, {"time": 765, "text": "What that means is that if you prove a theorem about a thing that's over here, and then you move it three inches to the left, it would be kind of weird if all of your theorems like didn't still work."}, {"time": 775, "text": "So this question of like, what are the symmetries and which things that you want to study are invariant under those symmetries is absolutely fundamental."}, {"time": 782, "text": "Boy, this is getting a little abstract, right?"}, {"time": 784, "text": "It's not at all abstract."}, {"time": 785, "text": "I think this is completely central to everything I think about in terms of artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 791, "text": "I don't know if you know about the MNIST dataset, what's handwritten digits."}, {"time": 795, "text": "And you know, I don't smoke much weed or any really, but it certainly feels like it when I look at MNIST and think about this stuff, which is like, what's the difference between one and two?"}, {"time": 808, "text": "And why are all the twos similar to each other?"}, {"time": 812, "text": "What kind of transformations are within the category of what makes a thing the same?"}, {"time": 819, "text": "And what kind of transformations are those that make it different?"}, {"time": 822, "text": "And symmetries core to that."}, {"time": 859, "text": "And so I kind of stared and wonder how, what kind of symmetries are enough to solve the MNIST handwritten digit recognition problem and write that down."}, {"time": 872, "text": "And exactly, and what's so fascinating about the work in that direction from the point of view of a mathematician like me and a geometer is that the kind of groups of symmetries, the types of symmetries that we know of are not sufficient."}, {"time": 885, "text": "So in other words, like we're just gonna keep on going into the weeds on this."}, {"time": 891, "text": "The deeper, the better."}, {"time": 893, "text": "A kind of symmetry that we understand very well is rotation."}, {"time": 896, "text": "So here's what would be easy."}, {"time": 897, "text": "If humans, if we recognize the digit as a one, if it was like literally a rotation by some number of degrees or some fixed one in some typeface like Palatino or something, that would be very easy to understand."}, {"time": 912, "text": "It would be very easy to like write a program that could detect whether something was a rotation of a fixed digit one."}, {"time": 920, "text": "Whatever we're doing when you recognize the digit one and distinguish it from the digit two, it's not that."}, {"time": 925, "text": "It's not just incorporating one of the types of symmetries that we understand."}, {"time": 932, "text": "Now, I would say that I would be shocked if there was some kind of classical symmetry type formulation that captured what we're doing when we tell the difference between a two and a three."}, {"time": 945, "text": "To be honest, I think what we're doing is actually more complicated than that."}, {"time": 950, "text": "I feel like it must be."}, {"time": 952, "text": "They're so simple, these numbers."}, {"time": 953, "text": "I mean, they're really geometric objects."}, {"time": 955, "text": "Like we can draw out one, two, three."}, {"time": 958, "text": "It does seem like it should be formalizable."}, {"time": 961, "text": "That's why it's so strange."}, {"time": 963, "text": "Do you think it's formalizable when something stops being a two and starts being a three?"}, {"time": 966, "text": "Right, you can imagine something continuously deforming from being a two to a three."}, {"time": 971, "text": "Yeah, but that's, there is a moment."}, {"time": 975, "text": "Like I have myself written programs that literally morph twos and threes and so on."}, {"time": 980, "text": "And you watch, and there is moments that you notice depending on the trajectory of that transformation, that morphing, that it is a three and a two."}, {"time": 992, "text": "There's a hard line."}, {"time": 993, "text": "Wait, so if you ask people, if you showed them this morph, if you ask a bunch of people, do they all agree about where the transition happened?"}, {"time": 999, "text": "Because I would be surprised."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Oh my God, okay, we have an empirical dispute."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "Here's the problem, that if I just showed that moment that I agreed on."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "Well, that's not fair."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "No, but say I said, so I want to move away from the agreement because that's a fascinating actually question that I want to backtrack from because I just dogmatically said, because I could be very, very wrong."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "But the morphing really helps that like the change, because I mean, partially it's because our perception systems, see this, it's all probably tied in there."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "Somehow the change from one to the other, like seeing the video of it allows you to pinpoint the place where a two becomes a three much better."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "If I just showed you one picture, I think you might really, really struggle."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "You might call a seven."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "I think there's something also that we don't often think about, which is it's not just about the static image, it's the transformation of the image, or it's not a static shape, it's the transformation of the shape."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "There's something in the movement that seems to be not just about our perception system, but fundamental to our cognition, like how we think about stuff."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "Yeah, and that's part of geometry too."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "And in fact, again, another insight of modern geometry is this idea that maybe we would naively think we're gonna study, I don't know, like Poincare, we're gonna study the three body problem."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "We're gonna study sort of like three objects in space moving around subject only to the force of each other's gravity, which sounds very simple, right?"}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And if you don't know about this problem, you're probably like, okay, so you just like put it in your computer and see what they do."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Well, guess what?"}, {"time": 1102, "text": "That's like a problem that Poincare won a huge prize for like making the first real progress on in the 1880s."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "And we still don't know that much about it 150 years later."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "I mean, it's a humongous mystery."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "You just opened the door and we're gonna walk right in before we return to symmetry."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "What's the, who's Poincare and what's this conjecture that he came up with?"}, {"time": 1126, "text": "Why is it such a hard problem?"}, {"time": 1128, "text": "Okay, so Poincare, he ends up being a major figure in the book and I didn't even really intend for him to be such a big figure, but he's first and foremost a geometer, right?"}, {"time": 1140, "text": "So he's a mathematician who kind of comes up in late 19th century France at a time when French math is really starting to flower."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Actually, I learned a lot."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "I mean, in math, we're not really trained on our own history."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "We got a PhD in math, learned about math."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "So I learned a lot."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "There's this whole kind of moment where France has just been beaten in the Franco Prussian war."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "And they're like, oh my God, what did we do wrong?"}, {"time": 1163, "text": "And they were like, we gotta get strong in math like the Germans."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "We have to be like more like the Germans."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "So this never happens to us again."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "So it's very much, it's like the Sputnik moment, like what happens in America in the 50s and 60s with the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "This is happening to France and they're trying to kind of like instantly like modernize."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "That's fascinating that the humans and mathematics are intricately connected to the history of humans."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "The Cold War is I think fundamental to the way people saw science and math in the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "I don't know if that was true in the United States, but certainly it was in the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "It definitely was, and I would love to hear more about how it was in the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "I mean, there was, and we'll talk about the Olympiad."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "I just remember that there was this feeling like the world hung in a balance and you could save the world with the tools of science."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "And mathematics was like the superpower that fuels science."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "And so like people were seen as, you know, people in America often idolize athletes, but ultimately the best athletes in the world, they just throw a ball into a basket."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "So like there's not, what people really enjoy about sports, I love sports, is like excellence at the highest level."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "But when you take that with mathematics and science, people also enjoyed excellence in science and mathematics in the Soviet Union, but there's an extra sense that that excellence would lead to a better world."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "So that created all the usual things you think about with the Olympics, which is like extreme competitiveness."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "But it also created this sense that in the modern era in America, somebody like Elon Musk, whatever you think of him, like Jeff Bezos, those folks, they inspire the possibility that one person or a group of smart people can change the world."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "Like not just be good at what they do, but actually change the world."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "Mathematics was at the core of that."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "I don't know, there's a romanticism around it too."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Like when you read books about in America, people romanticize certain things like baseball, for example."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "There's like these beautiful poetic writing about the game of baseball."}, {"time": 1307, "text": "The same was the feeling with mathematics and science in the Soviet Union, and it was in the air."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "Everybody was forced to take high level mathematics courses."}, {"time": 1317, "text": "Like you took a lot of math, you took a lot of science and a lot of like really rigorous literature."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "Like the level of education in Russia, this could be true in China, I'm not sure, in a lot of countries is in whatever that's called, it's K to 12 in America, but like young people education."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "The level they were challenged to learn at is incredible."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "It's like America falls far behind, I would say."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "America then quickly catches up and then exceeds everybody else as you start approaching the end of high school to college."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "Like the university system in the United States arguably is the best in the world."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "But like what we challenge everybody, it's not just like the good, the A students, but everybody to learn in the Soviet Union was fascinating."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "I think I'm gonna pick up on something you said."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "I think you would love a book called Dual at Dawn by Amir Alexander, which I think some of the things you're responding to and what I wrote, I think I first got turned on to by Amir's work, he's a historian of math."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "And he writes about the story of Everest to Galois, which is a story that's well known to all mathematicians, this kind of like very, very romantic figure who he really sort of like begins the development of this or this theory of groups that I mentioned earlier, this general theory of symmetries and then dies in a duel in his early 20s, like all this stuff, mostly unpublished."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "It's a very, very romantic story that we all learn."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "And much of it is true, but Alexander really lays out just how much the way people thought about math in those times in the early 19th century was wound up with, as you say, romanticism."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "I mean, that's when the romantic movement takes place and he really outlines how people were predisposed to think about mathematics in that way because they thought about poetry that way and they thought about music that way."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "It was the mood of the era to think about we're reaching for the transcendent, we're sort of reaching for sort of direct contact with the divine."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "And part of the reason that we think of Gawa that way was because Gawa himself was a creature of that era and he romanticized himself."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "I mean, now we know he wrote lots of letters and he was kind of like, I mean, in modern terms, we would say he was extremely emo."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "Like we wrote all these letters about his like florid feelings and like the fire within him about the mathematics."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "And so it's just as you say that the math history touches human history."}, {"time": 1469, "text": "They're never separate because math is made of people."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "I mean, that's what, it's people who do it and we're human beings doing it and we do it within whatever community we're in and we do it affected by the mores of the society around us."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "So the French, the Germans and Poincare."}, {"time": 1487, "text": "Yes, okay, so back to Poincare."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "So he's, you know, it's funny."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "This book is filled with kind of mathematical characters who often are kind of peevish or get into feuds or sort of have like weird enthusiasms because those people are fun to write about and they sort of like say very salty things."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Poincare is actually none of this."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "As far as I can tell, he was an extremely normal dude who didn't get into fights with people and everybody liked him and he was like pretty personally modest and he had very regular habits."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "He did math for like four hours in the morning and four hours in the evening and that was it."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "Like he had his schedule."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "I actually, it was like, I still am feeling like somebody's gonna tell me now that the book is out, like, oh, didn't you know about this like incredibly sordid episode?"}, {"time": 1537, "text": "As far as I could tell, a completely normal guy."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "But he just kind of, in many ways, creates the geometric world in which we live and his first really big success is this prize paper he writes for this prize offered by the King of Sweden for the study of the three body problem."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "The study of what we can say about, yeah, three astronomical objects moving in what you might think would be this very simple way."}, {"time": 1569, "text": "Nothing's going on except gravity."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "So what's the three body problem?"}, {"time": 1573, "text": "Why is it a problem?"}, {"time": 1575, "text": "So the problem is to understand when this motion is stable and when it's not."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "So stable meaning they would sort of like end up in some kind of periodic orbit."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "Or I guess it would mean, sorry, stable would mean they never sort of fly off far apart from each other."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "And unstable would mean like eventually they fly apart."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "So understanding two bodies is much easier."}, {"time": 1593, "text": "When you have the third wheel is always a problem."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "This is what

first hearing it think it's a triviality and they're like, well, the answer is obvious."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "And then what happens if you ever ask a group of people that something wonderfully comic happens, which is that everyone's like, well, it's completely obvious."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "And then each person realizes that half the person, the other people in the room have a different obvious answer for the way they have."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "And then people get really heated."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "People are like, I can't believe that you think it has two holes or like, I can't believe that you think it has one."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "And then, you know, you really, like people really learn something about each other and people get heated."},

people, the zero holders are rare."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "They would say like, well, look, you can make a straw by taking a rectangular piece of plastic and closing it up."}, {"time": 2891,

it's just one thing."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "Okay, most people don't see it that way."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "That's like a...

a bagel."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So if you're really committed, you can be like, okay, a bagel doesn't have a hole either."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "But like, who are you if you say a bagel

other options?"}, {"time": 2942, "text": "So, you know, one whole people would say..."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "I like how these are like groups of people."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "Like we've

all the way through the straw, right?"}, {"time": 2959, "text": "It's one region of space, that's the hole."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "And two whole people would say like, well, look, there's a hole in the top and a hole at the bottom."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "I think a common thing you see when people argue about this, they would take something like this bottle of water I'm holding and go open it and they say, well, how many holes are there in this?"}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And you say like, well, there's one hole at the top."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "Okay, what if I like poke a hole here so that all the water spills out?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "Well, now it's a straw."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "So if you're a one holder, I say to you like, well, how many holes are in it now?"}, {"time": 2996, "text": "There was one hole in it before and I poked a new hole in it."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "And then you think there's still one hole even though there was one hole and I made one more?"}, {"time": 3004, "text": "Clearly not, this is two holes."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "And yet if you're a two holder, the one holder will say like, okay, where does one hole begin and the other hole end?"}, {"time": 3016, "text": "And in the book, I sort of, you know, in math, there's two things we do when we're faced with a problem that's confusing us."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "We can make the problem simpler."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "That's what we were doing a minute ago when we were talking about high dimensional space."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "And I was like, let's talk about like circles and line segments."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "Let's like go down a dimension to make it easier."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "The other big move we have is to make the problem harder and try to sort of really like face up to what are the complications."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "So, you know, what I do in the book is say like, let's stop talking about straws for a minute and talk about pants."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "How many holes are there in a pair of pants?"}, {"time": 3046, "text": "So I think most people who say there's two holes in a straw would say there's three holes in a pair of pants."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "I guess, I mean, I guess we're filming only from here."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "I could take up, no, I'm not gonna do it."}, {"time": 3056,

"text": "That's that Patreon only footage."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "So many people would say there's three holes in a pair of pants."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "But you know, for instance, my daughter, when I asked, by the way, talking to kids about this is super fun."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "I highly recommend it."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "What did she say?"}, {"time": 3077, "text": "She said, well, yeah, I feel a pair of pants like just has two holes because yes, there's the waist, but that's just the two leg holes stuck together."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "Whoa, okay."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "Two leg holes, yeah, okay."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "I mean, that really is a good combination."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "So she's a one holder for the straw."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "So she's a one holder for the straw too."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And that really does capture something."}, {"time": 3099, "text": "It captures this fact, which is central to the theory of what's called homology, which is like a central part of modern topology that holes, whatever we may mean by them, they're somehow things which have an arithmetic to them."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "They're things which can be added."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Like the waist, like waist equals leg plus leg is kind of an equation, but it's not an equation about numbers."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "It's an equation about some kind of geometric, some kind of topological thing, which is very strange."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "And so, you know, when I come down, you know, like a rabbi, I like to kind of like come up with these answers and somehow like dodge the original question and say like, you're both right, my children."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "So for the straw, I think what a modern mathematician would say is like, the first version would be to say like, well, there are two holes, but they're really both the same hole."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "Well, that's not quite right."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "A better way to say it is there's two holes, but one is the negative of the other."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Now, what can that mean?"}, {"time": 3159, "text": "One way of thinking about what it means is that if you sip something like a milkshake through the straw, no matter what, the amount of milkshake that's flowing in one end, that same amount is flowing out the other end."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "So they're not independent from each other."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "There's some relationship between them."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "In the same way that if you somehow could like suck a milkshake through a pair of pants, the amount of milkshake, just go with me on this thought experiment."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "I'm right there with you."},

waist of the pants."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "So just so you know, I fasted for 72 hours the last three days."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "So I just broke the fast with a little bit of food yesterday."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "So this sounds, food analogies or metaphors for this podcast work wonderfully because I can intensely picture it."}, {"time": 3215, "text": "Is that your weekly

yes."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "Water and salt, so like electrolytes and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "But anyway, so the inflow on the top of the pants equals to the outflow on the bottom of the pants."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "Exactly, so this idea that, I mean, I think, you know, Poincare really had this idea, this sort of modern idea."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "I mean, building on stuff other people did, Betty is an important one, of this kind of modern notion of relations between holes."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "But the idea that holes really had an arithmetic, the really modern view was really Emmy Noether's idea."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "So she kind of comes in and sort of truly puts the subject on its modern footing that we have now."},

took like a semester of algebraic anthropology."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "It's not like this and it's always a challenge writing about math because there are some things that you can really do on the page and the math is there."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "And there's other things which it's too much in a book like this to like do them all the page."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "You can only say something about them, if that makes sense."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "So, you know, in the book, I try to do some of both."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "I try to do, I try to, topics that are, you can't really compress and really truly say exactly what they are in this amount of space."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "I try to say something interesting about them, something meaningful about them so that readers can get the flavor."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "And then in other places, I really try to get up close and personal and really do the math and have it take place on the page."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "To some degree be able to give inklings of the beauty of the subject."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of books that are like, I don't quite know how to express this well."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "I'm still laboring to do it, but there's a lot of books that are about stuff, but I want my books to not only be about stuff, but to actually have some stuff there on the page in the book for people to interact with directly and not just sort of hear me talk about distant features of it."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "Right, so not be talking just about ideas, but the actually be expressing the idea."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "Is there, you know, somebody in the, maybe you can comment, there's a guy, his YouTube channel is 3Blue1Brown, Grant Sanderson."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "He does that masterfully well."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "Of visualizing, of expressing a particular idea and then talking about it as well back and forth."}, {"time": 3394, "text":

can teach people math."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "There's the traditional one, right?"}, {"time": 3411, "text": "Where I'm in a classroom with, depending on the class, it could be 30 people, it could be a hundred people, it could, God help me, be a 500 people if it's like the big calculus lecture or whatever it may be."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "And there's sort of some, but there's some set of people of that order of magnitude and I'm with them, we have a long time."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "I'm with them for a whole semester and I can ask them to do homework and we talk together."},

3437, "text": "Like not that many, right?"}, {"time": 3440, "text": "And you can, and there's kind of an inverse relationship where the more, the fewer people you're talking to, the more engagement you can ask for."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "The ultimate of course is like the mentorship relation of like a PhD advisor and a graduate student where you spend a lot of one on one time together for like three to five years."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "And the ultimate high level of engagement to one person."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "Books, this can get to a lot more people that are ever gonna sit in my classroom and you spend like however many hours it takes to read a book."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "Somebody like Three Blue One Brown or Numberphile or people like Vi Hart."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "I mean, YouTube, let's face it, has bigger reach than a book."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "Like there's YouTube videos that have many, many, many more views than like any hardback book like not written by a Kardashian or an Obama is gonna sell, right?"}, {"time": 3496, "text": "So that's, I mean, and then those are, some of them are like longer, 20 minutes long, some of them are five minutes long, but they're shorter."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "And then even some of you look like Eugenia Chang who's a wonderful category theorist in Chicago."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "I mean, she was on, I think the Daily Show or is it, I mean, she was on, she has 30 seconds, but then there's like 30 seconds to sort of say something about mathematics to like untold millions of people."},

I sort of spent a lot of time like thinking about how to put English words together into sentences and sentences together into paragraphs, like at length, which is this kind of like weird specialized skill."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "And that's one thing, but like sort of being able to make like winning, good looking, eye catching videos is like a totally different skill."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "And probably somewhere out there, there's probably sort of some like heavy metal band that's like teaching math through heavy metal and like using their skills to do that."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "I hope there is at any rate."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "Their music and so on, yeah."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "But there is something to the process."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "I mean, Grant does this especially well, which is in order to be able to visualize something, now he writes programs, so it's programmatic visualization."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "So like the things he is basically mostly through his Manum library and Python, everything is drawn through Python."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "You have to truly understand the topic to be able to visualize it in that way and not just understand it, but really kind of think in a very novel way."}, {"time": 3604, "text": "It's funny because I've spoken with him a couple of times, spoken to him a lot offline as well."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "He really doesn't think he's doing anything new, meaning like he sees himself as very different from maybe like a researcher, but it feels to me like he's creating something totally new."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "Like that act of understanding and visualizing is as powerful or has the same kind of inkling of power as does the process of proving something."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "It doesn't have that clear destination, but it's pulling out an insight and creating multiple sets of perspective that arrive at that insight."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "And to be honest, it's something that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value inside academic mathematics in the same way, and this is a bit older, that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value the development of computational infrastructure."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "We all have computers as our partners now and people build computers that sort of assist and participate in our mathematics."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "They build those systems and that's a kind of mathematics too, but not in the traditional form of proving theorems and writing papers."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "But I think it's coming."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "Look, I mean, I think, for example, the Institute for Computational Experimental Mathematics at Brown, which is like, it's a NSF funded math institute, very much part of sort of traditional math academia."}, {"time": 3689, "text": "They did an entire theme semester about visualizing mathematics, looking at the same kind of thing that they would do for like an up and coming research topic."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "Like that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "So I think there really is buy in from the mathematics community to recognize that this kind of stuff is important and counts as part of mathematics, like part of what we're actually here to do."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "Yeah, I'm hoping to see more and more of that from like MIT

does he want me to answer?"}, {"time": 3748, "text": "Is there something interesting to be said about that?"}, {"time": 3751, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I am tremendously interested in what AI can do in pure mathematics."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "I mean, it's, of course, it's a parochial interest, right?"}, {"time": 3760, "text": "You're like, why am I interested in like, how it can like help feed the world or help solve like real social problems?"}, {"time": 3764, "text": "I'm like, can it do more math?"}, {"time": 3766, "text": "Like, what can I do?"}, {"time": 3767, "text": "We all have our interests, right?"}, {"time": 3769, "text": "But I think it is a really interesting conceptual question."}, {"time": 3773, "text": "And here too, I think it's important to be kind of historical

machines."}, {"time": 3789, "text": "Like, you know, in 1890, somebody could be like, here's my PhD thesis."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "I computed all the invariants of this polynomial ring under the

computer algebra programs."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "So those are like sort of bespoke systems that lots of mathematicians use."}, {"time": 3828, "text": "That's similar to Maple and... Yeah, oh yeah, so it's similar to Maple and Mathematica, yeah, but a little more specialized, but yeah."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "It's programs that work with symbols and allow you to do, can you do proofs?"}, {"time": 3838, "text": "Can you do kind of little leaps and proofs?"}, {"time": 3841, "text": "They're not really built for that."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "And that's a whole other story."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "But these tools are part of the process of mathematics now."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "Right, they are now for most mathematicians, I would say, part of the process of mathematics."}, {"time": 3851, "text": "And so, you know, there's a story I tell in the book, which I'm fascinated by, which is, you know, so far, attempts to get AIs to prove interesting theorems have not done so well."}, {"time": 3867, "text": "It doesn't mean they can."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "There's actually a paper I just saw, which has a very nice use of a neural net to find counter examples to conjecture."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Somebody said like, well, maybe this is always that."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "And you can be like, well, let me sort of train an AI to sort of try to find things where that's not true."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "And it actually succeeded."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "Now, in this case, if you look at the things that it found, you say like, okay, I mean, these are not famous conjectures."}, {"time": 3893, "text": "Okay, so like somebody wrote this down, maybe this is so."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "Looking at what the AI came up with, you're like, you know, I bet if like five grad students had thought about that problem, they wouldn't have come up with that."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "I mean, when you see it, you're like, okay, that is one of the things you might try if you sort of like put some work into it."}, {"time": 3910, "text": "Still, it's pretty awesome."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "But the story I tell in the book, which I'm

what it is."}, {"time": 3947, "text": "So knots."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "Yeah, so there was a question and again, it doesn't matter the technicalities of the question, but it's a question of

just Wiles, Andrew Wiles being the person who, together with Richard Taylor, finally proved this theorem."}, {"time": 4441, "text": "But you know how you have this whole moment that people try to prove this theorem and they fail, and there's a famous false proof by LeMay from the 19th century, where Kummer, in understanding what mistake LeMay had made in this incorrect proof, basically

primes."}, {"time": 6169, "text": "Sure, you can look at your computer and see a lot of them, but the fact that there's a lot, why is that evidence that there's infinitely many, right?"}, {"time":

evidence?"}, {"time": 6182, "text": "There's like a lot more than 10 million atoms."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "That doesn't mean there's infinitely many atoms in the universe, right?"}, {"time": 6186,

that it turns out to be like incredibly productive and enlightening to think about primes as if they were random numbers, as if they were randomly distributed according to a certain law."}, {"time":

predict that other behaviors of the system are like that of the random process."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "And so that's kind of like, it's funny because I think when you talk to people at the twin

the opposite of deep structure."}, {"time": 6258, "text": "What we say when we say we believe the twin prime conjecture is that we believe the primes are like sort of strewn around pretty randomly."},

about drive your learning."}, {"time": 9086, "text": "I mean, one thing I've learned from advising students, math is really hard."}, {"time": 9092, "text": "In fact, anything that you do right is

the basic."}, {"time": 9229, "text": "That's not sort of research thinking, because with research, you probably also have to enjoy the dead ends with learning math from a textbook or from video."},
