that competes with others while the individual ants are like cells in the animal's body."}, {"time": 239, "text": "We are more like a colony in that regard."}, {"time": 241, "text": "But the humans are weird because we kind of, I think of it, if emergence happens in an emergence tower, where you've got kind of, as I said, cells and then humans and communities and societies."}, {"time": 253, "text": "Ants are very specific."}, {"time": 255, "text": "The individual ants are always cooperating with each other for the sake of the colony."}, {"time": 259, "text": "So the colony is this unit that is the competitive unit."}, {"time": 262, "text": "Humans can kind of go, we take the elevator up and down emergence tower psychologically."}, {"time": 267, "text": "Sometimes we are individuals that are competing with other individuals and that's where our mindset is."}, {"time": 273, "text": "And then other times we get in this crazy zone, you know, a protest or a sporting event and you're just chanting and screaming and doing the same hand motions with all these other people and you feel like one."}, {"time": 283, "text": "You feel like one, you know, and you'd sacrifice yourself."}, {"time": 285, "text": "And now that's what, you know, soldiers."}, {"time": 286, "text": "And so our brains can kind of psychologically go up and down this elevator in an interesting way."}, {"time": 293, "text": "Yeah, I wonder how much of that is just the narrative we tell ourselves."}, {"time": 297, "text": "Maybe we are just like an ant colony."}, {"time": 299, "text": "We're just collaborating always, even in our stories of individualism, of like the freedom of the individual, like this kind of isolation, lone man on an island kind of thing."}, {"time": 311, "text": "We're actually all part of this giant network of maybe one of the things that makes humans who we are is probably deeply social, the ability to maintain not just the single human intelligence, but like a collective intelligence."}, {"time": 326, "text": "And so this feeling like individual is just because we woke up at this level of the hierarchy."}, {"time": 333, "text": "So we make it special, but we very well could be just part of the ant colony."}, {"time": 339, "text": "This whole conversation, I'm either going to be doing a Shakespearean analysis of your Twitter, your writing, or very specific statements that you've made."}, {"time": 349, "text": "So you've written answers to a mailbag of questions."}, {"time": 354, "text": "The questions were amazing, the ones you've chosen, and your answers were amazing."}, {"time": 358, "text": "So on this topic of the big and the small, somebody asked, are we bigger than we are small?"}, {"time": 363, "text": "Or smaller than we are big?"}, {"time": 365, "text": "Who's asking these questions?"}, {"time": 366, "text": "This is really good."}, {"time": 368, "text": "You have amazing fans."}, {"time": 369, "text": "Okay, so where do we sit at this level of the very small to the very big?"}, {"time": 378, "text": "So are we bigger or are we small?"}, {"time": 380, "text": "Are we bigger than we are small?"}, {"time": 381, "text": "I think it depends on what we're asking here."}, {"time": 383, "text": "So if we're talking about the biggest thing that we kind of can talk about without just imagining is the observable universe, the Hubble sphere."}, {"time": 394, "text": "And that's about 10 to the 26th meters in diameter."}, {"time": 401, "text": "The smallest thing we talk about is a plank length, but you could argue that that's kind of an imaginary thing."}, {"time": 407, "text": "But that's 10 to the negative 35."}, {"time": 409, "text": "Now we're about, conveniently, about 10 to the one."}, {"time": 412, "text": "Not quite, 10 to the zero."}, {"time": 413, "text": "We're about 10 to the zero meters long."}, {"time": 416, "text": "So it's easy because you can just look and say, okay, well, for example, atoms are like 10 to the negative 15th or 10 to the negative 16th meters across, right?"}, {"time": 428, "text": "If you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 16th, which is right, that's now."}, {"time": 432, "text": "So an atom to us is us to this."}, {"time": 433, "text": "You get to like nebulas, smaller than a galaxy and bigger than the biggest star."}, {"time": 438, "text": "So we're right in between nebula and an atom."}, {"time": 442, "text": "Now, if you wanna go down to quark level, you might be able to get up to galaxy level."}, {"time": 447, "text": "When you go up to the observable universe, you're getting down on the small side to things that we, I think, are mostly theoretically imagining are there and hypothesizing are there."}, {"time": 459, "text": "So I think as far as real world objects that we really know a lot about, I would say we are smaller than we are big."}, {"time": 468, "text": "But if you wanna go down to the Planck length, we're very quickly, we're bigger than we are small."}, {"time": 472, "text": "If you think about strings."}, {"time": 474, "text": "Yeah, strings, exactly, string theory and so on."}, {"time": 478, "text": "But I think like you answered, no matter what, we're kind of middleish."}, {"time": 482, "text": "Yeah, I mean, here's something cool."}, {"time": 484, "text": "If a human is a neutrino, and again, neutrino, the size doesn't really make sense."}, {"time": 488, "text": "It's not really a size."}, {"time": 489, "text": "But when we talk about some of these neutrinos, I mean, if a neutrino is a human, a proton is the sun."}, {"time": 495, "text": "So that's like, I mean, a proton is real small, like really small."}, {"time": 500, "text": "And so, yeah, the small gets like crazy small very quickly."}, {"time": 505, "text": "Let's talk about aliens."}, {"time": 510, "text": "We already mentioned it."}, {"time": 512, "text": "Let's start just by with the basic, what's your intuition as of today?"}, {"time": 516, "text": "This is a thing that could change day by day."}, {"time": 518, "text": "But how many alien civilizations out there?"}, {"time": 520, "text": "Is it zero?"}, {"time": 522, "text": "Is it a handful?"}, {"time": 525, "text": "Is it almost endless, like the observable universe or the universe is teeming with life?"}, {"time": 532, "text": "If I had gun to my head, I have to take a guess."}, {"time": 534, "text": "I would say it's teeming with life."}, {"time": 536, "text": "I would say there is."}, {"time": 537, "text": "I think running a Monte Carlo simulation, this paper by Andrew Sandberg and Drexler and a few others a couple of years ago, I think you probably know about it."}, {"time": 547, "text": "I think the mean, using different, running through randomized rake equation multiplication, you're ended up with 27 million as the mean of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy, in the Milky Way alone."}, {"time": 569, "text": "And so then if you go outside the Milky Way, that would turn into trillions."}, {"time": 572, "text": "That's the mean."}, {"time": 574, "text": "Now, what's interesting is that there's a long tail because they believe some of these multipliers in the Drake equation."}, {"time": 580, "text": "So for example, the probability that life starts in the first place, they think that the kind of range that we use is for that variable or is way too small."}, {"time": 594, "text": "And that's constraining our possibilities."}, {"time": 597, "text": "And if you actually extend it to some crazy number of orders of magnitude, like 200, they think that that variable should be, you get this long tail where, I forget the exact number, but it's like a third or a quarter of the total outcomes have us alone."}, {"time": 614, "text": "I think it's a sizable percentage has us as the only intelligent life in the galaxy, but you can keep going."}, {"time": 623, "text": "And I think there's like a non zero, like legitimate amount of outcomes there that have us as the only life in the observable universe at all is on earth."}, {"time": 632, "text": "I mean, it seems incredibly counterintuitive."}, {"time": 635, "text": "It seems like, you mentioned that people think you must be an idiot because if you picked up one grain of sand on a beach and examined it and you found all these little things on it, it's like saying, well, maybe this is the only one that has that."}, {"time": 647, "text": "And it's like, probably not."}, {"time": 648, "text": "They're probably most of the sand probably or a lot of the sand, right?"}, {"time": 652, "text": "So, and then the other hand, we don't see anything."}, {"time": 654, "text": "We don't see any evidence, which of course, people would say that the people who stuff scoff at the concept that we're potentially alone, they say, well, of course, there's lots of reasons we wouldn't have seen anything."}, {"time": 666, "text": "And they can go list them and they're very compelling, but we don't know."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And the truth is if there were, if this were a freak thing, I mean, we don't, if this were a completely freak thing that happened here, whether it's life at all or just getting to this level of intelligence, that species, whoever it was, would think there must be lots of us out there and they'd be wrong."}, {"time": 688, "text": "So just being, again, using the same intuition that most people would use, I'd say there's probably lots of other things out there."}, {"time": 694, "text": "Yeah, and you wrote a great blog post about it."}, {"time": 696, "text": "But to me, the two interesting reasons that we haven't been in contact, I too have an intuition that the universe is teeming with life."}, {"time": 707, "text": "So one interesting is around the great filter."}, {"time": 710, "text": "So we either, the great filter's either behind us or in front of us."}, {"time": 715, "text": "So the reason that's interesting is you get to think about what kind of things ensure or ensure the survival of an intelligent civilization or lead to the destruction of intelligent civilization."}, {"time": 728, "text": "That's a very pragmatic, very important question to always be asking."}, {"time": 731, "text": "And we'll talk about some of those."}, {"time": 733, "text": "And then the other one is I'm saddened by the possibility that there could be aliens communicating with us all the time."}, {"time": 741, "text": "In fact, they may have visited."}, {"time": 745, "text": "And we're just too dumb to hear it, to see it."}, {"time": 749, "text": "Like the idea that the kind of life that can evolve is just the range of life that can evolve is so large that our narrow view of what is life and what is intelligent life is preventing us from having communication with them."}, {"time": 765, "text": "But then they don't seem very smart because if they were trying to communicate with us, they would surely, if they were super intelligent, they would be very, I'm sure if there's lots of life, we're not that rare, we're not some crazy weird species that hears and has different kinds of ways of perceiving signals."}, {"time": 784, "text": "So they would probably be able to, if you really wanted to communicate with an earth like species, with a human like species, you would send out all kinds of things."}, {"time": 794, "text": "You'd send out radio waves and you send out gravity waves and lots of things."}, {"time": 800, "text": "So if they're communicating in a way, they're trying to communicate with us and it's just we're too dumb to perceive the signals, it's like, well, they're not doing a great job of considering the primitive species we might be."}, {"time": 812, "text": "So I don't know, I think if a super intelligent species wanted to get in touch with us and had the capability of, I think probably they would."}, {"time": 823, "text": "Well, they may be getting in touch with us, they're just getting in touch with the thing that we humans are not understanding that they're getting in touch with us with."}, {"time": 833, "text": "I guess that's what I was trying to say is there could be something about earth that's much more special than us humans."}, {"time": 840, "text": "Like the nature of the intelligence that's on earth or the thing that's of value and that's curious and that's complicated and fascinating and beautiful might be something that's not just like tweets, okay?"}, {"time": 855, "text": "Like English language that's interpretable or any kind of language or any kind of signal, whether it's gravity or radio signal that humans seem to appreciate."}, {"time": 864, "text": "Why not the actual, it could be the process of evolution itself."}, {"time": 869, "text": "There could be something about the way that earth is breathing essentially through the creation of life and this complex growth of life."}, {"time": 877, "text": "There's like, it's a whole different way to view organisms and view life that could be getting communicated with."}, {"time": 884, "text": "And we humans are just a tiny fingertip on top of that intelligence."}, {"time": 889, "text": "And the communication is happening with the main mothership of earth versus us humans that seem to treat ourselves as super important and we're missing the big picture."}, {"time": 900, "text": "I mean, it sounds crazy, but our understanding of what is intelligent, of what is life, what is consciousness is very limited."}, {"time": 908, "text": "And it seems to be, and just being very suspicious, it seems to be awfully human centric."}, {"time": 914, "text": "Like this story, it seems like the progress of science is constantly putting humans down on the importance, humans down on the cosmic importance, the ranking of how big we are, how important we are."}, {"time": 932, "text": "That seems to be the more we discover that's what's happening."}, {"time": 934, "text": "And I think science is very young."}, {"time": 937, "text": "And so I think eventually we might figure out that there's something much, much bigger going on, that humans are just a curious little side effect of the much bigger thing."}, {"time": 946, "text": "That's what, I mean, that, as I'm saying, it just sounds insane, but."}, {"time": 950, "text": "Well, it just, it sounds a little like religious."}, {"time": 954, "text": "It sounds like a spiritual, it gets to that realm where there's something that more than meets the eye."}, {"time": 962, "text": "Well, yeah, but not, so religious and spiritual, often have this kind of whoo whoo characteristic, like when people write books about them, then go to wars over whatever the heck is written in those books."}, {"time": 976, "text": "I mean, more like it's possible that collective intelligence is more important than individual intelligence, right?"}, {"time": 982, "text": "It's the ant colony."}, {"time": 983, "text": "What's the primal organism?"}, {"time": 984, "text": "Is it the ant colony or is it the ant?"}, {"time": 986, "text": "Yeah, I mean, humans, just like any individual ant can't do shit, but the colony can do, make this incredible structures and has this intelligence."}, {"time": 995, "text": "And we're exactly the same."}, {"time": 996, "text": "I mean, you know the famous thing that no one, no human knows how to make a pencil."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "Have you heard this?"}, {"time": 1004, "text": "Basically, I mean."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "There's not, a single human out there has absolutely no idea how to make a pencil."}, {"time": 1011, "text": "So you have to think about, you have to get the wood, the paint, the different chemicals that make up the yellow paint."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "The eraser is a whole other thing."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "The metal has to be mined from somewhere and then the graphite, whatever that is."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "And there's not one person on earth who knows how to kind of collect all those materials and create a pencil, but together, that's one of the, that's child's play."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "It's just one of the easiest things."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "So, you know, the other thing I like to think about, I actually put this as a question on the blog once."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "There's a thought experiment and I actually wanna hear what you think."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "So if a witch, kind of a dickish witch comes around and she says, I'm gonna cast a spell on all of humanity and all material things that you've invented are gonna disappear all at once."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "So suddenly we're all standing there naked."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "There's no buildings."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "There's no cars and boats and ships and no mines, nothing, right?"}, {"time": 1069, "text": "It's just the stone age earth and a bunch of naked humans, but we're all the same, we have the same brain."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "So we're all know what's going on."}, {"time": 1075, "text": "And we all got a note from her, so we understand the deal."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "And she says, she communicated to every human, here's the deal, you lost all your stuff."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "You guys need to make one working iPhone 13 and you make one working iPhone 13 that could pass in the Apple store today, you know, in your previous world for an iPhone 13, then I will restore everything."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "How long do you think?"}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And so everyone knows this is the mission."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "We're all aware of the mission, everyone, all humans."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "How long would it take us?"}, {"time": 1105, "text": "So obviously if you do a random selection of 100 or a thousand humans within the population, I think you're screwed to make that iPhone."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "I tend to believe that there's fascinating specialization among the human civilization."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "Like there's a few hackers out there that can like solo build an iPhone."}, {"time": 1126, "text": "But with what materials?"}, {"time": 1128, "text": "So no materials whatsoever."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "It has to, I mean, it's virtually, I mean, okay."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "You have to build factories."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "I mean, to fabricate."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And how are you gonna mine them?"}, {"time": 1143, "text": "You know, you gotta mine the materials where you don't have any cranes."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "You don't have any, you know."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "Okay, you 100% have to have the, everybody's naked."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Everyone's naked and everyone's where they are."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "So you and I would currently be naked."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "It's on the ground in what used to be Manhattan."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "So no building."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "No, grassy island."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "So you need a naked Elon Musk type character to then start building a company."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "You have to have a large company then."}, {"time": 1166, "text": "He doesn't even know where he, you know, where is everyone?"}, {"time": 1168, "text": "You know, oh shit, how am I gonna find other people I need to talk to?"}, {"time": 1170, "text": "But we have all the knowledge of."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "Yeah, everyone has the knowledge that's in their current brains."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "I've met some legit engineers."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "Crazy polymath people."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "Yeah, but the actual labor of, cause you said, cause like the original Mac, like the Apple II, that can be built."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Even that, you know."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "Even that's gonna be tough."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Well, I think part of it is a communication problem."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "If you could suddenly have, you know, someone, if everyone had a walkie talkie and there was, you know, a couple, you know, 10 really smart people were designated the leaders, they could say, okay, I want, you know, everyone who can do this to walk west, you know, until you get to this little hub and everyone else, you know, and they could actually coordinate, but we don't have that."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "So it's like people just, you know, and then what I think about is, so you've got some people that are like trying to organize and you'll have a little community where a couple hundred people have come together and maybe a couple thousand have organized and they designated one person, you know, as the leader and then they have sub leaders and okay, we have a start here."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "We have some organization."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "You're also gonna have some people that say, good, humans were scourged upon the earth and this is good."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "And they're gonna try to sabotage."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "They're gonna try to murder the people with the, and who know what they're talking about."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "The elite that possessed the knowledge."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "Well, and so everyone, maybe everyone's hopeful for the, you know, we're all civilized and hopeful for the first 30 days or something."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And then things start to fall off."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "They, you know, people get, start to lose hope and there's new kinds of, you know, new kinds of governments popping up, you know, new kinds of societies and they're, you know, and they don't play nicely with the other ones."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "And I think very quickly, I think a lot of people would just give up and say, you know what, this is it."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "We're back in the stone age."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Let's just create, you know, agrarian."}, {"time": 1263, "text": "We don't also don't know how to farm."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "No one knows how to farm."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "There's like, even the farmers, you know, a lot of them are relying on their machines."}, {"time": 1271, "text": "And so we also, you know, mass starvation."}, {"time": 1274, "text": "And that, you know, when you're trying to organize, a lot of people are, you know, coming in with, you know, spears they've fashioned and trying to murder everyone who has food."}, {"time": 1283, "text": "Given today's society, how much violence would that be?"}, {"time": 1285, "text": "We've gotten softer, less violent."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "And we don't have weapons."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "We don't have weapons."}, {"time": 1289, "text": "We have really primitive weapons now."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "But we have, and also we have a kind of ethics where murder is bad."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "We used to be less, like human life was less valued in the past."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "So murder was more okay, like ethically."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "But in the past, they also were really good at figuring out how to have sustenance."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "They knew how to get food and water because they, so we have no idea."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "Like the ancient hunter gatherer societies would laugh at what's going on here."}, {"time": 1312, "text": "They'd say, you guys, you don't know what you're, none of you know what you're doing."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And also the amount of people feeding this amount of people in a very, in a stone age, you know, civilization, that's not gonna happen."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "So New York and San Francisco are screwed."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "Well, whoever's not near water is really screwed."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "So that's, you're near a river or freshwater river."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "And you know, anyway, it's a very interesting question."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "And what it does, this and the pencil, it makes me feel so grateful and like excited about like, man, our civilization is so cool."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And this is, talk about collective intelligence."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "Humans did not build any of this."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "It's collective human super, collective humans is a super intelligent, you know, being that is, that can do absolutely, especially over a long period of time, can do such magical things."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "And we just get to be born, when I go out, when I'm working and I'm hungry, I just go click, click, click, and like a salad's coming."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "The salad arrives."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "If you think about the incredible infrastructure that's in place for that, for that quickly, or just the internet to, you know, the electricity, first of all, that's just powering the things, you know, how the, where the, the amount of structures that have to be created and for that electricity to be there."}, {"time": 1380, "text": "And then you've got the, you've of course the internet, and then you have this system where delivery drivers and they have, they're riding bikes that were made by someone else."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "And they're going to get the salad and all those ingredients came from all over the place."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "I mean, it's just, so I think it's like, I like thinking about these things because it makes me feel like just so grateful."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "I'm like, man, it would be so awful if we didn't have this."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "And people who didn't have it would think this was such magic we live in and we do."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "And like, cool, that's fun."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "Yeah, one of the most amazing things when I showed up, I came here at 13 from the Soviet Union and the supermarket was, people don't really realize that, but the

off one thing, which is Elon Musk says that he has this number, a million in mind as the order of magnitude of people you need to be on Mars to truly be multi planetary."}, {"time": 1571, "text":

on one hand, like the number of great leaps that we've had, you know, like no life to life and single cell or simple cell to complex cell and single cell organisms to animals to come, you know, multi cell animals and then ocean to land and then one planet to two planets, anyway, diversion."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "But the point is that we are officially that leap for all of life, you know, has

got, no one built the first, the mine that we're getting stuff for the iPhone for probably wasn't built for the iPhone."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "Or in general, early mining was for, I think

a civilization like ours, and of course you could have oil and lanterns, we could go way back, but if you're trying to build our today thing, you're gonna need energy and electricity and then mines

think if people are going back and forth enough, then it becomes fuzzy."}, {"time": 1876, "text": "It becomes like, oh, our friends on Mars."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "And there's like this Mars versus Earth, and it become like fun tribalism."}, {"time": 1882, "text": "I think if people don't rarely go back and forth and it really, they're there for, I think if you get kind of like, oh, we

kinds of crazy geopolitical things that like we have not even, no one's really even thought about too much yet that like, it could get weird."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "Think about the 1500s when it

just like really stuck."}, {"time": 1936, "text": "Mars is a whole new world of like, territory, naming things and you know, and it's a chance for new kind of governments maybe, or maybe it's just the

start, I mean, it's not that people didn't have the idea, people had the idea, it was that they had a clean slate, new place, and they suddenly were, so I think it would be a great opportunity to have, there's a lot of people who have done that, oh, if I had my own government on an island, my own country, what would I do?"}, {"time": 1995, "text": "And the US founders actually had the

there's some scary external pressure, not just from yourself."}, {"time": 7495, "text": "And that's a huge aid to a lot of procrastinators."}, {"time": 7499, "text": "Again, there's a lot of people

panic monster."}, {"time": 7516, "text": "If you wanna, you know, you really wanna write music, you really wanna become a singer, songwriter, well, book a venue, tell 40 people about it and say, hey,

weird is going on, there's some resistance, there's some force that is prevent, that is in my own way, right?"}, {"time": 7577, "text": "And so doing something where I have to pay all this money,
