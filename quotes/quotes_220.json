in political theory is what's called rationalism."}, {"time": 445, "text": "I guess we'll probably talk about that some."}, {"time": 448, "text": "Rationalism is kind of an instantaneous, timeless thing."}, {"time": 451, "text": "Before I mentioned that liberalism and various enlightenment theories, they don't include time at all."}, {"time": 457, "text": "Their goal is to say, look, there's such a thing as universal human reason."}, {"time": 462, "text": "All human beings, if they reason properly, will come to the same conclusions."}, {"time": 467, "text": "If that's true, then it removes the time consideration."}, {"time": 471, "text": "It removes tradition and context because everywhere where you are at any time, you ought to be able to use reason and come to the same conclusions about politics or morals."}, {"time": 483, "text": "So that's a theory like Immanuel Kant or John Locke is an example, Hobbes is an example."}, {"time": 492, "text": "That kind of political theorizing really does say at a given instant, we can know pretty much everything that we need to know, at least the big things."}, {"time": 503, "text": "And conservatism is the opposite."}, {"time": 506, "text": "It's a traditionalist view, exactly as you say, that says that history is crucial."}, {"time": 513, "text": "So you're on, you say that history is interesting, but perhaps not crucial if in the context of individualism."}, {"time": 522, "text": "No, I mean, I think there's a false dichotomy he presented here, and that is that one view holds that you can derive anything from a particular historical path and kind of an empirical view."}, {"time": 534, "text": "And if we know the history, we know where we should be tomorrow."}, {"time": 537, "text": "We know where we should stand today."}, {"time": 540, "text": "And the other path is we ignore history, we ignore facts, we ignore what's going on."}, {"time": 544, "text": "We can derive from some a priori axioms, we can derive a truth right now."}, {"time": 550, "text": "And both are false."}, {"time": 551, "text": "Both of those views, in my view, are false."}, {"time": 554, "text": "And you know, Ayn Rand and I reject both of those views."}, {"time": 559, "text": "And I think the better thinkers of the Enlightenment did as well, although they sometimes fall into the trap of appearing like rationalists."}, {"time": 565, "text": "And Jorm and I agree on one thing, and that is that Kant is one of, you know, we've talked about this in the past, Alex, but we both hate Kant."}, {"time": 576, "text": "We both think Kant is, I at least think Kant is probably the most destructive philosopher since Plato, who was pretty destructive himself."}, {"time": 589, "text": "And part of the problem is that Kant divorces reason from reality."}, {"time": 592, "text": "That is, he divorces reason from history."}, {"time": 595, "text": "He divorces reason from experience, because we don't have direct experience of reality according to Kant, right?"}, {"time": 601, "text": "We're removed from that direct experience."}, {"time": 603, "text": "But I view Kant as the anti Enlightenment, that is, I view Kant as the destroyer of good Enlightenment thinking."}, {"time": 611, "text": "And I acknowledge a lot of history of philosophy, people who do history of philosophy view Kant as the embodiment of the Enlightenment, that is the ultimate."}, {"time": 621, "text": "But I think that's a mistake."}, {"time": 622, "text": "I think both Rousseau and Kant are fundamentally the goal, the mission in life is to destroy the Enlightenment."}, {"time": 630, "text": "So my view is neither of those options are the right option."}, {"time": 633, "text": "That is, the true reason based, reason is not divorced from reality."}, {"time": 639, "text": "It's quite the opposite."}, {"time": 640, "text": "Reason is a tool."}, {"time": 641, "text": "It's a faculty of identifying and integrating what?"}, {"time": 645, "text": "It's identifying and integrating the facts of reality as we know them through sense perception or through the study of history, through what actually happened."}, {"time": 655, "text": "So it's the integration of those facts."}, {"time": 658, "text": "It's the knowledge of that history."}, {"time": 660, "text": "And then what we do is we abstract away principles based on what's worked in the past, what hasn't worked in the past, the consequences of different ideas, different past, different actions."}, {"time": 670, "text": "We abstract away principles that then can be universal."}, {"time": 675, "text": "We make mistakes, right?"}, {"time": 676, "text": "We can come up with a universal principle, it turns out it's not."}, {"time": 679, "text": "But if we have the whole scope of human history, we can derive principles as we do in life, as individuals, we derive principles that are then truths that we can live by, but you don't do that by ignoring history."}, {"time": 692, "text": "You do that by learning history, by understanding history, by understanding in a sense tradition and where it leads to, and then trying to do better."}, {"time": 700, "text": "And I think good thinkers are constantly trying to do better based on what they know about the past and what they know about the present."}, {"time": 706, "text": "What's the difference between studying history on a journey of reason and tradition?"}, {"time": 713, "text": "So you mentioned that Burke understood that reason begins with an inherited tradition yesterday."}, {"time": 718, "text": "So what's the difference between studying history, but then being free to go any way you want and tradition where it feels more, I don't want to say a negative term like burden, but there's more of a momentum that forces you to go the same way as your ancestors."}, {"time": 738, "text": "It's the recognition that people are wrong, often are wrong."}, {"time": 743, "text": "Including parents?"}, {"time": 745, "text": "Including your parents, including your teachers, including everybody."}, {"time": 748, "text": "Everybody is potentially wrong, and that you can't accept anybody just because they happen to come before you."}, {"time": 755, "text": "That is, you have to evaluate and judge, and you have to have a standard by which to evaluate and judge the actions of those who came before you, whether they are your parents, whether they are the state in which you happen to be born, whether they are somebody on the other side of planet Earth."}, {"time": 771, "text": "You can judge them if you have a standard."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And my standard, and I think the right standard, is human well being."}, {"time": 777, "text": "That which is good for human beings, qua human beings, is the standard by which we judge."}, {"time": 783, "text": "I can say that certain periods of history were bad."}, {"time": 787, "text": "They happened."}, {"time": 788, "text": "It's important to study them."}, {"time": 789, "text": "It's important to understand what they did that made them bad so we cannot do that again."}, {"time": 794, "text": "And I can say certain cultures, certain periods in time were good."}, {"time": 798, "text": "Because they promoted human well being and human flourishing."}, {"time": 801, "text": "That's the standard."}, {"time": 802, "text": "To derive from that, okay, what is it that made a particular culture good?"}, {"time": 806, "text": "What is it that made that particular culture positive in terms of human well being and human flourishing?"}, {"time": 811, "text": "What made this bad?"}, {"time": 812, "text": "And hopefully from that, I can derive a principle."}, {"time": 815, "text": "Okay, if I want human flourishing and human well being in the future, I want to be more like these guys and less like those guys."}, {"time": 821, "text": "I want to derive what is the principle that will guide me in the future."}, {"time": 825, "text": "That's I think how human knowledge ultimately develops."}, {"time": 827, "text": "I think people often make a mistake, I'm not saying your own, but lots of people don't actually read the original sources and so what happens is people will attack conservatives assuming that conservatives think that whatever comes from the past is right."}, {"time": 842, "text": "And actually, it's very difficult to find a thinker who actually says something like that."}, {"time": 848, "text": "Seldon or Burke, the big conservative theorists hooker, they're all people who understand that the tradition carries with it mistakes that were made in the past."}, {"time": 861, "text": "And this is actually I think an important part of their empiricism is that they see the search for truth as something a society does by trial and error."}, {"time": 871, "text": "And what that means is that in any given moment, you have to be aware of the possibility that things that you've inherited are actually false."}, {"time": 879, "text": "And the job of the political thinker or the jurist or the philosopher is not to dig in and say whatever it is that we've inherited is right."}, {"time": 890, "text": "The job is to look at the society as a whole and say, look, we have this job of first of all conservation, just making sure that we don't lose good things that we've had."}, {"time": 901, "text": "And second, seeing if we can repair things in order to improve them where it's necessary or where it's possible."}, {"time": 907, "text": "And that process is actually a creative process."}, {"time": 911, "text": "This is a way in which I think it is similar to Jeroen's philosophy that you take the inherited tradition and you look for a way that you can shape it in order to make it something better than it was."}, {"time": 925, "text": "That's a baseline for what we call conservatism."}, {"time": 928, "text": "It's not, yeah."}, {"time": 929, "text": "Just a comment."}, {"time": 930, "text": "So the trial and error, the errors is, you're proud of the errors."}, {"time": 935, "text": "It's a feature, not a bug."}, {"time": 937, "text": "So you mentioned trial and error a few times yesterday, it's a really interesting kind of idea."}, {"time": 941, "text": "It's basically accepting that the journey is going to have flaws as opposed to saying, I mean, the conclusion there is the current system is flawed and it will always be flawed and you try to improve it."}, {"time": 957, "text": "When you listen to your on talk, there's much more of an optimism for the system being perfect now or potentially soon, or it could be perfect."}, {"time": 969, "text": "And to me, the way I heard it is almost like accepting that the system is flawed and through trial and error will improve and Jeroen says, no, we can have a perfection now."}, {"time": 985, "text": "That's the way it sounds to me."}, {"time": 989, "text": "I think the difference is that at some point, just like in science, I think one can stop the trial and error and say, I can now see a pattern here."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "I can see that certain actions lead to bad consequences, certain actions lead to good consequences."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "Let me try to abstract away what is it that is good and what is it that is bad and build a system around what is good and reject what is bad."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "I think ultimately, if you read the founding fathers and whether we call them conservatives or individuals, what the founding fathers actually did, all of them, I think, is study history."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "They all talk about history."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "They all talk about examples of other cultures, whether they go back to the Republic in Venice or back to the ancient Greeks."}, {"time": 1037, "text": "They studied these."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "They learned lessons from them."}, {"time": 1040, "text": "They try to figure out what has worked in the past and what hasn't and try to derive principles."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "They got pretty close to what I would consider kind of an ideal, but they didn't get it completely right."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "Here we sit 200 and something years after the Declaration and after the Constitution."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "I think we can look back and say, okay, well, what did they get right?"}, {"time": 1061, "text": "What did they get wrong based on how is it done and where are the flaws and we can improve on it."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "I think we can get closer to perfection based on those kind of observations, based on that kind of abstraction, that kind of discovery of what is true."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "Just like at some point, you do the experiments, you do the trial and error, and now you come up with a scientific principle."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "The problem with trial and error in politics is that we're talking about human life, right?"}, {"time": 1125, "text": "So there was a big trial around communism, and 100 million people paid the price for the trial."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "I could have told them in advance, as did many people, that it would not work."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "There are principles of human nature, principles that we can study from history, principles about economics and other aspects."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "Well, we know it's not going to work."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "You don't need to try it again."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "We've had communal arrangements throughout history."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "There was an experiment with fascism, and there have been experiments with all kinds of political systems."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "Okay, we've done them."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "Sad that we did them, because many of us knew they wouldn't work."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "We should learn the lesson, and I think that all of history now converges on one lesson, and that is what we need to do is build systems that protect individual freedom."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "That is the core."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "That's what ultimately leads to human flourishing and human success and human achievement, and to the extent that we place anything above that individual, whether it's the state, whether it's the ethnicity, whether it's the race, whether it's the bourgeois, whatever it happens to be, class or whatever, whenever we place something above the individual, the consequence is negative."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "That's one of these principles that I think we can derive from studying 3,000 years of civilization."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "It's tragic, I think, because we're going to keep experimenting, sadly."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "I see it, right?"}, {"time": 1204, "text": "I'm not winning this battle."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "I'm losing the battle."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "We're going to keep experimenting with different forms of collectivism, and we're going to keep paying the price in human life and in missed opportunities for human flourishing and human success and human wealth and prosperity."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "Let's take communism as a good example."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "None of the major conservative thinkers would say, you know what's a good idea?"}, {"time": 1227, "text": "A good idea would be to experiment by raising everything that we've inherited and starting from scratch."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "I mean, that's the conservative complaint or accusation against rationalists as opposed to empiricists."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "I mean, using rationalism, let's take Descartes kind of as a benchmark."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "Can you also maybe define rationalism?"}, {"time": 1250, "text": "These are two terms that are in philosophy, especially in epistemology."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "They're often compared to one another."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "Jeroen said that it's a false dichotomy, and maybe it is a bit exaggerated, but that doesn't mean it's not useful for conceptualizing the domain."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "So a rationalist is somebody like Descartes who says, I'm going to set aside, I'm going to try to set aside everything I know, everything I've inherited, I'm going to start from scratch."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "And he explicitly says, in evaluating the inheritance of the past, he explicitly says, you take a look at the histories that we have, they're not reliable."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "You take a look at the moral and the scientific writings that we receive, they're not very good."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "His baseline is to look very critically at the past and say, look, I'm evaluating it."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "I think all in all, it's just not worth very much."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "And so whatever I do, beginning from scratch, is going to be better as long as, and here's his caveat, as long as I'm proceeding from self evident assumptions, from self evident premises, things that you can't argue against."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "I think, therefore, I am."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And then from there, deducing what he calls infallible conclusions."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "So that model of self evident premises to infallible conclusions, I'm calling that rationalism, I think that's kind of a standard academic jargon term."}, {"time": 1339, "text": "And it's opposed to empiricism, which is a thinker, I think in universities, usually the empiricist is David Hume."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "And David Hume will say, we can't learn anything the way that Descartes said."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "There is nothing that's that self evident and that infallible."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "So Hume proposes, based on Newton and Boyle and the new physical sciences."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "So Hume proposes a science of man."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "And the science of man sounds an awful lot like what Yaron just said, which is we're going to take a look at human nature, at the nature of societies."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "Human nature, we're going to try to abstract towards fixed principles for describing it."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "Human societies, we're going to try to do the same thing."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And from there, we get, for example, contemporary economics."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "But we also get sociology and anthropology, which cut in a different direction."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "So that's rationalism versus empiricism."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "Yeah, go ahead, please."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "I think empiricism, the one thing I disagree is I think empiricism rarely comes to these abstractions."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "I mean, they want more facts."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "It's always about collecting more evidence."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "But this is where I think Ayn Rand is so unusual and where I think there's something new here."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "And that's a bold statement given the history of philosophy."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "But I think Ayn Rand is something new."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "And so she says, yes, we agree about rationalism and that it's inherently wrong."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "Empiricism has the problem of, OK, where does it lead?"}, {"time": 1443, "text": "You never come to a conclusion."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "You're just accumulating evidence."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "There's something in addition."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "There's a third alternative, which she is positing, which is using empirical evidence, not denying empirical evidence, recognizing that there are some axioms, there are some axioms that we all, at the base of all of our knowledge, that are starting points."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "We're not rejecting axiomatic knowledge."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "And integrating those two and identifying the fact that based on these axioms and based on these empirical evidence, we can come to truths."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "Just again, like we do in science, we have certain axioms, scientific axioms, we have certain experiments that we run, and then we can come to some identification of a truth."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And that truth is always going to be challenged by new information, by new knowledge."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "But as long as that's what we know, that is what truth is."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "So truth is contextual in the sense that it's contextual, it's based on that knowledge that surrounds it."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "It's always available to change if you get new facts."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "It's always available to change if the facts that you get, and they really are, I mean, the burden of changing what you've come to a conclusion of truth is high, so you'd have to have real evidence that it's not true, but that happens all the time."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "So it happens in science, right?"}, {"time": 1517, "text": "We discovered that what we thought was true is not true, and it can happen in politics and ethics even more so than in science because they're much messier fields."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "But the idea is that you can come to a truth, but it's not just deductive."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "Most truths are inductive."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "We learn from observing reality and, again, coming to principles about what works and what's not."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "She doesn't fall into the conventional view."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "She's an opponent of Hume, and she's an opponent of Descartes, and she's certainly an opponent of Kant."}, {"time": 1561, "text": "And I think she's right, right?"}, {"time": 1569, "text": "You're both critics of communism and socialism."}, {"time": 1572, "text": "Why did communism fail?"}, {"time": 1574, "text": "You started to say that conservatives criticize it on the basis of rationalism, that you're throwing away the past."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "You're starting from scratch."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "Is that the fundamental description of why communism failed?"}, {"time": 1587, "text": "I think the fundamental difference between rationalists and empiricists is the question of whether you're throwing away the past."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "That's the argument."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "And it cashes out as a distinction between abstract, universal, rationalist political theories and empirical political theories."}, {"time": 1608, "text": "Artificial political theories, they're always going to say something like, look, there are many different societies."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "We can say that some are better and some are worse, but the problem is that there are many different ways in which a society can be better or worse."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "There's an ongoing competition, and we're learning on an ongoing basis what are the ways in which societies can be better and worse."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "That creates a kind of, I'd say, a mild skepticism, a moderate skepticism among conservatives."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "I don't think too many conservatives have a problem looking at the Soviet Union, which is brutal and murderous, ineffective in its economics, totally ineffective spiritually, and then collapsed."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "So I think it's easier for us to look at a system like that and say, what on earth?"}, {"time": 1665, "text": "What should we learn from that?"}, {"time": 1667, "text": "But the main conservative tradition is pretty tolerant of a diversity of different kinds of society and is slow to insist that France is so tyrannical, it just needs a revolution because what's going to come after the revolution is going to be much better."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "The assumption is that there's lots of things that are good about most societies and that a clean slate leads you to throw out all of the inherited things that you don't even know how to notice until they're gone."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Could I actually play devil's advocate here and address something you also said?"}, {"time": 1703, "text": "Can we, as opposed to knowing the empirical data of the 20th century that communism presented, can we go back to the beginning of the 20th century?"}, {"time": 1712, "text": "Can you empathize or steel man or put yourself in a place of the Soviet Union where the workers are being disrespected?"}, {"time": 1721, "text": "And can you not see that the conservatives could be pro communism?"}, {"time": 1728, "text": "Communism is such a strongly negative word in modern day political discourse that you have to put yourself in the mind of people who like red colors, it's all about the branding, I think, but also like the ideas of solidarity, of nation, of togetherness, of respect for fellow man."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "I mean, all of these things that communism represents, can you not see that this idea is actually going along with conservatism?"}, {"time": 1766, "text": "It is in some ways respecting the deep ideals of the past, but proposing a new way to raise those ideals, implement those ideals in the system."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "Yes, I'm going to try to do what you're suggesting, but historically we actually have a more useful option, I think, for both of our positions."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "Instead of pretending that we like the actual communists, we have conservative statesmen like Disraeli and Bismarck who initiated social legislation."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "The first step towards saying, look, we're one nation, we're undergoing industrialization, that industrialization is important and positive, but it's also doing a lot of damage to a lot of people."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "And in particular, it's doing damage not just to individuals and families, but it's doing damage to the social fabric, the capacity of Britain or German to remain cohesive societies is being harmed."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "And so it's these two conservative statesmen, Disraeli and Bismarck, who actually take the first steps in order to legislate for what today we would consider to be minimal social programs, pensions and disability insurance and those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1845, "text": "So for sure, conservatives do look at industrialization as a rapid change and they say, we do have to care about the nation as a whole and we have to care about it as a unit."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "And I assume that your own will say, look, that's the first step towards the catastrophe of communism."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "But before your own drives that nail into the coffin, let me try to make a distinction because when you read Marx, you're reading an intellectual descendant of Descartes."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "You're reading somebody who says, look, every society consists of oppressors and oppressed."}, {"time": 1887, "text": "And that's an improvement in some ways over liberal thinking because at least he's seeing groups as a real social phenomenon."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "But he says, every society has an oppressor class and oppressed class."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "They're different classes, they're different groups, and whenever one is stronger, it exploits the ones
