Gato is that it's sort of pushing prediction to the maximum in terms of like mapping arbitrary sequences to other sequences and sort of just predicting what's going to happen next."}, {"time": 336, "text": "So prediction seems to be fundamental to intelligence."}, {"time": 341, "text": "And what you're predicting doesn't so much matter."}, {"time": 344, "text": "Yeah, it seems like you can generalize that quite well."}, {"time": 346, "text": "So obviously language models predict the next word, Gato predicts potentially any action or any token."}, {"time": 353, "text": "And it's just the beginning really."}, {"time": 355, "text": "It's our most general agent one could call it so far, but that itself can be scaled up massively more than we've done so far."}, {"time": 362, "text": "And obviously we're in the middle of doing that."}, {"time": 364, "text": "But the big part of solving AGI is creating benchmarks that help us get closer and closer, sort of creating benchmarks that test the generalizability."}, {"time": 374, "text": "And it's just still interesting that this fella, Alan Turing, was one of the first and probably still one of the only people that was trying, maybe philosophically, but was trying to formulate a benchmark that could be followed."}, {"time": 387, "text": "It is, even though it's fuzzy, it's still sufficiently rigorous to where you can run that test."}, {"time": 393, "text": "And I still think something like the Turing test will, at the end of the day, be the thing that truly impresses other humans so that you can have a close friend who's an AI system."}, {"time": 406, "text": "And for that friend to be a good friend, they're going to have to be able to play StarCraft and they're gonna have to do all of these tasks, get you a beer, so the robotics tasks, play games with you, use language, humor, all of those kinds of things."}, {"time": 424, "text": "But that ultimately can boil down to language."}, {"time": 428, "text": "It feels like, not in terms of the AI community, but in terms of the actual impact of general intelligence on the world, it feels like language will be the place where it truly shines."}, {"time": 438, "text": "I think so, because it's such an important kind of input output for us."}, {"time": 443, "text": "I think the Turing test, the kind of the philosophy behind it, which is the idea of can a machine mimic the behaviors of a human?"}, {"time": 454, "text": "And I would say wider than just language and text, then in terms of actions and everything else, creativity, all these things, then if it can sort of match or exceed human cognitive capabilities, then I think we have a true intelligence."}, {"time": 469, "text": "So from that perspective, you're right."}, {"time": 471, "text": "I think he did formulate the right kind of setup."}, {"time": 504, "text": "Well, hello to the AI agents of the future."}, {"time": 507, "text": "Anyway, so going back to your journey, when did you fall in love with programming first?"}, {"time": 513, "text": "Well, I was pretty young age actually."}, {"time": 515, "text": "So, I started off, actually games was my first love."}, {"time": 520, "text": "So starting to play chess when I was around four years old and then it was actually with winnings from a chess competition that I managed to buy my first chess computer when I was about eight years old."}, {"time": 530, "text": "It was a ZX Spectrum, which was hugely popular in the UK at the time."}, {"time": 534, "text": "And it was amazing machine because I think it trained a whole generation of programmers in the UK because it was so accessible."}, {"time": 542, "text": "You know, you literally switched it on and there was the basic prompt and you could just get going."}, {"time": 546, "text": "And my parents didn't really know anything about computers."}, {"time": 549, "text": "So, but because it was my money from a chess competition, I could say I wanted to buy it."}, {"time": 555, "text": "And then, you know, I just went to bookstores, got books on programming and started typing in, you know, the programming code."}, {"time": 563, "text": "And then of course, once you start doing that, you start adjusting it and then making your own games."}, {"time": 569, "text": "And that's when I fell in love with computers and realized that they were a very magical device."}, {"time": 574, "text": "In a way, I kind of, I wouldn't have been able to explain this at the time, but I felt that they were sort of almost a magical extension of your mind."}, {"time": 580, "text": "I always had this feeling and I've always loved this about computers that you can set them off doing something, some task for you, you can go to sleep, come back the next day and it's solved."}, {"time": 591, "text": "You know, that feels magical to me."}, {"time": 593, "text": "So, I mean, all machines do that to some extent."}, {"time": 595, "text": "They all enhance our natural capabilities."}, {"time": 597, "text": "Obviously cars make us, allow us to move faster than we can run, but this was a machine to extend the mind."}, {"time": 604, "text": "And then of course, AI is the ultimate expression of what a machine may be able to do or learn."}, {"time": 611, "text": "So very naturally for me, that thought extended into AI quite quickly."}, {"time": 616, "text": "Do you remember the programming language that was first started and was it special to the machine?"}, {"time": 622, "text": "No, I think it was just basic on the ZX Spectrum."}, {"time": 625, "text": "I don't know what specific form it was."}, {"time": 627, "text": "And then later on I got a Commodore Amiga, which was a fantastic machine."}, {"time": 632, "text": "Now you're just showing off."}, {"time": 633, "text": "So yeah, well, lots of my friends had Atari STs and I managed to get Amigas, it was a bit more powerful and that was incredible and used to do programming in assembler and also Amos basic, this specific form of basic, it was incredible actually."}, {"time": 649, "text": "So I learned all my coding skills."}, {"time": 651, "text": "And when did you fall in love with AI?"}, {"time": 653, "text": "So when did you first start to gain an understanding that you can not just write programs that do some mathematical operations for you while you sleep, but something that's akin to bringing an entity to life, sort of a thing that can figure out something more complicated than a simple mathematical operation."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Yeah, so there was a few stages for me all while I was very young."}, {"time": 678, "text": "So first of all, as I was trying to improve at playing chess, I was captaining various England junior chess teams."}, {"time": 684, "text": "And at the time when I was about maybe 10, 11 years old, I was gonna become a professional chess player."}, {"time": 689, "text": "That was my first thought."}, {"time": 692, "text": "So that dream was there to try to get to the highest levels of chess."}, {"time": 695, "text": "Yeah, so when I was about 12 years old, I got to master standard and I was second highest rated player in the world to Judith Polgar, who obviously ended up being an amazing chess player and a world women's champion."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And when I was trying to improve at chess, where what you do is you obviously, first of all, you're trying to improve your own thinking processes."}, {"time": 715, "text": "So that leads you to thinking about thinking, how is your brain coming up with these ideas?"}, {"time": 720, "text": "Why is it making mistakes?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "How can you improve that thought process?"}, {"time": 724, "text": "But the second thing is that you, it was just the beginning, this was like in the early 80s, mid 80s of chess computers."}, {"time": 731, "text": "If you remember, they were physical balls like the one we have in front of us."}, {"time": 734, "text": "And you press down the squares."}, {"time": 737, "text": "And I think Kasparov had a branded version of it that I got."}, {"time": 741, "text": "And you used to, they're not as strong as they are today, but they were pretty strong and you used to practice against them to try and improve your openings and other things."}, {"time": 751, "text": "And so I remember, I think I probably got my first one, I was around 11 or 12."}, {"time": 754, "text": "And I remember thinking, this is amazing, how has someone programmed this chess board to play chess?"}, {"time": 762, "text": "And it was very formative book I bought, which was called The Chess Computer Handbook by David Levy."}, {"time": 769, "text": "This thing came out in 1984 or something."}, {"time": 770, "text": "So I must've got it when I was about 11, 12."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And it explained fully how these chess programs were made."}, {"time": 776, "text": "And I remember my first AI program being programming my Amiga."}, {"time": 780, "text": "It couldn't, it wasn't powerful enough to play chess."}, {"time": 782, "text": "I couldn't write a whole chess program, but I wrote a program for it to play Othello or reverse it, sometimes called I think in the US."}, {"time": 789, "text": "And so a slightly simpler game than chess, but I used all of the principles that chess programs had, alpha, beta, search, all of that."}, {"time": 796, "text": "And that was my first AI program."}, {"time": 797, "text": "I remember that very well, I was around 12 years old."}, {"time": 799, "text": "So that brought me into AI."}, {"time": 801, "text": "And then the second part was later on, when I was around 16, 17, and I was writing games professionally, designing games, writing a game called Theme Park, which had AI as a core gameplay component as part of the simulation."}, {"time": 815, "text": "And it sold millions of copies around the world."}, {"time": 818, "text": "And people loved the way that the AI, even though it was relatively simple by today's AI standards, was reacting to the way you as the player played it."}, {"time": 827, "text": "So it was called a sandbox game."}, {"time": 829, "text": "So it was one of the first types of games like that, along with SimCity."}, {"time": 832, "text": "And it meant that every game you played was unique."}, {"time": 835, "text": "Is there something you could say just on a small tangent about really impressive AI from a game design, human enjoyment perspective, really impressive AI that you've seen in games and maybe what does it take to create an AI system?"}, {"time": 852, "text": "And how hard of a problem is that?"}, {"time": 854, "text": "So a million questions just as a brief tangent."}, {"time": 858, "text": "Well, look, I think games have been significant in my life for three reasons."}, {"time": 863, "text": "So first of all, I was playing them and training myself on games when I was a kid."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Then I went through a phase of designing games and writing AI for games."}, {"time": 873, "text": "So all the games I professionally wrote had AI as a core component."}, {"time": 877, "text": "And that was mostly in the 90s."}, {"time": 880, "text": "And the reason I was doing that in games industry was at the time the games industry, I think was the cutting edge of technology."}, {"time": 887, "text": "So whether it was graphics with people like John Carmack and Quake and those kinds of things or AI, I think actually all the action was going on in games."}, {"time": 896, "text": "And we're still reaping the benefits of that even with things like GPUs, which I find ironic was obviously invented for graphics, computer graphics, but then turns out to be amazingly useful for AI."}, {"time": 906, "text": "It just turns out everything's a matrix multiplication it appears in the whole world."}, {"time": 911, "text": "So I think games at the time had the most cutting edge AI."}, {"time": 915, "text": "And a lot of the games, I was involved in writing."}, {"time": 919, "text": "So there was a game called Black and White, which was one game I was involved with in the early stages of, which I still think is the most impressive example of reinforcement learning in a computer game."}, {"time": 930, "text": "So in that game, you trained a little pet animal and..."}, {"time": 934, "text": "It's a brilliant game."}, {"time": 935, "text": "And it sort of learned from how you were treating it."}, {"time": 937, "text": "So if you treated it badly, then it became mean."}, {"time": 940, "text": "And then it would be mean to your villagers and your population, the sort of the little tribe that you were running."}, {"time": 947, "text": "But if you were kind to it, then it would be kind."}, {"time": 949, "text": "And people were fascinated by how that works."}, {"time": 951, "text": "And so was I to be honest with the way it kind of developed."}, {"time": 955, "text": "Especially the mapping to good and evil."}, {"time": 958, "text": "Made you realize, made me realize that you can sort of in the choices you make can define where you end up."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And that means all of us are capable of the good, evil."}, {"time": 972, "text": "It all matters in the different choices along the trajectory to those places that you make."}, {"time": 979, "text": "I mean, games can do that philosophically to you."}, {"time": 981, "text": "And it's rare."}, {"time": 982, "text": "It seems rare."}, {"time": 983, "text": "Well, games are, I think, a unique medium because you as the player, you're not just passively consuming the entertainment, right?"}, {"time": 990, "text": "You're actually actively involved as an agent."}, {"time": 994, "text": "So I think that's what makes it in some ways can be more visceral than other mediums like films and books."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "So the second, so that was designing AI in games."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "And then the third use we've used of AI is in DeepMind from the beginning, which is using games as a testing ground for proving out AI algorithms and developing AI algorithms."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And that was a sort of a core component of our vision at the start of DeepMind was that we would use games very heavily as our main testing ground, certainly to begin with, because it's super efficient to use games."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "And also, it's very easy to have metrics to see how well your systems are improving and what direction your ideas are going in and whether you're making incremental improvements."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "And because those games are often rooted in something that humans did for a long time beforehand, there's already a strong set of rules."}, {"time": 1046, "text": "Like it's already a damn good benchmark."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Yes, it's really good for so many reasons because you've got clear measures of how good humans can be at these things."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "And in some cases like Go, we've been playing it for thousands of years and often they have scores or at least win conditions."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So it's very easy for reward learning systems to get a reward."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "It's very easy to specify what that reward is."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "And also at the end, it's easy to test externally at how strong is your system by of course, playing against the world's strongest players at those games."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "So it's so good for so many reasons and it's also very efficient to run potentially millions of simulations in parallel on the cloud."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So I think there's a huge reason why we were so successful back in starting out 2010, how come we were able to progress so quickly because we've utilized games."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "And at the beginning of DeepMind, we also hired some amazing game engineers who I knew from my previous lives in the games industry."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "And that helped to bootstrap us very quickly."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And plus it's somehow super compelling almost at a philosophical level of man versus machine over a chess board or a Go board."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "And especially given that the entire history of AI is defined by people saying it's gonna be impossible to make a machine that beats a human being in chess."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "And then once that happened, people were certain when I was coming up in AI that Go is not a game that can be solved because of the combinatorial complexity is just too, it's no matter how much Moore's law you have, compute is just never going to be able to crack the game of Go."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "And so then there's something compelling about facing, sort of taking on the impossibility of that task from the AI researcher perspective, engineer perspective, and then as a human being, just observing this whole thing."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Your beliefs about what you thought was impossible being broken apart, it's humbling to realize we're not as smart as we thought."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "It's humbling to realize that the things we think are impossible now perhaps will be done in the future."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "There's something really powerful about a game, AI system beating human being in a game that drives that message home for like millions, billions of people, especially in the case of Go."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "Well, look, I think it's, I mean, it has been a fascinating journey and especially as I think about it from, I can understand it from both sides, both as the AI, creators of the AI, but also as a games player originally."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "So, it was a really interesting, I mean, it was a fantastic, but also somewhat bittersweet moment, the AlphaGo match for me, seeing that and being obviously heavily involved in that."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "But as you say, chess has been the, I mean, Kasparov, I think rightly called it the Drosophila of intelligence, right?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So, it's sort of, I love that phrase and I think he's right because chess has been hand in hand with AI from the beginning of the whole field, right?"}, {"time": 1247, "text": "So, I think every AI practitioner, starting with Turing and Claude Shannon and all those, the sort of forefathers of the field, tried their hand at writing a chess program."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "I've got original edition of Claude Shannon's first chess program, I think it was 1949, the original sort of paper."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "And they all did that and Turing famously wrote a chess program, but all the computers around them were obviously too slow to run it."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "So, he had to run, he had to be the computer, right?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So, he literally, I think spent two or three days running his own program by hand with pencil and paper and playing a friend of his with his chess program."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So, of course, Deep Blue was a huge moment, beating Kasparov, but actually when that happened, I remember that very vividly, of course, because it was chess and computers and AI, all the things I loved and I was at college at the time."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "But I remember coming away from that, being more impressed by Kasparov's mind than I was by Deep Blue."}, {"time": 1304, "text": "Because here was Kasparov with his human mind, not only could he play chess more or less to the same level as this brute of a calculation machine, but of course, Kasparov can do everything else humans can do, ride a bike, talk many languages, do politics, all the rest of the amazing things that Kasparov does."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "And so, with the same brain."}, {"time": 1323, "text": "And yet Deep Blue, brilliant as it was at chess, it'd been hand coded for chess and actually had distilled the knowledge of chess grandmasters into a cool program, but it couldn't do anything else."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "It couldn't even play a strictly simpler game like tic tac toe."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "So, something to me was missing from intelligence from that system that we would regard as intelligence."}, {"time": 1348, "text": "And I think it was this idea of generality and also learning."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "So, and that's obviously what we tried to do with AlphaGo."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "Yeah, with AlphaGo and AlphaZero, MuZero, and then God and all the things that we'll get into some parts of, there's just a fascinating trajectory here."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "But let's just stick on chess briefly."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "On the human side of chess, you've proposed that from a game design perspective, the thing that makes chess compelling as a game is that there's a creative tension between a bishop and the knight."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "Can you explain this?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "First of all, it's really interesting to think about what makes a game compelling, makes it stick across centuries."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Yeah, I was sort of thinking about this, and actually a lot of even amazing chess players don't think about it necessarily from a game's designer point of view."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "So, it's with my game design hat on that I was thinking about this, why is chess so compelling?"}, {"time": 1403, "text": "And I think a critical reason is the dynamicness of the different kind of chess positions you can have, whether they're closed or open and other things, comes from the bishop and the knight."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "So, if you think about how different the capabilities of the bishop and knight are in terms of the way they move, and then somehow chess has evolved to balance those two capabilities more or less equally."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "So, they're both roughly worth three points each."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "So, you think that dynamics is always there and then the rest of the rules are kind of trying to stabilize the game."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "Well, maybe, I mean, it's sort of, I don't know, it's chicken and egg situation, probably both came together."}, {"time": 1437, "text": "But the fact that it's got to this beautiful equilibrium where you can have the bishop and knight that are so different in power, but so equal in value across the set of the universe of all positions, right?"}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Somehow they've been balanced by humanity over hundreds of years, I think gives the game the creative tension that you can swap the bishop and knights for a bishop for a knight, and they're more or less worth the same, but now you aim for a different type of position."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "If you have the knight, you want a closed position."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "If you have the bishop, you want an open position."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "So, I think that creates a lot of the creative tension in chess."}, {"time": 1470, "text": "So, some kind of controlled creative tension."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "From an AI perspective, do you think AI systems could eventually design games that are optimally compelling to humans?"}, {"time": 1482, "text": "Sometimes I get asked about AI and creativity, and the way I answered that is relevant to that question, which is that I think there are different levels of creativity, one could say."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "So, I think if we define creativity as coming up with something original, right, that's useful for a purpose, then I think the kind of lowest level of creativity is like an interpolation."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "So, an averaging of all the examples you see."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "So, maybe a very basic AI system could say you could have that."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So, you show it millions of pictures of cats, and then you say, give me an average looking cat, right?"}, {"time": 1513, "text": "Generate me an average looking cat."}, {"time": 1515, "text": "I would call that interpolation."}, {"time": 1517, "text": "Then there's extrapolation, which something like AlphaGo showed."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "So, AlphaGo played millions of games of Go against itself, and then it came up with brilliant new ideas like Move 37 in game two, brilliant motif strategies in Go that no humans had ever thought of, even though we've played it for thousands of years and professionally for hundreds of years."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "So, that I call that extrapolation, but then there's still a level above that, which is, you could call out of the box thinking or true innovation, which is, could you invent Go, right?"}, {"time": 1547, "text": "Could you invent chess and not just come up with a brilliant chess move or brilliant Go move, but can you actually invent chess or something as good as chess or Go?"}, {"time": 1555, "text": "And I think one day AI could, but then what's missing is how would you even specify that task to a program right now?"}, {"time": 1564, "text": "And the way I would do it if I was telling a human to do it or a human games designer to do it is I would say, something like Go, I would say, come up with a game that only takes five minutes to learn, which Go does because it's got simple rules, but many lifetimes to master, right?"}, {"time": 1580, "text": "Or impossible to master in one lifetime because it's so deep and so complex."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "And then it's aesthetically beautiful."}, {"time": 1586, "text": "And also it can be completed in three or four hours of gameplay time, which is useful for us in a human day."}, {"time": 1595, "text": "And so you might specify these sort of high level concepts like that, and then with that and then maybe a few other things, one could imagine that Go satisfies those constraints."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "But the problem is that we're not able to specify abstract notions like that, high level abstract notions like that yet to our AI systems."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "And I think there's still something missing there in terms of high level concepts or abstractions that they truly understand and they're combinable and compositional."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "So for the moment, I think AI is capable of doing interpolation and extrapolation, but not true invention."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "So coming up with rule sets and optimizing with complicated objectives around those rule sets, we can't currently do."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "But you could take a specific rule set and then run a kind of self play experiment to see how long, just observe how an AI system from scratch learns, how long is that journey of learning?"}, {"time": 1655, "text": "And maybe if it satisfies some of those other things you mentioned in terms of quickness to learn and so on, and you could see a long journey to master for even an AI system, then you could say that this is a promising game."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "But it would be nice to do almost like AlphaCode so programming rules."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "So generating rules that automate even that part of the generation of rules."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "So I have thought about systems actually that I think would be amazing for a games designer."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "If you could have a system that takes your game, plays it tens of millions of times, maybe overnight, and then self balances the rules better."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "So it tweaks the rules and maybe the equations and the parameters so that the game is more balanced, the units in the game or some of the rules could be tweaked."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "So it's a bit of like giving a base set and then allowing Monte Carlo Tree Search or something like that to sort of explore it."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "And I think that would be super powerful tool actually for balancing, auto balancing a game, which usually takes thousands of hours from hundreds of human games testers normally to balance a game like StarCraft, which is Blizzard are amazing at

"Now, the key thing is you want to know what that 3D structure is because the structure, the 3D structure of a protein is what helps to determine what does it do, the function it does in your body."}, {"time": 2348, "text": "And also if you're interested in drugs or disease, you need to understand that 3D structure because if you want to target something with a drug compound about to block something the protein's doing, you need to understand where it's gonna bind on the surface of the protein."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "So obviously in order to do that, you need to understand the 3D structure."}, {"time": 2366, "text": "So the structure is mapped to the function."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "The structure is mapped to the function and the structure is obviously somehow specified by the amino acid sequence."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "And that's the, in essence, the protein folding problem is, can you just from the amino acid sequence, the one dimensional string of letters, can you immediately computationally predict the 3D structure?"}, {"time": 2387, "text": "And this has been a grand challenge in biology for over 50 years."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So I think it was first articulated by Christian Anfinsen, a Nobel prize winner in 1972, as part of his Nobel prize winning lecture."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "And he just speculated this should be possible to go from the amino acid sequence to the 3D structure, but he didn't say how."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "So it's been described to me as equivalent to Fermat's last theorem, but for biology."}, {"time": 2412,

set off, you know, with this one throwaway remark, just like Fermat, you know, he set off this whole 50 year field really of computational biology."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "And they had, you know, they got stuck."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "They hadn't really got very far with doing this."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "And until now, until AlphaFold came along, this is done experimentally, right?"}, {"time": 2454, "text": "Very painstakingly."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "So the rule of thumb is, and you have to like crystallize the protein, which is really difficult."}, {"time": 2459, "text": "Some proteins can't be crystallized like membrane proteins."}, {"time": 2463, "text": "And then you have to use very expensive electron microscopes or X ray crystallography machines."}, {"time": 2468, "text": "Really painstaking work to get the 3D structure and visualize the 3D structure."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "So the rule of thumb in experimental biology is that it takes one PhD student, their entire PhD to do one protein."}, {"time": 2480, "text": "And with AlphaFold 2, we were able to predict the 3D structure in a matter of seconds."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "And so we were, you know, over Christmas, we did the whole human proteome or every protein in the human body or 20,000 proteins."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "So the human proteomes like the equivalent of the human genome, but on protein space."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "And sort of revolutionized really what a structural biologist can do."}, {"time": 2503, "text": "Because now they don't have to worry about these painstaking experimental, should they put all of that effort in or not?"}, {"time": 2509, "text": "They can almost just look up the structure of their proteins like a Google search."}, {"time": 2513, "text": "And so there's a data set on which it's trained and how to map this amino acid sequence."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "First of all, it's incredible that a protein, this little chemical computer is able to do that computation itself in some kind of distributed way and do it very quickly."}, {"time": 2527, "text": "That's a weird thing."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "And they evolve that way because, you know, in the beginning, I mean, that's a great invention, just the protein itself."}, {"time": 2534, "text": "And then there's, I think, probably a history of like they evolved to have many of these proteins and those proteins figure out how to be computers themselves in such a way that you can create structures that can interact in complexes with each other in order to form high level functions."}, {"time": 2552, "text": "I mean, it's a weird system that they figured it out."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "I mean, you know, maybe we should talk about the origins of life too, but proteins themselves, I think are magical and incredible, as I said, little bio nano machines."}, {"time": 2565, "text": "And actually Leventhal, who was another scientist, a contemporary of Amphinson, he coined this Leventhal, what became known as Leventhal's paradox, which is exactly what you're saying."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "He calculated roughly an average protein, which is maybe 2000 amino acids base as long, is can fold in maybe 10 to the power 300 different confirmations."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "So there's 10 to the power 300 different ways that protein could fold up."}, {"time": 2594, "text": "And yet somehow in nature, physics solves this, solves this in a matter of milliseconds."}, {"time": 2600, "text": "So proteins fold up in your body in, you know, sometimes in fractions of a second."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "So physics is somehow solving that search problem."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "And just to be clear, in many of these cases, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, there's often a unique way for that sequence to form itself."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "So among that huge number of possibilities, it figures out a way how to stably, in some cases there might be a misfunction, so on, which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "But most of the time it's a unique mapping and that unique mapping is not obvious."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "Which is what the problem is."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "Exactly, so there's a unique mapping usually in a healthy, if it's healthy, and as you say in disease, so for example, Alzheimer's, one conjecture is that it's because of misfolded protein, a protein that folds in the wrong way, amyloid beta protein."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "So, and then because it folds in the wrong way, it gets tangled up, right, in your neurons."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "So it's super important to understand both healthy functioning and also disease is to understand, you know, what these things are doing and how they're structuring."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "Of course, the next step is sometimes proteins change shape when they interact with something."}, {"time": 2672, "text": "So they're not just static necessarily in biology."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "Maybe you can give some interesting, so beautiful things to you about these early days of AlphaFold, of solving this problem, because unlike games, this is real physical systems that are less amenable to self play type of mechanisms."}, {"time": 2696, "text": "The size of the data set is smaller than you might otherwise like, so you have to be very clever about certain things."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "Is there something you could speak to what was very hard to solve and what are some beautiful aspects about the solution?"}, {"time": 2709, "text": "Yeah, I would say AlphaFold is the most complex and also probably most meaningful system we've built so far."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "So it's been an amazing time actually in the last, you know, two, three years to see that come through because as we talked about earlier, you know, games is what we started on building things like AlphaGo and AlphaZero, but really the ultimate goal was to, not just to crack games, it was just to build, use them to bootstrap general learning systems we could then apply to real world challenges."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "Specifically, my passion is scientific challenges like protein folding."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "And then AlphaFold of course is our first big proof point of that."}, {"time": 2745, "text": "And so, you know, in terms of the data and the amount of innovations that had to go into it, we, you know, it was like more than 30 different component algorithms needed to be put together to crack the protein folding."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "I think some of the big innovations were that kind of building in some hard coded constraints around physics and evolutionary biology to constrain sort of things like the bond angles in the protein and things like that, a lot, but not to impact the learning system."}, {"time": 2778, "text": "So still allowing the system to be able to learn the physics itself from the examples that we had."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "And the examples, as you say, there are only about 150,000 proteins, even after 40 years of experimental biology, only around 150,000 proteins have been, the structures have been found out about."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "So that was our training set, which is much less than normally we would like to use, but using various tricks, things like self distillation."}, {"time": 2803, "text": "So actually using AlphaFold predictions, some of the best predictions that it thought was highly confident in, we put them back into the training set, right?"}, {"time": 2813, "text": "To make the training set bigger, that was critical to AlphaFold working."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "So there was actually a huge number of different innovations like that, that were required to ultimately crack the problem."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "AlphaFold one, what it produced was a distrogram."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "So a kind of a matrix of the pairwise distances between all of the molecules in the protein."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "And then there had to be a separate optimization process to create the 3D structure."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "And what we did for AlphaFold two is make it truly end to end."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "So we went straight from the amino acid sequence of bases to the 3D structure directly without going through this intermediate step."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "And in machine learning, what we've always found is that the more end to end you can make it, the better the system."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "And it's probably because in the end, the system's better at learning what the constraints are than we are as the human designers of specifying it."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "So anytime you can let it flow end to end and actually just generate what it is you're really looking for, in this case, the 3D structure, you're better off than having this intermediate step, which you then have to handcraft the next step for."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "So it's better to let the gradients and the learning flow all the way through the system from the end point, the end output you want to the inputs."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "So that's a good way to start on a new problem."}, {"time": 2893, "text": "Handcraft a bunch of stuff, add a bunch of manual constraints with a small end to end learning piece or a small learning piece and grow that learning piece until it consumes the whole thing."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "And so you can also see, this is a bit of a method we've developed over doing many sort of successful alpha, we call them alpha X projects, right?"}, {"time": 2912, "text": "And the easiest way to see that is the evolution of alpha go to alpha zero."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "So alpha go was a learning system, but it was specifically trained to only play go, right?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "So, and what we wanted to do with first version of alpha go is just get to world champion performance no matter how we did it, right?"}, {"time": 2929, "text": "And then of course, alpha go zero, we remove the need to use human games as a starting point, right?"}, {"time": 2936, "text": "So it could just play against itself from random starting point from the beginning."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "So that removed the need for human knowledge about go."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "And then finally alpha zero then generalized it so that any things we had in there, the system, including things like symmetry of the go board were removed."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "So the alpha zero could play from scratch any two player game and then mu zero, which is the final, our latest version of that set of things was then extending it so that you didn't even have to give it the rules of the game."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "It would learn that for itself."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "So it could also deal with computer games as well as board games."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "So that line of alpha go, alpha go zero, alpha zero, mu zero, that's the full trajectory of what you can take from imitation learning to full self supervised learning."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And learning the entire structure of the environment you're put in from scratch, right?"}, {"time": 2987, "text": "And bootstrapping it through self play yourself."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "But the thing is it would have been impossible, I think, or very hard for us to build alpha zero or mu zero first out of the box."}, {"time": 2998, "text": "Even psychologically, because you have to believe in yourself for a very long time."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "You're constantly dealing with doubt because a lot of people say that it's impossible."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Exactly, so it's hard enough just to do go."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "As you were saying, everyone thought that was impossible or at least a decade away from when we did it back in 2015, 2016."}, {"time": 3017, "text": "And so yes, it would have been psychologically probably very difficult as well as the fact that of course we learn a lot by building alpha go first."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Right, so I think this is why I call AI an engineering science."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "It's one of the most fascinating science disciplines, but it's also an engineering science in the sense that unlike natural sciences, the phenomenon you're studying doesn't exist out in nature."}, {"time": 3039, "text": "You have to build it first."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "So you have to build the artifact first, and then you can study and pull it apart and how it works."}, {"time": 3046, "text": "This is tough to ask you this question because you probably will say it's everything, but let's try to think through this because you're in a very interesting position where DeepMind is a place of some of the most brilliant ideas in the history of AI, but it's also a place of brilliant engineering."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "So how much of solving intelligence, this big goal for DeepMind, how much of it is science?"}, {"time": 3072, "text": "How much is engineering?"}, {"time": 3073, "text": "So how much is the algorithms?"}, {"time": 3074, "text": "How much is the data?"}, {"time": 3076, "text": "How much is the hardware compute infrastructure?"}, {"time": 3079, "text": "How much is it the software compute infrastructure?"}, {"time": 3084, "text": "How much is the human infrastructure?"}, {"time": 3087, "text": "And like just the humans interacting certain kinds of ways in all the space of all those ideas."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "And how much is maybe like philosophy?"}, {"time": 3093, "text": "How much, what's the key?"}, {"time": 3095, "text": "If you were to sort of look back, like if we go forward 200 years and look back, what was the key thing that solved intelligence?"}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Is it the ideas or the engineering?"}, {"time": 3107, "text": "I think it's a combination."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "First of all, of course, it's a combination of all those things, but the ratios of them changed over time."}, {"time": 3114, "text": "So even in the last 12 years, so we started DeepMind in 2010, which is hard to imagine now because 2010, it's only 12 short years ago, but nobody was talking about AI."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "I don't know if you remember back to your MIT days, no one was talking about it."}, {"time": 3128, "text": "I did a postdoc at MIT back around then."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "And it was sort of thought of as a, well, look, we know AI doesn't work."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "We tried this hard in the 90s at places like MIT, mostly using logic systems and old fashioned, sort of good old fashioned AI, we would call it now."}, {"time": 3142, "text": "People like Minsky and Patrick Winston, and you know all these characters, right?"}, {"time": 3146, "text": "And used to debate a few of them."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "And they used to think I was mad thinking about that some new advance could be done with learning systems."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "And I was actually pleased to hear that because at least you know you're on a unique track at that point, right?"}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Even if all of your professors are telling you you're mad."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "And of course in industry, we couldn't get, it was difficult to get two cents together, which is hard to imagine now as well, given that it's the biggest sort of buzzword in VCs and fundraisings easy and all these kinds of things today."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "So back in 2010, it was very difficult."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "And the reason we started then, and Shane and I used to discuss what were the sort of founding tenants of DeepMind."}, {"time": 3184, "text": "And it was various things."}, {"time": 3186, "text": "One was algorithmic advances."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "So deep learning, you know, Jeff Hinton and Co had just sort of invented that in academia, but no one in industry knew about it."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "We love reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "We thought that could be scaled up."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "But also understanding about the human brain had advanced quite a lot in the decade prior with fMRI machines and other things."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "So we could get some good hints about architectures and algorithms and sort of representations maybe that the brain uses."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "So at a systems level, not at a implementation level."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "And then the other big things were compute and GPUs, right?"}, {"time": 3221, "text": "So we could see a compute was going to be really useful and had got to a place where it become commoditized mostly through the games industry and that could be taken advantage of."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "And then the final thing was also mathematical and theoretical definitions of intelligence."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "So things like AIXI, AIXE, which Shane worked on with his supervisor, Marcus Hutter, which is this sort of theoretical proof really of universal intelligence, which is actually a reinforcement learning system in the limit."}, {"time": 3248, "text": "I mean, it assumes infinite compute and infinite memory in the way, you know, like a Turing machine proves."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "But I was also waiting to see something like that too, to, you know, like Turing machines and computation theory that people like Turing and Shannon came up with underpins modern computer science."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "You know, I was waiting for a theory like that to sort of underpin AGI research."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "So when I, you know, met Shane and saw he was working on something like that, you know, that to me was a sort of final piece of the jigsaw."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "So in the early days, I would say that ideas were the most important."}, {"time": 3280, "text": "You know, for us, it was deep reinforcement learning, scaling up deep learning."}, {"time": 3284, "text": "Of course, we've seen transformers."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "So huge leaps, I would say, you know, three or four from, if you think from 2010 till now, huge evolutions, things like AlphaGo."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "And maybe there's a few more still needed."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "But as we get closer to AI, AGI, I think engineering becomes more and more important and data because scale and of course the recent, you know, results of GPT3 and all the big language models and large models, including our ones, has shown that scale and large models are clearly gonna be a necessary, but perhaps not sufficient part of an AGI solution."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "And throughout that, like you said, and I'd like to give you a big thank you."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "You're one of the pioneers in this is sticking by ideas like reinforcement learning, that this can actually work given actually limited success in the past."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "And also, which we still don't know, but proudly having the best researchers in the world and talking about solving intelligence."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "So talking about whatever you call it, AGI or something like this, speaking of MIT, that's just something you wouldn't bring up."}, {"time": 3357, "text": "Not maybe you did in like 40, 50 years ago, but that was, AI was a place where you do tinkering, very small scale, not very ambitious projects."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "And maybe the biggest ambitious projects were in the space of robotics and doing like the DARPA challenge."}, {"time": 3379, "text": "But the task of solving intelligence and believing you can, that's really, really powerful."}, {"time": 3384, "text": "So in order for engineering to do its work, to have great engineers, build great systems, you have to have that belief, that threads throughout the whole thing that you can actually solve some of these impossible challenges."}, {"time": 3397, "text": "And back in 2010, our mission statement and still is today, it was used to be solving step one, solve intelligence, step two, use it to solve everything else."}, {"time": 3407, "text": "So if you can imagine pitching that to a VC in 2010, the kind of looks we got, we managed to find a few kooky people to back us, but it was tricky."}, {"time": 3417, "text": "And it got to the point where we wouldn't mention it to any of our professors because they would just eye roll and think we committed career suicide."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "And so it was, there's a lot of things that we had to do, but we always believed it."}, {"time": 3431, "text": "And one reason, by the way, one reason I've always believed in reinforcement learning is that if you look at neuroscience, that is the way that the primate brain learns."}, {"time": 3442, "text": "One of the main mechanisms is the dopamine system implements some form of TD learning."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "It was a very famous result in the late 90s where they saw this in monkeys and as a propagating prediction error."}, {"time": 3454, "text": "So again, in the limit, this is what I think you can use neuroscience for is, at mathematics, when you're doing something as ambitious as trying to solve intelligence and it's blue sky research, no one knows how to do it, you need to use any evidence or any source of information you can to help guide you in the right direction or give you confidence you're going in the right direction."}, {"time": 3476, "text": "So that was one reason we pushed so hard on that."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "And just going back to your earlier question about organization, the other big thing that I think we innovated with at DeepMind to encourage invention and innovation was the multidisciplinary organization we built and we still have today."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "So DeepMind originally was a confluence of the most cutting edge knowledge in neuroscience with machine learning, engineering and mathematics, right?"}, {"time": 3502, "text": "And gaming."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "And then since then we've built that out even further."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "So we have philosophers here and ethicists, but also other types of scientists, physicists and so on."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "And that's what brings together, I tried to build a sort of new type of Bell Labs, but in its golden era, right?"}, {"time": 3521, "text": "And a new expression of that to try and foster this incredible sort of innovation machine."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "So talking about the humans in the machine, DeepMind itself is a learning machine with lots of amazing human minds in it coming together to try and build these learning systems."}, {"time": 3540, "text": "If we return to the big ambitious dream of AlphaFold, that may be the early steps on a very long journey in biology, do you think the same kind of approach can use to predict the structure and function of more complex biological systems?"}, {"time": 3558, "text": "So multi protein interaction, and then, I mean, you can go out from there, just simulating bigger and bigger systems that eventually simulate something like the human brain or the human body, just the big mush, the mess of the beautiful, resilient mess of biology."}, {"time": 3576, "text": "Do you see that as a long term vision?"}, {"time": 3579, "text": "I do, and I think, if you think about what are the top things I wanted to apply AI to once we had powerful enough systems, biology and curing diseases and understanding biology was right up there, top of my list."}, {"time": 3594, "text": "That's one of the reasons I personally pushed that myself and with AlphaFold, but I think AlphaFold, amazing as it is, is just the beginning."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "And I hope it's evidence of what could be done with computational methods."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "So AlphaFold solved this huge problem of the structure of proteins, but biology is dynamic."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "So really what I imagine from here, and we're working on all these things now, is protein, protein interaction, protein ligand binding, so reacting with molecules, then you wanna build up to pathways, and then eventually a virtual cell."}, {"time": 3630, "text": "That's my dream, maybe in the next 10 years."}, {"time": 3632, "text": "And I've been talking actually to a lot of biologists, friends of mine, Paul Nurse, who runs the Crick Institute, amazing biologists, Nobel Prize winning biologists."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "We've been discussing for 20 years now, virtual cells."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "Could you build a virtual simulation of a cell?"}, {"time": 3644, "text": "And if you could, that would be incredible for biology and disease discovery, because you could do loads of experiments on the virtual cell, and then only at the last stage, validate it in the wet lab."}, {"time": 3653, "text": "So you could, in terms of the search space of discovering new drugs, it takes 10 years roughly to go from identifying a target, to having a drug candidate."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "Maybe that could be shortened by an order of magnitude, if you could do most of that work in silico."}, {"time": 3673, "text": "So in order to get to a virtual cell, we have to build up understanding of different parts of biology and the interactions."}, {"time": 3680, "text": "And so every few years we talk about this, I talked about this with Paul."}, {"time": 3685, "text": "And then finally, last year after AlphaFold, I said, now's the time we can finally go for it."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "And AlphaFold is the first proof point that this might be possible."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "And he's very excited, and we have some collaborations with his lab, they're just across the road actually from us, it's wonderful being here in King's Cross with the Crick Institute across the road."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "And I think the next steps, I think there's gonna be some amazing advances in biology built on top of things like AlphaFold."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "We're already seeing that with the community doing that after we've open sourced it and released it."}, {"time": 3716, "text": "And I often say that I think if you think of mathematics is the perfect description language for physics, I think AI might be end up being the perfect description language for biology because biology is so messy, it's so emergent, so dynamic and complex."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "I think I find it very hard to believe we'll ever get to something as elegant as Newton's laws of motions to describe a cell, right?"}, {"time": 3741, "text": "It's just too complicated."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "So I think AI is the right tool for that."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "So you have to start at the basic building blocks and use AI to run the simulation for all those building blocks."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "So have a very strong way to do prediction of what given these building blocks, what kind of biology, how the function and the evolution of that biological system."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "It's almost like a cellular automata, you have to run it, you can't analyze it from a high level."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "You have to take the basic ingredients, figure out the rules and let it run."}, {"time": 3771, "text": "But in this case, the rules are very difficult to figure out, you have to learn them."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "So the biology is too complicated to figure out the rules."}, {"time": 3780, "text": "It's too emergent, too dynamic, say compared to a physics system, like the motion of a planet, right?"}, {"time": 3787, "text": "And so you have to learn the rules and that's exactly the type of systems that we're building."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "So you mentioned you've open sourced AlphaFold and even the data involved."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "To me personally, also really happy and a big thank you for open sourcing Mojoko, the physics simulation engine that's often used for robotics research and so on."}, {"time": 3809, "text": "So I think that's a pretty gangster move."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "So what's the, I mean, very few companies or people do that kind of thing."}, {"time": 3819, "text": "What's the philosophy behind that?"}, {"time": 3821, "text": "You know, it's a case by case basis."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "And in both of those cases, we felt that was the maximum benefit to humanity to do that."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "And the scientific community, in one case, the robotics physics community with Mojoko, so."}, {"time": 3833, "text": "We purchased it."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "We purchased it for, yes, we purchased it for the express principle to open source it."}, {"time": 3838, "text": "So, you know, I hope people appreciate that."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "It's great to hear that you do."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "And then the second thing was, and mostly we did it because the person building it was not able to cope with supporting it anymore because it got too big for him."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "He's an amazing professor who built it in the first place."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "So we helped him out with that."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "And then with AlphaFold is even bigger, I would say."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "And I think in that case, we decided that there were so many downstream applications of AlphaFold that we couldn't possibly even imagine what they all were."}, {"time": 3870, "text": "So the best way to accelerate drug discovery and also fundamental research would be to give all that data away and the system itself."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "You know, it's been so gratifying to see what people have done that within just one year, which is a short amount of time in science."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "And it's been used by over 500,000 researchers have used it."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "We think that's almost every biologist in the world."}, {"time": 3896, "text": "I think there's roughly 500,000 biologists in the world, professional biologists, have used it to look at their proteins of interest."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "We've seen amazing fundamental research done."}, {"time": 3906, "text": "So a couple of weeks ago, front cover, there was a whole special issue of science, including the front cover, which had the nuclear pore complex on it, which is one of the biggest proteins in the body."}, {"time": 3915, "text": "The nuclear pore complex is a protein that governs all the nutrients going in and out of your cell nucleus."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "So they're like little gateways that open and close to let things go in and out of your cell nucleus."}, {"time": 3927, "text": "So they're really important, but they're huge because they're massive donut ring shaped things."}, {"time": 3931, "text": "And they've been looking to try and figure out that structure for decades."}, {"time": 3934, "text": "And they have lots of experimental data, but it's too low resolution, there's bits missing."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "And they were able to, like a giant Lego jigsaw puzzle, use alpha fold predictions plus experimental data and combined those two independent sources of information, actually four different groups around the world were able to put it together more or less simultaneously using alpha fold predictions."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "So that's been amazing to see."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "And pretty much every pharma company, every drug company executive I've spoken to has said that their teams are using alpha fold to accelerate whatever drugs they're trying to discover."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "So I think the knock on effect has been enormous in terms of the impact that alpha fold has made."}, {"time": 3975, "text": "And it's probably bringing in, it's creating biologists, it's bringing more people into the field, both on the excitement and both on the technical skills involved in, it's almost like a gateway drug to biology."}, {"time": 3989, "text": "And to get more computational people involved too, hopefully."}, {"time": 3992, "text": "And I think for us, the next stage, as I said, in future we have to have other considerations too."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "We're building on top of alpha fold and these other ideas I discussed with you about protein interactions and genomics and other things."}, {"time": 4004, "text": "And not everything will be open source."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "Some of it we'll do commercially because that will be the best way to actually get the most resources and impact behind it."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "In other ways, some other projects we'll do nonprofit style."}, {"time": 4015, "text": "And also we have to consider for future things as well, safety and ethics as well."}, {"time": 4019, "text": "Like synthetic biology, there is dual use."}, {"time": 4023, "text": "And we have to think about that as well."}, {"time": 4025, "text": "With alpha fold, we consulted with 30 different bioethicists and other people expert in this field to make sure it was safe before we released it."}, {"time": 4033, "text": "So there'll be other considerations in future."}, {"time": 4035, "text": "But for right now, I think alpha fold is a kind of a gift from us to the scientific community."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "So I'm pretty sure that something like alpha fold will be part of Nobel prizes in the future."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "But us humans, of course, are horrible with credit assignment."}, {"time": 4052, "text": "So we'll of course give it to the humans."}, {"time": 4055, "text": "Do you think there will be a day when AI system can't be denied that it earned that Nobel prize?"}, {"time": 4065, "text": "Do you think we will see that in 21st century?"}, {"time": 4067, "text": "It depends what type of AIs we end up building, right?"}, {"time": 4070, "text": "Whether they're goal seeking agents who specifies the goals, who comes up with the hypotheses, who determines which problems to tackle, right?"}, {"time": 4080, "text": "So I think... And tweets about it, announcement of the results."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "Yes, and tweets about results exactly as part of it."}, {"time": 4085, "text": "So I think right now, of course, it's amazing human ingenuity that's behind these systems."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "And then the system, in my opinion, is just a tool."}, {"time": 4095, "text": "Be a bit like saying with Galileo and his telescope, the ingenuity that the credit should go to the telescope."}, {"time": 4101, "text": "I mean, it's clearly Galileo building the tool which he then uses."}, {"time": 4105, "text": "So I still see that in the same way today, even though these tools learn for themselves."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "There, I think of things like alpha fold and the things we're building as the ultimate tools for science and for acquiring new knowledge to help us as scientists acquire new knowledge."}, {"time": 4121, "text": "I think one day there will come a point where an AI system may solve or come up with something like general relativity of its own bat, not just by averaging everything on the internet or averaging everything on PubMed, although that would be interesting to see what that would come up with."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "So that to me is a bit like our earlier debate about creativity, you know, inventing go rather than just coming up with a good go move."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "And so I think solving, I think to, you know, if we wanted to give it the credit of like a Nobel type of thing, then it would need to invent go and sort of invent that new conjecture out of the blue rather than being specified by the human scientists or the human creators."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "So I think right now it's definitely just a tool."}, {"time": 4166, "text": "Although it is interesting how far you get by averaging everything on the internet, like you said, because, you know, a lot of people do see science as you're always standing on the shoulders of giants."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "And the question is how much are you really reaching up above the shoulders of giants?"}, {"time": 4182, "text": "Maybe it's just simulating different kinds of results of the past with ultimately this new perspective that gives you this breakthrough idea."}, {"time": 4191, "text": "But that idea may not be novel in the way that it can't be already discovered on the internet."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "Maybe the Nobel prizes of the next 100 years are already all there on the internet to be discovered."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "They could be, they could be."}, {"time": 4204, "text": "I mean, I think this is one of the big mysteries, I think is that I, first of all, I believe a lot of the big new breakthroughs that are gonna come in the next few decades and even in the last decade are gonna come at the intersection between different subject areas where there'll be some new connection that's found between what seemingly were disparate areas."}, {"time": 4226, "text": "And one can even think of DeepMind, as I said earlier, as a sort of interdisciplinary between neuroscience ideas and AI engineering ideas originally."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "And so I think there's that."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "And then one of the things we can't imagine today is, and one of the reasons I think people, we were so surprised by how well large models worked is that actually it's very hard for our human minds, our limited human minds to understand what it would be like to read the whole internet, right?"}, {"time": 4252, "text": "I think we can do a thought experiment and I used to do this of like, well, what if I read the whole of Wikipedia?"}, {"time": 4257, "text": "What would I know?"}, {"time": 4258, "text": "And I think our minds can just about comprehend maybe what that would be like, but the whole internet is beyond comprehension."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "So I think we just don't understand what it would be like to be able to hold all of that in mind potentially, right?"}, {"time": 4270, "text": "And then active at once, and then maybe what are the connections that are available there?"}, {"time": 4275, "text": "So I think no doubt there are huge things to be discovered just like that."}, {"time": 4279, "text": "But I do think there is this other type of creativity of true spark of new knowledge, new idea, never thought before about, can't be averaged from things that are known, that really, of course, everything come, nobody creates in a vacuum, so there must be clues somewhere, but just a unique way of putting those things together."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "I think some of the greatest scientists in history have displayed that I would say, although it's very hard to know going back to their time, what was exactly known when they came up with those things."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "Although you're making me really think because just a thought experiment of deeply knowing a hundred Wikipedia pages."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "I don't think I can, I've been really impressed by Wikipedia for technical topics."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "So if you know a hundred pages or a thousand pages, I don't think we can truly comprehend what kind of intelligence that is."}, {"time": 4333, "text": "That's a pretty powerful intelligence."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "If you know how to use that and integrate that information correctly, I think you can go really far."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "You can probably construct thought experiments based on that, like simulate different ideas."}, {"time": 4345, "text": "So if this is true, let me run this thought experiment that maybe this is true."}, {"time": 4350, "text": "It's not really invention."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "It's like just taking literally the knowledge and using it to construct the very basic simulation of the world."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "I mean, some argue it's romantic in part, but Einstein would do the same kind of things with a thought experiment."}, {"time": 4363, "text": "Yeah, one could imagine doing that systematically across millions of Wikipedia pages, plus PubMed, all these things."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "I think there are many, many things to be discovered like that that are hugely useful."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "You could imagine, and I want us to do some of these things in material science like room temperature superconductors is something on my list one day."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "I'd like to have an AI system to help build better optimized batteries, all of these sort of mechanical things."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "I think a systematic sort of search could be guided by a model, could be extremely powerful."}, {"time": 4397, "text": "So speaking of which, you have a paper on nuclear fusion, magnetic control of tachymic plasmas through deep reinforcement learning."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "So you're seeking to solve nuclear fusion with deep RL."}, {"time": 4409, "text":

year or two and very productive because we've been taking off a lot of my dream projects, if you like, of things that I've collected over the years of areas of science that I would like to, I think could be very transformative if we helped accelerate and really interesting problems, scientific challenges in of themselves."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "So this is energy."}, {"time": 4437, "text": "So energy, yes, exactly."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "So energy and climate."}, {"time": 4439, "text": "So we talked about disease and biology as being one of the biggest places I think AI can help with."}, {"time": 4444, "text": "I think energy and climate is another one."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "So maybe they would be my top two."}, {"time": 4449, "text": "And fusion is one area I think AI

jump?"}, {"time": 5954, "text": "It's very difficult, which is why I think it has only been done once from the sort of specialized brains that you see in animals to this sort of general purpose,

any semblance of self awareness or other things."}, {"time": 6160, "text": "And in fact, I would advocate if there's a choice, building systems in the first place, AI systems that are not conscious to

you about this one particular anecdotal evidence of the Google engineer who made a comment or believed that there's some aspect of a language model, the Lambda language model that exhibited

that we miss them when they're gone."}, {"time": 6227, "text": "And we sure as heck feel like they're living entities, self aware entities, and maybe even we project sentience onto them."}, {"time":

reason, the difficult thing, I think for us when we get, and I think this is a really interesting philosophical debate is when we get closer to AGI and, you know, and much more powerful systems than we have today, how are we going to make this judgment?"}, {"time": 6404, "text": "And one way, which is the Turing test is sort of a behavioral judgment, is the system exhibiting all the behaviors that a human sentient or a sentient being would exhibit?"}, {"time": 6416, "text": "Is it answering the right questions?"}, {"time": 6418, "text": "Is it saying the right things?"}, {"time": 6419,

running on the same substrate, right?"}, {"time": 6438, "text": "So if we're exhibiting the same behavior, more or less as humans, and we're running on the same, you know, carbon based biological substrate, the squishy, you know, few pounds of flesh in our skulls, then the most parsimonious, I think, explanation is that you're feeling the same thing as I'm feeling, right?"}, {"time": 6455,

think they might be, because they're exhibiting some of the behaviors we would expect from a sentient animal."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "And we know they're made of the same things, biological neurons."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "So we're gonna have to come up with explanations or models of the gap between substrate differences, between machines and humans to get anywhere beyond the behavioral."}, {"time": 6490, "text": "But to me, sort of the practical question is very interesting and very important."}, {"time": 6496, "text": "When you have millions, perhaps billions of people

before that, because we plan for success and however remote that looked like back in 2010."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "And we've always had sort of these ethical considerations as fundamental at DeepMind."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "And my current thinking on the language models and large models is they're not ready, we don't understand them well enough yet."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "And in terms of analysis tools and guard rails, what they can and can't do and so on, to deploy them at scale, because I think, there are big, still ethical questions like should an AI system always announce that it is an AI system to begin with?"}, {"time": 6592, "text": "What do you do about answering those philosophical questions about the feelings people may have about AI systems, perhaps incorrectly attributed?"}, {"time": 6600, "text": "So I think there's a whole bunch of research that needs to be done first to responsibly, before you can responsibly deploy these systems at scale."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "That will be at least be my current position."}, {"time": 6612, "text": "Over time, I'm very confident we'll have those tools like interpretability questions and analysis questions."}, {"time": 6620, "text": "And then with the ethical quandary, I think there it's important to look beyond just science."}, {"time": 6628, "text": "That's why I think philosophy, social sciences, even theology, other things like that come into it, where arts and humanities, what does it mean to be human and the spirit of being human and to enhance that and the human condition, right?"}, {"time": 6643, "text": "And allow us to experience things we could never experience before and improve the overall human condition and humanity overall, get radical abundance, solve many scientific problems, solve disease."}, {"time": 6654, "text": "So this is the era I think, this is the amazing era I think we're heading into if we do it right."}, {"time": 6659, "text": "But we've got to be careful."}, {"time": 6660, "text": "We've already seen with things like social media, how dual use technologies can be misused by, firstly, by bad actors or naive actors or crazy actors, right, so there's that set of just the common or garden misuse of existing dual use technology."}, {"time": 6678, "text": "And then of course, there's an additional thing that has to be overcome with AI that eventually it may have its own agency."}, {"time": 6684, "text": "So it could be good or bad in and of itself."}, {"time": 6688, "text": "So I think these questions have to be approached very carefully using the scientific method, I would say, in terms of hypothesis generation, careful control testing, not live A, B testing out in the world, because with powerful technologies like AI, if something goes wrong, it may cause a lot of harm before you can fix it."}, {"time": 6709, "text": "It's not like an imaging app or game app where if something goes wrong, it's relatively easy to fix and the harm is relatively small."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "So I think it comes with the usual cliche of, like with a lot of power comes a lot of responsibility."}, {"time": 6725, "text": "And I think that's the case here with things like AI, given the enormous opportunity in front of us."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "And I think we need a lot of voices and as many inputs into things like the design of the systems and the values they should have and what goals should they be put to."}, {"time": 6742, "text": "I think as wide a group of voices as possible beyond just the technologists is needed to input into that and to have a say in that, especially when it comes to deployment of these systems, which is when the rubber really hits the road, it really affects the general person in the street rather than fundamental research."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "And that's why I say, I think as a first step, it would be better if we have the choice to build these systems as tools to give, and I'm not saying that they should never go beyond tools because of course the potential is there for it to go way beyond just tools."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "But I think that would be a good first step in order for us to allow us to carefully experiment and understand what these things can do."}, {"time": 6781, "text": "So the leap between tool, the sentient entity being is one we should take very careful of."}, {"time": 6788, "text": "Let me ask a dark personal question."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "So you're one of the most brilliant people in the AI community, you're also one of the most kind and if I may say sort of loved people in the community."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "That said, creation of a super intelligent AI system would be one of the most powerful things in the world, tools or otherwise."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "And again, as the old saying goes, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely."}, {"time": 6821, "text": "You are likely to be one of the people, I

evil."}, {"time": 6853, "text": "Do you think about this stuff or are we just focused on language model?"}, {"time": 6856, "text": "No, I think about them all the time and I think what are the defenses against that?"}, {"time": 6862, "text": "I think one thing is to remain very grounded and sort of humble, no matter what you do or achieve."}, {"time": 6868, "text": "And I try to do that, my best friends are still my set of friends from my undergraduate Cambridge days, my family's and friends are very important."}, {"time": 6879, "text": "I've always, I think trying to be a

topic again from scratch is a new field is very humbling, right?"}, {"time": 6893, "text": "So for me, that's been biology over the last five years, huge area topic and I just love doing that, but it helps to keep you grounded like it keeps you open minded."}, {"time": 6904, "text": "And then the other important thing is to have a really good, amazing set of people around you at your company or your organization who are also very ethical and grounded themselves and help to keep you that way."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "And then ultimately just to answer your question, I hope we're gonna be a

first."}, {"time": 6957, "text": "I hope we're in the vanguard so we can influence how that goes."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "And I think it matters who builds, which cultures they come from and what values they have, the builders of AI systems."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "Cause I think even though the AI system is gonna learn for itself most of its knowledge, there'll be a residue in the system of

experiment, reading lots of research papers."}, {"time": 7216, "text": "And then perhaps at nighttime, reading science fiction books or playing some games."}, {"time": 7225, "text": "But lots of focus, so like deep focused work on whether it's programming or reading research papers."}, {"time": 7232, "text": "Yes, so that would be lots of deep focus work."}, {"time": 7235, "text": "These days for the last sort of, I guess, five to 10 years, I've actually got quite a structure that works very well for me now, which is that I'm a complete night owl, always have been."}, {"time": 7246, "text": "So I optimize for that."}, {"time": 7247, "text": "So I'll basically do a normal day's work, get into work about 11 o clock and sort of do work to about seven in the office."}, {"time": 7256, "text": "And I will arrange back to back meetings for the entire time of that."}, {"time": 7260, "text": "And with as many, meet as many people as possible."}, {"time": 7263, "text": "So that's my collaboration management part of the day."}, {"time": 7266, "text": "Then I go home, spend time with the family and friends, have dinner, relax a little bit."}, {"time": 7273, "text": "And then I start a second day of work."}, {"time": 7275, "text": "I call it my second day of work around 10 p.m., 11 p.m. And that's the time to about the small hours of the morning, four or five in the morning, where I will do my thinking and reading and research, writing research papers."}, {"time": 7289, "text": "Sadly, I don't have time to code anymore, but it's not efficient to do that these days, given the amount of time I have."}, {"time": 7297, "text": "But that's when I do, you know, maybe do the long kind of stretches of thinking and planning."}, {"time": 7302, "text": "And then probably, you know, using email, other things, I would set, I would fire off a lot of things to my team to deal with the next morning."}, {"time": 7309, "text": "But actually thinking about this overnight, we should go for this project or arrange this meeting the next day."}, {"time": 7314, "text": "When you're thinking through a problem, are you talking about a sheet of paper with a pen?"}, {"time": 7318, "text": "Is there some structured process?"}, {"time": 7321, "text": "I still like pencil and paper best for working out things, but these days it's just so efficient to read research papers just on the screen."}, {"time": 7328, "text": "I still often print them out, actually."}, {"time": 7330, "text": "I still prefer to mark out things."}, {"time": 7332, "text": "And I find it goes into the brain better and sticks in the brain better when you're still using physical pen and pencil and paper."}, {"time": 7339, "text": "So you take notes with the..."}, {"time": 7340, "text": "I have lots of notes, electronic ones, and also whole stacks of notebooks that I use at home, yeah."}, {"time": 7347, "text": "On some of these most challenging next steps, for example, stuff none of us know about that you're working on, you're thinking, there's some deep thinking required there, right?"}, {"time": 7357, "text": "Like what is the right problem?"}, {"time": 7359, "text": "What is the right approach?"}, {"time": 7361, "text": "Because you're gonna have to invest a huge amount of time for the whole team."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "They're going to have to pursue this thing."}, {"time": 7368, "text": "Is RL gonna work here or not?"}, {"time": 7370, "text": "What's the right thing to try?"}, {"time": 7373, "text": "What's the right benchmark to use?"}, {"time": 7375, "text": "Do we need to construct a benchmark from scratch?"}, {"time": 7379, "text": "So I think of all those kinds of things in the nighttime phase, but also much more, I find I've always found the quiet hours of the morning when everyone's asleep, it's super quiet outside."}, {"time": 7391, "text": "I love that time."}, {"time": 7392, "text": "It's the golden hours, like between one and three in the morning."}, {"time": 7396, "text": "Put some music on, some inspiring music on, and then think these deep thoughts."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "So that's when I would read my philosophy books and Spinoza's, my recent favorite can, all these things."}, {"time": 7408, "text": "And I read about a great scientist of history, how they did things, how they thought things."}, {"time": 7415, "text": "So that's when you do all your creative, that's when I do all my creative thinking."}, {"time": 7419, "text": "And it's good, I think people recommend you do your sort of creative thinking in one block."}, {"time": 7425, "text": "And the way I organize the day, that way I don't get interrupted."}, {"time": 7428, "text": "There's obviously no one else is up at those times."}, {"time": 7431, "text": "So I can go, I can sort of get super deep and super into flow."}, {"time": 7437, "text": "The other nice thing about doing it nighttime wise is if I'm really onto something or I've got really deep into something, I can choose to extend it and I'll go into six in the morning, whatever."}, {"time": 7449, "text": "And then I'll just pay for it the next day."}, {"time": 7450, "text": "So I'll be a bit tired and I won't be my best, but that's fine."}, {"time": 7453, "text": "I can decide looking at my schedule the next day and given where I'm at with this particular thought or creative idea that I'm gonna pay that cost the next day."}, {"time": 7462, "text": "So I think that's more flexible than morning people who do that, they get up at four in the morning."}, {"time": 7468, "text": "They can also do those golden hours then, but then their start of their scheduled day starts at breakfast, 8 a.m., whatever they have their first meeting."}, {"time": 7476, "text": "And then it's hard, you have to reschedule a day if you're in flow."}, {"time": 7478, "text": "So I don't have to do that."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "So that could be a true special thread of thoughts that you're too passionate about."}, {"time": 7485, "text": "This is where some of the greatest ideas could potentially come is when you just lose yourself late into the night."}, {"time": 7491, "text": "And for the meetings, I mean, you're loading in really hard problems in a very short amount of time."}, {"time": 7496, "text": "So you have to do some kind of first principles thinking here, it's like, what's the problem?"}, {"time": 7500, "text": "What's the state of things?"}, {"time": 7501, "text": "What's the right next steps?"}, {"time": 7503, "text": "You have to get really good at context switching, which is one of the hardest things, because especially as we do so many things, if you include all the scientific things we do, scientific fields we're working in, these are complex fields in themselves."}, {"time": 7515, "text": "And you have to sort of keep abreast of that."}, {"time": 7518, "text": "But I enjoy it."}, {"time": 7520, "text": "I've always been a sort of generalist in a way."}, {"time": 7523, "text": "And that's actually what happened in my games career after chess."}, {"time": 7527, "text": "One of the reasons I stopped playing chess was because I got into computers, but also I started realizing there were many other great games out there to play too."}, {"time": 7533, "text": "So I've always been that way inclined, multidisciplinary."}, {"time": 7536, "text": "And there's too many interesting things in the world to spend all your time just on one thing."}, {"time": 7541, "text": "So you mentioned Spinoza, gotta ask the big, ridiculously big question about life."}, {"time": 7550, "text": "Why are we humans here?"}, {"time": 7552, "text": "You've already mentioned that perhaps the universe created us."}, {"time": 7556, "text": "Is that why you think we're here?"}, {"time": 7558, "text": "To understand how the universe works?"}, {"time": 7560, "text": "Yeah, I think my answer to that would be, and at least the life I'm living, is to gain and understand the knowledge, to gain knowledge and understand the universe."}, {"time": 7570, "text": "That's what I think, I can't see any higher purpose than that if you think back to the classical Greeks, the virtue of gaining knowledge."}, {"time": 7577, "text": "It's, I think it's one of the few true virtues is to understand the world around us and the context and humanity better."}]}]
