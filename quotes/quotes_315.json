[{"title": "Gary Marcus: Toward a Hybrid of Deep Learning and Symbolic AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #43", "id": "vNOTDn3D_RI", "quotes": [{"time": 316, "text": "And so machines might do that long before they do really good psychological reasoning, because it's easier to get kind of labeled data or to do direct experimentation on a microphone stand than it is to do direct experimentation on human beings to understand the levers that guide them."}, {"time": 334, "text": "That's a really interesting point, actually, whether it's easier to gain common sense knowledge or psychological knowledge."}, {"time": 341, "text": "I would say the common sense knowledge includes both physical knowledge and psychological knowledge."}, {"time": 346, "text": "And the argument I was making."}, {"time": 347, "text": "Well, you said physical versus psychological."}, {"time": 349, "text": "Yeah, physical versus psychological."}, {"time": 351, "text": "And the argument I was making is physical knowledge might be more accessible, because you could have a robot, for example, lift a bottle, try putting a bottle cap on it, see that it falls off if it does this, and see that it could turn it upside down, and so the robot could do some experimentation."}, {"time": 364, "text": "We do some of our psychological reasoning by looking at our own minds."}, {"time": 369, "text": "So I can sort of guess how you might react to something based on how I think I would react to it."}, {"time": 373, "text": "And robots don't have that intuition, and they also can't do experiments on people in the same way or we'll probably shut them down."}, {"time": 380, "text": "So if we wanted to have robots figure out how I respond to pain by pinching me in different ways, like that's probably, it's not gonna make it past the human subjects board and companies are gonna get sued or whatever."}, {"time": 392, "text": "So there's certain kinds of practical experience that are limited or off limits to robots."}, {"time": 399, "text": "That's a really interesting point."}, {"time": 401, "text": "What is more difficult to gain a grounding in?"}, {"time": 407, "text": "Because to play devil's advocate, I would say that human behavior is easier expressed in data and digital form."}, {"time": 416, "text": "And so when you look at Facebook algorithms, they get to observe human behavior."}, {"time": 421, "text": "So you get to study and manipulate even a human behavior in a way that you perhaps cannot study or manipulate the physical world."}, {"time": 429, "text": "So it's true why you said pain is like physical pain, but that's again, the physical world."}, {"time": 436, "text": "Emotional pain might be much easier to experiment with, perhaps unethical, but nevertheless, some would argue it's already going on."}, {"time": 445, "text": "I think that you're right, for example, that Facebook does a lot of experimentation in psychological reasoning."}, {"time": 452, "text": "In fact, Zuckerberg talked about AI at a talk that he gave in NIPS."}, {"time": 458, "text": "I wasn't there, but the conference has been renamed NeurIPS, but he used to be called NIPS when he gave the talk."}, {"time": 463, "text": "And he talked about Facebook basically having a gigantic theory of mind."}, {"time": 467, "text": "So I think it is certainly possible."}, {"time": 469, "text": "I mean, Facebook does some of that."}, {"time": 471, "text": "I think they have a really good idea of how to addict people to things."}, {"time": 473, "text": "They understand what draws people back to things."}, {"time": 476, "text": "I think they exploit it in ways that I'm not very comfortable with."}, {"time": 479, "text": "But even so, I think that there are only some slices of human experience that they can access through the kind of interface they have."}, {"time": 487, "text": "And of course, they're doing all kinds of VR stuff, and maybe that'll change and they'll expand their data."}, {"time": 491, "text": "And I'm sure that that's part of their goal."}, {"time": 494, "text": "So it is an interesting question."}, {"time": 496, "text": "I think love, fear, insecurity, all of the things that, I would say some of the deepest things about human nature and the human mind could be explored through digital form."}, {"time": 510, "text": "It's that you're actually the first person just now that brought up, I wonder what is more difficult."}, {"time": 515, "text": "Because I think folks who are the slow, and we'll talk a lot about deep learning, but the people who are thinking beyond deep learning are thinking about the physical world."}, {"time": 526, "text": "You're starting to think about robotics in the home robotics."}, {"time": 529, "text": "How do we make robots manipulate objects, which requires an understanding of the physical world and then requires common sense reasoning."}, {"time": 537, "text": "And that has felt to be like the next step for common sense reasoning, but you've now brought up the idea that there's also the emotional part."}, {"time": 543, "text": "And it's interesting whether that's hard or easy."}, {"time": 546, "text": "I think some parts of it are and some aren't."}, {"time": 548, "text": "So my company that I recently founded with Rod Brooks, from MIT for many years and so forth, we're interested in both."}, {"time": 557, "text": "We're interested in physical reasoning and psychological reasoning, among many other things."}, {"time": 561, "text": "And there are pieces of each of these that are accessible."}, {"time": 566, "text": "So if you want a robot to figure out whether it can fit under a table, that's a relatively accessible piece of physical reasoning."}, {"time": 573, "text": "If you know the height of the table and you know the height of the robot, it's not that hard."}, {"time": 576, "text": "If you wanted to do physical reasoning about Jenga, it gets a little bit more complicated and you have to have higher resolution data in order to do it."}, {"time": 585, "text": "With psychological reasoning, it's not that hard to know, for example, that people have goals and they like to act on those goals, but it's really hard to know exactly what those goals are."}, {"time": 594, "text": "But ideas of frustration."}, {"time": 596, "text": "I mean, you could argue it's extremely difficult to understand the sources of human frustration as they're playing Jenga with you, or not."}, {"time": 605, "text": "You could argue that it's very accessible."}, {"time": 608, "text": "There's some things that are gonna be obvious and some not."}, {"time": 610, "text": "So I don't think anybody really can do this well yet, but I think it's not inconceivable to imagine machines in the not so distant future being able to understand that if people lose in a game, that they don't like that."}, {"time": 626, "text": "That's not such a hard thing to program and it's pretty consistent across people."}, {"time": 629, "text": "Most people don't enjoy losing and so that makes it relatively easy to code."}, {"time": 634, "text": "On the other hand, if you wanted to capture everything about frustration, well, people can get frustrated for a lot of different reasons."}, {"time": 640, "text": "They might get sexually frustrated, they might get frustrated, they can get their promotion at work, all kinds of different things."}, {"time": 646, "text": "And the more you expand the scope, the harder it is for anything like the existing techniques to really do that."}, {"time": 653, "text": "So I'm talking to Garret Kasparov next week and he seemed pretty frustrated with his game against Deep Blue, so."}, {"time": 658, "text": "Yeah, well, I'm frustrated with my game against him last year, because I played him, I had two excuses, I'll give you my excuses up front, but it won't mitigate the outcome."}, {"time": 667, "text": "I was jet lagged and I hadn't played in 25 or 30 years, but the outcome is he completely destroyed me and it wasn't even close."}, {"time": 674, "text": "Have you ever been beaten in any board game by a machine?"}, {"time": 679, "text": "I have, I actually played the predecessor to Deep Blue."}, {"time": 684, "text": "Deep Thought, I believe it was called, and that too crushed me."}, {"time": 690, "text": "And that was, and after that you realize it's over for us."}, {"time": 695, "text": "Well, there's no point in my playing Deep Blue."}, {"time": 696, "text": "I mean, it's a waste of Deep Blue's computation."}, {"time": 700, "text": "I mean, I played Kasparov because we both gave lectures this same event and he was playing 30 people."}, {"time": 706, "text": "I forgot to mention that."}, {"time": 706, "text": "Not only did he crush me, but he crushed 29 other people at the same time."}, {"time": 710, "text": "I mean, but the actual philosophical and emotional experience of being beaten by a machine, I imagine is a, I mean, to you who thinks about these things may be a profound experience."}, {"time": 723, "text": "Or no, it was a simple mathematical experience."}, {"time": 727, "text": "Yeah, I think a game like chess particularly where you have perfect information, it's two player closed end and there's more computation for the computer, it's no surprise the machine wins."}, {"time": 738, "text": "I mean, I'm not sad when a computer, I'm not sad when a computer calculates a cube root faster than me."}, {"time": 745, "text": "Like, I know I can't win that game."}, {"time": 747, "text": "I'm not gonna try."}, {"time": 748, "text": "Well, with a system like AlphaGo or AlphaZero, do you see a little bit more magic in a system like that even though it's simply playing a board game?"}, {"time": 757, "text": "But because there's a strong learning component?"}, {"time": 759, "text": "You know, I find you should mention that in the context of this conversation because Kasparov and I are working on an article that's gonna be called AI is not magic."}, {"time": 767, "text": "And, you know, neither one of us thinks that it's magic."}, {"time": 770, "text": "And part of the point of this article is that AI is actually a grab bag of different techniques and some of them have, or they each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses."}, {"time": 780, "text": "So, you know, you read media accounts and it's like, ooh, AI, it must be magical or it can solve any problem."}, {"time": 786, "text": "Well, no, some problems are really accessible like chess and go and other problems like reading are completely outside the current technology."}, {"time": 794, "text": "And it's not like you can take the technology, that drives AlphaGo and apply it to reading and get anywhere."}, {"time": 801, "text": "You know, DeepMind has tried that a bit."}, {"time": 803, "text": "They have all kinds of resources."}, {"time": 804, "text": "You know, they built AlphaGo and they have, you know, I wrote a piece recently that they lost and you can argue about the word lost, but they spent $530 million more than they made last year."}, {"time": 814, "text": "So, you know, they're making huge investments."}, {"time": 816, "text": "They have a large budget and they have applied the same kinds of techniques to reading or to language."}, {"time": 823, "text": "It's just much less productive there because it's a fundamentally different kind of problem."}, {"time": 827, "text": "Chess and go and so forth are closed end problems."}, {"time": 830, "text": "The rules haven't changed in 2,500 years."}, {"time": 832, "text": "There's only so many moves you can make."}, {"time": 834, "text": "You can talk about the exponential as you look at the combinations of moves, but fundamentally, you know, the go board has 361 squares."}, {"time": 842, "text": "That's the only, you know, those intersections are the only places that you can place your stone."}, {"time": 847, "text": "Whereas when you're reading, the next sentence could be anything."}, {"time": 851, "text": "You know, it's completely up to the writer what they're gonna do next."}, {"time": 854, "text": "That's fascinating that you think this way."}, {"time": 856, "text": "You're clearly a brilliant mind who points out the emperor has no clothes, but so I'll play the role of a person who says."}, {"time": 862, "text": "You're gonna put clothes on the emperor?"}, {"time": 863, "text": "Good luck with it."}, {"time": 864, "text": "It romanticizes the notion of the emperor, period, suggesting that clothes don't even matter."}, {"time": 870, "text": "Okay, so that's really interesting that you're talking about language."}, {"time": 876, "text": "So there's the physical world of being able to move about the world, making an omelet and coffee and so on."}, {"time": 881, "text": "There's language where you first understand what's being written and then maybe even more complicated than that, having a natural dialogue."}, {"time": 891, "text": "And then there's the game of go and chess."}, {"time": 893, "text": "I would argue that language is much closer to go than it is to the physical world."}, {"time": 899, "text": "Like it is still very constrained."}, {"time": 901, "text": "When you say the possibility of the number of sentences that could come, it is huge, but it nevertheless is much more constrained."}, {"time": 909, "text": "It feels maybe I'm wrong than the possibilities that the physical world brings us."}, {"time": 914, "text": "There's something to what you say in some ways in which I disagree."}, {"time": 917, "text": "So one interesting thing about language is that it abstracts away."}, {"time": 923, "text": "This bottle, I don't know if it would be in the field of view is on this table and I use the word on here and I can use the word on here, maybe not here, but that one word encompasses in analog space sort of infinite number of possibilities."}, {"time": 939, "text": "So there is a way in which language filters down the variation of the world and there's other ways."}, {"time": 946, "text": "So we have a grammar and more or less you have to follow the rules of that grammar."}, {"time": 951, "text": "You can break them a little bit, but by and large we follow the rules of grammar and so that's a constraint on language."}, {"time": 957, "text": "So there are ways in which language is a constrained system."}, {"time": 959, "text": "On the other hand, there are many arguments that say there's an infinite number of possible sentences and you can establish that by just stacking them up."}, {"time": 967, "text": "So I think there's water on the table, you think that I think there's water on the table, your mother thinks that you think that I think that water's on the table, your brother thinks that maybe your mom is wrong to think that you think that I think, right?"}, {"time": 978, "text": "So we can make sentences of infinite length or we can stack up adjectives."}, {"time": 983, "text": "This is a very silly example, a very, very silly example, a very, very, very, very, very, very silly example and so forth."}, {"time": 989, "text": "So there are good arguments that there's an infinite range of sentences."}, {"time": 992, "text": "In any case, it's vast by any reasonable measure and for example, almost anything in the physical world we can talk about in the language world and interestingly, many of the sentences that we understand, we can only understand if we have a very rich model of the physical world."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "So I don't ultimately want to adjudicate the debate that I think you just set up, but I find it interesting."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "Maybe the physical world is even more complicated than language, I think that's fair, but."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "Language is really, really complicated."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "It's really, really hard."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "Well, it's really, really hard for machines, for linguists, people trying to understand it."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "It's not that hard for children and that's part of what's driven my whole career."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "I was a student of Steven Pinker's and we were trying to figure out why kids could learn language when machines couldn't."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "I think we're gonna get into language, we're gonna get into communication intelligence and neural networks and so on, but let me return to the high level, the futuristic for a brief moment."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "So you've written in your book, in your new book, it would be arrogant to suppose that we could forecast where AI will be or the impact it will have in a thousand years or even 500 years."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "So let me ask you to be arrogant."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "What do AI systems with or without physical bodies look like 100 years from now?"}, {"time": 1073, "text": "If you would just, you can't predict, but if you were to philosophize and imagine, do."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "Can I first justify the arrogance before you try to push me beyond it?"}, {"time": 1085, "text": "I mean, there are examples like, people figured out how electricity worked, they had no idea that that was gonna lead to cell phones."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "I mean, things can move awfully fast once new technologies are perfected."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "Even when they made transistors, they weren't really thinking that cell phones would lead to social networking."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "There are nevertheless predictions of the future, which are statistically unlikely to come to be, but nevertheless is the best."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "You're asking me to be wrong."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "Asking you to be statistically."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "In which way would I like to be wrong?"}, {"time": 1114, "text": "Pick the least unlikely to be wrong thing, even though it's most very likely to be wrong."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "I mean, here's some things that we can safely predict, I suppose."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "We can predict that AI will be faster than it is now."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "It will be cheaper than it is now."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "It will be better in the sense of being more general and applicable in more places."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "It will be pervasive."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "I mean, these are easy predictions."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "I'm sort of modeling them in my head on Jeff Bezos's famous predictions."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "He says, I can't predict the future, not in every way, I'm paraphrasing."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "But I can predict that people will never wanna pay more money for their stuff."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "They're never gonna want it to take longer to get there."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "So you can't predict everything, but you can predict something."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "Sure, of course it's gonna be faster and better."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "But what we can't really predict is the full scope of where AI will be in a certain period."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "I mean, I think it's safe to say that, although I'm very skeptical about current AI, that it's possible to do much better."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "You know, there's no in principled argument that says AI is an insolvable problem, that there's magic inside our brains that will never be captured."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "I mean, I've heard people make those kind of arguments."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "I don't think they're very good."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "So AI's gonna come, and probably 500 years is plenty to get there."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "And then once it's here, it really will change everything."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "So when you say AI's gonna come, are you talking about human level intelligence?"}, {"time": 1203, "text": "So maybe I..."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "I like the term general intelligence."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "So I don't think that the ultimate AI, if there is such a thing, is gonna look just like humans."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "I think it's gonna do some things that humans do better than current machines, like reason flexibly."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "And understand language and so forth."}, {"time": 1221, "text": "But it doesn't mean they have to be identical to humans."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "So for example, humans have terrible memory, and they suffer from what some people call motivated reasoning."}, {"time": 1229, "text": "So they like arguments that seem to support them, and they dismiss arguments that they don't like."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "There's no reason that a machine should ever do that."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "So you see that those limitations of memory as a bug, not a feature."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "One is I was on a panel with Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, last night, and we were talking about this stuff."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "And I think what we converged on is that humans are a low bar to exceed."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "They may be outside of our skill right now, but as AI programmers, but eventually AI will exceed it."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "So we're not talking about human level AI."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "We're talking about general intelligence that can do all kinds of different things and do it without some of the flaws that human beings have."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "The other thing I'll say is I wrote a whole book, actually, about the flaws of humans."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "It's actually a nice bookend to the, or counterpoint to the current book."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "So I wrote a book called Cluj, which was about the limits of the human mind."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "The current book is kind of about those few things that humans do a lot better than machines."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Do you think it's possible that the flaws of the human mind, the limits of memory, our mortality, our bias, is a strength, not a weakness, that that is the thing that enables, from which motivation springs and meaning springs or not?"}, {"time": 1307, "text": "I've heard a lot of arguments like this."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "I've never found them that convincing."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "I think that there's a lot of making lemonade out of lemons."}, {"time": 1315, "text": "So we, for example, do a lot of free association where one idea just leads to the next and they're not really that well connected."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "And we enjoy that and we make poetry out of it and we make kind of movies with free associations and it's fun and whatever."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "I don't think that's really a virtue of the system."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "I think that the limitations in human reasoning actually get us in a lot of trouble."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Like, for example, politically we can't see eye to eye because we have the motivational reasoning I was talking about and something related called confirmation bias."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "So we have all of these problems that actually make for a rougher society because we can't get along because we can't interpret the data in shared ways."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "And then we do some nice stuff with that."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "So my free associations are different from yours and you're kind of amused by them and that's great."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "And hence poetry."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "So there are lots of ways in which we take a lousy situation and make it good."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "Another example would be our memories are terrible."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "So we play games like Concentration where you flip over two cards, try to find a pair."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Can you imagine a computer playing that?"}, {"time": 1376, "text": "Computer's like, this is the dullest game in the world."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "I know where all the cards are, I see it once, I know where it is, what are you even talking about?"}, {"time": 1382, "text": "So we make a fun game out of having this terrible memory."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "So we are imperfect in discovering and optimizing some kind of utility function."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "But you think in general, there is a utility function."}, {"time": 1396, "text": "There's an objective function that's better than others."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "I didn't say that."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "But see, the presumption, when you say..."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "I think you could design a better memory system."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "You could argue about utility functions and how you wanna think about that."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "But objectively, it would be really nice to do some of the following things."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "To get rid of memories that are no longer useful."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "Objectively, that would just be good."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And we're not that good at it."}, {"time": 1423, "text": "So when you park in the same lot every day, you confuse where you parked today with where you parked yesterday with where you parked the day before and so forth."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So you blur together a series of memories."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "There's just no way that that's optimal."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "I mean, I've heard all kinds of wacky arguments of people trying to defend that."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "But in the end of the day, I don't think any of them hold water."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "It's just above."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "Or memories of traumatic events would be possibly a very nice feature to have to get rid of those."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "It'd be great if you could just be like, I'm gonna wipe this sector."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "I'm done with that."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "I didn't have fun last night."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "I don't wanna think about it anymore."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "Whoop, bye bye."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "I'm gone."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "But we can't."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "Do you think it's possible to build a system..."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "So you said human level intelligence is a weird concept, but... Well, I'm saying I prefer general intelligence."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "General intelligence."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "I mean, human level intelligence is a real thing."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "And you could try to make a machine that matches people or something like that."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "I'm saying that per se shouldn't be the objective, but rather that we should learn from humans the things they do well and incorporate that into our AI, just as we incorporate the things that machines do well that people do terribly."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "So, I mean, it's great that

the movie, but there's a huge range of things that pretty much any ordinary adult can understand."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "His argument is, is that actually, the set of things seems large for us

discussing it now is very intuitive."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "It makes a lot of sense that that is something we should have and that's something deep learning systems don't have."}, {"time": 1845,

problems."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "A lot of people aren't actually gonna read my book."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "But if they did read the book, one of the things that might come as a surprise to them is that we actually say common sense is really hard and really complicated."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "So they would probably, my critics know that I like common sense, but that chapter actually starts by us beating up not on deep learning, but kind of on our own home team as it will."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "So Ernie and I are first and foremost people that believe in at least some of what

vessel, let's say."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "And I know a vessel is an object and objects are material things in the physical world."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "So I can make some inferences."},

order to carry its contents."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "So you can do hierarchical inference and so forth."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "And we say that's great, but it's only a tiny piece of what you need for common sense."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "We give lots of examples that don't fit into that."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So another one that we talk about is a cheese grater."}, {"time": 1946,

it actually work."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "Do you think these ideas are just abstractions that could emerge on a system like a very large deep neural network?"}, {"time": 1979, "text": "I'm a skeptic that that kind of emergence per se can work."}, {"time": 1983, "text": "So I think that deep learning might play a role in the systems that do what I want systems to do, but it won't do it by itself."}, {"time": 1989, "text": "I've never seen a deep learning system really extract an abstract concept."}, {"time": 1995, "text": "What they do, principled reasons for that stemming from how back propagation works, how the architectures are set up."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "One example is deep learning people actually all build in something called convolution, which Jan Lacune is famous for, which is an abstraction."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "They don't have their systems learn this."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "So the abstraction is an object that looks the same if it appears in different places."}, {"time": 2019, "text": "And what Lacune figured out and why, essentially why he was a co winner of the Turing Award was that if you programmed this in innately, then your system would be a whole lot more efficient."}, {"time": 2030, "text": "In principle, this should be learnable, but people don't have systems that kind of reify things and make them more abstract."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And so what you'd really wind up with if you don't program that in advance is a system that kind of realizes that this is the same thing as this, but then I take your little clock there

like, it's an innate feature that's programmed by the human expert."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "We need more of those, not less."}, {"time": 2061, "text": "Yes, but the nice feature is it feels like that requires coming up with that brilliant idea, can get you a Turing Award, but it requires less effort than encoding and something we'll talk about, the expert system."}, {"time": 2076, "text": "So encoding a lot of knowledge by hand."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "So it feels like there's a huge amount of limitations which you clearly outline with deep learning, but the nice feature of deep learning, whatever it is able to accomplish, it does a lot of stuff automatically without human intervention."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "Well, and that's part of why people love it, right?"}, {"time": 2097, "text": "But I always think of this quote from Bertrand Russell, which is it has all the advantages of theft over honest toil."}, {"time": 2104, "text": "It's really hard to program into a

it."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "But on that way of doing it, it's really hard work to do something as simple as understanding containers."}, {"time": 2150, "text": "And nobody wants to do that hard
