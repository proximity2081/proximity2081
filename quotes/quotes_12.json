set of function is set of function which has small capacity or small diversity, small VC dimension example."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Which contain good function inside."}, {"time": 1117, "text":

describe VC?"}, {"time": 1132, "text": "So, when you have a machine."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "So, machine capable to pick up one function from the admissible set of function."}, {"time": 1142,

pick up function."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "But it can be small."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "Small, we call it capacity but maybe better called diversity."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "So, not very different function in the set."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "It's infinite set of function but not very diverse."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "So, it is small VC dimension."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "When VC dimension is small, you need small amount of training data."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "So, the goal is to create admissible set of functions which is have small VC dimension and contain good function."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "Then you will be able to pick up the function using small amount of observations."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "So, that is the task of learning?"}, {"time": 1207,

formulated yesterday."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Statistical learning theory does not involve in creating admissible set of function."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "In classical learning theory, everywhere, 100% in textbook, the set of function, admissible set of function is given."}, {"time": 1239, "text": "But this is science about nothing because the most difficult problem to create admissible set of functions given, say, a lot of functions, continuum set of function, create admissible set of functions."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "That means that it has finite VC dimension, small VC dimension and contain good function."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "So, this was out of consideration."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "So, what's the process of doing that?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "I mean, it's fascinating."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "What is the process of creating this admissible set of functions?"}, {"time": 1273, "text": "That is invariant."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "That's invariant."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "Yeah, you're looking of properties of training data and properties means that you have some function and you just count what is value, average value of function on training data."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "You have model and what is expectation of this function on the model and they should coincide."}, {"time": 1306, "text": "So, the problem is about how to pick up functions."}, {"time": 1311, "text": "It can be any function."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "In fact, it is true for all functions."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "But because when we're talking, say, duck does not jumping, so you don't ask question jump like a duck because it is trivial."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "It does not jumping and doesn't help you to recognize jump."}, {"time": 1336,

this illness, this disease."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "It is legal."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "So, there is a general type of predicate looks like and special type of predicate, which related to this

wrong degree of power that AlphaGo has, for example, the word reasoning is a powerful word."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "So let me ask you, sort of, you were part of the symbolic AI world for a while,

say, yeah, it's not quite as simple as that."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "So the AI winter for the first winter that was actually named as such was the one in the late 80s."}, {"time": 1251, "text":

expensive Lisp machine workstations, which were literally between $50,000 and $100,000 in 1980s money, which would be like between $150,000 and $300,000 per workstation in current prices."}, {"time":

kind of very visible failure in some of the major application areas."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "And I think self driving cars would be the flagship."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "And I think when you

about eight nines of reliability, right?"}, {"time": 1530, "text": "Now, if your vision system only detects 98.3% of the vehicles, right, then that's sort of, you know, one in a bit nines of

then you had a classical 1970s rule based expert system telling you, okay, if you're in the middle lane and there's a bicyclist in the right lane who is signaling this, then you do that, right?"},

traffic circle and there's a little girl riding her bicycle the wrong way around the traffic circle."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "Okay, what do you do?"}, {"time": 1630, "text": "We don't have a rule."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "Oh my God."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "Okay, stop."}, {"time": 1634, "text": "And then, you know, they come back and add more rules and they just found that this was not really converging."}, {"time": 1640, "text": "And if you think about it, right, how do you deal with an unexpected situation, meaning one that you've never previously encountered and the sort of

desirable the outcomes are and then pick the right one."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "You know, in the 90s, we were saying, okay, this is how you're going to have to do automated vehicles."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "They're going to have to have a look ahead capability, but the look ahead for driving is more difficult than it is for chess because there's humans and they're less predictable than chess pieces."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "Well, then you have an opponent in chess who's also somewhat unpredictable."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "But for example, in chess, you always know the opponent's intention."}, {"time": 1703, "text": "They're trying to beat you, right?"}, {"time": 1709, "text": "Whereas in driving, you don't know is this guy trying to turn left or has he just forgotten to turn off his turn signal or is he drunk or is he changing the channel on his radio or whatever it might be."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "You've got to try and figure out the mental state, the intent of the other drivers to forecast the possible evolutions of their trajectories."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "And then you've got to figure out, okay, which is the trajectory for me that's going to be safest."}, {"time": 1740, "text": "And those all interact with each other because the other drivers are going to react to your trajectory and so on."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "So, you know, they've got the classic merging onto the freeway problem where you're kind of racing a vehicle that's already on the freeway and you're going to pull ahead of them or you're going to let them go first and pull in behind and you get this sort of uncertainty about who's going first."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "So all those kinds of things mean that you need a decision making architecture that's very different from either a rule based system or it seems to me kind of an end to end neural network system."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "So just as AlphaGo is pretty good when it doesn't do any look ahead, but it's way, way, way, way better when it does, I think the same is going to be true for driving."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "You can have a driving system that's pretty good when it doesn't do any look ahead, but that's not good enough."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "And we've already seen multiple deaths caused by poorly designed machine learning algorithms that don't really understand what they're doing."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "On several levels, I think on the perception side, there's mistakes being made by those algorithms where the perception is very shallow."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "On the planning side, the look ahead, like you said, and the thing that we come up against that's really interesting when you try to deploy systems in the real world is you can't think of an artificial intelligence system as a thing that responds to the world always."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "You have to realize that it's an agent that others will respond to as well."}, {"time": 1841,

the invisible car."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "It doesn't work that way."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "I mean, but you have to assert yet others have to be scared of you."}, {"time": 1853, "text": "Just we're all, there's this tension, there's this game."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "So if we study a lot of work with pedestrians, if you approach pedestrians as purely an obstacle avoidance, so you're doing look ahead as in modeling the intent that they're not going to, they're going to take advantage of you."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "They're not going to respect you at all."}, {"time": 1875,

something."}, {"time": 2656, "text": "So it's going to defer because it wants to be doing what we really want."}, {"time": 2660, "text": "And that point, I think, is absolutely central to solving the control problem."}, {"time": 2670, "text": "And it's a different kind of AI when you take away this idea that the objective is known, then in fact, a lot of the theoretical frameworks that we're so

a more complicated problem because now the interaction with the human becomes part of the problem."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "Because the human by making choices is giving you more information about

dance music."}, {"time": 762, "text": "You could say Avicii."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Avicii was one of the biggest in this genre."}, {"time": 766, "text": "So the main constraint is of time."}, {"time": 769, "text": "Something like a three, four, five minute song."}, {"time": 772, "text": "So you could have songs that were eight minutes, 10 minutes and so forth."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Because it started as a digital product that you downloaded."}, {"time": 781, "text": "So you didn't have this constraint anymore."}, {"time": 783, "text": "So I think it's something really interesting that I don't think has fully happened yet."}, {"time": 788, "text": "We're kind of jumping ahead a little bit to where we are, but I think there's tons of format innovation in music that should happen now, that couldn't happen when you needed to really adhere to the distribution constraints."}, {"time": 800, "text": "If you didn't adhere to that, you would get no distribution."}, {"time": 810, "text": "That was very expensive."}, {"time": 813, "text": "Even though the app store has great distribution, she gets nowhere near the distribution versus staying within the three minute format."}, {"time": 819, "text": "So I think now that music is fully digital inside these streaming services, there is the opportunity to change the format again and allow creators to be much more creative without limiting their distribution ability."}, {"time": 832, "text": "That's interesting that you're right."}, {"time": 834, "text": "It's surprising that we don't see that taken advantage more often."}, {"time": 839, "text": "It's almost like the constraints of the distribution from the 50s and 60s have molded the culture to where we want the five, three to five minute song than anything else, not just."}, {"time": 852, "text": "So we want the song as consumers and as artists, because I write a lot of music and I never even thought about writing something longer than 10 minutes."}, {"time": 863, "text": "It's really interesting that those constraints."}, {"time": 866, "text": "Because all your training data has been three and a half minute songs, right?"}, {"time": 870, "text": "Okay, so yes, digitization of data led to then mp3s."}, {"time": 876, "text": "Yeah, so I think you had this file then that was distributed physically, but then you had the components of digital distribution and then the internet happened and there was this vacuum where you had a format that could be digitally shipped, but there was no business model."}, {"time": 891, "text": "And then all these pirate networks happened, Napster and in Pirate Island."}, {"time": 898, "text": "Napster and in Sweden Pirate Bay, which was one of the biggest."}, {"time": 902, "text": "And I think from a consumer point of view, which kind of leads up to the inception of Spotify, from a consumer point of view, consumers for the first time had this access model to music where they could, without kind of any marginal cost, they could try different tracks."}, {"time": 925, "text": "You could use music in new ways."}, {"time": 927, "text": "There was no marginal cost."}, {"time": 928, "text": "And that was a fantastic consumer experience to have access to all the music ever made, I think was fantastic."}, {"time": 934, "text": "But it was also horrible for artists because there was no business model around it."}, {"time": 938, "text": "So they didn't make any money."}, {"time": 939, "text": "So the user need almost drove the user interface before there was a business model."}, {"time": 946, "text": "And then there were these download stores that allowed you to download files, which was a solution, but it didn't solve the access problem."}, {"time": 955, "text": "There was still a marginal cost of 99 cents to try one more track."}, {"time": 958, "text": "And I think that that heavily limits how you listen to music."}, {"time": 961, "text": "The example I always give is, you know, in Spotify, a huge amount of people listen to music while they sleep, while they go to sleep and while they sleep."}, {"time": 971, "text": "If that costed you 99 cents per three minutes, you probably wouldn't do that."}, {"time": 975, "text": "And you would be much less adventurous if there was a real dollar cost to exploring music."}, {"time": 979, "text": "So the access model is interesting in that it changes your music behavior."}, {"time": 982, "text": "You can be, you can take much more risk because there's no marginal cost to it."}, {"time": 987, "text": "Maybe let me linger on piracy for a second, because I find, especially coming from Russia, piracy is something that's very interesting to me."}, {"time": 999, "text": "Not me, of course, ever, but I have friends who have partook in piracy of music, software, TV shows, sporting events."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And usually to me, what that shows is not that they're, they can actually pay the money and they're not trying to save money."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "They're choosing the best experience."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "So what to me, piracy shows is a business opportunity in all these domains."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "And that's where I think you're right."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "Spotify stepped in is basically piracy was an experience."}, {"time": 1035, "text": "You can explore with fine music you like, and actually the interface of piracy is horrible because it's, I mean, it's bad metadata, long download times, all kinds of stuff."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "And what Spotify does is basically first rewards artists and second makes the experience of exploring music much better."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "I mean, the same is true, I think for movies and so on."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "That piracy reveals in the software space, for example, I'm a huge user and fan of Adobe products and there was much more incentive to pirate Adobe products before they went to a monthly subscription plan."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "And now all of the said friends that used to pirate Adobe products that I know now actually pay gladly for the monthly subscription."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "Yeah, I think you're right."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "I think it's a sign of an opportunity for product development."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "And that sometimes there's a product market fit before there's a business model fit in product development."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "I think that's a sign of it."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "In Sweden, I think it was a bit of both."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "There was a culture where we even had a political party called the Pirate Party."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And this was during the time when people said that information should be free."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "It was somehow wrong to charge for ones and zeros."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "So I think people felt that artists should probably make some money somehow else and concerts or something."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So at least in Sweden, it was part really social acceptance, even at the political level."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "But that also forced Spotify to compete with free, which I don't think would actually could have happened anywhere else in the world."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "The music industry needed to be doing bad enough to take that risk."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "And Sweden was like the perfect testing ground."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "It had government funded high bandwidth, low latency broadband, which meant that the product would work."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "And it was also there was no music revenue anyway."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "So they were kind of like, I don't think this is going to work, but why not?"}, {"time": 1158, "text": "So this product is one that I don't think could have happened in America, the world's largest music market, for example."}, {"time": 1163, "text": "So how do you compete with free?"}, {"time": 1165, "text": "Because that's an interesting world of the internet where most people don't like to pay for things."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "So Spotify steps in and tries to, yes, compete with free."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "How do you do it?"}, {"time": 1177, "text": "So I think two things."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "One is people are starting to pay for things on the internet."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "I think one way to think about it was that advertising was the first business model because no one would put a credit card on the internet."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Transactional with Amazon was the second."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "And maybe subscription is the third."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And if you look offline, subscription is the biggest of those."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "So that may still happen."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "I think people are starting to pay for things."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "But definitely back then, we needed to compete with free."}, {"time": 1202, "text": "And the first thing you need to do is obviously to lower the price to free and then you need to be better somehow."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "And the way that Spotify was better was on the user experience, on the actual performance, the latency of, you know, even if you had high bandwidth broadband, it would still take you 30 seconds to a minute to download one of these tracks."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "So the Spotify experience of starting within the perceptual limit of immediacy, about 250 milliseconds, meant that the whole trick was it felt as if you had downloaded all of Pirate Bay."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "It was on your hard drive."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "It was that fast, even though it wasn't."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "And it was still free."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "But somehow you were actually still being a legal citizen."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And that was the trick that Spotify managed to pull off."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "So I've actually heard you say this or write this."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And I was surprised that I wasn't aware of it because I just took it for granted."}, {"time": 1262, "text": "You know, whenever an awesome thing comes along, you're just like, of course, it has to be this way."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "That's exactly right."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "That it felt like the entire world's libraries at my fingertips because of that latency being reduced."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "What was the technical challenge in reducing the latency?"}, {"time": 1278, "text": "So there was a group of really, really talented engineers, one of them called Ludwig Strigius."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "He wrote the, actually from Gothenburg, he wrote the initial, the uTorrent client, which is kind of an interesting backstory to Spotify, that we have one of the top developers from uTorrent clients as well."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "So he wrote uTorrent, the world's smallest uTorrent client."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "And then he was acquired very early by Daniel and Martin, who founded Spotify, and they actually sold the uTorrent client to BitTorrent, but kept Ludwig."}, {"time": 1313, "text": "So Spotify had a lot of experience within peer to peer networking."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "So the original innovation was a distribution innovation, where Spotify built an end to end media distribution system up until only a few years ago, we actually hosted all the music ourselves."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "So we had both the service side and the client, and that meant that we could do things such as having a peer to peer solution to use local caching on the client side, because back then the world was mostly desktop."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "But we could also do things like hack the TCP protocols, things like Nagel's algorithm for kind of exponential back off, or ramp up and just go full throttle and optimize for latency at the cost of bandwidth."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "And all of this end to end control meant that we could do an experience that felt like a step change."}, {"time": 1360, "text": "These days, we actually are on GCP, we don't host our own stuff, and everyone is really fast these days."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "So that was the initial competitive advantage."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "But then obviously, you have to move on over time."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "And that was over 10 years ago, right?"}, {"time": 1374, "text": "That was in 2008."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "The product was launched in Sweden."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "It was in a beta, I think, 2007."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "And it was on the desktop, right?"}, {"time": 1380, "text": "It was desktop only."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "There's no phone."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "There was no phone."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "The iPhone came out in 2008."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "But the App Store came out one year later, I think."}, {"time": 1390, "text": "So the writing was on the wall, but there was no phone yet."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "You've mentioned that people would use Spotify to discover the songs they like, and then they would torrent those songs to so they can copy it to their phone."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "Not torrent, pirate."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "Seriously, piracy does seem to be like a good guide for business models."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "Video content."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "As far as I know, Spotify doesn't have video content."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "Well, we do have music videos, and we do have videos on the service."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "But the way we think about ourselves is that we're an audio service, and we think that if you look at the amount of time that people spend on audio, it's actually very similar to the amount of time that people spend on music."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "It's very similar to the amount of time that people spend on video."}, {"time": 1438, "text": "So the opportunity should be equally big."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "But today, it's not at all valued."}, {"time": 1443, "text": "Videos value much higher."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "So we think it's basically completely undervalued."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "So we think of ourselves as an audio service."}, {"time": 1450, "text": "But within that audio service, I think video can make a lot of sense."}, {"time": 1454, "text": "I think when you're discovering an artist, you probably do want to see them and understand who they are, to understand their identity."}, {"time": 1461, "text": "You won't see that video every time."}, {"time": 1462, "text": "90% of the time, the phone is going to be in your pocket."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "For podcasters, you use video."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "I think that can make a ton of sense."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "So we do have video, but we're an audio service where, think of it as we call it internally, backgroundable video."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Video that is helpful, but isn't the driver of the narrative."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "I think also, if we look at YouTube, there's quite a few folks who listen to music on YouTube."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "So in some sense, YouTube is a bit of a competitor to Spotify, which is very strange to me that people use YouTube to listen to music."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "They play essentially the music videos, right?"}, {"time": 1500, "text": "But don't watch the videos and put it in their pocket."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "Well, I think it's similar to what, strangely, maybe it's similar to what we were for the piracy networks, where YouTube, for historical reasons, have a lot of music videos."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "So people use YouTube for a lot of the discovery part of the process, I think."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "But then it's not a really good sort of, quote unquote, MP3 player, because it doesn't even background."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "Then you have to keep the app in the foreground."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "So it's not a good consumption tool, but it's a decently good discovery."}, {"time": 1536, "text": "I mean, I think YouTube is a fantastic product."}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And I use it for all kinds of purposes."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "If I were to admit something, I do use YouTube a little bit to assist in the discovery process of songs."}, {"time": 1547, "text": "And then if I like it, I'll add it to Spotify."}, {"time": 1550, "text": "But that's OK. That's OK with us."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "OK, so sorry, we're jumping around a little bit."}, {"time": 1555, "text": "So it's kind of incredible."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "You look at Napster, you look at the early days of Spotify."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "One fascinating point is how do you grow a user base?"}, {"time": 1566, "text": "So you're there in Sweden."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "You have an idea."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "I saw the initial sketches that look terrible."}, {"time": 1574, "text": "How do you grow a user base from a few folks to millions?"}, {"time": 1579, "text": "I think there are a bunch of tactical answers."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "So first of all, I think you need a great product."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "I don't think you take a bad product and market it to be successful."}, {"time": 1590, "text": "So you need a great product."}, {"time": 1591, "text": "But sorry to interrupt, but it's a totally new way to listen to music, too."}, {"time": 1594, "text": "So it's not just did people realize immediately that Spotify is a great product?"}, {"time": 1598, "text": "No, I think they did."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So back to the point of piracy, it was a totally new way to listen to music legally."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "But people had been used to the access model in Sweden and the rest of the world for a long time through piracy."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "So one way to think about Spotify, it was just legal and fast piracy."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And so people have been using it for a long time."}, {"time": 1616, "text": "So they weren't alien to it."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "They didn't really understand how it could be illegal because it seemed too fast and too good to be true, which I think is a great product proposition if you can be too good to be true."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "But what I saw again and again was people showing each other, clicking the song, showing how fast it started and say, can you believe this?"}, {"time": 1633, "text": "So I really think it was about speed."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "Then we also had an invite program that was really meant for scaling because we hosted our own service."}, {"time": 1643, "text": "We needed to control scaling."}, {"time": 1645, "text": "But that built a lot of expectation."}, {"time": 1647, "text": "And I don't want to say hype because hype implies that it wasn't true."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "Excitement around the product."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "And we've replicated that when we launched in the US."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "We also built up an invite only program first."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "There are lots of tactics, but I think you need a great product to solve some problem."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "And basically the key innovation, there was technology, but on a meta level, the innovation was really the access model versus the ownership model."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "And that was tricky."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "A lot of people said that they wanted to be able to do it."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "I mean, they wanted to own their music."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "They would never kind of rent it or borrow it."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "But I think the fact that we had a free tier, which meant that you get to keep this music for life as well, helped quite a lot."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "So this is an interesting psychological point that maybe you can speak to."}, {"time": 1698, "text": "It was a big shift for me."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "It's almost like I had to go to therapy for this."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "I think I would describe my early listening experience, and I think a lot of my friends do, as basically hoarding music."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "As you're like slowly, one song by one song, or maybe albums, gathering a collection of music that you love."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "And you own it."}, {"time": 1722, "text": "It's like often, especially with CDs or tape, you like physically had it."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "And what Spotify, what I had to come to grips with, it was kind of liberating actually, is to throw away all the music."}, {"time": 1735, "text": "I've had this therapy session with lots of people."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "And I think the mental trick is, so actually we've seen the user data."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "When Spotify started, a lot of people did the exact same thing."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "They started hoarding as if the music would disappear."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "Almost the equivalent of downloading."}, {"time": 1750, "text": "And so we had these playlists that had limits of like a few hundred thousand tracks."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "We figured no one will ever."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "Well, they do."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "Nuts and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tracks."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "And to this day, some people want to actually save, quote unquote, and then play the entire catalog."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "But I think the therapy session goes something like instead of throwing away your music, if you took your files and you stored them in the locker at Google, it'd be a streaming service."}, {"time": 1779, "text": "It's just that in that locker, you have all the world's music now for free."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "So instead of giving away your music, you got all the music."}, {"time": 1786, "text": "You could think of it as having a copy of the world's catalog there forever."}, {"time": 1790, "text": "So you actually got more music instead of less."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "It's just that you just took that hard disk and you sent it to someone who stored it for you."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "And once you go through that mental journey, I'm like, it's still my files."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "They're just over there."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "And I just have 40 million or 50 million or something now."}, {"time": 1805, "text": "Then people are like, OK, that's good."}, {"time": 1807, "text": "The problem is, I think, because you paid us a subscription, if we hadn't had the free tier where you would feel like, even if I don't want to pay anymore, I still get to keep them."}, {"time": 1817, "text": "You keep your playlist forever."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "They don't disappear even though you stop paying."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "I think that was really important."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "If we would have started as, you know, you can put in all this time, but if you stop paying, you lose all your work."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "I think that would have been a big challenge and was the big challenge for a lot of our competitors."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "That's another reason why I think the free tier is really important."}, {"time": 1834, "text": "That people need to feel the security, that the work they put in, it will never disappear, even if they decide not to pay."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "I like how you put the work you put in."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "I actually stopped even thinking of it that way."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "I just actually Spotify taught me to just enjoy music as opposed to."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "As opposed to what I was doing before, which is like in an unhealthy way, hoarding music."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "Which I found that because I was doing that, I was listening to a small selection of songs way too much to where I was getting sick of them."}, {"time": 1867, "text": "Whereas Spotify, the more liberating kind of approach is I was just enjoying."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "Of course, I listened to Stairway to Heaven over and over, but because of the extra variety, I don't get as sick of them."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "There's an interesting statistic I saw."}, {"time": 1881, "text": "So Spotify has, maybe you can correct me, but over 50 million songs, tracks, and over 3 billion playlists."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "So 50 million songs and 3 billion playlists."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "60 times more playlist songs."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "What do you make of that?"}, {"time": 1900, "text": "So the way I think about it is that from a statistician or machine learning point of view, you have all these, if you want to think about reinforcement learning, you have this state space of all the tracks."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "You can take different journeys through this world."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "I think of these as people helping themselves and each other, creating interesting vectors through this space of tracks."}, {"time": 1928, "text": "And then it's not so surprising that across many tens of millions of atomic units, there will be billions of paths that make sense."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And we're probably pretty quite far away from having found all of them."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "So kind of our job now is users, when Spotify started, it was really a search box that was for the time pretty powerful."}, {"time": 1950, "text": "And then I'd like to refer to it as this programming language called playlisting, where if you, as you probably were pretty good at music, you knew your new releases, you knew your back catalog, you knew your star with the heaven, you could create a soundtrack for yourself using this playlisting tool, this like meta programming language for music to soundtrack your life."}, {"time": 1967, "text": "And people who were good at music, it's back to how do you scale the product."}, {"time": 1970, "text": "For people who are good at music, that wasn't actually enough."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "If you had the catalog and a good search tool, and you can create your own sessions, you could create really good a soundtrack for your entire life."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Probably perfectly personalized because you did it yourself."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "But the problem was most people, many people aren't that good at music."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "They just can't spend the time."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "Even if you're very good at music, it's going to be hard to keep up."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "So what we did to try to scale this was to essentially try to build, you can think of them as agents that this friend that some people had that helped them navigate this music catalog."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "That's what we're trying to do for you."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "But also there is something like 200 million active users."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "1 million active users on Spotify."}, {"time": 2015, "text": "So there it's okay."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So from the machine learning perspective, you have these 200 million people plus they're creating."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "It's really interesting to think of a playlist as, I mean, I don't know if you meant it that way, but it's almost like a programming language."}, {"time": 2034, "text": "It's or at least a trace of exploration of those individual agents."}, {"time": 2041, "text": "The listeners and you have all this new tracks coming in."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "So it's a fascinating space that is ripe for machine learning."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "So is there, is it possible, how can playlists be used as data in terms of machine learning and to help Spotify organize the music?"}, {"time": 2064, "text": "So we found in our data, not surprising that people who play listed lots they retain much better."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "They had a great experience."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "And so our first attempt was to playlist for users."}, {"time": 2075, "text": "And so we acquired this company called Tunigo of editors and professional playlisters and kind of leveraged the maximum of human intelligence to help build kind of these vectors through the track space for people."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "And that broadened the product."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "But then the obvious next, and we use statistical means, where they could see when they created a playlist, how did that playlist perform?"}, {"time": 2102, "text": "They could see skips of the songs, they could see how the songs perform, and they manually iterated the playlist to maximize performance for a large group of people."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "But there were never enough editors to playlists for you personally."}, {"time": 2114, "text": "So the promise of machine learning was to go from kind of group personalization using editors and tools and statistics to individualization."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "And then what's so interesting about the 3 billion playlists we have is we ended, the truth is we lucked out."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "This was not a priority strategy, as is often the case."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "It looks really smart in hindsight, but it was dumb luck."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "We looked at these playlists and we had some people in the company, a person named Eric Beranodson."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "He was really good at machine learning already back then in like 2007, 2008."}, {"time": 2148, "text": "Back then it was mostly collaborative filtering and so forth."}, {"time": 2151, "text": "But we realized that what this is, is people are grouping tracks for themselves that have some semantic meaning to them."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "And then they actually label it with a playlist name as well."}, {"time": 2164, "text": "So in a sense, people were grouping tracks along semantic dimensions and labeling them."}, {"time": 2169, "text": "And so could you use that information to find that latent embedding?"}, {"time": 2175, "text": "And so we started playing around with collaborative filtering and we saw tremendous success with it."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "Basically trying to extract some of these dimensions."}, {"time": 2188, "text": "And if you think about it, it's not surprising at all."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "It'd be quite surprising if playlists were actually random, if they had no semantic meaning."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "For most people, they group these tracks for some reason."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "So we just happened across this incredible data set."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "Where people are taking these tens of millions of tracks and group them along different semantic vectors."}, {"time": 2209, "text": "And the semantics being outside the individual users."}, {"time": 2212, "text": "So it's some kind of universal."}, {"time": 2214, "text": "There's a universal embedding that holds across people on this earth."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "Yes, I do think that the embeddings you find are going to be reflective of the people who play listed."}, {"time": 2225, "text": "So if you have a lot of indie lovers who play list, your embedding is going to perform better there."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "But what we found was that yes, there were these latent similarities."}, {"time": 2240, "text": "They were very powerful."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "And it was interesting because I think that the people who play listed the most initially were the so called music aficionados who were really into music."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "And they often had a certain... Their taste was often geared towards a certain type of music."}, {"time": 2258, "text": "And so what surprised us, if you look at the problem from the outside, you might expect that the algorithms would start performing best with mainstreamers first."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "Because it somehow feels like an easier problem to solve mainstream taste than really particular taste."}, {"time": 2273, "text": "It was the complete opposite for us."}, {"time": 2275, "text": "The recommendations performed fantastically for people who saw themselves as having very unique taste."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "That's probably because all of them play listed."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "And they didn't perform so well for mainstreamers."}, {"time": 2285, "text": "They actually thought they were a bit too particular and unorthodox."}, {"time": 2289, "text": "So we had the complete opposite of what we expected."}, {"time": 2292, "text": "Success within the hardest problem first, and then had to try to scale to more mainstream recommendations."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "So you've also acquired Echo Nest that analyzes song data."}, {"time": 2304, "text": "So in your view, maybe you can talk about, so what kind of data is there from a machine learning perspective?"}, {"time": 2311, "text": "From a machine learning perspective, there's a huge amount."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "We're talking about playlisting and just user data of what people are listening to, the playlist they're constructing, and so on."}, {"time": 2324, "text": "And then there's the actual data within a song."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "What makes a song, I don't know, the actual waveforms."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "How do you mix the two?"}, {"time": 2335, "text": "How much value is there in each?"}, {"time": 2337, "text": "To me, it seems like user data is a romantic notion that the song itself would contain useful information."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "But if I were to guess, user data would be much more powerful, like playlists would be much more powerful."}, {"time": 2351, "text": "Yeah, so we use both."}, {"time": 2354, "text": "Our biggest success initially was with playlist data without understanding anything about the structure of the song."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "But when we acquired Echo Nest, they had the inverse problem."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "They actually didn't have any play data."}, {"time": 2367, "text": "They were just, they were a provider of recommendations, but they didn't actually have any play data."}, {"time": 2371, "text": "So they looked at the structure of songs, sonically, and they looked at Wikipedia for cultural references and so forth, right?"}, {"time": 2380, "text": "And did a lot of NLU and so forth."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "So we got that skill into the company and combined kind of our user data with their kind of content based."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "So you can think of it as we were user based and they were content based in their recommendations."}, {"time": 2394, "text": "And we combined those two."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "And for some cases where you have a new song that has no play data, obviously you have to try to go by either who the artist is or the sonic information in the song or what it's similar to."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "So there's definitely a value in both and we do a lot in both, but I would say, yes, the user data captures things that have to do with culture in the greater society that you would never see in the content itself."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "But that said, we have seen, we have a research lab in Paris when we can talk more about that on machine learning on the creator side, what it can do for creators, not just for the consumers, but where we looked at how does the structure of a song actually affect the listening behavior?"}, {"time": 2440, "text": "And it turns out that there is a lot of, we can predict things like skips based on the song itself."}, {"time": 2448, "text": "We could say that maybe you should move that chorus a bit because your skip is going to go up here."}, {"time": 2452, "text": "There is a lot of latent structure in the music, which is not surprising because it is some sort of mind hack."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "So there should be structure."}, {"time": 2458, "text": "That's probably what we respond to."}, {"time": 2460, "text": "You just blew my mind actually from the creator perspective."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "So that's a really interesting topic that probably most creators aren't taking advantage of, right?"}, {"time": 2471, "text": "So I've recently got to interact with a few folks, YouTubers who are like obsessed with this idea of what do I do to make sure people keep watching the video?"}, {"time": 2487, "text": "And they like look at the analytics of which point do people turn it off and so on."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "First of all, I don't think that's healthy, but it's because you can do it a little too much."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "But it is a really powerful tool for helping the creative process."}, {"time": 2502, "text": "You just made me realize you could do the same thing for creation of music."}, {"time": 2507, "text": "And so is that something you've looked into?"}, {"time": 2511, "text": "And can you speak to how much opportunity there is for that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 2514, "text": "Yeah, so I listened to the podcast with Ziraj and I thought it was fantastic and I reacted to the same thing where he said he posted something in the morning, immediately watched the feedback where the drop off was and then responded to that in the afternoon, which is quite different from how people make podcasts, for example."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "I mean, the feedback loop is almost non existent."}, {"time": 2535, "text": "So if we back out one level, I think actually both for music and podcasts, which we also do at Spotify, I think there's a tremendous opportunity just for the creation workflow."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And I think it's really interesting speaking to you who, because you're a musician, a developer, and a podcaster."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "If you think about those three different roles, if you make the leap as a musician, if you think about it as a software tool chain, really, your DAW with the stems, that's the IDE, right?"}, {"time": 2566, "text": "That's where you work in source code format with what you're creating."}, {"time": 2571, "text": "Then you sit around and you play with that."}, {"time": 2572, "text": "And when you're happy, you compile that thing into some sort of AAC or MP3 or something."}, {"time": 2577, "text": "You do that because you get distribution."}, {"time": 2579, "text": "There are so many runtimes for that MP3 across the world in car stairs and stuff."}, {"time": 2582, "text": "So if you kind of compile this execution, you ship it out in kind of an old fashioned boxed software analogy."}, {"time": 2589, "text": "And then you hope for the best, right?"}, {"time": 2591, "text": "But as a software developer, you would never do that."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "First, you go on GitHub and you collaborate with other creators."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "And then you think it'd be crazy to just ship one version of your software without doing an A B test, without any feedback loop."}, {"time": 2606, "text": "Issue tracking."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "And then you would look at the feedback loop and say, try to optimize that thing, right?"}, {"time": 2614, "text": "So I think if you think of it as a very specific software tool chain, it looks quite arcane, the tools that a music creator has versus what a software developer has."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "So that's kind of how we think about it."}, {"time": 2628, "text": "Why wouldn't a music creator have something like GitHub where you could collaborate much more easily?"}, {"time": 2634, "text": "So we bought this company called Soundtrap, which has a kind of Google Docs for music approach, where you can collaborate with other people on the kind of source code format with Stems."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "And I think introducing things like AI tools there to help you as you're creating music, both in helping you put accompaniment to your music, like drums or something, help you master and mix automatically, help you understand how this track will perform."}, {"time": 2666, "text": "Exactly what you would expect as a software developer."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "I think it makes a lot of sense."}, {"time": 2670, "text": "And I think the same goes for a podcaster."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "I think podcasters will expect to have the same kind of feedback loop that Siraj has, like, why wouldn't you?"}, {"time": 2679, "text": "Maybe it's not healthy, but..."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "Sorry, I wanted to criticize the fact because you can overdo it because a lot of the, and we're in a new era of that."}, {"time": 2689, "text": "So you can become addicted to it and therefore, what people say, you become a slave to the YouTube algorithm or sort of, it's always a danger of a new technology as opposed to say, if you're creating a song, becoming too obsessed about the intro riff to the song that keeps people listening versus actually the entirety of the creation process."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "It's a balance."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "But the fact that there's zero, I mean, you're blowing my mind right now, because you're completely right that there is no signal whatsoever."}, {"time": 2724, "text": "There's no feedback whatsoever on the creation process and music or podcasting, almost at all."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "And are you saying that Spotify is hoping to help create tools to, not tools, but... No, tools actually."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Actually, tools."}, {"time": 2742, "text": "Tools for creators."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "So we've made some acquisitions the last few years around music creation, this company called Soundtrap, which is a digital audio workstation, but that is browser based."}, {"time": 2759, "text": "And their focus was really the Google Docs approach."}, {"time": 2761, "text": "We can collaborate with people much more easily than you could in previous tools."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "So we have some of these tools that we're working with that we want to make accessible and then we can connect it with our consumption data."}, {"time": 2772, "text": "We can create this feedback loop where we could help you understand, we could help you create and help you understand how you will perform."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "We also acquired this other company within podcasting called Anchor, which is one of the biggest podcasting tools, mobile focused."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "So really focused on simple creation or easy access to creation."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "But that also gives us this feedback loop."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "And even before that, we invested in something called Spotify for Artists and Spotify for Podcasters, which is an app that you can download, you can verify that you are that creator."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "And then you get things that software developers have had for years."}, {"time": 2811, "text": "You can see where, if you look at your podcast, for example, on Spotify or a song that you released, you can see how it's performing, which cities it's performing in, who's listening to it, what's the demographic breakup."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "So similar in the sense that you can understand how you're actually doing on the platform."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "So we definitely want to build tools."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "I think you also interviewed the head of research for Adobe."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "And I think that's an, back to Photoshop that you like, I think that's an interesting analogy as well."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "Photoshop, I think, has been very innovative in helping photographers and artists."}, {"time": 2848, "text": "And I think there should be the same kind of tools for music creators, where you could get AI assistance, for example, as you're creating music, as you can do with Adobe, where you can, I want a sky over here and you can get help creating that sky."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "The really fascinating thing is what Adobe doesn't have is a distribution for the content you create."}, {"time": 2870, "text": "So you don't have the data of if I create, if I, you know, whatever creation I make in Photoshop or Premiere, I can't get like immediate feedback like I can on YouTube, for example, about the way people are responding."}, {"time": 2885, "text": "And if Spotify is creating those tools, that's a really exciting actually world."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "But let's talk a little about podcasts."}, {"time": 2896, "text": "So I have trouble talking to one person."}, {"time": 2900, "text": "So it's a bit terrifying and kind of hard to fathom, but on average, 60 to 100,000 people will listen to this episode."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "Okay, so it's intimidating."}, {"time": 2912, "text": "Yeah, it's intimidating."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So I hosted on Blueberry."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly, actually."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "It looks like most people listen to it on Apple Podcasts, Cast Box and Pocket Casts, and only about a thousand listen on Spotify."}, {"time": 2928, "text": "It's just my podcast, right?"}, {"time": 2933, "text": "So where do you see a time when Spotify will dominate this?"}, {"time": 2940, "text": "So Spotify is relatively new into this podcasting site."}, {"time": 2946, "text": "Yeah, in podcasting."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "What's the deal with podcasting and Spotify?"}, {"time": 2950, "text": "How serious is Spotify about podcasting?"}, {"time": 2953, "text": "Do you see a time where everybody would listen to, you know, probably a huge amount of people, majority perhaps listen to music on Spotify?"}, {"time": 2962, "text": "Do you see a time when the same is true for podcasting?"}, {"time": 2966, "text": "Well, I certainly hope so."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "That is our mission."}, {"time": 2969, "text": "Our mission as a company is actually to enable a million creators to live off of their art, and a billion people be inspired by it."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "And what I think is interesting about that mission is it actually puts the creators first, even though it started as a consumer focused company, and it's just to be able to live off of their art, not just make some money off of their art as well."}, {"time": 2987, "text": "So it's quite an ambitious project."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "So we think about creators of all kinds, and we kind of expanded our mission from being music to being audio a while back."}, {"time": 3001, "text": "And that's not so much because we think we made that decision."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "We think that decision was made for us."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "We think the world made that decision."}, {"time": 3012, "text": "Whether we like it or not, when you put in your headphones, you're going to make a choice between music and a new episode of your podcast or something else."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "We're in that world whether we like it or not."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "And that's how radio works."}, {"time": 3028, "text": "So we decided that we think it's about audio."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "You can see the rise of audiobooks and so forth."}, {"time": 3034, "text": "We think audio is a great opportunity."}, {"time": 3036, "text": "So we decided to enter it."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "And obviously, Apple and Apple Podcasts is absolutely dominating in podcasting, and we didn't have a single podcast only like two years ago."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "What we did though was we looked at this and said, can we bring something to this?"}, {"time": 3056, "text": "We want to do this, but back to the original Spotify, we have to do something that consumers actually value to be able to do this."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "And the reason we've gone from not existing at all to being quite a wide margin, the second largest podcast consumption, still wide gap to iTunes, but we're growing quite fast."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "I think it's because when we looked at the consumer problem, people said surprisingly that they wanted their podcasts and music in the same application."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "So what we did was we took a little bit of a different approach where we said, instead of building a separate podcast app, we thought, is there a consumer problem to solve here?"}, {"time": 3093, "text": "Because the others are very successful already."}, {"time": 3095, "text": "And we thought there was in making a more seamless experience where you can have your podcast and your music in the same application, because we think it's audio to you."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "And that has been successful."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "And that meant that we actually had 200 million people to offer this to instead of starting from zero."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "So I think we have a good chance because we're taking a different approach than the competition."}, {"time": 3116, "text": "And back to the other thing I mentioned about creators, because we're looking at the end to end flow."}, {"time": 3122, "text": "I think there's a tremendous amount of innovation to do around podcast as a format."}, {"time": 3127, "text": "When we have creation tools and consumption, I think we could start improving what podcasting is."}, {"time": 3132, "text": "I mean, podcast is this opaque, big, like one, two hour file that you're streaming, which it really doesn't make that much sense in 2019 that it's not interactive."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "There's no feedback loops, nothing like that."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "So I think if we're going to win, it's going to have to be because we build a better product for creators and for consumers."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "So we'll see, but it's certainly our goal."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "We have a long way to go."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "Well, the creators part is really exciting."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "You already, you got me hooked there."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "Cause the only stats I have, Blueberry just recently added the stats of whether it's listened to the end or not."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "And that's like a huge improvement, but that's still nowhere to where you could possibly go in terms of statistics."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "You just download the Spotify podcasters up and verify."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "And then, then you'll know where people dropped out in this episode."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "The moment I started talking."}, {"time": 3183, "text": "I might be depressed by this, but okay."}, {"time": 3186, "text": "So one, um, one other question is the original Spotify for music."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "And I have a question about podcasting in this line is the idea of podcasting about podcasting in this line is the idea of albums."}, {"time": 3203, "text": "I have, uh, what did you, uh, music aficionados, uh, friends who are really, uh, big fans of music often, uh, really enjoy albums, listening to entire albums of, of an artist."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like Spotify has helped replace the idea of an album with playlists."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "So you create your own albums."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "It's, it's kind of the way, at least I've experienced music and I've really enjoyed it that way."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "One of the things that was missing in podcasting for me, I don't know if it's missing."}, {"time": 3236, "text": "It's an open question for me, but the way I listened to podcasts is the way I would listen to albums."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "So I take a Joe Rogan experience and that's an album."}, {"time": 3245, "text": "And I listened, you know, I like, I, I put that on and I listened one episode after the next, then there's a sequence and so on."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "Is there a room for doing what you did for music or doing what Spotify did for music, but, uh, creating playlists, sort of, uh, this kind of playlisting idea of breaking apart from podcasting, uh, from individual podcasts and creating kind of, uh, this interplay or, or have you thought about that space?"}, {"time": 3273, "text": "Uh, it's a great question."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "So I think in, um, in music, you're right."}, {"time": 3278, "text": "Basically you bought an album."}, {"time": 3279, "text": "So it was like, you bought a small catalog of like 10 tracks, right?"}, {"time": 3282, "text": "It was, it was, again, it was actually a lot of, a lot of consumption."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "You think it's about what you like, but it's based on the business model."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "So you paid for this 10 track service and then you listened to that for a while."}, {"time": 3294, "text": "And then when, when everything was flat priced, you tended to listen differently."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "Now, so, so I think the, I think the album is still tremendously important."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "That's why we have it and you can save albums and so forth."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "And you have a huge amount of people who really listen according to albums."}, {"time": 3306, "text": "And I like that because it is a creator format, you can tell a longer story over several tracks."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "And so some people listen to just one track."}, {"time": 3313, "text": "Some people actually want to hear that whole story."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "Now in podcast, I think, I think it's different."}, {"time": 3321, "text": "You can argue that podcasts might be more like shows on Netflix."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "Have like a full season of Narcos and you're probably not going to do like one episode of Narcos and then one of House of Cards, like, like, you know, there's a narrative there."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "And you, you, you love the cast and you love these characters."}, {"time": 3337, "text": "So I think people will, people love shows."}, {"time": 3342, "text": "And I think they will, they will listen to those shows."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "I do think you follow a bunch of shows at the same time."}, {"time": 3346, "text": "So there's certainly an opportunity to bring you the latest episode of, you know, whatever the five, six, 10 things that, that you're into."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "But, but I think, I think people are going to listen to specific hosts and love those hosts for a long time."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "Because I think there's something different with podcasts where, um, this format of the, the, the, the, the, the experience of the, of the audience is actually sitting here right between us."}, {"time": 3373, "text": "Whereas if you look at something on TV, the audio actually would come from, you would sit over there and the audio would come to you from both of us as if you were watching, not as you were part of the conversation."}, {"time": 3382, "text": "So my experience is having listened to podcasts like yours and Joe Rogan is, I feel like I know all of these people."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "They, they have a lot of experience."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "I know all of these people, they have no idea who I am, but I feel like I've listened to so many hours of that."}, {"time": 3395, "text": "It's very different from me watching a, watching like a TV show or an interview."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "So I think you, you kind of, um, fall in love with people and, um, experience in a, in a different way."}, {"time": 3405, "text": "So I think, I think shows and hosts are going to be very, uh, very important."}, {"time": 3409, "text": "I don't think that's going to go away into some sort of thing where, where you don't even know who you're listening to."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "I don't think that's going to happen."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "What I do think is I think there's a tremendous discovery opportunity in podcast because the catalog is growing quite quickly."}, {"time": 3423, "text": "And I think podcast is only a few, like five, 600,000 shows right now."}, {"time": 3431, "text": "If you look back to YouTube as another analogy of creators, no one really knows if you would lift the lid on YouTube, but it's probably billions of episodes."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "And so I think the podcast catalog would probably grow tremendously because the creation tools are getting easier."}, {"time": 3447, "text": "And then you're going to have this discovery opportunity that I think is really big."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "So, so a lot of people tell me that they love their shows, but discovering podcasts kind of suck."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "It's really hard to get into new show."}, {"time": 3458, "text": "They're usually quite long."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "It's a big time investment."}, {"time": 3460, "text": "So I think there's plenty of opportunity in the discovery part."}, {"time": 3465, "text": "Yeah, for sure."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "A hundred percent in, in even the dumbest, there's so many low hanging fruit too."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "Uh, for example, just knowing what episode to listen to first to try out a podcast."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "Uh, because most podcasts don't have an order to them."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "Uh, they, they can be listened to out of order and sorry to say some are better than others episodes."}, {"time": 3492, "text": "So some episodes of Joe Rogan are better than others."}, {"time": 3495, "text": "And it's nice to know, uh, which you should listen to, to try it out."}, {"time": 3500, "text": "And there's, uh, as far as I know, almost no information, uh, in terms of like, uh, upvotes on how good an episode is."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "So I think part of the problem is, uh, you, it's kind of like music."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "There isn't one answer."}, {"time": 3514, "text": "People use music for different things and there's actually many different types of music."}, {"time": 3517, "text": "There's workout music and there's classical piano music and focus music and, and, and, uh, so forth."}, {"time": 3522, "text": "I think the same with podcasts."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "Some podcasts are sequential."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "They're supposed to be listened to in, in order."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "It's actually, it's actually telling a narrative."}, {"time": 3531, "text": "Some podcasts are one topic, uh, kind of like yours, but different guests."}, {"time": 3535, "text": "So you could jump in anywhere."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "Some podcasts actually have completely different topics."}, {"time": 3539, "text": "And for those podcasts, it might be that I want, you know, we should recommend one episode because it's about AI from someone, but then they talk about something that you're not interested in the rest of the episodes."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "So I think our, what we're spending a lot of time on now is just first understanding the domain and creating kind of the knowledge graph of how do these objects relate and how do people consume."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "And I think we'll find that it's going to be, it's going to be different."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "I'm excited because you're the, uh, Spotify is the first people I'm aware of that are trying to do this for podcasting."}, {"time": 3574, "text": "Podcasting has been like a wild west up until now."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "It's been a very, we want to be very careful though, because it's been a very good wild west, I think it's this fragile ecosystem."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "And I, we want to make sure that you don't barge in and say like, Oh, we're going to internetize this thing."}, {"time": 3593, "text": "And you have to think about the creators."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "You have to understand how they get distribution today, who listens to how they make money today, try to, you know, make sure that their business model works, that they understand."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "I think it's back to doing something to improving their products, like feedback loops and distribution."}, {"time": 3611, "text": "So jumping back into terms of this fascinating world of a recommender system and listening to music and using machine learning to analyze things, do you think it's better to what currently, correct me if I'm wrong, but currently Spotify lets people pick what they listen to the most part."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "There's a discovery process, but you kind of organize playlists."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "Is it better to let people pick what they listen to or recommend what they should listen to something like stations by Spotify that I saw that you're playing around with?"}, {"time": 3644, "text": "Maybe you can tell me what's the status of that."}, {"time": 3647, "text": "This is a Pandora style app that just kind of, as opposed to you select the music you listen to, it kind of feeds you the music you listen to."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "What's the status of stations by Spotify?"}, {"time": 3660, "text": "What's its future?"}, {"time": 3661, "text": "The story of Spotify, as we have grown, has been that we made it more accessible to different audiences and stations is another one of those where the question is, some people want to be very specific."}, {"time": 3674, "text": "They actually want to hear Starway to Heaven right now, that needs to be very easy to do."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "And some people, or even the same person, at some point might say, I want to feel upbeat or I want to feel happy or I want songs to sing in the car."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "So they put in the information at a very different level and then we need to translate that into what that means musically."}, {"time": 3700, "text": "So stations is a test to create like a consumption input vector that is much simpler where you can just tune it a little bit and see if that increases the overall reach."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "But we're trying to kind of serve the entire gamut of super advanced so called music aficionados all the way to people who they love listening to music but it's not their number one priority in life."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "They're not going to sit and follow every new release from every new artist."}, {"time": 3726, "text": "They need to be able to influence music at a different level."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "So you can think of it as different products and I think one of the interesting things to answer your question on if it's better to let the user choose or to play, I think the answer is the challenge when machine learning kind of came along, there was a lot of thinking about what does product development mean in a machine learning context."}, {"time": 3753, "text": "People like Andrew Ng, for example, when he went to Baidu, he started doing a lot of practical machine learning, went from academia and he thought a lot about this and he had this notion that a product manager, designer and engineer, they used to work around this wireframe to kind of describe what the product should look like."}, {"time": 3769, "text": "It was something to talk about when you're doing a chatbot or a playlist, what are you going to say?"}, {"time": 3774, "text": "It should be good."}, {"time": 3775, "text": "That's not a good product description."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "So how do you do that?"}, {"time": 3778, "text": "And he came up with this notion that the test set is the new wireframe."}, {"time": 3783, "text": "The job of the product manager is to source a good test set that is representative of what, like if you say I want to play this, that is songs to sing in the car."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "The job of the product manager is to go and source a good test set of what that means."}, {"time": 3795, "text": "So then you can work with engineering to have algorithms to try to produce that."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "So we try to think a lot about how to structure product development for a machine learning age."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "And what we discovered was that a lot of it is actually in the expectation."}, {"time": 3810, "text": "And you can go two ways."}, {"time": 3813, "text": "So let's say that if you set the expectation with the user that this is a discovery product, like Discover Weekly, you're actually setting the expectation that most of what we show you will not be relevant."}, {"time": 3826, "text": "When you're in the discovery process, you're going to accept that actually if you find one gem every Monday that you totally love, you're probably going to be happy."}, {"time": 3835, "text": "Even though the statistical meaning, one out of 10 is terrible or one out of 20 is terrible from a user point of view because the setting was discovery is fine."}, {"time": 3843, "text": "Sorry to interrupt real quick."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "I just actually learned about Discover Weekly, which is a Spotify, I don't know, it's a feature of Spotify that shows you cool songs to listen to."}, {"time": 3856, "text": "Maybe I can do issue tracking."}, {"time": 3858, "text": "I couldn't find it on my Spotify app."}, {"time": 3860, "text": "It's in your library."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "It's in the library."}, {"time": 3862, "text": "It's in the list of library."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "Because I was like, whoa, this is cool."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "I didn't know this existed."}, {"time": 3866, "text": "And I tried to find it."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "I will show it to you and feedback to our product team."}, {"time": 3871, "text": "There you go."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "But yeah, so yeah, sorry."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Just to mention the expectation there is basically that you're going to discover new songs."}, {"time": 3882, "text": "So then you can be quite adventurous in the recommendations you do."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "But we have another product called Daily Mix, which kind of implies that these are only going to be your favorites."}, {"time": 3894, "text": "So if you have one out of 10 that is good and nine out of 10 that doesn't work for you, you're going to think it's a horrible product."}, {"time": 3899, "text": "So actually a lot of the product development we learned over the years is about setting the right expectations."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "So for Daily Mix, you know, algorithmically, we would pick among things that feel very safe in your taste space."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "Whereas Discover Weekly, we go kind of wild because the expectation is most of this is not going to."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "So a lot of that, a lot of to answer your question there, a lot of should you let the user pick or not?"}, {"time": 3923, "text": "We have some products where the whole point is that the user can click play, put the phone in the pocket, and it should be really good music for like an hour."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "We have other products where you probably need to say like, no, no, save, no, no."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "And it's very interactive."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "That makes sense."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "And then the radio product, the stations product is one of these like click play, put in your pocket for hours."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "So you're thinking of different test sets for different users and trying to create products that sort of optimize for those test sets that represent a specific set of users."}, {"time": 3957, "text": "Yes, I think one thing that I think is interesting is we invested quite heavily in editorial in people creating playlists using statistical data."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "And that was successful for us."}, {"time": 3970, "text": "And then we also invested in machine learning."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "And for the longest time within Spotify and within the rest of the industry, there was always this narrative of humans versus the machine, algo versus editorial."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "And editors would say like, well, if I had that data, if I could see your playlisting history and I made a choice for you, I would have made a better choice."}, {"time": 3991, "text": "And they would have because they're much smarter than these algorithms."}, {"time": 3995, "text": "The human is incredibly smart compared to our algorithms."}, {"time": 3998, "text": "They can take culture into account and so forth."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "The problem is that they can't make 200 million decisions per hour for every user that logs in."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "So the algo may be not as sophisticated, but much more efficient."}, {"time": 4011, "text": "So there was this contradiction."}, {"time": 4014, "text": "But then a few years ago, we started focusing on this kind of human in the loop thinking around machine learning."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "And we actually coined an internal term for it called algotorial, a combination of algorithms and editors, where if we take a concrete example, you think of the editor, this paid expert that we have that's really good at something like soul, hip hop, EDM, something, right?"}, {"time": 4040, "text": "They're a true expert, no one in the industry."}, {"time": 4042, "text": "So they have all the cultural knowledge."}, {"time": 4044, "text": "You think of them as the product manager."}, {"time": 4046, "text": "And you say that, let's say that you want to create a, you think that there's a product need in the world for something like songs to sing in the car or songs to sing in the shower."}, {"time": 4056, "text": "I'm taking that example because it exists."}, {"time": 4058, "text": "People love to scream songs in the car when they drive, right?"}, {"time": 4062, "text": "So you want to create that product and you have this product manager who's a musical expert."}, {"time": 4066, "text": "They create, they come up with a concept, like I think this is a missing thing in humanity, like a playlist called songs to sing in the car."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "They create the framing, the image, the title, and they create a test set of, they create a group of songs, like a few thousand songs out of the catalog that they manually curate that are known songs that are great to sing in the car."}, {"time": 4087, "text": "And they can take like true romance into account."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "They understand things that our algorithms do not at all."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "So they have this huge set of tracks."}, {"time": 4094, "text": "Then when we deliver that to you, we look at your taste vectors and you get the 20 tracks that are songs to sing in the car in your taste."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "So you have personalization and editorial input in the same process, if that makes sense."}, {"time": 4109, "text": "Yeah, it makes total sense."}, {"time": 4110, "text": "And I have several questions around that."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "This is like fascinating."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "So first, it is a little bit surprising to me that the world expert humans are outperforming machines at specifying songs to sing in the car."}, {"time": 4130, "text": "So maybe you could talk to that a little bit."}, {"time": 4133, "text": "I don't know if you can put it into words, but what is it?"}, {"time": 4137, "text": "How difficult is this problem?"}, {"time": 4141, "text": "Do you really, I guess what I'm trying to ask is there, how difficult is it to encode the cultural references, the context of the song, the artists, all those things together?"}, {"time": 4154, "text": "Can machine learning really not do that?"}, {"time": 4157, "text": "I mean, I think machine learning is great at replicating patterns if you have the patterns."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "But if you try to write with me a spec of what song's greatest song to sing in the car definition is, is it loud?"}, {"time": 4170, "text": "Does it have many choruses?"}, {"time": 4171, "text": "Should it have been in movies?"}, {"time": 4172, "text": "It quickly gets incredibly complicated, right?"}, {"time": 4176, "text": "And a lot of it may not be in the structure of the song or the title."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "It could be cultural references because, you know, it was a history."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "So the definition problems quickly get, and I think that was the insight of Andrew Ng when he said the job of the product manager is to understand these things that algorithms don't and then define what that looks like."}, {"time": 4198, "text": "And then you have something to train towards, right?"}, {"time": 4200, "text": "Then you have kind of the test set."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "And then so today the editors create this pool of tracks and then we personalize."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "You could easily imagine that once you have this set, you could have some automatic exploration on the rest of the catalog because then you understand what it is."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "And then the other side of it, when machine learning does help is this taste vector."}, {"time": 4220, "text": "How hard is it to construct a vector that represents the things an individual human likes, this human preference?"}, {"time": 4230, "text": "So you can, you know, music isn't like, it's not like Amazon, like things you usually buy."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "Music seems more amorphous."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "Like it's this thing that's hard to specify."}, {"time": 4242, "text": "Like what is, you know, if you look at my playlist, what is the music that I love?"}, {"time": 4248, "text": "It's harder."}, {"time": 4249, "text": "It seems to be much more difficult to specify concretely."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "So how hard is it to build a taste vector?"}, {"time": 4257, "text": "It is very hard in the sense that you need a lot of data."}, {"time": 4260, "text": "And I think what we found was that, so it's not a stationary problem."}, {"time": 4266, "text": "It changes over time."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "And so we've gone through the journey of, if you've done a lot of computer vision, obviously I've done a bunch of computer vision in my past."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "And we started kind of with the handcrafted heuristics for, you know, this is kind of indie music."}, {"time": 4284, "text": "This is this."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "And if you consume this, you'd probably like this."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "So we have, we started there and we have some of that still."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "Then what was interesting about the playlist data was that you could find these latent things that wouldn't necessarily even make sense to you."}, {"time": 4298, "text": "That could even capture maybe cultural references because they cooccurred."}, {"time": 4302, "text": "Things that wouldn't have appeared kind of mechanistically either in the content or so forth."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "So I think that, I think the core assumption is that there are patterns in almost everything."}, {"time": 4322, "text": "And if there are patterns, these embedding techniques are getting better and better now."}, {"time": 4326, "text": "Now, as everyone else, we're also using kind of deep embeddings where you can encode binary values and so forth."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "And what I think is interesting is this process to try to find things that do not necessarily, you wouldn't actually have guessed."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "So it is very hard in an engineering sense to find the right dimensions."}, {"time": 4348, "text": "It's an incredible scalability problem to do for hundreds of millions of users and to update it every day."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "But in theory, in theory embeddings isn't that complicated."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "The fact that you try to find some principal components or something like that, dimensionality reduction and so forth."}, {"time": 4367, "text": "So the theory, I guess, is easy."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "The practice is very, very hard."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "And it's a huge engineering challenge."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "But fortunately, we have some amazing both research and engineering teams in this space."}, {"time": 4378, "text": "Yeah, I guess the question is all, I mean, it's similar."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "I deal with it with autonomous vehicle spaces."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "The question is how hard is driving?"}, {"time": 4387, "text": "And here is basically the question is of edge cases."}, {"time": 4394, "text": "So embedding probably works, not probably, but I would imagine works well in a lot of cases."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "So there's a bunch of questions that arise then."}, {"time": 4405, "text": "So do song preferences, does your taste vector depend on context, like mood, right?"}, {"time": 4413, "text": "So there's different moods, and so how does that take in it?"}, {"time": 4421, "text": "Is it possible to take that as a consideration?"}, {"time": 4424, "text": "Or do you just leave that as a interface problem that allows the user to just control it?"}, {"time": 4429, "text": "So when I'm looking for workout music, I kind of specify it by choosing certain playlists, doing certain search."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "Yeah, so that's a great point."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "Back to the product development."}, {"time": 4440, "text": "You could try to spend a few years trying to predict which mood you're in automatically when you open Spotify, or you create a tab which is happy and sad, right?"}, {"time": 4448, "text": "And you're going to be right 100% of the time with one click."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "Now, it's probably much better to let the user tell you if they're happy or sad, or if they want to work out."}, {"time": 4455, "text": "On the other hand, if your user interface becomes 2,000 tabs, you're introducing so much friction so no one will use the product."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "So then you have to get better."}, {"time": 4464, "text": "So it's this thing where you have to be able to get better."}, {"time": 4466, "text": "So then you have to get better, so it's this thing where I think maybe it was, I don't remember who coined it, but it's called fault tolerant UIs, right?"}, {"time": 4475, "text": "You build a UI that is tolerant of being wrong, and then you can be much less right in your algorithms."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "So we've had to learn a lot of that."}, {"time": 4485, "text": "Building the right UI that fits where the machine learning is, and a great discovery there, which was by the teams during one of our hack days, was this thing of taking discovery, packaging it into a playlist, and saying that these are new tracks that we think you might like based on this."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "And setting the right expectation made it a great product."}, {"time": 4509, "text": "So I think we have this benefit that, for example, Tesla doesn't have that we can change the expectation."}, {"time": 4516, "text": "We can build a fault tolerant setting."}, {"time": 4518, "text": "It's very hard to be fault tolerant when you're driving at 100 miles per hour or something."}, {"time": 4523, "text":

only about three minutes."}, {"time": 4599, "text": "So you get a lot of chances to recommend and the feedback loop is every three minutes instead of every two hours or something."}, {"time": 4605,

would walk up and skip."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "So it's a noisy signal."}, {"time": 4630, "text": "Then we have the equivalent of the like, which is you saved it to your library."}, {"time": 4634,

like this."}, {"time": 4705, "text": "Just kind of talking to the algorithm."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "It's unclear if that's the best way for humans to interact."}, {"time": 4710, "text": "Maybe it

4826, "text": "And what we see in our data is that the number one use case for these speakers is music, music and podcast."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "So fortunately for us, it's been important to these companies to have those use case covered."}, {"time": 4840, "text": "So they want to Spotify on this."}, {"time": 4842, "text": "We have very good relationships with them."}, {"time": 4845,

epiphany many years ago, back when we started using Sonos."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "If you went through all the trouble of setting up your Sonos system, you had this magical experience where you had all the music ever made in your living room."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "And we made this assumption that the home, everyone used to have a CD player at home, but they never managed to get their files working in the home."}, {"time": 4879, "text": "Having this network attached storage was too cumbersome for most consumers."}, {"time": 4882, "text": "So we made the assumption that the home would

think of them as voice speakers."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "But I think if you look at Google I.O., for example, they just added a camera to it, where when the alarm goes off, instead of saying, hey, Google, stop, you can just wave your hand."}, {"time": 4925, "text": "So I think they're going to think more of it as an agent or as an assistant, truly an assistant."}, {"time": 4932, "text": "And an assistant that can see you is going to be much more effective than a blind assistant."}, {"time": 4937, "text": "So I think these things will morph."}, {"time": 4938, "text": "And we won't necessarily think of them as, quote unquote, voice speakers anymore."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "Just as interactive access to the Internet in the home."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "But I still think that the biggest use case for those will be audio."}, {"time": 4954, "text": "So for that reason, we're investing heavily in it."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "And we built our own NLU stack to be able to the

play with in an audio only world."}, {"time": 4971, "text": "It's really the vocabulary that is the interface."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "So we started investing and playing around quite a lot with that, trying to understand what the future will be of you speaking and gesturing and waving at your music."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "And actually, you're actually nudging closer to the autonomous

think you see that in the data."}, {"time": 5008, "text": "While it's tremendously successful, the most common interactions are play, pause and next."}, {"time": 5016, "text": "The things where if you compare it to taking up your phone, unlocking it, bringing up the app and skipping, clicking skip, it was much lower friction."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "But then for longer, more complicated things like, can you find me that song about the people still bring up the phone and search and then play it on their speaker?"}, {"time": 5031, "text": "So we tried again to build a fault tolerant UI where for the more complicated things, you can still pick up your phone, have powerful full keyboard search and then try to optimize for where there is actually lower friction and try to it's kind of like

their speaker go off."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "But I talked to the speaker and I say play stairway to heaven."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "And every time it like not every time, but a large percentage

perspective, does Spotify control that entire experience or no?"}, {"time": 5096, "text": "It seems like the NLU, the natural language stuff is controlled by the speaker and then Spotify stays at a layer below that."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "It's a good and complicated question."}, {"time": 5107, "text": "Some of which is dependent on the on the partners."}, {"time": 5111, "text": "So it's hard to comment on the on the specifics."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "But the question is the right one."}, {"time": 5115, "text": "The challenge is if you can't use any of the personalization, I mean, we know which stairway to heaven."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "And the truth is maybe for for one person, it is exactly the cover that they want."}, {"time": 5126, "text": "And they would be very frustrated if a place I think we I think we default to the right version."}, {"time": 5131, "text": "But but you actually want to be able to do the cover for the person that just played the cover 50 times."}, {"time": 5136, "text": "Or Spotify is just going to seem stupid."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "So you want to be able to leverage the personalization."}, {"time": 5140, "text": "But you have this stack where you have the the ASR and this thing called the end best list of the best guesses here."}, {"time": 5148, "text": "And then the position comes in at the end."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "You actually want the person to be here when you're guessing about what they actually meant."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "So we're working with these partners and it's a complicated it's a complicated thing where you want to you want to be able."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "So first of all, you want to be very careful with your users data."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "You don't want to share your users data without the permission."}, {"time": 5169, "text": "But you want to share some data so that their experience gets better."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "So that these partners can understand enough, but not too much and so forth."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "So it's really the trick is that it's like a business driven relationship where you're doing product development across companies together, which is which is really complicated."}, {"time": 5186, "text": "But this is exactly why we built our own NLU so that we actually can make personalized guesses, because this is the biggest frustration from a user point of view."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "They don't understand about ASR and best list and and business deals."}, {"time": 5200, "text": "They're like, how hard can it be?"}, {"time": 5201, "text": "I was told this thing 50 times this version and still the place the wrong thing."}, {"time": 5205, "text": "It can't it can't be hard."}, {"time": 5207, "text": "So we try to take the user approach."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "If the user the user is not going to understand the complications of business, we have to solve it."}, {"time": 5213, "text": "So let's talk about sort of a complicated subject that I myself I'm quite torn about the idea sort of of paying artists."}, {"time": 5229, "text": "I saw as of August 31st, 2018, over 11 billion dollars were paid to rights holders."}, {"time": 5237, "text": "So and further distributed to artists from Spotify."}, {"time": 5241, "text": "So a lot of money is being paid to artists."}, {"time": 5243, "text": "First of all, the whole time as a consumer for me, when I look at Spotify, I'm not sure I'm remembering correctly, but I think you said exactly how I feel, which is this is too good to be true."}, {"time": 5256,

{"time": 5267, "text": "I was like, this is amazing."}, {"time": 5268, "text": "So one question I have is sort of the bigger question."}, {"time": 5273, "text": "How do you make money in this complicated world?"}, {"time": 5275, "text": "How do you deal with the relationship with record labels who are complicated?"}, {"time": 5284, "text": "These big you're essentially have the task of herding cats, but like rich and powerful powerful cats, and also have the task of paying artists enough and paying those labels enough and still making money in the Internet space where people are not willing to pay hundreds of dollars a month."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "So how do you navigate the space?"}, {"time": 5310, "text": "How do you navigate?"}, {"time": 5311, "text": "That's a beautiful description."}, {"time": 5312, "text": "Herding rich cats."}, {"time": 5314, "text": "That before."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "It is very complicated, and I think certainly actually betting against Spotify has been statistically a very smart thing to do."}, {"time": 5325, "text": "Just looking at the at the line of roadkill in music streaming services, it's it's kind of I think if I understood the complexity when I joined Spotify, unfortunately, fortunately, I didn't know enough about the music industry to understand the complexities, because then I would have made a more rational guess that it wouldn't work."}, {"time": 5346, "text": "So, you know, ignorance is bliss."}, {"time": 5348, "text": "But I think there have been a few distinct challenges."}, {"time": 5353, "text": "I think, as I said, one of the things that made it work at all was that Sweden and the Nordics was a lost market."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "So there was no risk for labels to try this."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "I don't think it would have worked if if the market was healthy."}, {"time": 5369, "text": "So that was the initial condition."}, {"time": 5373, "text": "Then we had this tremendous challenge with the model itself."}, {"time": 5376, "text": "So now most people were pirating."}, {"time": 5379, "text": "But for the people who bought a download or a CD, the artists would get all the revenue for all the future plays then, right?"}, {"time": 5388, "text": "So you got it all up front, whereas the streaming model was like almost nothing day one, almost nothing day two."}, {"time": 5392, "text": "And then at some point, this curve of incremental revenue would intersect with your day one payment."}, {"time": 5399, "text": "And that took a long time to play out before before the music labels, they understood that."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "But on the artist side, it took a lot of time to understand that actually, if I have a big hit that is going to be played for many years, this is a much better model because I get paid based on how much people use the product, not how much they thought they would use it day one or so forth."}, {"time": 5420, "text": "So it was a complicated model to get across."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "But time helped with that."}, {"time": 5424, "text": "And now the revenues to the music industry actually are bigger again than it's gone through this incredible dip and now they're back up."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "And so we're very proud of having been a part of that."}, {"time": 5437, "text": "So there have been distinct problems."}, {"time": 5439, "text": "I think when it comes to the labels, we have taken the painful approach."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "Some of our competition at the time, they kind of looked at other companies and said, if we just ignore the rights, we get really big, really fast."}, {"time": 5456, "text": "We're going to be too big for the labels to kind of, too big to fail."}, {"time": 5460, "text": "They're not going to kill us."}, {"time": 5461, "text": "We didn't take that approach."}, {"time": 5462, "text": "We went legal from day one and we negotiated and negotiated and negotiated."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "It was very slow."}, {"time": 5467, "text": "It was very frustrating."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "We were angry at seeing other companies taking shortcuts and seeming to get away with it."}, {"time": 5472, "text": "It was this game theory thing where over many rounds of playing the game, this would be the right strategy."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "And even though clearly there's a lot of frustrations at times during renegotiations, there is this there is this weird trust where we have been honest and fair."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "We've never screwed them."}, {"time": 5492, "text": "They've never screwed us."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "It's 10 years, but there's this trust and like they know that if music doesn't get really big, if lots of people do not want to listen to music and want to pay for it, Spotify has no business model."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "So we actually are incredibly aligned."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "Other companies, not to be tense, but other companies have other business models where even if they made no money from music, they'd still be profitable companies."}, {"time": 5516, "text": "But Spotify won't."}, {"time": 5517, "text": "So I think the industry sees that we are actually aligned business wise."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "So there is this trust that allows us to do product development, even if it's scary, taking risks."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "The free model itself was an incredible risk for the music industry to take that they should get credit for."}, {"time": 5537, "text": "Now, some of it was that they had nothing to lose in the game."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "Some of it was that they had nothing to lose in Sweden."}, {"time": 5542, "text": "But frankly, a lot of the labels also took risk."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "And so I think we built up that trust with I think herding of cats sounds a bit."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "What's the word?"}, {"time": 5553, "text": "It sounds like dismissive of the cats."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "Dismissive."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "No, every cat matters."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "They're all beautiful and very important."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "They've taken a lot of risks and certainly it's been frustrating."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "So it's really like playing it's game theory."}, {"time": 5567, "text": "If you play the game many times, then you can have the statistical outcome that you bet on."}, {"time": 5574, "text": "And it feels very painful when you're in the middle of that thing."}, {"time": 5577, "text": "I mean, there's risk, there's trust, there's relationships."}, {"time": 5580, "text": "From just having read the biography of Steve Jobs, similar kind of relationships were discussed in iTunes."}, {"time": 5588, "text": "The idea of selling a song for a dollar was very uncomfortable for labels."}, {"time": 5593, "text": "And there was no, it was the same kind of thing."}, {"time": 5596, "text": "It was trust, it was game theory as a lot of relationships that had to be built."}, {"time": 5601, "text": "And it's really a terrifyingly difficult process that Apple could go through a little bit because

honestly Daniel and his tenacity in negotiating, which seems like an impossible task because he was completely unknown and so forth."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "But maybe that was also the reason that it worked."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "But I think game theory is probably the best way to think about it."}, {"time": 5643, "text": "You could go straight for this Nash equilibrium that someone is going to defect or you play it many times, you try to actually go for the top left, the corporations sell."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "Is there any magical reason why Spotify seems to have won this?"},

I don't believe in magic."}, {"time": 5670, "text": "But I think there are there are reasons."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "And I think some of them are that people have misunderstood a lot of what we actually do."}, {"time": 5680, "text": "The actual Spotify model is very complicated."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "They've looked at the premium model and said, it seems like you can charge $9.99 for

5696, "text": "What happened was they started on the free product and then their engagement grew so much that eventually they said, maybe it is worth $9.99, right?"}, {"time": 5705, "text": "It's your propensity to pay gross with your engagement."}, {"time": 5708, "text": "So we have this super complicated business model."}, {"time": 5711, "text": "We operate two different business models,

advertising and subscription products at the same time."}, {"time": 5724, "text": "So I think the business model is actually much more complicated than people think it is."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "And so some people went after just the premium part without the free part and ran into a wall where no one wanted to pay."}, {"time": 5735, "text": "Some people went after just music should be free, just ads, which doesn't give you enough revenue and doesn't work for the music industry."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "So I think that combination is kind of opaque from the outside."}, {"time": 5746,

20 year product cycle to bring pictures into that."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "Now, once that entire value chain of creation and consumption got wrapped in one software stack within something like

think, like I probably do, that it's something biological about perceiving to be in the middle of the conversation that makes you listen in a different way."}, {"time": 5988, "text": "People seem to perceive it differently."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "And there was this narrative for a long time that if you look at video, everything kind of in the foreground, it got shorter and shorter and shorter

existed."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "But maybe it was the fact that you're not prepared to look at your phone like this for two hours."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "But if you can drive at the same time, it seems like people really want to dig deeper and they want to hear like the more complicated version."}, {"time": 6038, "text": "So to me, that is very inspiring that that podcast is actually long form."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "It gives me a lot of hope for humanity that people seem really interested in hearing deeper, more complicated conversations."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "This is I don't

the viewer knows that really, mathematics is amazing, amazing subject and deep, deep connections between ideas that didn't look connected, they turned out they were."}, {"time": 932, "text": "But if we stick with linear algebra..."}, {"time": 935, "text": "So we have a matrix."}, {"time": 937, "text": "That's like the basic thing, a rectangle of numbers."}, {"time": 940, "text": "And it might be a rectangle of data."}, {"time": 942, "text": "You're probably gonna ask me later about data science, where often data comes in a matrix."}, {"time": 950, "text": "You have maybe every column corresponds to a drug and every row corresponds to a patient."}, {"time": 960, "text": "And if the patient reacted favorably to the drug, then you put up some positive number in there."}, {"time": 969, "text": "Anyway, rectangle of numbers, a matrix is basic."}, {"time": 974, "text": "So the big problem is to understand all those numbers."}, {"time": 978, "text": "You got a big, big set of numbers."}, {"time": 980, "text": "And what are the patterns, what's going on?"}, {"time": 983, "text": "And so one of the ways to break down that matrix into simple pieces is uses something called singular values."}, {"time": 996, "text": "And that's come on as fundamental in the last, certainly in my lifetime."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "Eigenvalues, if you have viewers who've done engineering, math, or basic linear algebra, eigenvalues were in there."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "But those are restricted to square matrices."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "And data comes in rectangular matrices."},

1031, "text": "So those are a way to break, to find the important pieces of the matrix, which add up to the whole matrix."}, {"time": 1042, "text": "So you're breaking a matrix into simple pieces."},

often, so a data set is a matrix."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "And often, so a data scientist will like, if a data scientist can find those first and second pieces, stop there, the rest of the data is probably round off, experimental error maybe."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "So you're looking for the important part."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "So what do you find beautiful about singular values?"},

square, whatever, can be written as a product of three very simple special matrices."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "So that's the theorem."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Every matrix can be written as a rotation times a stretch, which is just a diagonal matrix, otherwise all zeros except on the one diagonal."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "And then the third factor is another rotation."}, {"time": 1117,

"text": "So it turns out that, and I did this with myself and then I had students and they worked with many other people."}, {"time": 637, "text": "And it turns out at the end of the day, people do

good job of sort of understanding how people are and they cluster remarkably well, in fact, irritatingly so."}, {"time": 698, "text": "And so by clustering people this way, you can maybe, you know, I got the 93% accuracy of what's the next button you're going to press, but I can get 99% accuracy or somewhere there's about on the collections of things you might press."}, {"time": 714, "text": "And it turns out the things that you might press are all related to number to each other and exactly what you would expect."}, {"time": 718, "text": "So for example, all the key, all the numbers on a

related to one another in some way and all these other things."}, {"time": 734, "text": "And then, and here's the part that I think is important."}, {"time": 734, "text": "I mean, you can see this in all kinds of things."}, {"time": 738, "text": "Every individual is different, but any given individual is remarkably predictable because you keep doing the same things over and over again."}, {"time":

defines humans is the outlier."}, {"time": 766, "text": "So even though many, some large percentage of our behaviors, whatever the signal we measure is the same and it would cluster nicely, but maybe it's the special moments of when we break out of the routine is the definitive thing that we're breaking out of the routine is the definitive things."}, {"time": 783, "text": "And the way we break out of that routine for each one of us might be different."}, {"time": 787, "text": "I would say that I would say it a little differently."}, {"time": 791, "text": "I think I would make two things."},

from lots of other people, but they're not 0%, they're closer to 10%, right?"}, {"time": 802, "text": "So in fact, even if you do this kind of clustering of people, that'll turn out to be the small number they all behave like each other, even if they individually behave very differently from everyone else."}, {"time": 816, "text": "So I think that's kind of important."}, {"time": 816, "text": "But what you're really asking, I think, and I think this is really a question is, what do you do when you're faced with the situation you've never seen before?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "What do you do when you're faced with an extraordinary situation maybe you've seen others do and you're actually forced to do something and you react to that very differently."}, {"time": 829, "text": "And that is the thing that makes you human."}, {"time": 833, "text": "I would agree with that, at least at a philosophical level, that it's the times when you are faced with something difficult, a decision that you have to make where the answer isn't easy, even if you know what the right answer is, that's sort of what defines you as the individual."}, {"time": 848, "text": "And I think what defines people broadly, it's the hard problem."}, {"time": 848, "text": "It's not the easy problem."}, {"time": 852, "text": "It's the thing that's going to hurt you."}, {"time": 852, "text": "It's not even that it's difficult."}, {"time": 852, "text": "It's just that you know that the outcome is going to be highly suboptimal for you."}, {"time": 857, "text": "And I do think that that's a reasonable place to start for the question of what makes us human."}, {"time": 862, "text": "So before we talk about sort of explore the different ideas underlying interactive artificial intelligence, which we are working on, let me just go along this thread to skip to kind of our world of social media, which is something that at least on the artificial intelligence side you think about."}, {"time": 884,

getting us out of those silos."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Is that something that you think is possible?"}, {"time": 941, "text": "Do you see a hopeful possibility for artificial intelligence systems in these large networks of people to get us outside of our habits in at least the idea space to where we can sort of be empathetic to other people's lived experiences, other people's points of view, you know, all that kind of stuff?"}, {"time": 971, "text": "Yes, and I actually don't think it's that hard."}, {"time": 971, "text": "Well, it's not hard in this sense."}, {"time": 971, "text": "So imagine that you can, let's just, let's make life simple for a minute."}, {"time": 976, "text": "Let's assume that you can do a kind of partial ordering over ideas or clusterings of behavior."}, {"time": 982, "text": "It doesn't even matter what I mean here, so long as there's some way that this is a cluster, this is a cluster, there's some edge between them, right?"}, {"time": 991, "text":

from here to here."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "The way you get from here to here is you find the edge and you move slowly together, right?"}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And I think that machines are actually very good at that sort of thing once we can kind of define the problem, either in terms of behavior or ideas or words or whatever."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "So it's easy in the sense that if you already have the network and you know the relationships, you know, the edges and sort of the strengths on them and you kind of have some semantic meaning for them, the machine doesn't have to, you do as the designer, then yeah, I think you can kind of move people along and sort of expand them."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "But it's harder than that."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "And the reason it's harder than that, or sort of coming up with the network structure itself is hard, is because I'm gonna tell you a story that someone else told me and I don't, I may get some of the details a little bit wrong, but it's roughly, it roughly goes like this."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "You take two sets of people from the same backgrounds and you want them to solve a problem."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "So you separate them up, which we do all the time, right?"}, {"time": 1049, "text": "Oh, you know, we're gonna break out in the, we're gonna break out groups."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "You're gonna go over there and you're gonna talk about this."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "And then you have them sort of in this big room, but far apart from one another, and you have them sort of interact with one another."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "When they come back to talk about what they learn, you want to merge what they've done together."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "It can be extremely hard because they don't, they basically don't speak the same language anymore."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "Like when you create these problems and you dive into them, you create your own language."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "So the example this one person gave me, which I found kind of interesting because we were in the middle of that at the time, was they're sitting over there and they're talking about these rooms that you can see, but you're seeing them from different vantage points, depending on what side of the room you're on."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "They can see a clock very easily."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "And so they start referring to the room as the one with the clock."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "This group over here, looking at the same room, they can see the clock, but it's, you know, not in their line of sight or whatever."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "So they end up referring to it by some other way."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "When they get back together and they're talking about things, they're referring to the same room and they don't even realize they're referring to the same room."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "And in fact, this group doesn't even see that there's a clock there and this group doesn't see whatever's the clock on the wall is the thing that stuck with me."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "So if you create these different silos, the problem isn't that the ideologies disagree."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "It's that you're using the same words and they mean radically different things."}, {"time": 1121, "text": "The hard part is just getting them to agree on the, well, maybe we'd say the axioms in our world, right?"}, {"time": 1127, "text": "But you know, just get them to agree on some basic definitions because right now they talk, they're talking past each other, just completely talking past each other."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "That's the hard part, getting them to meet, getting them to interact."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "That may not be that difficult."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "Getting them to see where their language is leading them to lead past one another."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "That's, that's the hard part."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "It's a really interesting question to me."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "It could be on the layer of language, but it feels like there's multiple layers to this."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Like it could be worldview."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "It could be, I mean, all boils down to empathy, being able to put yourself in the shoes of the other person to learn the language, to learn like visually how they see the world, to learn like the, I mean, I experienced this now with, with trolls, the, the degree of humor in that world."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "For example, I talk about love a lot."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "I'm very like, I'm really lucky to have this amazing community of loving people."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "But whenever I encounter trolls, they always roll their eyes at the idea of love because it's so quote unquote cringe."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "So, so they, they show love by like derision, I would say."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And I think about on the human level, that's a whole nother discussion."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "That's psychology, that's sociology, so on."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "But I wonder if AI systems can help somehow and to bridge the gap of what is this person's life like?"}, {"time": 1210, "text": "Encourage me to just ask that question, to put myself in their shoes, to experience the agitations, the fears, the hopes they have, the, to experience, you know, the, to even just to think about what was their upbringing like, like having a, a single parent home or a shitty education or all those kinds of things, just to put myself in that mind space."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "It feels like that's really important."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "For us to, to, to bring those clusters together, to find that similar language."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "But it's unclear how AI can help that because it seems like AI systems need to understand both parties first."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "So the, you know, the word understand, there's doing a lot of work, right?"}, {"time": 1252, "text": "So do you have to understand it or do you just simply have to note that there is something similar as a point to touch, right?"}, {"time": 1257, "text": "So, you know, you use the word empathy and I like that word, for a lot of reasons, I think you're right in the way that you're using in the ways you're describing, but let's separate it from sympathy, right?"}, {"time": 1267, "text": "So, you know, sympathy is feeling sort of for someone, empathy is kind of understanding where they're coming from and how they, how they feel, right?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "And for most people, those things go hand in hand."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "For some people, some are very good at empathy and very, very bad at sympathy."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Some people cannot experience, well, my observation would be, I'm not a psychologist, my observation would be that some people seem to be very, very, very bad at sympathy."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "My observation would be that some people seem incapable of feeling sympathy unless they feel empathy first."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "You can understand someone, understand where they're coming from and still think, no, I can't support that, right?"}, {"time": 1302, "text": "It doesn't mean that the only way I, because if that, if that isn't the case, then what it requires is that you, you must, the only way that you can, to understand someone means you must agree with everything that they do, which isn't right, right?"}, {"time": 1319, "text": "I can feel for someone is to completely understand them and make them like me in some way."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Well, then we're lost, right?"}, {"time": 1326, "text": "Because we're not all exactly like each other."}, {"time": 1326, "text": "I have to understand everything that you've gone through."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "It helps clearly, but they're separable ideas, right?"}, {"time": 1334, "text": "Even though they get clearly, clearly tangled up in one another."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "So what I think AI could help you do actually is if, and you know, I'm, I'm being quite fanciful as it were, but if you, if you think of these as kind of, I understand how you interact, the words that you use, the, you know, the actions you take, I have some way of doing this."}, {"time": 1348,

distribution, right, then, you know, I can take the cosine of the angle between you and if it's, you know, if it's zero, you've got nothing in common."}, {"time": 1370, "text": "If it's one, you're completely the same person."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "Well, you know, you're probably not one."}, {"time": 1374, "text": "You're almost certainly not zero."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "I can find the place where there's the overlap, then I might be able to introduce you on that basis or connect you in that, connect you in that way and make it easier for you to take that step of that step of empathy."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "It's not, it's not impossible to do."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "Although I wonder if it requires that everyone involved is at least interested in asking the question."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "So maybe the hard part is just getting them interested in asking the question."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "In fact, maybe if you can get them to ask the question, how are we more alike than we are different, they'll solve it themselves."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "Maybe that's the problem that AI should be working on, not telling you how you're similar or different, but just getting you to decide that it's worthwhile asking the question."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "It feels like an economist's answer actually."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "Well, people, okay, first of all, people like would disagree."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "So let me disagree slightly, which is, I think everything you said is brilliant, but I tend to believe philosophically

"Yeah, it's a brilliant book."}, {"time": 9316, "text": "So this book was written in 1632."}, {"time": 9319, "text": "It was written, and it was the one that caused him to go into house arrest and almost threatened to be tortured."}, {"time": 9324, "text": "And that book laid out his arguments for what was called the Copernican or the nonparapathetic Aristotelian, et cetera, notion of the planetary dynamic."}, {"time": 9337, "text": "And eventually he was forced to recant that he believed in it, and allegedly he said he still believes the earth moves."}, {"time": 9343, "text": "Anyway, so we're making, it's written in the form of a trilogue."}, {"time": 9346, "text": "It's actually called the dialogue with his three people."}, {"time": 9348, "text": "There's one named Salviati, who was espousing Galileo's notions about how the heavens were orchestrated."}, {"time": 9354, "text": "And Salviati means like the salvation, the savior."}, {"time": 9358, "text": "Then there's a middleman, Segredo."}, {"time": 9359, "text": "So Carlo Rovelli is playing Salviati, brilliant one."}, {"time": 9364, "text": "I am playing Segredo, who's like an intelligent interlocutor."}, {"time": 9367, "text": "I'm kind of just, I can appreciate Aristotle, I can appreciate Copernicus."}, {"time": 9372, "text": "Then there's this guy, Simplicio, the simpleton, and he espouses the words of the Pope."}, {"time": 9378, "text": "So you can imagine like, you're working in Putin's government or you're working in whatever, and all of a sudden you're kind of putting the words of like the fool, literally calling the fool, but you're using the words of the all supreme powerful being on earth at that time was the Vatican church, especially for an Italian like Galileo."}, {"time": 9397, "text": "So he wasn't as brilliant politically as he was astrophysically and otherwise."}, {"time": 9404, "text": "Who's doing Simplicio?"}, {"time": 9406, "text": "Simplicio is a friend of mine in University

the translator, Stillman Drake, who's a renowned scientific translator."}, {"time": 9458, "text": "And then Fabiola Giannati, she reads the introduction and dedication from Galileo to the Duke of Tuscany and some of the different introductions that Galileo himself had."}, {"time": 9470, "text": "It's just, it's such a thrill to be able to do it."}, {"time": 9473, "text": "I only randomly found out, cause I wanted to study it and it's like 500 pages long."}, {"time": 9478, "text": "And I was like, let me get the audio book cause I'm an audio medium kind of guy, didn't exist."}, {"time": 9482, "text": "So I said, let's do it ourselves."}, {"time": 9483, "text": "And so we did it and hopefully it'll be out on Galileo's birthday, which is February 15th, 2022."}, {"time": 9489, "text":

they don't, right?"}, {"time": 9515, "text": "But this was a manual for how to use this slide roll, which is like enormously important."}, {"time": 9519, "text": "And he gives a whole bunch of worked examples."}, {"time": 9521, "text": "It's a brilliant book."}, {"time": 9523, "text": "One of the examples is how do you convert money?"}, {"time": 9525, "text": "So he does a currency conversion

collector wants a piece of paper, right?"}, {"time": 9555, "text": "So it's a lesson."}, {"time": 9556, "text": "Like there are value in physical, you know, nonfungible tokens, this original

these alchemists, you know, physicists, chemists that would be around a court."}, {"time": 9573, "text": "And every so often for the treasurer, they would want to accept pieces of gold from the citizens and convert that to script or, you know, paper money."}, {"time": 9580, "text": "And to do that, they needed someone to verify with a standard of gold that they knew to be gold and do some kind of semi non destructive evaluation of the purported object, the metal that was supposed to be gold."}, {"time": 9593, "text": "So they would take these pieces of gold, theoretically gold, and

lira or whatever, right?"}, {"time": 9613, "text": "So it was an incredibly important job."}, {"time": 9615, "text": "And so this person would take this piece of inanimate rock and use it to do something valuable."}, {"time": 9620, "text": "What I want to do in the Assayer Project is take this plethora of physical theories of everything."}, {"time": 9627, "text": "I said recently, you know,

couldn't see that worked."}, {"time": 9763, "text": "But Einstein said, no, it's caused by the warping and bending of spacetime due to the presence of matter, who will later become known as the Einstein equations."}, {"time": 9771, "text": "So he explained why Mercury did that."}, {"time": 9774, "text": "And it was known since the time of Newton that Mercury was behaving in this really

the assayer do?"}, {"time": 9829, "text": "He or she should look at these theories, look what things they explain that already exist, and look at what new predictions they can claim to explain if we can build experiments to test them."}, {"time": 9841, "text": "So you have to kind of challenge yourself to think about what kind of predictions can they make such that we can construct experiments?"}, {"time": 9849, "text": "So that's like ultimately back going to the signal, to the experimenter's theorist, essentially."}, {"time": 9859, "text": "So like very experiment centric exploration of the fundamental theory of everything."}, {"time": 9866, "text": "And the best scientists, the best physicists, were both experimentalists and theorists."}, {"time": 9871, "text": "Or at

if they were theorists, they were like Galileo."}, {"time": 9883, "text": "Like Einstein has patents for things that he invented."}, {"time": 9887, "text": "And then some of his work led to the laser and the maser."}, {"time": 9890, "text": "So he had practically, it wasn't just pure airy fairy, quantum reality and expanding universe."}, {"time": 9896, "text": "So in this case, what I wanna do is look at, there's 10 different theories of everything or cosmological models."}, {"time": 9901, "text": "They make predictions, they have advantages and disadvantages, and I'm just asking the question,

fingertips, which is to define a new culture for space exploration."}, {"time": 2637, "text": "We don't just have to import cultural artifacts from Earth to make life worth living in space, and this

kind of getting your mental model of physics, we do think that that would change kids abilities to if they were born in microgravity, their ability to have that intuition around an Earth based 1G

that's fabulous and really empowering for our research."}, {"time": 4684, "text": "Is it affordable?"}, {"time": 4686, "text": "So like loosely speaking, does it become affordable for like MIT type of research lab?"}, {"time": 4693, "text": "Does it, or does it need to be a multi university like a gigantic effort, a consortium thing?"}, {"time": 4700, "text": "One of the reasons we're spinning out

NASA and MIT academia?"}, {"time": 4761, "text": "Yeah, I think people have been worried about NASA the last few years because in some people's minds, they are ceding ground to these commercial efforts, but that's really not what's happening."}, {"time": 4774, "text": "NASA empowered these commercial efforts because they wanna free themselves up to go to Mars and go to Europa and continue being that really aspirational force for humanity of pushing the boundary, always pushing the boundary."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "And if they were anchored in low earth orbit, maintaining a space station indefinitely, that's so much a part of their budget that it was keeping them from being able to do more."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "So it actually is really fantastic for NASA to have grown this commercial ecosystem and then that frees NASA up to go further."}, {"time": 4803, "text": "And in academia, we like to think that we will be able to do the provocative next generation research

space and then you can actually free up both of your hands to work."}, {"time": 4862, "text": "So we're already starting to think about the design of bionic humans or prosthetics or things that would make you kind of like a cyborg to augment your capabilities when you're in a space environment."}, {"time": 4873, "text": "How would you control something like that?"}, {"time": 4874, "text": "So it's kind of like a, I mean, you can't call it a leg, but whatever, it's a."}, {"time": 4877, "text": "An additional appendage."}, {"time": 4880, "text": "Appendage, so how would you, what are ideas for controlling something like that?"}, {"time": 4883, "text": "Yeah, so right now it's super, yeah, there you go."}, {"time": 4887, "text": "Right now it's super manual."}, {"time": 4889, "text": "It's basically just like a kind of a set pattern of inflating as we're testing it."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "But in the future, if we had a Neuralink, I mean, this is something that you could imagine directly controlling, just thinking thoughts and controlling it."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "That's a ways away."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "Yeah, so we talked about on the biology side, astrobiology, there's probably agriculture stuff."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "Is there other things that kind of feed the ecosystem of out in space for survival or the robotics architectures, the self assembly stuff?"}, {"time": 4916, "text": "So kind of combining something we were talking about, you can form these relationships with objects and anthropomorphize."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "One of the things that we're thinking about for agriculture created by Manwe and Somu, so two students at MIT, was this little, it looks like a planet, but it's inspired by, I think, a Mandala or Nepalese spinning wheel."}, {"time": 4935, "text": "And you plant plants on the inside and the astronaut has to spin it every day to help the plants survive."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "So it's a way to give the astronauts something to care about, something that they are responsible for keeping alive and can really invest themselves in."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "And it's not necessary, right?"}, {"time": 4950, "text": "We have other ways to grow in orbit, hydroponics, liquid medium, trying to keep the liquid around the plant roots is hard because there's no gravity to pull it down in a particular direction."}, {"time": 4960, "text": "But what I loved about this project was they said, sure, we have ways that the plants could grow on their own, but the astronauts might want to care for it in the same way that we have little plants that come to be important to us, little plant friends."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "So there's AgriFuge, that's an early model of this manually spinning plant habitat."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "I guess this is the best of academic research is you can do these kinds of wild ideas."}, {"time": 4983, "text": "Wild ideas, yeah."}, {"time": 4984, "text": "Well, I get to spend quite a bit of time with Mr. Elon Musk and he's very stressed, especially about Starship and all those kinds of engineering efforts."}, {"time": 4997, "text": "What do you think about

"And even if it happens, it might be very painful."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "I think that's what's so special about what Elon is doing with SpaceX is he takes these risks and he tests iteratively and he'll, we'll see the spectacular failures on the path to a successful Starship."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "It's something that, you know, people have said, why isn't NASA doing that?"}, {"time": 5059, "text": "Well, that's cause NASA is doing that with taxpayer dollars and we would all revolt if we saw NASA failing at all these different stages."}, {"time": 5066, "text": "But that level of, you know, spiral engineering theory of development isn't super impressive."}, {"time": 5071, "text": "And it's a really interesting approach that SpaceX has taken."}, {"time": 5074, "text": "And I think

commercial space stations in orbit, that it's not just NASA that does space stuff."}, {"time": 5103, "text": "So we have a big challenge to get more of humanity excited and educated and involved again, kind of like in the Apollo era where it was a big deal for everybody."}, {"time": 5112, "text": "Well, a lot of that is also one of the big impressive things that Elon does, I think, extremely well is the social media, is the getting people excited."}, {"time": 5121, "text": "And I think that actually, he's helped NASA step their game up in terms of social media."}, {"time": 5126, "text":

out emails somehow."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "So people are now seeing the followers of this particular podcast who are fans, they're finding them on platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube and so on,

language is proper."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "It gets worse than that, though."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "If you look at business email compromise, so the way a business email compromise typically works is the attacker will find a payroll person, find a CEO."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "He will fashion a spear phishing email, which is that's a Phishing attack that's targeting one specific individual."}, {"time": 3038, "text": "So he'll fashion a spear phishing email."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "And the way he does that is he pulls all the information he possibly can on that person, that CEO."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "Maybe he'll spear that CEO just to get their login credentials to their email, just to read the emails."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "And he'll go in there, and he'll start reading all these emails."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "He'll specifically read the emails to the payroll department, see what that relationship is."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "Are they talking

"text": "Are they sterile?"}, {"time": 3073, "text": "What are they doing, all right?"}, {"time": 3075, "text": "So then he decides, well, I'm going to go ahead and spear phish the payroll department as well."}, {"time": 3080, "text": "So then he spear phishes in, gets those credentials."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "At the same time, he creates a Unicode domain in whatever the company name is, all right?"}, {"time": 3087, "text": "So instead of that English alphabet I, he's got that Russian letter that looks like an I but without the dot on top, all right?"}, {"time": 3095, "text": "Comes back into the email, into the payroll email, blocks the real CEO's email, replaces that with the Unicode email that he's got, and then sends out a message using the correct language, the correct relationships, everything else, and says, hey, we're updating our account status, I need you to send this payment instead of over here, they've set up a new account, send all payments over here now."}, {"time": 3119, "text": "And that is business email compromise in a nutshell, all right, works great."}, {"time": 3124, "text": "Probably the larger the organization, the more susceptible to that kind of attack because there's like a distribution of responsibility to where you're more likely to believe that, okay, this other person is responsible, I'm sure they secured everything."},

example."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "So if my friend were to spear phish like a CEO, right, and get their information and after they get control, say, of their Twitter account, they tweet something

card number forward slash any 16 digits, it would encode."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "Take it to the ATM, pull cash out, because you got the pin, all right?"}, {"time": 5726, "text": "Well, wait, sorry, I'm trying to understand."}, {"time": 5728, "text": "So that means, so if there's no hash, are they generating random numbers or do they have valid numbers for track two?"}, {"time": 5737,

you in?"}, {"time": 5748, "text": "So back then, all right, back then, what we're talking about is you needed, typically today you need a whole track two."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "You need that valid track two."}, {"time": 5755, "text": "All right, you need the 16 digit card number, forward slash, and then whatever that algorithm does, the other side of it, all right?"}, {"time": 5763,

play."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "Now you had a couple of forerunners with eGold and Liberty Reserve, things like that."}, {"time": 5824, "text": "But back then it starts out with Western Union, then it becomes prepaid cards, sending track information over, loading the card up like that, and then finally you get to eGold, Liberty Reserve, and then today it's with crypto that's used."}, {"time": 5839, "text": "Started stealing a lot of money, a lot."}, {"time": 5843, "text": "And that got law enforcement attention."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "So we started to see, I mean, it's a crazy ass story."}, {"time": 5850, "text": "We started to see IPs coming in from law enforcement agencies, government agencies, because back then they didn't know how to shield their identity either."},

called a hack, but it wasn't a hack."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "We had a guy that worked at T Mobile in Los Angeles."}, {"time": 5878, "text": "This is the same guy that back then published Paris

fake driver's licenses, what have you."}, {"time": 5932, "text": "And then finally, we happened upon the California Death Index, all right?"}, {"time": 5938, "text": "Complete information, mother's maiden, socials, DOBs, all that, and it's like, gotta be a use for that."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "Well, you can use it to create identities all day long."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "My idea was, I wonder if you could take somebody that's died and then file for social security death benefit, not death benefits, but social security benefits for that individual, and get that recurring paycheck in."}, {"time": 5963, "text": "So that takes a lot of research to start seeing if you can do that."}, {"time": 5966, "text": "How does the federal government know if you're dead?"}, {"time": 5969, "text": "Do federal indexes reference state indexes?"}, {"time": 5972, "text": "You got all these questions that pop up."}, {"time": 5974, "text": "Well, it turns out, federal indexes don't reference state indexes, it's against the law."}, {"time": 5979, "text": "It also turns out, the only way the federal government knows you're dead is prior to 1998, the family had to file a social security

the family."}, {"time": 5998, "text": "After 98, the hospital can do it, funeral home can do it, or the family can do it."}, {"time": 6003, "text": "So a lot more people have it filed after, if

death benefit's only like $219, okay?"}, {"time": 6013, "text": "Nobody's thinking about that shit."}, {"time": 6015, "text": "So I started to apply for social security benefits."}, {"time": 6019, "text": "Nope, number's dormant."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "So they want you to come in for a physical interview."}, {"time": 6023, "text": "Here I am, you know, 32."}, {"time": 6026, "text": "You're not gonna pass as a 65 year old, so no."}, {"time": 6029, "text": "So the next idea I had was, I wonder if you could file income tax returns on these people."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "Turns out you can, all day long."}, {"time": 6040, "text": "So I started doing that."}, {"time": 6042, "text": "And I started to steal, once I got ramped up, because you test everything."}, {"time": 6046, "text":

"The other one was the Tor browser, the dark web."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "Now I was working with a secret service, ripping the secret service off, when Tor comes into play, all right?"}, {"time": 6814, "text": "So we got a memo in one day and it was talking about the Tor browser."}, {"time": 6818, "text": "And it was like, we really need to be careful with this."}, {"time": 6821, "text": "This is going to be problem."}, {"time": 6823, "text": "And so we all fired up the Tor browser and it turns out it was, this was 2005, early six."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "It turns out it was completely unusable, could not use it at all, simply because no one was using it and it was extremely slow."}, {"time": 6836, "text": "So for people who don't know, Tor browser is a way to be completely anonymous."}, {"time": 6841, "text": "As long as you properly know how to use it, huge caveat."}, {"time": 6844, "text": "All right, so developed by the United States Navy and they developed it."},

to this day, all right?"}, {"time": 6861, "text": "I mean, the same, I guess with the internet, the origins are the dark web and DOD."}, {"time": 6865, "text": "It was developed so that operatives could communicate with each other without being identified, all right?"}, {"time": 6871, "text": "That then goes open source."}, {"time": 6873, "text": "They release it, EFF comes in, start sponsoring and everything else like that."}, {"time": 6878, "text": "The next idea was, well, you know, people can get around their country's firewalls, whistleblowers can use it, things like that."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "Well, someone forgot to mention that the first adoptees of tech, if you can use it to launder money or remain anonymous, are criminals."}, {"time": 6892, "text": "And so criminals start to use the damn thing."}, {"time": 6896, "text": "So along the same time we get, well, a few years later, we get Satoshi Nakamoto pops up with his ideas for Bitcoin, and then Ross Ulbrich runs with it."}, {"time": 6907, "text": "Ross Ulbrich decides he's gonna start up Silk Road."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "So initially the people who were using Tor, which later is the dark web, people were using

trouble finding the box."}, {"time": 6928, "text": "So that is the advent of Silk Road all of a sudden."}, {"time": 6933, "text": "Ross Ulbrich has this idea that he's gonna change the world by becoming the largest drug dealer on the planet."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "So he opens up the Silk Road and the only payment instrument he allows is Bitcoin."}, {"time": 6946, "text": "So if those people out there are wondering why Bitcoin is going at what, 44K today?"}, {"time": 6951, "text": "Yeah, and by the time this is out, it could be 100,000 or 10,000."}, {"time": 6958, "text": "If it's 10,000, I'm going to buy some."}, {"time": 6964, "text": "Which is a hilarious statement to make because that statement would be ridiculously wrong like five years ago, right?"}, {"time": 6970,

course the initial use case of crypto is no one wants to admit it today, but the initial use case is we're gonna buy a bunch of pot."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "We need somebody, we need a way to pay for it."}, {"time": 6993, "text": "So that's what happens."}, {"time": 6995, "text": "Ross, it's really interesting to me."}, {"time": 6998, "text": "If you look at motivations of cyber criminals, the motivations are status, cash, ideology, all right?"}, {"time": 7008, "text": "My guys, all cash, across the board, all cash."}, {"time": 7012, "text": "Ross is ideology."}, {"time": 7014, "text": "He

you know, the cash guy, it's low hanging fruit."}, {"time": 7041, "text": "The ease of, it's hard to stop committing crime, but it's much easier for a cash motivated individual to stop than it is that

to."}, {"time": 7061, "text": "So it's... That's fascinating that, I mean, the worst atrocities in human history are committed with people that operate under ideology."}, {"time": 7071, "text": "All the other motivations are much weaker."}, {"time": 7073, "text": "But you know, you think about it, with Ross, I mean, very bright guy, very bright guy, but think about the amount of cognitive dissonance that the guy's got, that he thinks he's gonna change the world by running a drug site."}, {"time": 7089, "text": "I mean, certainly, I mean, could he have changed the world?"}, {"time": 7092, "text": "Yeah, could he have done it like that?"}, {"time": 7097, "text": "Well, I can steel man those arguments."}, {"time": 7099, "text": "I listened to quite a few libertarians and you can push that to anarchists."}, {"time": 7105, "text": "You know, there's a lot of people that argue..."}, {"time": 7108, "text": "So I actually talked to a professor at Columbia who actually argues that all drugs should be legalized and not at a

would agree with that."}, {"time": 7128, "text": "And so that's, okay, but that's more like a argument about negative aspects of drugs."}, {"time": 7133, "text": "I think the ideology comes in where

out?"}, {"time": 1150, "text": "So for people who don't know, I mean, obviously everyone knows that you've produced some of the greatest records ever, but the way I see that is you just brought out the best in a lot of interesting artists."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "And so in order to bring out the best in them, you have to understand them."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "You have to hear the music

understand."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "So if anything, I would draw you out further and just ask questions to really understand."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "And if you say, or if you say something that

is."}, {"time": 1280, "text": "And through questioning, we can usually get there."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Or through just spending time together, you find out who the person is."}, {"time": 1289,

like this?"}, {"time": 1396, "text": "And I'll think, that sounds bad, and then I'll think, okay, let's try it, and then we hear it, and then eight times out of 10, it's nothing like I imagined and
