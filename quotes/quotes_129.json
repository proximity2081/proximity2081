partisans of Newton's way of doing things, you were able to generate devices which reflect light in crystals, do various things that the Newtonian way could accommodate only after the fact."},

people who become what we now call physicists in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s in particular, then that's the direction you're going to go."}, {"time": 411, "text": "But there were holdouts until the 1850s."}, {"time": 411, "text": "I want to try to elaborate on the nature of the disagreement you have with Thomas Kuhn."}, {"time": 417, "text": "So do you still believe in paradigm shifts?"},

paradigm shifts come to be?"}, {"time": 429, "text": "How they come to be and how they change."}, {"time": 436, "text": "I certainly think they exist."}, {"time": 436, "text": "How strong they may be at any given time is maybe not quite as powerful as Tom thought in general."}, {"time": 445, "text": "Although towards the end of his life, he was beginning to develop different modifications of his original way of thinking."}, {"time": 451, "text": "But I don't think that the changes happened quite so neatly, if you will, in reaction to novel experimental observations."}, {"time": 467, "text": "They get much more complex than that."}, {"time": 467, "text": "In terms of neatness, how much of science progresses by individual lone geniuses and how much by the messy collaboration of competing and cooperating humans?"}, {"time": 485, "text": "I don't think you can cut that with a knife to say it's this percent and that percent."}, {"time": 498, "text": "It's almost always the case that there are one or two or maybe three individuals who are sort of central to what goes on when things begin to shift."}, {"time": 507, "text": "Are they inevitably and solely responsible for what then begins to happen in a major way?"}, {"time": 517, "text": "You can go very far back with this, even into antiquity to see what goes on."}, {"time": 528, "text": "The major locus we always talk about from the beginning is if you're talking about Galileo's work on motion, for example, were there ways of accommodating it that others could adapt to without buying into the whole scheme?"}, {"time": 551, "text": "Did it eventually evolve and start convincing people because you could also do other things with it that you couldn't otherwise do?"}, {"time": 559, "text": "Also, yes."}, {"time": 566, "text": "The great French mathematician philosopher Descartes, who was a mechanical philosopher, he believed the world was matter in motion."}, {"time": 572, "text": "He never thought much of what Galileo had done in respect to motion because he thought, well, at best, it's some sort of approximative scheme or something like that."}, {"time": 584, "text": "But one of his initial, I wouldn't call him a disciple, but follower, who then broke with him in a number of ways, was a man named Christian Huygens, who was, along with Newton, one of the two greatest scientists of the 17th century."}, {"time": 596, "text": "Huygens is older than Newton, and Huygens nicely deployed Galilean relationships in respect to motion to develop all sorts of things, including the first pendulum governed clock, and even figured out how to build one, which keeps perfect time, except it didn't work."}, {"time": 619, "text": "But he had the mathematical structure for it."}, {"time": 624, "text": "How well known is Huygens?"}, {"time": 628, "text": "Oh, very well known."}, {"time": 628, "text": "Should I know him well?"}, {"time": 631, "text": "Yes, you should."}, {"time": 633, "text": "You should definitely know him."}, {"time": 634, "text": "Can we define should here?"}, {"time": 640, "text": "So is this should like, yeah, can you define should?"}, {"time": 648, "text": "Should means this."}, {"time": 648, "text": "If you had taken up to a second year physics courses, you should, you would have heard his name because one of the fundamental principles in optics is called Huygens principle."}, {"time": 664, "text": "Yeah, so I have and I have heard his name."}, {"time": 667, "text": "No, but I don't remember."}, {"time": 668, "text": "But you don't remember."}, {"time": 669, "text": "So I mean, there's a very different thing between names attached to principles and laws and so on that you sometimes let go of, you just remember the equations of the principles themselves, and the personalities of science."}, {"time": 681, "text": "And there's certain personalities, certain human beings that stand out."}, {"time": 685, "text": "And that's why there's a sense to which the lone inventor, the lone scientist is the way I personally mean, I think a lot of people think about the history of science is these lone geniuses."}, {"time": 698, "text": "Without them, the senses, if you remove Newton from the picture, if you remove Galileo from the picture, then science would, there's almost a feeling like it would just have stopped there."}, {"time": 711, "text": "Or at the very least, there's a feeling like it would take much longer to develop the things that were developed."}, {"time": 717, "text": "Is that a silly way to look at the history?"}, {"time": 721, "text": "That's not entirely incorrect, I suppose."}, {"time": 721, "text": "I find it difficult to believe that had Galileo not existed, that eventually someone like Huygens, for instance, given the context of the time, what was floating around in the belief structure concerning the nature of the world and so on, the developments in mathematics and whatnot, that sooner or later, whether it would have been exactly the same or not, I cannot say."}, {"time": 754, "text": "But would things have evolved?"}, {"time": 761, "text": "If we look at the long arc of history of science, from back when we were in the caves trying to knock two rocks together, or maybe make a basic tool to a long time from now, many centuries from now, when human civilization finally destroys itself."}, {"time": 783, "text": "If we look at that history, and imagine you're a historian at the end, like with the fire of the apocalypse coming upon us, and you look back at this time in the 21st century, how far along are we on that arc?"}, {"time": 796, "text": "Do you sense?"}, {"time": 796, "text": "Have we invented and discovered everything that's to be discovered, or are we at like below 1%?"}, {"time": 806,

lugubrious means, but I love it."}, {"time": 819, "text": "Lugubrious."}, {"time": 824, "text": "Well, let me try and separate the question of whether we're all going to die in an apocalypse in several hundred years or not from the question of where science may be sitting."}, {"time": 837, "text": "Take that as an assumption."}, {"time": 837, "text": "I find that hard to say."}, {"time": 837, "text": "And I find it hard to say because in the deepest sense of the term, as it's usually deployed by philosophers of science today, I'm not fundamentally a realist."}, {"time": 857, "text": "That is to say, I think our access to the inner workings of nature is inevitably mediated by what we can do with the materials and factors around us."}, {"time": 870, "text": "We can probe things in various ways."}, {"time": 880, "text": "Does that mean that I don't think that the standard model in quantum electrodynamics is incorrect?"}, {"time": 887, "text": "I wouldn't even dream of saying such a thing."}, {"time": 892, "text": "It can do a lot, especially when it comes to figuring out what's happening in very large, expensive particle accelerators and applying results in cosmology and so on as well."}, {"time": 909, "text": "Do I think that we have inevitably probed the depths of reality through this?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "I do not agree with Steven Weinberg who thinks we have about such things."}, {"time": 916, "text": "Do I, on the other hand, think that the way in which science has been moving for the last hundred years, physics in particular is what I have in mind, will continue on the same course?"}, {"time": 930, "text": "In that sense, I don't because we're not going to be building bigger and bigger and more and more expensive machines to rip apart particles in various ways."}, {"time": 944, "text": "In which case, what are physicists going to do?"}, {"time": 944, "text": "They'll turn their attention to other aspects."}, {"time": 950, "text": "There are all sorts of things we've never explained about the material world."}, {"time": 957, "text": "We don't have theories that go beyond a certain point for all sorts of things."}, {"time": 964, "text": "Can we, for example, start with the standard model and work our way up all the way to chemical transformations?"}, {"time": 969, "text": "You can make an argument about it and you can justify things, but in chemistry, that's not the way people work."}, {"time": 977, "text": "They work with much higher level quantum mechanical relationships and so on."}, {"time": 982, "text": "This notion of the deep theory to explain everything is a longstanding belief which goes back pretty far, although I think it only takes its fullest form sometime towards the end of the 19th century."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "Maybe we just speak to that."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "You're referring to a hope, a dream, a reality of coming up with a theory of everything that explains everything."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "There's a very specific thing that that currently means in physics, is the unification of the laws of physics."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "But I'm sure in antiquity or before it meant maybe something else, or is it always about physics?"}, {"time": 1026, "text": "Because I mean, I think as you've kind of implied in physics, there's a sense once you get to the theory of everything, you've understood everything, but there's a very deep sense in which you've actually understood not very much at all."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "You've understood at that particular level how things work, but you don't understand how the abstractions on top of abstractions form, all the way to the chemistry, to the human mind, and the human societies, and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "So maybe you can speak to the theory of everything and its history and comment on what the heck does that even mean, the theory of everything."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "Well, I don't think you can go back that far with something like that."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "Maybe to the, at best, to the 17th century."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "If you go back all the way in antiquity, there are, of course, discussions about the nature of the world."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "But first of all, you have to recognize that the manipulative character of physics and chemistry, the probing of... Let me put it this way."}, {"time": 1134, "text": "That's not a belief that was widely held by pretty much anyone until sometime maybe in the 1500s."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "And when it was first held, it was held by people we now call alchemists."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "So alchemy was the first, the early days of the theory of everything, of a dream of a theory of everything."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "I would put it a little differently."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "I think it's more along the way, a dream that by probing nature in artificially constructed ways, we can find out what's going on deep down there."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "So that's distinct from science being an observing thing, where you observe nature and you study nature."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "You're talking about probing, like messing with nature to understand it."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "Indeed I am."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "But that, of course, is the very essence of experimental science."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "You have to manipulate nature to find out things about it, and then you have to convince others that you haven't so manipulated it that what you've done is to produce what amounts to fake artifactual behavior that doesn't really hold purely naturally."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "So where are we today in your sense to jump around a little bit with the theory of everything?"}, {"time": 1218, "text": "Maybe a quick kind of sense you have about the journey in the world of physics that we're taking towards the theory of everything."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "Well, I'm, of course, not a practicing physicist."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "I mean, I was trained in physics at Princeton a long time ago."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "Until Thomas Kuhn stole you away."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "More or less."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "I was taking graduate courses in those days in general relativity."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "I was an undergraduate, but I moved up and then I took a course with him and... Well, you made the mistake of being compelled by charismatic philosophers and never looked back."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "I suppose so in a way."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "From what I understand, talking especially to my friends at Caltech, like Kip Thorne and others, the fundamental notion is that actually the laws that even at the deepest level we can sort of divine and work with in the universe that we inhabit are perhaps quite unique to this particular universe as it formed at the Big Bang."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "The question is, how deep does it go?"}, {"time": 1294, "text": "If you are very mathematically inclined, the prevailing notion for several decades now has been what's called string theory, but that has not been able to figure a way to generate probative experimental evidence, although it's pretty good apparently at accommodating things."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Then the question is, what's before the Big Bang?"}, {"time": 1320, "text": "Actually, the word before doesn't mean anything given the nature of time, but why do we have the laws that prevail in our universe?"}, {"time": 1337, "text": "Well, there is a notion that those laws prevail in our universe because if they didn't, we wouldn't be here."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "That's a bit of a cyclical, but nevertheless, a compelling definition."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "And there's all kinds of things like it seems like the unification of those laws could be discovered by looking inside of a black hole because you get both the general relativity and the quantum mechanics, quantum field theory in there."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "Experimentally, of course, there's a lot of interesting ideas."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "We can't really look close to the Big Bang."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "We can't look that far back."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "Caltech and MIT will LIGO looking at gravitational waves, perhaps allows us to march backwards and so on."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "Yeah, it's really exciting space."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "And there's, of course, the theory of everything, like with a lot of things in science, captivates the dreams of those who are perhaps completely outside of science."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "It's the dream of discovering the key to the nature of how everything works."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "And that feels deeply human."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "That's perhaps the basic elements of what makes up a scientist in the end is that curiosity, that longing to understand."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "Let me ask, you mentioned a disagreement with Weinberg on reality."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "Could you elaborate a little bit?"}, {"time": 1419, "text": "Well, obviously, I don't disagree with Steve Weinberg on physics itself."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "I wouldn't know enough to even begin to do that."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "And clearly, you know, he's one of the founders of the standard model and so on."}, {"time": 1435, "text": "And it works to a level of accuracy that no physical theory has ever worked at before."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "I suppose the question in my mind is something that in one way could go back to the philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century, namely, can we really ever convince ourselves that we have come to grips with something that is not in itself knowable to us by our senses, or even except in the most remote way through the complex instruments that we make as to what it is that underlies everything?"}, {"time": 1481, "text": "Can we corral it with mathematics and experimental structures?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "Do I think that a particular way of corraling nature will inevitably play itself out?"}, {"time": 1497, "text": "It always has."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "I'll put it to you that way."}, {"time": 1506, "text": "So the basic question is, can we know reality?"}, {"time": 1506, "text": "Is that the Kant question?"}, {"time": 1506, "text": "Is that the Weinberg question?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "We humans, with our brains, can we comprehend reality?"}, {"time": 1518, "text": "Sounds like a very trippy question because a lot of it rests on definitions of know and comprehend and reality."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "But get to the bottom of it."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "It's turtles on top of turtles."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "Can we get to the bottom turtle and say hello?"}, {"time": 1544, "text": "Well, maybe I can put it to you this way in a way that I often begin discussions in a class on the history of science and so on, and say, I'm looking at you."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "You are in fact a figment of my imagination."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "You have a messed up imagination, yes."}, {"time": 1567, "text": "Well, what do I mean by that?"}, {"time": 1567, "text": "If I were a dragonfly looking at you, whatever my nervous system would form by way of a perceptual structure would clearly be utterly different from what my brain and perceptual system altogether is forming when I look at you."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "Is it me or the dragonfly?"}, {"time": 1611, "text": "Well, the dragonfly is certainly very impressive, so I don't know."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "But yes, the observer matters."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "What is that supposed to tell us about objective reality?"}, {"time": 1626, "text": "Well, I think it means that it's very difficult to get beyond the constructs that our perceptual system is leading us to."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "When we make apparatus and devices and so on, we're still making things, the results of which or the outputs of which we process perceptually in various ways."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "An analogy I like to use with students sometimes is this."}, {"time": 1650, "text": "All right, they all have their laptops open in front of them, of course."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "I've sent them something to read, and I say, okay, click on it and open it up."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "PDF opens up."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "I said, what are you looking at?"}, {"time": 1665, "text": "They said, well, I'm looking at the paper that you sent me."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "I said, no, you're not."}, {"time": 1671, "text": "What you're looking at is what you're looking at is a stream of light coming off LEDs or LCDs coming off a screen."},

about consciousness?"}, {"time": 1714, "text": "I'm asking for a friend trying to figure this thing out."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "Well, boy, I mean, I read a fair bit of science, but I don't know."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "I read a fair bit about that, but I certainly can't really say much about it."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "I'm a materialist in the deepest sense of the term."},

be discovered."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Maybe it permeates all matter."}, {"time": 1895, "text": "Maybe it's as simple as trying to plug it in and plug into the ability to generate and control that kind of law of physics that would crack open."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "Or we would understand that the bottle of water is in fact conscious, just much less conscious than us humans, and then we

to show you I think a little bit about what gets involved when you've got a smart individual who's trying to monkey around with stuff and finds new things about it."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "First, let me say that the prevailing notion going back to antiquity was that colors are produced in a sense by modifying or tinting white light, that they're modifications of white light."}, {"time": 2014,

following."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "He was by this time, even though he's very young, a very good mathematician."}, {"time": 2058, "text": "And he could use the then known laws for how light behaves when it goes through glass to calculate what should happen if you took light from the sun, passed it from a hole, through a little hole, then hit the prism, goes out of the prism, strikes a wall a long distance away and makes a splash of light, never mind the colors for a moment, makes a splash of light there."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "He was very smart."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "First of all, he abstracts from the colors themselves, even though that's what everybody's paying attention to initially."}, {"time": 2096, "text": "Because what he knows is this, he knows that if you take this prism and you turn it to a certain particular angle, that he knew what it should be because he could calculate things."}, {"time": 2109, "text": "Very few other people in Europe at the time could
