feel just the experience of it is ultimately of gratitude of how awesome it is to be alive."}, {"time": 364, "text": "But when you eat many times a day and you're pigging out and you don't get to experience that."}, {"time": 370, "text": "It's really like fasting is one of the most accessible things for people, I think to experience that kind of pairing of hardship to pleasure."}, {"time": 382, "text": "And in my case, it changed my life on a good way."}, {"time": 386, "text": "I cannot recommend it to people because everybody is different."}, {"time": 390, "text": "But to fight Michael Bisping, my last fight was against the champion in the heavier weight class that I used to compete at."}, {"time": 401, "text": "So I thought that if I would gain weight, it would increase my performance."}, {"time": 408, "text": "And I struggled a lot to gain weight."}, {"time": 410, "text": "I gained about eight to 10 pounds."}, {"time": 414, "text": "Normally I walk around 185 pounds."}, {"time": 416, "text": "And for that fight, I was walking around 195."}, {"time": 419, "text": "However, I forced myself to eat like six times a day."}, {"time": 424, "text": "I was on a very strict diet and it didn't feel right to me because I feel like I was carrying like a little bit like I was carrying a bag on my shoulder."}, {"time": 438, "text": "And I think it was a bad idea for me because when I did the weigh in and I went on a scale at 185, I couldn't go back to my initial weight that was 195 that I worked so hard for several months to get there."}, {"time": 458, "text": "So I was 190 pounds, but I couldn't get back."}, {"time": 462, "text": "And the morning of the fight, I got sick."}, {"time": 466, "text": "We didn't know what it was in the beginning because in order to know, to find out what it was, I needed to do what they call a colonoscopy."}, {"time": 475, "text": "They put a camera inside of you and to do that, they give you something that makes that empty you."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And I was trying to gain weight, not to lose weight."}, {"time": 486, "text": "So I told myself I'm going to wait after the fight, whatever it is, because it was pretty bad."}, {"time": 493, "text": "It was blood."}, {"time": 494, "text": "And I didn't know what I was."}, {"time": 495, "text": "I was very concerned."}, {"time": 496, "text": "I thought I had maybe cancer."}, {"time": 497, "text": "I was freaking out."}, {"time": 500, "text": "So I said, I'm going to do that fight."}, {"time": 502, "text": "And then after right away, I'm going to make a checkup."}, {"time": 505, "text": "So I did the fight."}, {"time": 506, "text": "Everything went well."}, {"time": 507, "text": "I won the fight."}, {"time": 508, "text": "I went back home."}, {"time": 509, "text": "I did a colonoscopy and I got diagnosed with ulcer colitis."}, {"time": 513, "text": "Then I got on very severe medication to get better."}, {"time": 517, "text": "And I'm not a big fan of medication."}, {"time": 519, "text": "I was trying to look for more natural way to get better."}, {"time": 526, "text": "And I found out about fasting and it really changed my life."}, {"time": 530, "text": "I met Dr. Jason Fong, who was one of the world authority of fasting."}, {"time": 539, "text": "He treat diabetes patient with fasting and he gave me a program of fasting and it really changed my life."}, {"time": 548, "text": "And right away what I did is I went in a CAT scan to see the difference because it was right after my fight with Michael Bisping and I did the CAT scan."}, {"time": 559, "text": "So I had my muscle mass, bone density, fat percentage, water retention."}, {"time": 567, "text": "It can show you which harm has more muscle than the other."}, {"time": 570, "text": "It's very precise."}, {"time": 572, "text": "And I did it like two months after."}, {"time": 575, "text": "So I started doing time restricted eating, 16 eight."}, {"time": 580, "text": "But right away when I started, I did three days water fast."}, {"time": 586, "text": "And the Dr. Jason Fong, he said, because I like to train during those days, I consume Himalayan salt to make sure, because when you sweat, there's a lot of minerals to make sure you don't deplete your mineral."}, {"time": 600, "text": "And when I compared the two results in the CAT scan, I found out my biggest concern was to lose muscle mass."}, {"time": 607, "text": "I found out that I did not lose muscle mass."}, {"time": 611, "text": "Instead of losing it, it increased a little bit."}, {"time": 614, "text": "Even though my weight on the scale was lighter, I kept the same muscle mass even increases a little bit."}, {"time": 622, "text": "My bone density increases a little bit."}, {"time": 625, "text": "My water retention is the biggest thing that decrease."}, {"time": 630, "text": "So my inflammation and my fat percentage."}, {"time": 633, "text": "So basically by looking at the data, I found out that by eating so much, trying to gain weight to fight Michael Bisping, it only increases my water retention, which is not good because it's like dead weight and inflammation on you."}, {"time": 650, "text": "So what was the actual process of fasting?"}, {"time": 654, "text": "You said 16, eight time restricted, so intermittent fasting."}, {"time": 659, "text": "But you also mentioned the three hour, the three day water fast."}, {"time": 663, "text": "What did that feel like?"}, {"time": 664, "text": "And you also said training during the three day?"}, {"time": 669, "text": "Can you give me some details of, this is fascinating."}, {"time": 672, "text": "So I do three days water fast, four times a year."}, {"time": 678, "text": "For me, I do it, everybody is different, but for me, I do it after New Year's."}, {"time": 684, "text": "Because during the holidays, that's when I eat bad foods and I drink."}, {"time": 689, "text": "I see it more like a cleansing, like a detox, so to speak."}, {"time": 694, "text": "Mental too, like psychological."}, {"time": 696, "text": "I do it after the New Year's, right before the summer, cut for the beach."}, {"time": 703, "text": "After the summer, because of the summer, I've been partying a little bit sometimes, let myself go."}, {"time": 708, "text": "And right before the holidays."}, {"time": 711, "text": "And I've tried, Dr. Phuong, he says to me, said, George, everybody's different because I'm a very active person and everybody has a different genetics."}, {"time": 721, "text": "So for me, I feel that three days is the sweet spot because I still train during those three days."}, {"time": 729, "text": "The first day, the first two days, I don't change nothing."}, {"time": 731, "text": "I train on my regular schedule."}, {"time": 734, "text": "However, on the third day, I modify a little bit."}, {"time": 739, "text": "I do something more easy and that's how I do it."}, {"time": 745, "text": "And I've tried before, because when I say three days is my sweet spot, I've tried to go up to five days."}, {"time": 753, "text": "But the problem is after my third days, I found out that I had a big problem sleeping."}, {"time": 759, "text": "I get into a hyperactive mode."}, {"time": 761, "text": "They call that the hunter gatherer mode, you know, like your brain, I mean, it's amazing."}, {"time": 768, "text": "Your creativity is at its peak, but you cannot sleep very well."}, {"time": 773, "text": "And sleeping for me, I think it's very important."}, {"time": 776, "text": "So that's why I do three days for me."}, {"time": 777, "text": "It's my sweet spot."}, {"time": 780, "text": "It's the four or five days when you start, see sleep is not important for me."}, {"time": 784, "text": "So the creativity is really important."}, {"time": 787, "text": "So it's very interesting the places your mind goes after a few days."}, {"time": 792, "text": "But I mean, what does it do to your mind?"}, {"time": 796, "text": "So you mentioned your body likes it."}, {"time": 798, "text": "In terms of training, do you find that it helps you focus and think?"}, {"time": 803, "text": "I mean, you're one of the great strategic thinkers in terms of martial arts."}, {"time": 808, "text": "Does it help with learning?"}, {"time": 810, "text": "Does it help with thinking?"}, {"time": 811, "text": "Does it help with strategizing and all of that?"}, {"time": 814, "text": "Well, unfortunately, I got into fasting after I retired."}, {"time": 819, "text": "I really wish people asked me, would you have done it during the time that you competed?"}, {"time": 828, "text": "I think we live in a society that we're bombarded by publicity."}, {"time": 832, "text": "Oh, buy this, eat protein, this, that."}, {"time": 836, "text": "And fasting, nobody makes money with it because there's nothing to sell."}, {"time": 842, "text": "I think that's why a lot of people have not heard about it."}, {"time": 846, "text": "And even for myself, if someone would have talked to me about the benefits of fasting when I was training before I got sick, I would probably have ignored him because it's hard to believe."}, {"time": 864, "text": "It sounds ridiculous."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Don't eat."}, {"time": 867, "text": "It's going to help your mind and you're going to gain muscle potentially."}, {"time": 871, "text": "And perhaps people have talked to me about it, but it went in one of my ears and got out from the other side, you know?"}, {"time": 879, "text": "But it really changed my life."}, {"time": 882, "text": "And I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and it helps me get rid of all my symptoms."}, {"time": 889, "text": "What I do is, I know a lot of people have ulcerative colitis and for me, I cannot recommend it to other people because everybody is different."}, {"time": 898, "text": "But for me, I made a lot of research of how people from ulcerative colitis got better."}, {"time": 905, "text": "And I found out that a lot of people that got that condition get better in the natural way through fasting, eating fermented food, collagen and bone broth and stuff like that."}, {"time": 917, "text": "And it made a huge difference in my life."}, {"time": 920, "text": "I just wish I would have known that before."}, {"time": 922, "text": "So do you have a specific diet wise stuff you like?"}, {"time": 926, "text": "So I've recently, another ridiculous sounding thing, but it makes me feel really good is very low carbs."}, {"time": 933, "text": "So keto, even carnivore, it sounds ridiculous."}, {"time": 939, "text": "But it makes me feel really good, even for performance."}, {"time": 942, "text": "Is Rogan has influenced you?"}, {"time": 944, "text": "He's a carnivore diet."}, {"time": 945, "text": "I was influenced actually by people, yeah."}, {"time": 949, "text": "There's I'll tell you where, because I was doing it before he was doing it."}, {"time": 954, "text": "It was popular in the endurance athlete community where it was fat adapted athletes, people who insane people who run 50 miles, 100 miles, they figured out that they could fuel their body by with fat that can go to fat as the source of energy as opposed to carbs."}, {"time": 973, "text": "So I remember hoping that I'll be able to learn how to run 50 miles and so on."}, {"time": 980, "text": "I've never done more than 22, but it, I just remember switching away from carbs and feeling really liberated."}, {"time": 990, "text": "Like I wasn't thinking about food as much."}, {"time": 993, "text": "I'm able to eat once a day and feel really good."}, {"time": 997, "text": "I mean, I think every everybody's body is different, but I think carbs make me lazy."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "Maybe it's because the crash, yeah, it's the crash, but also just psychologically something it it forces me to also think about food too much."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "Like it starts becoming, you know, our logistic, you said our society is so much about food."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "There's so many ads, so much advertisement and so much of our social life is about food."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "And so it's very easy to live life, like live day to day thinking, when is the next meal?"}, {"time": 1030, "text": "Like what am I going to eat for lunch?"}, {"time": 1031, "text": "What am I going to eat for dinner?"}, {"time": 1032, "text": "What am I going to eat for breakfast?"}, {"time": 1034, "text": "And if you're not careful, that's going to get in the way of you doing cool shit for like liberating yourself and thinking like, what am I actually passionate about in this life?"}, {"time": 1046, "text": "Like creating and forgetting to eat those kinds of things and still being able to fuel your body."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "It's been fascinating to, to figure out like later in life that carbs aren't necessary to function."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "Well, it makes me think like, we don't know anything about nutrition."}, {"time": 1066, "text": "You know, personally, I don't think I could have a diet without carbs."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "I love chocolate too much."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "For me eating, it's a, it's a pleasure of life."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "I love my carbs."}, {"time": 1078, "text": "I love my sugar."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "However, if you talk about that, I don't have a specific diet, but recently I, what I'm trying to do is the days that I do not work out, I only eat once."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "That's kind of my rules."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "Plus I try to respect 16 eight and do my three day fast, uh, uh, four times a year."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "But the rest of the thing, I, I, I, I let myself loose because I, I don't think I would be happy if I, if I, uh, if I, if I don't give myself the, the, the, the right to, to eat for me personally, I love to eat so much next."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "And you talk about a diet, carnivore diet is very interesting because I, um, a few years ago I went to Africa in, uh, Masai Mara and, uh, it's a tribe in, uh, in, in, uh, East Africa and, um, I want to visit them."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "I did a safari and I talked to them and these guys, they, their diet is 99% carnivore."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "They they, that's crazy."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "And you should see they're very beautiful people shredded."}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Some people would say, Oh, it's genetic."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "I'm like, yeah, maybe it's genetic."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "But I mean, think about the Eskimos also that like most of their diet is on, on fish, right?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "They, they, so I believe it can be done, you know, like, I believe it can be done and like an exclusive carnivore diet."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "And I, I think I'm going to try it pretty soon just to have the experience, you know, to see how it feels like."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "Well, you're going to hang out with Joe, uh, be careful bringing it up because he'll convince you to, uh, forever switch to carnivore."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "He loves it."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "I mean, but just like you, I think he loves food."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "So he's, he can't ever stay on carnivore."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "It was funny cause we went to an Italian restaurant together and I still only eat meat."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "Like I love, um, I love the constraints of discipline."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "That's, that's partially why I like carnivore."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "I like saying no to food that is delicious."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "But a part of the problem is that I don't know how to moderate."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "You said chocolate."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "I don't know how to have one chocolate."}, {"time": 1215, "text": "Is that something you're able to do?"}, {"time": 1217, "text": "Have like in moderation?"}, {"time": 1219, "text": "No, it's when it, when I have an opportunity, I do it."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "I don't have any, I'm an extremist person, uh, Lex, I, I, that's the thing I, when I, when I have a chance, I, I like, I, I just eat, I go too much."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "And that's why I like about my life, you know, that's what I like about fasting."}, {"time": 1237, "text": "Because probably if I would not have discovered fasting, eating chocolate would give me cramps and all sorts of problems because people on ulcer colitis, normally they cannot eat chocolate."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "They cannot drink alcohol."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "But I believe because I'm fasting, that's the reason why I'm medication, medicine, medication free."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want, but I have to do that, that fasting, you know, and now it becomes to a, it became to a point that it's no longer hard for me."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "It's like normal."}, {"time": 1268, "text": "I don't even force myself."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "I don't, it's easy."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "Some of my friends thinks I'm, think I'm, I'm insane, you know, but I tell them it's like with, when you get used to it, it becomes like an habit."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "And, and I'm, and I know that hunter gatherer, like our ancestor did not eat three times a day."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "It's, it's, it's not true."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "They, they ate one day they could, and when they eat, they, they, they, they feed themselves as much as they can until that, because the next time, because they didn't know when they, they could eat again."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "So it's, I think that's how we're, we're, we're built, you know, to, to, to have this similar lifestyle."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "If we could take a step back to the discussion about fear a little bit."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "So Mike Tyson talks about this process of him walking to the ring."}, {"time": 1320, "text": "He sounds similar to you in many ways of the anxiety and the fear that he experiences."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "And he has this sort of story that he tells about walking to the ring and being supremely afraid."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "But as he walks and gets closer and steps in, he finds the confidence and becomes supremely confident."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "I think he calls himself like a God."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "I feel like a God in the ring."}, {"time": 1344, "text": "Is, is, do you go through a similar process of finding the confidence?"}, {"time": 1348, "text": "Well, it, yes."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "And I use, I use a James Lange theory that they did."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "So what I do is because I'm, I'm, I'm not afraid to admit that I'm afraid."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "And in the beginning of my career, I really thought I asked myself, because I was very good in mixed martial, but I, I really thought I wasn't made for this because the idea of fighting didn't, was, was, didn't make me happy."}, {"time": 1383, "text": "It's something like I, I was, I was forced to do in order to keep that lifestyle that I have and achieve my goal."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Perhaps one day to make enough money to retire and you know, that, that was my dream."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "But when I was looking around the gym where I was training, most of my training partner, they were happy."}, {"time": 1403, "text": "They were excited."}, {"time": 1404, "text": "And sometime I corner, I corner a lot of guys and they're happy and they're in the locker room."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "They don't react the same way I do."}, {"time": 1410, "text": "Some perhaps does, but if you see me in the locker room, like when I get like my last fight with Michael Bisping, just to give you an example in my last fight with Michael Bisping, because it's fresh, it's the one that is the most recent and, but it's always the same thing."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "My last fight in Bisping, I get in the locker room, I like three guys that I train with, Mickey Gall, Eamon Zahabi and Joseph Duffy."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "They all lost."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "It was like, like my, my locker room was basically cursed."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "You know, when you're in a locker room and people from your locker room leave for a fight and then they come back, it's kind of a momentum, you know, you, you, you shake and yeah, good job."}, {"time": 1455, "text": "Now it's my turn."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "You know, it's kind of a team brotherhood sort of thing."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "So the, the, the, the atmosphere in my locker room was pretty bad."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "It was like going to a, you know, like a funeral."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "So I was very scared and before every fight, I asked myself, I asked myself always, shit, what the hell I'm doing here?"}, {"time": 1481, "text": "Why did I choose to come back?"}, {"time": 1484, "text": "And I'm freaking out."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "However, I'm putting on a mask like I'm acting because if I don't do that, it will reflect on my coaches."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "And if my coach, my, my, the confidence of my coaches is affected, it will reflect, reflect on me."}, {"time": 1500, "text": "So I need to feel strong."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "I need to make them believe that I'm excited to be there and I'm happy to be there."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "So this sort of play start when I get, when I first step in the locker room, even though I feel completely different, but that's how I play it."}, {"time": 1520, "text": "Normally the day, the fight day, I never fell, feel a hundred percent."}, {"time": 1524, "text": "I always feel exhausted, tired."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "My highs are hitching because I don't sleep enough the few nights before, because I'm constantly rehearse, rehearsing scenarios that might happen in the fight."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "So mentally it's not that I'm not on top, but you keep all that to yourself."}, {"time": 1543, "text": "I keep it to myself and I'm lying to everybody around me."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "But everybody knows, you know, fair ass John De Niro, they know Freddie Rose, they've been with me for a long time, so they know what's going on, but at least I'm lying to them."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "I'm like, I'm feeling great."}, {"time": 1560, "text": "So, and seeing all my training partner, like very disappointed because they lost our fight."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Some were badly hurt as well."}, {"time": 1570, "text": "So I remember I started to warm up and everything."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "And as you start to warm up, you become a different person because we know that certain posture and yoga can affect your mental state."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "But I would say it's a little bit the same thing in fighting, you know, like when you started hitting the pads, your muscle memory, your instincts comes back and you remember that you're good at this, you know, and your confidence start to grow."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "And as seeing your trainers holding the pad and repeating your moves, it makes you also remember all the sacrifice you have done through your training camp and confidence come from how you prepared yourself."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "And even you're afraid, you can be confident in the same time."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "Being afraid and being confident is two different things."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "And before every fight, just right before I walk in, when I'm scared, I go in the bathroom and I look at myself in the mirror."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "I used to have a bandana and a gi, but now I didn't have this for my last fight because of the new Reebok deal they had."}, {"time": 1642, "text": "But I did the same rehearsal that I always do."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "I look at myself in the mirror and I start to compliment myself."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "Like even if I don't believe it, I'm starting to trying to believe it as I am."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "I'm finding all the reasons why I'm going to win the fight."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "And all my trainer knows that before every fight, when the guy from the UFC goes and Steppen Maroon says, St. Pierre, you're up next, I always take a few minutes to do that same rehearsal."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "And
