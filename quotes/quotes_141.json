kinds or abandonment issues or anything."}, {"time": 428, "text": "So we tend to focus on just what we need to survive and what we need for work and esteem."}, {"time": 433, "text": "And so psychedelics, by dissolving this ego control or by with MDMA kind of strengthening our sense of self and our sense of self acceptance, we can bring in other information that have previously been too complicated or too painful."}, {"time": 452, "text": "You don't think of psychedelics as conjuring up something new."}, {"time": 456, "text": "It is more revealing something that is already there."}, {"time": 459, "text": "I think that's a very crucial thing."}, {"time": 461, "text": "So yes, Sasha Shulgin who sort of the godfather of MDMA, he sort of rediscovered it and brought it back into use."}, {"time": 477, "text": "He talked about his first experience was with mescaline."}, {"time": 481, "text": "His first psychedelic experience was with mescaline and he had a tremendous experience."}, {"time": 486, "text": "But what he said about it was he was having a human experience that the mescaline was helping him access rather than that he was having a mescaline experience."}, {"time": 497, "text": "So that it's not like you pop a pill and you always have the same kind of experience as everybody else."}, {"time": 502, "text": "The experience is not contained in the pill."}, {"time": 504, "text": "The pill opens you up and you have an experience of yourself."}, {"time": 509, "text": "Sometimes these are experiences that we've never consciously had."}, {"time": 512, "text": "But we can say right now that we know that our body below the level of our conscious awareness has all these self healing mechanisms."}, {"time": 522, "text": "And we don't modulate them to a large extent by conscious control."}, {"time": 528, "text": "I mean, eventually we are learning more about the mind body and we learn about the placebo effect, how what we think is the case."}, {"time": 534, "text": "But I think that there's experiences that are below our level of conscious awareness, particularly once we're adults that are more of these unit of mystical experiences, sense of connection."}, {"time": 546, "text": "I think kids are like this a lot."}, {"time": 547, "text": "We kind of come from the void, you could say, and you're born and you have a different way of processing information."}, {"time": 554, "text": "One interesting point about that has to do with ketamine, which is been approved as ketamine for depression, but it's used for anesthesia."}, {"time": 565, "text": "And roughly one 10th the anesthetic dose is a psychedelic dose."}, {"time": 571, "text": "And when it's used in anesthesia, there's what's called the emergent phenomena."}, {"time": 576, "text": "So this is, you get enough ketamine for, you can be operated on, you're not in pain, you're not really there, your ego's knocked out, but you can still breathe."}, {"time": 586, "text": "But as the operations get over and then people metabolize the ketamine, there's a process that they call the emergent phenomena."}, {"time": 594, "text": "It's like as you're emerging from this tranquilized state, and that's where you pass through the psychedelic phase."}, {"time": 601, "text": "And they don't prepare people for that."}, {"time": 603, "text": "And what we see is that a lot of adults have difficult times with that, but children don't seem to have those problems."}, {"time": 612, "text": "Children are a little bit more already in this kind of state."}, {"time": 615, "text": "And so ketamine is used quite frequently in children now for anesthesia."}, {"time": 622, "text": "So all of that is to say to your question that I think the psychedelics reveal things that are within us."}, {"time": 630, "text": "Some things that are how we process information back when we were children."}, {"time": 635, "text": "Other things that we've never thought of before that are sort of baked into our consciousness."}, {"time": 641, "text": "There's one drug, 5MeO DMT."}, {"time": 646, "text": "It's this toxin from a Sonoran toad that many people consider it to be the most powerful of all the psychedelics."}, {"time": 654, "text": "And it kind of knocks the ego structures completely out of it and we experience something different, but it's something I think that's always within us."}, {"time": 663, "text": "It's at a deeper layer."}, {"time": 664, "text": "So we knock out some of the higher cognitive functions and then we experience things in a different way."}, {"time": 669, "text": "So my sense is that these are human experiences that the psychedelics bring us to."}, {"time": 675, "text": "Yeah, it's really profound."}, {"time": 676, "text": "And DMT is a really interesting example."}, {"time": 678, "text": "So Terence McKenna has talked about these machine elves."}, {"time": 684, "text": "And there's this, I think from the people I've heard speak about the experience, there's a sense that you are traveling elsewhere to meet entities, whether they're elves or not."}, {"time": 698, "text": "So in your sense, you're not traveling elsewhere."}, {"time": 702, "text": "You're just revealing something that's within and maybe it's a particular mechanism of revealing what's already within."}, {"time": 710, "text": "Yeah, and I knew Terence."}, {"time": 711, "text": "I spent a lot of time talking with Terence and I do not ascribe to a lot of things that he was saying."}, {"time": 718, "text": "He was a tremendous entertainer and I think he did a lot of really good things and focused us on the power of psychedelics."}, {"time": 725, "text": "But I think I've never seen these quote machine elves."}, {"time": 730, "text": "I think culture is more determinative of what people experience under psychedelics, your preconceptions, than we give it credit for."}, {"time": 742, "text": "And so I think there's a lot of priming that you could say that people receive by stories from their culture."}, {"time": 753, "text": "With ayahuasca, it's about jaguars and Amazonian animals."}, {"time": 757, "text": "And so I think these machine elves are this construct of Terence that other people do see."}, {"time": 766, "text": "There's actually some people that are very interested in doing a study and that they're well funded and moving toward it to keep people on an IV infusion of DMT for them specifically to see, do they contact machine elves or aliens and what kind of information do they bring back from these other selves, other places or other entities?"}, {"time": 794, "text": "One question is, who are we?"}, {"time": 796, "text": "Are we connected to everything in the universe?"}, {"time": 800, "text": "We certainly know in many cases, you talk about waves or particles, the quantum approach."}, {"time": 807, "text": "So I don't interpret experiences that we have of some entity that's somehow or other deep in our consciousness that's not us."}, {"time": 819, "text": "It's a part of who we are."}, {"time": 821, "text": "So I tend to interpret it in that way."}, {"time": 823, "text": "The question is, how big are we?"}, {"time": 829, "text": "And how many ideas are within us that can be revealed by changing the perspective?"}, {"time": 836, "text": "You mentioned physics."}, {"time": 839, "text": "What physicists, especially mathematical physicists or mathematicians do is they reveal truths by taking a slightly different perspective on a problem that reveals the simplicity of how it actually works in totally new ways."}, {"time": 858, "text": "That's what Einstein did."}, {"time": 860, "text": "Like every progress in physics and certainly every progress in mathematics requires you to take a different perspective."}, {"time": 868, "text": "And then perhaps that's exactly what psychedelics are doing."}, {"time": 872, "text": "It's not that they're contacting aliens that are elsewhere."}, {"time": 876, "text": "It may be revealing the connection between us and other living life forms, or actually it might be revealing a totally new perspective on what life is or what consciousness is and giving us a glimpse at that even though our cognitive capabilities are limited to fully grasp and understand it."}, {"time": 896, "text": "So it's just giving us an inkling of that somehow."}, {"time": 898, "text": "And it seems perhaps a little ridiculous not from a scientific perspective in the sense that we don't have a good physics of life or physics of intelligence or physics of consciousness, but getting a glimpse of that is giving us a little bit of maybe an intuition of which way to head to build such a physics."}, {"time": 922, "text": "Yeah, yeah, I think so."}, {"time": 923, "text": "I think that there's this other concept I guess I would like to talk about briefly, this Jungian collective unconscious, this idea that somehow or other everything that has ever happened is still accessible, maybe not with as much data or as much resolution, but that there's wave resonances."}, {"time": 949, "text": "So that I do believe that we can have experiences as part of this human collective unconscious that we're not from our own life."}, {"time": 961, "text": "And that we can, it's like the holographic realities and that there is a way to gather information that can be accurate about other times and places through depth investigations of our own consciousness."}, {"time": 980, "text": "But I think what I tend to believe is that it's because there's emotional resonances between where we're at now in this life and other kind of experiences that people have had before."}, {"time": 997, "text": "And we always hear about everybody who talks about past lives, they're always kings and queens."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "So I think that's again, you filter things what you want to be true."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "But I do think that there is a way to access information beyond what we've taken in in our own temporal existence through our own five senses."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "In some ways, I really find that compelling, the notion that that information is already there and you're simply just moving the attention of your mind to different parts of that."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "Yeah, I mean, we have that with the radio."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "I mean, you got a frequency, you turn all this information, you could actually say right now in the space between us, we have the whole world's knowledge that's up on the internet."}, {"time": 1043, "text": "It's right here."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "But we don't see it."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "We just have to tune in."}, {"time": 1048, "text": "What are the interesting differences, would you say, between the various psychedelics that you mentioned, ayahuasca, DMT, acid, LSD, marijuana, mescaline, PCP, psilocybin, MDMA?"}, {"time": 1062, "text": "You mentioned a few of them that are really interesting."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "We'll talk about scientifically some of the different studies that have been conducted on each, but sort of at the high level."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "What are some interesting differences?"}, {"time": 1074, "text": "Well, one of the big ones that people make a big deal of that I think is completely misplaced is some are from nature, some are from the lab."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "So there's this kind of like romantic thought that if it's from nature, it's good."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "If it's from the lab, it's somehow tainted by humanity."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "And therefore, some people are like all for plant psychedelics."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "We see the policy changes that have been happening in a couple of cities, Cambridge, Somerville, not far from where we're at now, where they decriminalize plant medicines."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "So they call it decriminalizing nature."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "So I think that there is, from my perspective, certain things from nature are poison, certain things from the lab are spiritual, even if they don't show up in nature, like LSD."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "Now there is something, LSD is lysergic acid diethylamide."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "There is lysergic acid amide, LSA, which comes from morning glory seeds."}, {"time": 1136, "text": "So it's very similar."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "But at the same time, I'd say, I don't buy into that distinction that there's some fundamental preference."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "One of the things that Terence McKenna, since we talked about him, he talked about how if it's from nature, it's good."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "And if it's not, we should be suspect."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "Of course, he had a lot of great LSD experiences."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "But actually Terence, in 1984, we were at Esalen with a bunch of other people."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "This was before the crackdown on MDMA."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "And this was some of the underground therapists and the above ground researchers who were trying to talk about how to protect MDMA from this eventual crackdown."}, {"time": 1177, "text": "And Terence was like, forget about it."}, {"time": 1180, "text": "It's from the lab."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "It's dangerous."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "We have thousands of years of history, all these other things."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And what do we know about MDMA and blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "I was like, Terence, you're so unscientific."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Another way to say it is, and I just said, we need a study of the safety of MDMA."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "And so then Dick Price, who started Esalen, I said, I'll put a thousand, Dick Price, he put a thousand."}, {"time": 1204, "text": "So Terence was actually the catalyst for the first study with MDMA."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "Just because he was so frustrating about how plants are okay."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "And if it's from the lab, it's bad."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "So that's one distinction."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "The other distinction is that he was a scientist."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "The other distinction is this sense of classic psychedelics versus things like MDMA."}, {"time": 1227, "text": "So to what extent do they dissolve the ego?"}, {"time": 1231, "text": "And you could say, to what extent do they cause visions?"}, {"time": 1234, "text": "The 5HT2A serotonin receptor subtype, which is responsible for a lot of that where these drugs are activating."}, {"time": 1245, "text": "Now, mescaline of all the psychedelics, chemically, it's the most similar to MDMA."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "It's a phenethylamine, which is MDMA."}, {"time": 1253, "text": "So in the 50s, there was the, 53, I think it was, the Army Chemical Warfare Service wanted to look at drugs for interrogations, mind control, nonlethal incapacitants."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "They did a study in eight substances."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "These were now toxicity studies in animals."}, {"time": 1273, "text": "And on the one side was methamphetamine, and the other was mescaline, and MDMA was in the middle, chemically."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "So mescaline of these psychedelics tends to have the warmth that MDMA has."}, {"time": 1287, "text": "It's not as ego dissolving quite as some of the others."}, {"time": 1290, "text": "I mean, it's the main active ingredient in peyote."}, {"time": 1292, "text": "It is very psychedelic, very visual."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "Another distinction with these different drugs is how long they last."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "And a lot of that has to do with the route of administration."}, {"time": 1305, "text": "So for example, if you smoke DMT, it takes 10, 15 minutes, and you're, within seconds, you're off in another world."}, {"time": 1314, "text": "Similarly, 5MeO DMT, very rapid."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "When you take DMT in the form of ayahuasca, where it's mixed with another substance that makes it so that it's orally active, then it's a couple hours."}, {"time": 1330, "text": "So LSD is eight, 10, 12 hours sometimes."}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Psilocybin is more like five or six hours, or four to six hours."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "MDMA is similar."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "It's one reason why in our research, we give an initial dose of MDMA, and then two hours later, we give half the initial amount to extend the plateau, because we want it to last longer for people to be in this therapeutic state."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "So that's another distinction is how long these drugs last."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "Another distinction is which of them come from a religious context, have a religion built around them."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "We have this sense that some people are saying that 5MeO DMT and the Sonoran Toad, that they have this long history of indigenous use, but they don't, that's all modern, it's made up, and it's kind of a new approach."}, {"time": 1381, "text": "However, there was thousands of years of use of psilocybin mushrooms in religious contexts."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "From 1600 BC to 396 AD, the world's longest mystery ceremonies, the Eleusinian Mysteries, sort of the heart of Greek culture, the heart of Western culture, that was a psychedelic potion called Kikion that seems like it's very much like an LSD like substance."}, {"time": 1409, "text": "Aragat on grain and LSD comes from Aragat."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "So I think that there are a lot of ways to look at these different substances."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "Another distinction is which one of them are being researched right now in scientific context and which are not."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "And because of the rise of all these for profit companies and everybody's looking for what they can patent, what they can claim, the land grab, more and more there are companies looking at every different kind of psychedelics."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "The ones that are most important that are not being researched, Mescaline, but now there's a company to do Mescaline, the Jernico Lab, Ibogaine, which is crucial for opiate addiction."}, {"time": 1457, "text": "There's a new company, a branch of this company, Atai, that's gonna be looking at Ibogaine."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "So I'd say the rise of the for profit companies is making it so that there's just gonna be an enormous amount of investigations into all these different psychedelics."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "But what we're gonna see is the development of new psychedelics that we don't know anything about that have not existed yet because a lot of these for profit companies are gonna wanna invent and patent and have composition of matter patents on new molecules."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "So I think we'll see a lot of that happening too."}, {"time": 1539, "text": "Well, you reminded me, I'll get to exactly what you said, but you reminded me of a talk I heard by Buckminster Fuller shortly before he died."}, {"time": 1549, "text": "And what he talked about is how technology was making things ever smaller, that we are able to pack more and more information into smaller and smaller spaces and that we're developing technologies of communications with people, we now know the internet and things like that."}, {"time": 1568, "text": "But what he said is that he thought the eventual evolution of this sort of research would move from this miniaturization to telepathy."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "And that was like a shocking thing for somebody like scientific like that to say that."}, {"time": 1587, "text": "So will we unlock those parts where I talked about the collective unconscious?"}, {"time": 1593, "text": "Will we be able to more consciously explore those areas?"}, {"time": 1599, "text": "So I think that that's a possibility."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "There was Stan Groff, who's the world's leading LSD researcher and has been my mentor, his wife Brigida."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "They were talking about stories that they had heard about MDMA that people take and then on top of that, they do 5MEO DMT."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "And so you get this ego dissolution, but underneath it, you have this sense of ego, sort of sense of self safety, of self acceptance, kind of grounds it."}, {"time": 1635, "text": "So Stan was like, that's the future of psychiatry, that you can watch without the terror of the ego dissolution, the sense that you're losing your mind or you're going crazy or you're dying, or that you have this grounded sense of safety while you're dissolving your normal sense of how you see things."}, {"time": 1653, "text": "And being able to engineer in a fine tuned way that exact experience, maybe fine tuned to the person, as opposed to sort of this manual potion that's through experiment."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Although I don't know about fine tuning things to the person in the sense that we believe there's this inner healer, this kind of inner healing intelligence."}, {"time": 1675, "text": "We talked about it, the body repairs itself."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "So I think we more need to create safety for people and then what emerges will be customized to what they need to be looking at from this inner healing intelligence."}, {"time": 1689, "text": "At the same time, we will move to, we hear so much about the new approaches to oncology where you do genetic analysis of different kinds of tumors and then you have certain kind of chemotherapy agents and you do like personalized chemotherapy."}, {"time": 1707, "text": "I think we will have more like personalized psychedelic therapy, but it'll be more like a sequence of different drugs that people go through over an extended period of time and then you kind of customize what's next and sometimes you'll combine different drugs together like this 5MeO DMT and MDMA or a lot of times people do LSD MDMA combinations or psilocybin MDMA combinations."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "Chemistry is not my strength."}, {"time": 1736, "text": "I'm more into clinical applications and policy, but I can say that from what I've learned from reading from others and research done by others that different psychedelics have an impact on different neurotransmitters, different other parts of energies in the brain."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "The default mode network is what's considered to be like our sense of self and it's part of the brain that sort of is what I described before, scanning the world and filtering information for what's really important to us and both focusing us on things and also helping us to ignore a lot of things."}, {"time": 1815, "text": "So there's a lot of work that Sasha Shulgin and Albert Hoffman who invented LSD and first synthesized psilocybin on what they call structure activity relationships."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "What is the structural molecule and then how do you predict what that new molecule that never existed before is going to do once you actually take it?"}, {"time": 1835, "text": "And you can get close, but you never really know until you actually take the drug."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "And the way that Sasha ran his experiments is that he would take the drugs himself first in low doses and he would sort of step up the doses to have more experiences."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "If he thought it was valuable, he'd share it with his wife, Ann, but then what they would do is if they both thought it was valuable, they had a group of 12 people that they were with for many, many years and they would distribute these new drug to these 12 people and they would get the different perspectives."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "So there's still a lot of mysteries as far as structure activity relationships and it's not gonna be the case that people go into the lab and they tinker with molecules and they know exactly what they're gonna get."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "And a lot of it has to do with not so much chemistry as morphology."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "You could say the shape of the molecule and how does that interact with receptor sites."}, {"time": 1919, "text": "And so we're getting better at modeling all of that."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "And how does that interaction relate to the morphing of the human experience and deeply understanding that perhaps there's no equations yet for that kind of thing."}, {"time": 1933, "text": "You really have to build up intuition by experiencing it."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "And over time and sort of subjective self report, like trying to build an understanding of the effects of the different chemistries."}, {"time": 1944, "text": "Yeah, you can have approximate ideas, but to know exactly."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "So when I first tried MDMA, which was 1982 and this was after I had done lots of LSD and mescaline and mushrooms, I was shocked at how different it was than these other substances and yet how profound it was."}, {"time": 1969, "text": "So are there whole new kind of categories of classes of drugs that we're not aware of that would be not so much this like eco dissolution or emotional?"}, {"time": 1981, "text": "Well, what MDMA does is reduces activity in the amygdala, the fear processing part of the brain."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "So it's not just chemistry, but it routes energy throughout the brain in a different way."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "It increases activity in the prefrontal cortex."}, {"time": 1995, "text": "So you think more logically, that I think has an enormous impact on the effect of MDMA."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "The other thing it does is it increases connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "So it helps facilitate processing of things into longterm memory."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "And with PTSD, trauma is like never in the past, it's always about to happen."}, {"time": 2016, "text": "So will we one time develop drugs that would even be specific to certain kinds of memories?"}, {"time": 2023, "text": "We're working with a woman, Rachel Yehuda, who is at the Bronx VA, and she's done some studies that are with the epigenetics of trauma."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "So she's worked with Holocaust survivors and their children, and she has identified epigenetic mechanisms by which trauma is passed from generation to the generations."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Sort of like set points for anxiety, fear, certain things like that."}, {"time": 2051, "text": "But the question is, can you actually transmit memories from one generation to the next?"}, {"time": 2058, "text": "Now, this is not DNA changes which happen over a very long period of time and evolutionary scale."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "But within one lifetime, within some experiences, your epigenetics, what turns on the genes or turns off certain genes, that can be impacted."}, {"time": 2077, "text": "And that's what we know now can be transmitted from generation to generation, either by the father or the mother through the sperm or the egg."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "So it's pretty remarkable."}, {"time": 2088, "text": "So what Rachel's gonna try to do is MDMA research for PTSD and look at these epigenetic markers before and after and see if they change as a consequence of therapy."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "So will we develop one day certain kind of chemicals that will be able to bring certain kind of memories to the surface?"}, {"time": 2110, "text": "That's not inconceivable."}, {"time": 2112, "text": "The epigenetic angle is fascinating, that there'll be these epigenetic perturbations that lead to memories living from one generation to the other and then bringing those memories to the surface and using that as signal to

we store all these memories and in the stories that we get passed out."}, {"time": 2144, "text": "Especially with a lot of shared, you talk about the Holocaust or World War II, where it's deeply ingrained in the culture, the impact of those events and sort of in aggregate the different perspectives on that particular event create a set of stories that you can plug into."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "And then they kind of resonate with some aspect of you that creates a memory that's connected to, like when I think about World War II and the Holocaust, I think about my own family, but in some sense, it's also resonating with stories of many others."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "So it's like somehow the two echo each other and I'm just providing my own little flavor on top."}, {"time":

really fascinating, really plugging into like precisely plugging into particular memories as a way to deal with trauma and PTSD, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2207, "text": "Yeah, I'll just add that the most important dream of my life ever was of a Holocaust survivor telling me that he was miraculously saved from death and he knew that he was saved for a particular purpose, but he never knew what that purpose was."}, {"time": 2226, "text": "So in the dream, I'm seeing him on his deathbed and then he shows me whatever happened to him during the Holocaust."}, {"time": 2233, "text": "And then

tell you to be a psychedelic therapist and to study psychedelics and bring back psychedelic research."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "And I thought to myself, I've already decided to do this."}, {"time":

2258, "text": "So I think that that kind of cultural transmission that I got from when I was really young, then manifested in this dream."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "And that was this story about how people can be incredibly vicious and can be very motivated by irrational factors."}, {"time": 2278, "text": "And so I just feel that this kind of multi generational transmission of this story of the irrational being a murderous factor and something I needed to respond to was deeply ingrained."}, {"time": 2295, "text": "And I would say my guess is more culturally than this epigenetic mechanism."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "Yeah, but your sense is that whatever stimulated a certain part of human nature in World War II, especially Nazi Germany, but also in Stalinist Soviet Union, still is within us, within all of us."}, {"time": 2320, "text": "Just like what we're saying, we embody quite a lot of things."}, {"time": 2327, "text": "And one of those is whatever the capacity for evil seems to be one of those things."}, {"time": 2336, "text": "Yeah, there's a quote from Carl Jung from just a few years before he died."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "What he says, and I'll just paraphrase it is that

period of five, 10 minutes of just feeling part of this enormous wave of billions of years of evolution, how I had this sense that in my innermost sense of who I am uniquely individually, this inner voice that's talking to me that I didn't develop English, that it's like a gift to me from millions of people."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "So that even in my most innermost sense, it's not just me."},

that Hitler's part of me too."}, {"time": 2475, "text": "And that was just this shock, like a stone sunk, and I just was very moody for the whole next day."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "But it was that

journey that reveals so much?"}, {"time": 2527, "text": "Well, I was with a group of people."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "The way we were doing it was each of us would smoke DMT, have 10, 15 minutes experience while we closed our eyes, and everybody else was just chatting, and then the person who did the DMT would come back and tell their story of what happened."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "And then we'd think about it for a bit and then pass the pipe to the next person."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And so this was like a whole evening."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "So even the, sorry to interrupt, even the conversations themselves then is part of the experience."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "Exactly, yes, yes, because it's also what you bring back."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "I mean, I think that's particularly for therapy."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "It's not so much about what the experience is, but it's what you bring back and what do you integrate."}, {"time": 2568, "text": "And then also, how do you learn how to do these things on your own without the drugs?"}, {"time": 2574, "text": "There is this way, because we're saying it's sort of a core human experience, the drug is the mediator, but can we do this on our own?"}, {"time": 2581, "text": "And once you've seen it and felt it, then you have a little bit better sense to recreate it on your own."}, {"time": 2588,

{"time": 2599, "text": "So there's this way in which we do that."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "So I would say that from the DMT experience, the sense of safety, that's what I was trying to get at with this, the group of us and this group of friends trying to do this common exploration, that if you have this sense of safety, you're incredibly vulnerable because you are giving up your awareness really of what's happening around you."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "I think there's, what we're finding is that in our psychedelic research for PTSD and what we see with the vaccines, that even African Americans are reluctant to volunteer for vaccines because they haven't had that sense of safety from the medical establishment."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "They don't volunteer for psychedelic therapy even as much."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "So the overlay has to be this sense of safety as you become vulnerable and looking inside, you're not."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "I was just actually told about how there's a lot of work being done inside prisons to teach mindfulness."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "And so one of the, Charlene who's my assistant is trying to do work on helping people in prison with trauma, potentially one day with MDMA or meditation or mindfulness."}, {"time": 2679, "text": "But one of the exercises was teaching people to, okay, here's how you deal with stress, just close your eyes and deep breathe."}, {"time": 2686, "text": "And what Charlene was saying is people don't close their eyes in prison, you don't feel safe to do that."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "So all that is just to say is that the context is the most important factor."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "So while I'll talk about the DMT experience, the context was this supportive sense of safety that I could be completely vulnerable and out of any kind of controlled women, I think often are less safe in this way than men because of all the sexual assaults."}, {"time": 2720, "text": "But what it can do by taking the ego orientation offline to some extent, it opens you up to much more."}, {"time": 2729, "text": "And to make a bigger point of that, we could say that it's very similar to the Copernican revolution."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "And people thought that the earth was the center of the universe and the inquisition murdered people that questioned that."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "Father Bruno burned at the stake."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "Actually, one of the things he said, I think that's worth all these years later saying is that when the inquisition sentenced him to burn at the stake for espousing this idea that the earth was not really the center of the universe, he said to the inquisition, he said, your fear in sentencing me is greater than my fear in being sentenced."}, {"time": 2775, "text": "That their worldview was so rigid that they had to wipe out anybody that would question it."}, {"time": 2781, "text": "And so this idea of psychedelics displacing our ego is the center of the universe."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "And to realize that we are just rotating about on something much bigger than our individual life."}, {"time": 2795, "text": "Our ego

{"time": 2807, "text": "And so the psychedelics, DMT, by knocking this sort of ego orientation or the default mode network offline, you open up to the bigger sweeps of history."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "So in that place of safety and vulnerability in that fascinating group of people, when their ego was dissolved in this way, did they have similar experiences?"}, {"time": 2829, "text": "Is there different places that their minds went?"}, {"time": 2832, "text": "Yeah, so once I had this kind of shattering experience that Hitler's part of me, no one else in the group had that."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "Probably a lot of them have maybe had that before or they realized that they're not just the good, the white hat, good people and that they're all good and we got to fight against the bad people."}, {"time": 2855, "text": "So no, people will go in different places."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "And not only that, if you do it again, you'll go into a different place than you went to the first time."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "Unless you have not resolved the issue."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "So I had a sequence of LSD trips that were very difficult, but it was like coming to the same sort of conundrum, the same challenge that I was unable to overcome."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "This idea of letting go and really fully dissolving, letting the ego fully go."}, {"time": 2882, "text": "And I would have this sequence of trips over a couple of months where I would reach this point where I was too scared to move forward and I would just be holding on."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "So there are repeated themes sometimes."}, {"time": 2895, "text": "What Stan Groff has said, which I find very beautiful, is that the full expression of an emotion is the funeral pyre of that emotion."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "And what that means is if you can fully let in something, then the essence of life has changed, is that it moves on, that everything's in motion."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "And if you can fully experience it, even if it's a sense that you're gonna be trapped in eternity in this hellish state, if you surrender to that, that's the way out."}, {"time": 2926, "text": "This full experience of something is this funeral pyre of that emotion."}, {"time": 2932, "text": "And so that runs against a lot of what modern psychiatry is doing too, which is to suppress symptoms."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "Instead of supporting people to kind of explore these insecurities so that then they can contain them and then they can move on."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "So yeah, resistance is not a way to make progress."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "Although one of the reasons why we do the supplemental dose during the MDMA or why there's advantages in a 10 hour LSD experience is that you have a lot of opportunities to come up against this resistance that may be too difficult to deal with and then you kind of push it aside and then a couple hours later you come back to it or you come back to it."}, {"time": 2977, "text": "Press snooze every once in a while if you're not ready."}, {"time": 2980, "text": "It's hard to do that."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "I think with MDMA, you can negotiate."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "That's, I think, a part of its safety in a sense."}, {"time": 2988, "text": "You can have this like, oh, I should be talking about this or I'm feeling this, but it's too much for me now."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "You can push it away."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "But with the classic psychedelics, this kind of membrane between the conscious and the unconscious, that once you take the drug and it weakens this membrane and things are coming up, it's very difficult to negotiate with it."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "The key to successful classic psychedelic trips is surrender."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "You've talked about that you first began to reconsider the negative health myths around psychedelics when you learned that the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was written by Ken Kesey when he was in part under the influence of LSD."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "So how do you think LSD helped him, Ken Kesey, in writing that incredible book?"}, {"time": 3039, "text": "Yeah, there's a process that's called semantic priming."}, {"time": 3045, "text": "And so what that means is that I say night, you say day."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "There's kind of normal patterns of kind of, you say one word, what kind of words come to you next?"}, {"time": 3056, "text": "And so they've done some research."}, {"time": 3058, "text": "They, meaning scientists, have done some research where you give people a psychedelic and then you do this semantic priming."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "And what you find is they have a wider range of associations than they normally would when they're not under psychedelics."}, {"time": 3075, "text": "So I think for Ken Kesey, he was able with psychedelics to get a deeper kind of emotional connection to some of these states of mind that people were in this mental institution and that he could explore them more in depth and more eloquently."}, {"time": 3097, "text": "And also one of the things he talked about was the fog machine, was how people's minds were sort of clouded by the people that ran the institution and the fog machine would be coming in."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "So I think the imagery and the metaphors that he used a lot in the book could come to him during LSD experiences."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "And then now he wasn't doing very, when you're writing, you have to be literate."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "You have to be able to write."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "So it would be more like beginning and ends of LSD trips instead of at the peak."}, {"time": 3137, "text": "But I think you would get a lot of these, the feeling tones or the images, the metaphors, I think he would get these extent, also LSD lasts so long, you can get these extended focus and you can really elaborate on images."}, {"time": 3154, "text": "And so much of psychedelic experiences are poetic and metaphorical."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "I mean, you could take veterans who've never read a book of poetry in their lives."}, {"time": 3169, "text": "And under the influence of MDMA, just what they describe, the imagery and the way they describe their experiences, metaphorical, poetic, it's incredible."}, {"time": 3180, "text": "And so I think that Ken Kesey was able to channel what LSD did to his mind in a way that most people couldn't do, that he did because he was trying to write this novel and because he was so brilliant."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "Yeah, I mean, we'll talk about psychedelics and treating, in bringing some of trauma to the surface and dealing with all those kinds of things, but there's something also to the opening up of creativity for whether it's for writing purposes or for in my world for engineering, for invention, innovation and invention itself is a very, is a deeply creative process."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "And it's fascinating to think with the aid of psychedelics, what kind of ideas can be brought to life?"}, {"time": 3237, "text": "Yeah, well, we have the whole phenomena of a lot of the people in Silicon Valley and else microdosing psychedelics in order to have a little touch more of this creative approach to things."}, {"time": 3286, "text": "I think, of course, you start with helping people deal with trauma, and then the next step is people who have moved past their trauma and are trying to do something, create something special in their life."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "How can then psychedelics empower that?"}, {"time": 3307, "text": "Yeah, now, that also, just to not shy away from anything controversial, that gets us to this idea of psychedelics for vision quest, particularly for younger people."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "You know, when you're sort of moving into this adulting kind of phase and you have to figure out what are you gonna do with your life, there's so many options."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "A lot of people, of course, feel constrained that they have very few options, but I think this idea of psychedelics as a way to help you find your calling or find your vision or find your unique leverage point, I think we'll see that more and more as our culture evolves and gets healthier around the use of psychedelics."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "So it's both the science, having the rigor of understanding how to do it safely and the culture catching up to the fact that this is both safe and very useful."}, {"time": 3363, "text": "Yeah, although I would question this idea of safety."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "So we can understand physiological risks and we can minimize them."},

"Psychological risks are harder to address, but we can do that through the sense of safety and support."}, {"time": 3392, "text": "But I think there's a level of risk there that we shouldn't overlook."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "And so to make a drug into a medicine, what we have to do is prove to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory agencies that things are safe and efficacious."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "But even though they use those words, proving safety and safe and efficacious, it's in relationship to the disease that you're trying to treat and you accept a certain amount of risk."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "So it's the risk benefit ratio rather than pure safety."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "Let me ask you about Ken Kesey a little bit longer because fascinating him being."}, {"time": 3436, "text": "He was also part of Project MKUltra."}, {"time": 3441, "text": "What was Project MKUltra and what lessons we should take away from it?"}, {"time": 3447, "text": "Well, MKUltra was a program by the CIA."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "What they were looking at was, can you take these drugs, these psychedelic drugs, and weaponize them in different ways for interrogation, for true serums, for exposing somebody before they give a big talk to something like LSD and then they can't talk or make a fool of themselves?"}, {"time": 3473, "text": "Or can you spray LSD over the battlefield and have everybody tripping and drop their weapons and then you just walk up and nobody dies and you've won the battle?"}, {"time": 3484, "text": "So it's a fascinating concept."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "Yeah, they call it nonlethal incapacitance and I think that's how it's."}, {"time": 3491, "text": "One way to win a war is to enforce peace."}, {"time": 3496,

into your friend."}, {"time": 3504, "text": "Yes, that's a beautiful way to put it."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "Yeah, but MKUltra was really nefarious and it was part of our military and it was done in secret and they would dose people against their will."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "I mean, one of the most infamous things was that they had a house of prostitution in San Francisco and they would have one way mirrors, all this stuff and then they would just dose people with LSD and they would have the prostitutes dose these guys with LSD and observe what they would do and how they would act."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "And the CIA actually for a while was dosing each other secretly and that there's a famous case of this fellow Olson that either jumped out of a window or was pushed, he might've been killed."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "He was a CIA guy and they gave him LSD and then they're trying to see can they break him down and get him to tell secrets."}, {"time": 3558, "text": "And I think he felt uncomfortable with what happened to him while he was under the influence of LSD and whether he was pushed or not, I don't know if we'll ever know."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "But MKUltra was violating people's human rights."}, {"time": 3575, "text": "It was done in secret and the irony of it is that Ken Kesey is one of the people, one of the main early people that got LSD in this context and then he was one of the main people that helped inspire the hippies to use psychedelics to oppose the Vietnam War."}, {"time": 3596, "text": "So I think the CIA kind of in many cases, things get out of their control, what they think they can do and it turned in to be a disaster for them."}, {"time": 3608, "text": "I think there was some thought that some of the people at the CIA had is that if you can turn people inside, take drugs and they just focus on their internal experience, they're not gonna be involved politically."}, {"time": 3618, "text": "It's a way to sort of take people offline."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "And what I don't think they counted on is that when you're offline and you have these unit of special experiences and you realize how we're all connected, then why do you wanna go out and kill these Vietnamese and put one dictator over another dictator, dictators on both sides in North Vietnam and South Vietnam?"}, {"time": 3640, "text": "Why are we doing that?"}, {"time": 3642, "text": "So MKUltra has just a very disreputable."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "We're learning more and more about what they did and one of the unintended consequences was Ken Kesey and not only that, but then the Grateful Dead who began at the acid tests that Kesey was helping to organize and out of that emerged, you could say just this incredible psychedelic culture."}, {"time": 3668, "text": "And you look at the bands that began in the 60s and which ones have really survived to this day and the Grateful Dead has survived longer than most any other band."}, {"time": 3708, "text": "But can we talk about the darkness a little bit?"}, {"time": 3716, "text": "So Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber was allegedly part of the MKUltra studies while at

do think it's true and I do think it had an impact."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "So we talked before about are these drugs somehow or other producing a certain kind of drug experience or do they bring out what's within?"}, {"time": 3743, "text": "So we have this experience, yeah, on the one hand, Ken Kesey and he sort of took positive things out of this."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "On the other hand, we can get this opposition to the modern world, to technology and to the point of creating bombs to try to go after it."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "So that the experience is not in the drug, it's this interaction between the drug, the person, the context."}, {"time": 3770, "text": "And so we can heal people with psychedelics or people can be driven crazy with psychedelics."}, {"time": 3779, "text": "It depends again on the context."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "And so I think both these things can be true."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "And I think it was really good that you kind of highlighted this, that there is this polarities and that it's not in the drug, it's in the other factors and it's who they were beforehand and then how you use that experience."}, {"time": 3799, "text": "So all that's to say is if we put LSD in the water and everybody were to get it, it doesn't mean that all of a sudden everybody's gonna have a mystical experience and then that's all we need to do and humanity is spiritualized or end war and all of this."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "It's not about the drug."}, {"time": 3815, "text": "And that actually is why for me, we've also talked about engineering new psychedelics and all the people that are gonna be trying for profit companies to develop and patent new psychedelics."}, {"time": 3828, "text": "For me, the most important challenge is new cultural contexts that can create legality, safety, support for the existing psychedelics that we already have."}, {"time": 3840, "text": "I mean, we have so much incredible tools in these

"text": "That's more important to me than finding some new molecule that's somewhat similar or somewhat different but it can be patented."}, {"time": 3862, "text": "So it's the social context."}, {"time": 3864, "text": "So I do believe that Ted Kaczynski was part of NKUltra and I think it affected him in a negative way and that's a cautionary tale that it's not in the drug, it's in the context."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "The context, the person, still it feels like if viewed from a therapy perspective, perhaps there was a way to use psychedelics to help Ted Kaczynski find a path out

how to do the double blind study."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "And I thought I'd solve the problem and I persuaded my dissertation committee that I'd solve the problem."}, {"time": 6397, "text": "And the solution was therapy with low dose MDMA versus therapy with full dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6403, "text": "And everybody knows that they're gonna get MDMA, most of these people have never done it before, they'll be confused about is it full dose or low dose."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "And then the challenge is to pick a dose that's high enough so that there is this confusion, but not so high that it's so therapeutic that we can't tell the difference between the groups."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "So we studied zero, meaning inactive placebo, 25 milligrams, 30 milligrams, 40 milligrams, 50 milligrams, 75 milligrams, 100 milligrams, 125 and 150."}, {"time": 6438, "text": "What we discovered is that my dissertation was wrong and that there is no good solution to the double blind problem."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "What we found is that, to our surprise actually, was that 75 milligrams was an effective dose."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "We didn't think that."}, {"time": 6456,

discovered that the lower doses, so I was half right, you could say, the doses of 25, 30, 40, 50, they could produce enough confusion that you could say that they were successful at blinding, not perfectly, but enough confusion so that people, therapists, couldn't know for sure so that there was this reduction of bias, you could say."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "But what we discovered, again, to our surprise, was that the low doses made people uncomfortable."}, {"time": 6497, "text": "They stimulated them, but they didn't reduce the fear."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "And so people still got better with the therapy with low dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6508, "text": "But if we gave them therapy with inactive placebo, they did even better than if we gave them therapy with low dose MDMA."},

"People didn't like it."}, {"time": 6527, "text": "But we would still help them make some progress."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "So we had the blinding, but what it meant by reducing the effect of therapy with inactive placebo is that it would make it easier for us to find a difference between the two groups."}, {"time": 6541, "text": "And so the real question is, if you can do it with therapy, why bother add a drug?"}, {"time": 6547, "text": "So we went to the FDA, and so this was what we discovered during phase two."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "We went to the FDA at this end of phase two meeting, and we said, we can give you blinding, but it will make it easier for us to find a difference between the two groups."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "And so we suggest that we do therapy with inactive placebo versus therapy with full dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6569, "text": "That will cause a problem because most people will be able to tell what they've got."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "What Tom Loughran, a doctor who used to be head of psychiatry products at FDA is our main advisor."}, {"time": 6581, "text": "So the first thing he said is that the double blind fails in practice a lot, even with SSRIs, because there's certain side effects that you have with these drugs."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "And the doctors who are doing these research when you're reporting your side effects, they can say, oh, that's probably, you got the active drug instead of the placebo."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "So the double blind is in theory is terrific, but in practice, it doesn't always work quite as well."}, {"time": 6605, "text": "And so what Tom said is that there are two main approaches that they think are important to reduce bias."}, {"time": 6613, "text": "The first one is easy to do."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "It's called random assignment."}, {"time": 6617, "text": "So sometimes there are studies where you'll treat a bunch of people with something and some fraction of them will get better and some won't."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "And then you say, okay, all those who didn't get better, who volunteers to get this new treatment?"}, {"time": 6631, "text": "And then you give them the new treatment, but the people that volunteer are more likely to wanna get better."}, {"time": 6636, "text": "They're not representative sample of everybody that has."}, {"time": 6639, "text": "So when you have random assignment, everybody is similarly motivated and meets the same inclusion, exclusion criteria."}, {"time": 6647, "text": "So that's what we told, of course we need random assignment."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "The other part was when the bias double blind doesn't work as well, then the system of independent raters is especially important of how you do that."}, {"time": 6663, "text": "So we have over a pool of raters, over 20 of them, and we do this monthly interrater reliability tests to make sure that they evaluate this, so that they're given a videotape of a PTSD patient and then they're supposed to rate them according to their symptoms."}, {"time": 6680, "text": "And then we sort of make sure that we've got this calibrated rater pool and it's all done by Zoom, by telemedicine, and they're randomly assigned to the next person that needs a rating."}, {"time": 6692, "text": "So they said 20 raters."}, {"time": 6694, "text": "So we've got like 20 raters and what we wanna do is make it so that each rater sees each patient only once, maybe twice, but not tracking them through the study."}, {"time": 6707, "text": "So that tries to reduce the bias in the raters that they don't know where this person is in the study."}, {"time": 6714, "text": "And so there's a fellow, Bob Temple, who's like the old wise man at the FDA."}, {"time": 6721, "text": "He's been there since 1972."}, {"time": 6723, "text": "He was in charge of the Office of Science Policy and they brought him into the final meeting of this process where we are trying to design phase three."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "So once FDA said, yes, you can go to phase three, that was November 29th, 2016, we then negotiated for eight months on the design of phase three and all of the other information that FDA is gonna need."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "This process of design."}, {"time": 6748, "text": "To the extent that I have any artistic creativity, it's in protocol design."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "I really love that."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "So you enjoy this process."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "I love it because it's always trade offs and I acknowledge that we are all biased."}, {"time": 6764, "text": "And so how do you, there's something beautiful about the scientific process designed to get you to the truth."}, {"time": 6772, "text": "Especially when that scientific process is trying to get to the truth of the human organism, which is so complicated."}, {"time": 6778, "text": "So it's very difficult to dissect, to get the strong effects."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "And when you're analyzing, when you have like raters, they're watching a video."}, {"time": 6791, "text": "Removing subjectivity from that is very, very challenging."}, {"time": 6795, "text": "Yeah, very much so."}, {"time": 6798, "text": "And so we came to this agreement with FDA though that we would use this independent rater pool."}, {"time": 6805, "text": "And so we learned in phase two again, that the double blind, there was no solution to the double blind problem."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "And both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency in the end agreed that the best design was therapy with inactive placebo versus therapy with full dose MDMA, accepting the fact that most people will be able to tell whether they got nothing or they got full dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6830, "text": "Most therapists will be able to tell the difference, but that makes a harder test for us to show a difference between the two groups because we're giving them inactive placebo and not the anti therapeutic effect of low dose MDMA."}, {"time": 6843, "text": "So once we started phase three, so then we were able to start in 2018 phase three."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "And the paper in Nature Medicine that just came out was the results of our first phase three study."}, {"time": 6858, "text": "We came to agreement with FDA that we would do two phase three studies, each would have 100 persons in them."}, {"time": 6865, "text": "And what the FDA said to us is that they thought that we could prove efficacy with smaller numbers than they wanted to see for safety."}, {"time": 6876, "text": "The reason they said that is it in phase two, we had a large effect size."}, {"time": 6881, "text": "So from a statistical point of view, the bigger of an effect that you're looking for, the fewer number of people you need to get statistical significance."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "When you're trying to find small differences, you need large numbers of people to sort of work out the noise."}, {"time": 6899, "text": "So we came to agreement on two 100 person phase three studies."}, {"time": 6905, "text": "And the idea is that it's very possible that the first study would show the efficacy because the effect is so strong."}, {"time": 6913, "text": "Yeah, yeah, and the second, but also safety as well."}, {"time": 6916, "text": "So one of the things we also realized when you work with a highly stigmatized drug in the midst of still the drug war and prohibition that we need highly sympathetic subjects and we need to make the best case we can, which means we need to work with the hardest cases so that this is really needed."}, {"time": 6938, "text": "And so we end up enrolling people."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "The first study was chronic severe PTSD."}, {"time": 6945, "text": "And unlike many studies of PTSD, we enroll people that have previously attempted suicide."}, {"time": 6951, "text": "So we have multiple people that have tried to kill themselves that we felt like if we were to exclude them, what are we doing?"}, {"time": 6958, "text": "Those are the people that need it the most."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "So we came to this agreement with FDA."}, {"time": 6964, "text": "We're gonna work with chronic severe PTSD patients, including those that had attempted suicide."}, {"time": 6971, "text": "And we would do these two 100 person studies."}, {"time": 6974, "text": "And we also negotiated what's called an interim analysis."}, {"time": 6979, "text": "So what that means is that when the study is underway, and often big, big studies, they have this kind of interim analysis where what you do is, and for us, we negotiate when we had 60% or 60 people had reached the primary outcome measure and all 100 had been enrolled, then we would take a look at the data."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "And if the statistical analysis that we did was showing based on a certain effect size that we chose based on what we saw in phase two, the interim analysis is for what's called sample size reestimation."}, {"time": 7019, "text": "So what it means is if the results aren't as good as you thought they would, you can add more people."}, {"time": 7024, "text": "And then you'll get statistical significance."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "It means that your effect isn't as strong as you thought."}, {"time": 7030, "text": "It'll be harder to get insurance to cover it, but FDA will still approve it because FDA also believes that these are group averages."}, {"time": 7038, "text": "There may be some people that will later figure out respond better than others."}, {"time": 7042, "text": "So they'll approve it if it's statistically significant, even if it has a low effect size."}, {"time": 7047, "text": "The SSRIs have low effect size."}, {"time": 7050, "text": "So we did the interim analysis in March of 2020."}, {"time": 7055, "text": "And what we discovered to our delight was that we did not need to add any subjects."}, {"time": 7061, "text": "That's all we were told."}, {"time": 7062, "text": "We weren't told like, what is the results?"}, {"time": 7065, "text": "We were just told all we were gonna get is a number, zero, or you need to add X numbers of people to the study to get statistical significance."}, {"time": 7073, "text": "That's right around the time that COVID hit and lockdowns happened."}, {"time": 7076, "text": "And we ended up negotiating with FDA that we would end the study with 90 people instead of 100."}, {"time": 7084, "text": "It took a while for us to end up doing that."}, {"time": 7086, "text": "So the paper that we just published is on the results of 90 people."}, {"time": 7090, "text": "I think it was 46 in the MDMA group, 44 in the placebo group."}, {"time": 7096, "text": "And what we discovered was that the study worked better than we had even hoped."}, {"time": 7103, "text": "So the first thing is that you look at statistical significance."}, {"time": 7107, "text": "You have to get 0.05, which basically means a nickel out of a dollar, a one in 20 chance that the difference between the two groups is due to some random factor rather than to your intervention."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "And in this case, the placebo group gets therapy and then with inactive placebo and then the group gets MDMA with active placebo."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "So you have to get 0.05."}, {"time": 7132, "text": "There's another measure that the FDA uses sometimes called robust, which means one in a thousand, instead of one in 20, one in a thousand."}, {"time": 7141, "text": "And if you get a robust results, 0.001, and you meet some other criteria, they might agree to approve the drug on the basis of just one phase three study instead of two."}, {"time": 7155, "text": "Because when you think about it, a one in 20 chance for your first phase three study, a one in 20 chance for your second phase three study, you multiply that together, it's one in 400, 0.025."}, {"time": 7168, "text": "So that's pretty good."}, {"time": 7172, "text": "So robust 0.001 is even better than two independent phase three studies, each at 0.05."}, {"time": 7181, "text": "What we ended up getting was one in 10,000, 0.0001."}, {"time": 7186, "text": "Outrageous, incredibly."}, {"time": 7189, "text": "So that's a measure of both the difference between the two groups and the variability."}, {"time": 7193, "text": "And so what it meant is that we had minimal variability, that most people who got the MDA got quite a large amount of benefit from it."}, {"time": 7203, "text": "And most people who got the placebo were more or less in the same range as well."}, {"time": 7207, "text": "That's really exciting, by the way."}, {"time": 7208, "text": "I mean, I suppose it's exciting from a perspective of approval by the FDA."}, {"time": 7216, "text": "Maybe perhaps that's the way you're seeing it, but it's also exciting because it has a chance to help people that are truly suffering, yeah."}, {"time": 7226, "text": "Well, if we can get one in 10,000 in the first phase three study, chances are we can get one in 20 in the second."}, {"time": 7234, "text": "So it's really gonna be about safety for us in the second phase three study."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "Now, you can have a large P value, a large significance, but you could have an effect that's not very significant."}, {"time": 7249, "text": "It's not clinically significant."}, {"time": 7251, "text": "You can have statistical significance without clinical significance."}, {"time": 7255, "text": "And as I said, the more people you get in the study, you can find smaller and smaller differences between two groups."}, {"time": 7262, "text": "Now, we showed that we had a very large effect size."}, {"time": 7267, "text": "So effect size is based on... That scale you mentioned?"}, {"time": 7271, "text": "Well, the scale of the effect size is based on standard deviations."}, {"time": 7277, "text": "So an effect size of one means that your results are one standard deviation away from the norm."}, {"time": 7283, "text": "That's considered very large."}, {"time": 7286, "text": "The SSRIs, because they were like 0.3, 0.4 effect size, that's considered small effect size."}, {"time": 7294, "text": "Medium is starting to be around 0.6 and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes."}, {"time": 7301, "text": "We had what's called placebo subtracted effect size."}, {"time": 7305, "text": "There's two different ways to look at it."}, {"time": 7306, "text": "Placebo subtracted means you kind of look at the difference between your two groups."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "And what that is for us, since one group had therapy and one had therapy plus MDMA, the placebo subtracted effect size is basically the effect of just the MDMA because you've kind of washed out the therapy."}, {"time": 7323, "text": "That was 0.91."}, {"time": 7325, "text": "So we had a large effect size, which was different."}, {"time": 7328, "text": "Wow, so 0.91 over just the therapy, so over the placebo."}, {"time": 7333, "text": "Now, when we do the within group, meaning the group that just got the MDMA plus therapy, look at their baseline and their outcomes."}, {"time": 7343, "text": "That's another way to look at it."}, {"time": 7345, "text": "And that's what's gonna actually happen in practice because people are gonna get MDMA plus therapy."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "That's 2.1 effect size."}, {"time": 7352, "text": "Two standard deviations away from the norm is enormous effect size."}, {"time": 7358, "text": "The other part is that we had no effect by site, which is very important."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "So we had 15 sites, two in Israel, two in Canada, 11 throughout the United States."}, {"time": 7370, "text": "The FDA looks at, is there a side effect?"}, {"time": 7373, "text": "Because what that might mean is maybe you've got all your patients or most of your patients going to this one site, which is these highly experienced therapists and they're like hippies from way back and they're super experienced with psychedelics and they're getting great results, but nobody else gets good results."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "So we had no effect by site."}, {"time": 7392, "text": "That we've been able to train all these new therapists."}, {"time": 7394, "text": "We had about 80 therapists working at all these 15 sites."}, {"time": 7400, "text": "We also discovered that there's a group that's considered to be very difficult to treat, which is called the dissociative subtype."}, {"time": 7409, "text": "So when people are traumatized, one of the ways to psychologically survive that is you dissociate."}, {"time": 7418, "text": "It's like you're not there."}, {"time": 7421, "text": "When you do that though, it's hard to come back because when you come back, then you get all these painful memories and fearful."}, {"time": 7427, "text": "And so the extreme of that is called dissociative identity disorder, kind of like schizophrenia, almost dissociative identity."}, {"time": 7436, "text": "So we let people in who are on the dissociative subtype and those are considered to be the hardest to treat because the theory is that you need to be ego intact."}, {"time": 7447, "text": "As I said, the mystical experience is not correlated with therapeutic outcomes."}, {"time": 7451, "text": "And you need to be talking about what traumatized you and working through that and expressing it, letting it out, not keeping it in."}, {"time": 7458, "text": "So the dissociative subtype seems like it's harder for them to get back into the event because they're so dissociated."}, {"time": 7466, "text": "What we showed is that those people did even better on average than everybody else."}, {"time": 7471, "text": "So that MDMA is integrative."}, {"time": 7473, "text": "It helps people who are so separate that they make even more rapid progress."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "So it's almost like the MDMA made it more difficult for them to dissociate."}, {"time": 7484, "text": "Yeah, or you could say it made it easier for them to remember."}, {"time": 7488, "text": "To reverse the dissociation."}, {"time": 7490, "text": "And we find that MDMA enhances memory for the trauma so that you can have these unconscious memories or memories that you cannot remember or that you've suppressed so much, but they distort your view."}, {"time": 7502, "text": "Your filter of the world is distorted by these fearful memories that the world can't be trusted."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "People can't be trusted."}, {"time": 7508, "text": "It's always about to happen."}, {"time": 7510, "text": "So we find that MDMA increases memory for the trauma, but by reducing the fear, then the memories can come to the surface."}, {"time": 7516, "text": "Then you can process them, let out the emotions, cry, scream, shake, whatever."}, {"time": 7521, "text": "And then through this MDMA effect on the amygdala and the hippocampus, it helps you store these memories into longterm storage so that they're not always about to happen."}, {"time": 7531, "text": "They're in the past."}, {"time": 7532, "text": "They're part of your story, but they're not the whole story."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "So we discovered that the dissociative subtype works better."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "Now, none of this would be enough unless safety."}, {"time": 7542, "text": "So from a safety perspective, what we discovered is that there was one woman in the study that attempted to kill herself twice during the study."}, {"time": 7552, "text": "There was another woman that was so worried that she might kill herself, that the therapy brought these things to the surface that she's been pushing away, that she checked herself into a hospital in order to avoid self harm."}, {"time": 7566, "text": "At the end of the study, what we learned is both of them were in the placebo group."}, {"time": 7571, "text": "We didn't have anybody in the MDMA group attempt to kill themselves."}, {"time": 7576, "text": "So the MDMA is really helpful for giving people a sense of hope and that they can somehow process this."}, {"time": 7587, "text": "Now, it's not to say that nobody will ever commit suicide."}, {"time": 7590, "text": "That's our big concern in the second phase three study."}, {"time": 7594, "text": "As I said, it's more gonna be about safety than about efficacy."}, {"time": 7597, "text": "We think we'll get the efficacy, but we're very concerned about safety."}, {"time": 7602, "text": "Because we had problems in the first phase three study of somebody trying to kill herself twice in the placebo group, it's the background for having PTSD."}, {"time": 7612, "text": "So there'd have to be a disproportionate number of people in the MDMA group try to kill themselves or succeed in killing themselves than in the placebo group for the FDA to say, oh, this MDMA, it's too dangerous."}, {"time": 7624, "text": "We don't think that's gonna happen."}, {"time": 7625, "text": "So the other findings from safety is that the side effects are transitory."}, {"time": 7633, "text": "They're minor, they're sweating or jaw clenching or a slight temperature increase."}, {"time": 7639, "text": "And everybody that's been to a rave knows about it."}, {"time": 7643, "text": "Take an ecstasy, there are some side effects."}, {"time": 7646, "text": "But they're minor, they're transitory and there has been this massive problem of during the eighties, the nineties, NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse was trying to say that MDMA was neurotoxic and that you take it and it's gonna cause nerve terminal degeneration."}, {"time": 7661, "text": "It's gonna be major brain damage."}, {"time": 7662, "text": "It's gonna be significant functional consequences."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "And back then they were saying that MDMA is too dangerous."}, {"time": 7668, "text": "It should never even be researched."}, {"time": 7669, "text": "Nobody should even get it once because it's poison and brain damage."}, {"time": 7674, "text": "Well, we no longer believe that, that was exaggerated."}, {"time": 7677, "text": "That was in service of the drug war."}, {"time": 7680, "text": "But we've done in phase two neurocognitive tests before and after in two of our different sites and showed no decline in cognitive functioning."}, {"time": 7689, "text": "So we don't think that there's any neurotoxicity happening and the doses that we use."}, {"time": 7696, "text": "There's no obvious functional consequences."}, {"time": 7698, "text": "People are getting better."}, {"time": 7700, "text": "And the other thing that we've learned in phase two and that we still have to learn from this study."}, {"time": 7705, "text": "So what we showed is the durability of the effect."}, {"time": 7709, "text": "We showed that 32% of the people that got the therapy without MDMA at two months after the last experimental session no longer had PTSD."}, {"time": 7718, "text": "Just with the therapy, which is phenomenal because these are on average 14 years PTSD, one third had PTSD over 20 years."}, {"time": 7728, "text": "And just with the therapy, 32% no longer had PTSD at the two months."}, {"time": 7734, "text": "However, those people that got MDMA, it was 67%."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "No longer had PTSD, more than twice as good."}, {"time": 7742, "text": "In phase two and in phase three, we're also gonna do the 12 month followup."}, {"time": 7747, "text": "That's not for the FDA."}, {"time": 7749, "text": "That's not for approvability."}, {"time": 7750, "text": "That's more for insurance companies because this is expensive, a lot of therapy time."}, {"time": 7755, "text": "If it fades, if it's great results initially but then it fades after six months, what's the point?"}, {"time": 7760, "text": "And what we showed in phase two is that people keep getting better."}, {"time": 7768, "text": "At the two month followup, they're doing pretty well but at the 12 month followup, they're even better."}, {"time": 7774, "text": "So it's durable."}, {"time": 7775, "text": "People have learned how to process trauma."}, {"time": 7778, "text": "They keep getting better."}, {"time": 7779, "text": "So we've not reached that point in this phase three study where everybody's got their one year followup."}, {"time": 7783, "text": "But we have also done three and a half year followups to some of the groups that were in phase two and showed that it was durable."}, {"time": 7790, "text": "And we're doing a long term followup now to many of the people in phase two, some of them treated 15 years ago."}, {"time": 7797, "text": "So that's all more for the insurance companies."}, {"time": 7799, "text": "So basically what we found in the paper that we just published is that it was highly efficacious, highly significant, no effect by sight, works in the hardest cases and the safety record was great."}, {"time": 7813, "text": "That's an incredible success."}, {"time": 7814, "text": "And that's really exciting, especially given that the people who've committed, who attempted to commit suicide were let into the study."}, {"time": 7823, "text": "And so these are people who are truly suffering."}, {"time": 7830, "text": "I mean, that's incredibly exciting."}, {"time": 7836, "text": "And I mean, just to speak to the frustration why things can't move faster, but for what it is, it's incredibly exciting."}, {"time": 7844, "text": "Is there other studies of this nature that you foresee enabling that same kind of positive impact, whether it's MDMA for other things like treating addiction, or maybe it's psilocybin for other conditions?"}, {"time": 7859, "text": "Is there something else that's promising?"}, {"time": 7861, "text": "Yeah, I think that what we've discovered I don't think is unique to MDMA."}, {"time": 7868, "text": "So it's MDMA assisted psychotherapy."},

with chemicals to influence that that will help the therapeutic process."}, {"time": 8122, "text": "So you could say he was ahead of his time."}, {"time": 8128, "text": "This study paints a fascinating picture of a future where first for medical applications, but then also in general, psychedelics of various forms could be used by the broader society."}, {"time": 8142, "text": "Forgive the perhaps ridiculous question, but if much of society, including our politicians, are taking psychedelics and dissolving their ego and going through this whole process, how do you think the world may look different in 20, 30, 50 years?"}, {"time": 8164, "text": "Ah, okay, so I said that I think licensed legalization happens in 2035."}, {"time": 8172, "text": "And I think by 2050, we will have enough people, hopefully, spiritualized."}, {"time": 8182, "text": "We're also talking about, we hear so much in terms of climate change about net zero carbon."}, {"time": 8189, "text": "So our goal

help a few people, but the recent war with Gaza has traumatized millions of people on both sides."}, {"time": 8206, "text": "So we are a long way away from net zero trauma."}, {"time": 8212, "text": "But that's the hope, and that's, I think, possible."}, {"time": 8216, "text": "I think humanity as a whole is like lemmings heading over a cliff with climate change and with the nuclear proliferation and just the religious hatreds and the more the retreat to authoritarianism and fundamentalism and tribalism."}, {"time": 8237, "text": "So I think that there's a very good chance, though, that psychedelics used wisely."}, {"time": 8242, "text": "So it's not just make psychedelics legal and everybody takes them, as you talked about Ted Kaczynski."}, {"time": 8248, "text": "It's the context that people take it in."}, {"time": 8251, "text": "But I think that there's a reasonable chance that enough people can, sort of, you could say, clean their filters to see people as more similar to them than different, not to label them as the enemy."}, {"time": 8270, "text": "Stan Groff, again, had this beautiful phrase about transparent to the transcendent."}, {"time": 8276, "text": "That's what, so for our ego, can we be transparent to the transcendent?"}, {"time": 8282, "text": "Can the filter that we look through the world at be cleaned to, you could say, cleansing the doors of perception?"}, {"time": 8290, "text": "Can it be cleaned to the point where we can see the humanity in everybody and see that, one way to say this is that, can we get to the point where religions are seen as like languages?"}, {"time": 8303, "text": "Where we all have this need to communicate, there's thousands of different languages, we don't say that this language is fundamentally better than this language, this language is the only right language, everybody must speak English and Russian is bad or German is better."}, {"time": 8318, "text": "Maybe we'll get to that point that religions are like that, that there are different cultural backgrounds, different symbol systems, different saints and heroes and messiahs and all this, but that, yeah, Jesus is the son of God, but so is everybody."}, {"time": 8332, "text": "Or the Jews are the chosen people, but so is everybody."}, {"time": 8335, "text": "So can we get there?"}, {"time": 8337, "text": "I think that we can."}, {"time": 8339, "text": "And I think that we need to, to survive the challenges that we're facing."}, {"time": 8343, "text": "And the hope is that by bringing psychedelics as tools forward and trying to bring the context around them to be one of responsibility rather than just profit maximization and just get as many people to do them from all these for profit companies, can we, and then also drug policy reform and embed knowledge in the society, can we get to honest drug education?"}, {"time": 8371, "text": "DARE, the Drug Awareness Resistance Education, is fundamentally twisted."}, {"time": 8379, "text": "But it's the program that's used in a lot of schools now."}, {"time": 8382, "text": "So can we get honest drug education, pure drugs, harm reduction, and knowledge about therapeutic uses and on the one hand, and more of these thousands of psychedelic clinics?"}, {"time": 8395, "text": "I'm hopeful and that's our goal."}, {"time": 8399, "text": "But in this landscape of pharma companies, they make a lot of money."}, {"time": 8405, "text": "Some people are worried about the impact of those, you know, of big pharma on the landscape of human trauma."}, {"time": 8414, "text": "So there's, of course, some companies could do good, but that's not inherent, like many of these companies are not optimizing for good, they're optimizing for profit."}, {"time": 8427, "text": "Does this rise of for profit pharma companies worry you?"}, {"time": 8431, "text": "How do you navigate it?"}, {"time": 8433, "text": "Do we still have for profit companies that basically do what MAPS does, which is like fight the good fight for the benefit of humanity?"}, {"time": 8442, "text": "Like how do we proceed in this, in landscape where drugs can make a lot of money?"}, {"time": 8449, "text": "Well, I am concerned."}, {"time": 8452, "text": "Overall, I think the rise of the for profit companies, we have to realize is a sign of success, that we have overcome the regulatory prohibitions, we've overcome a lot of the public attitudes that are against it, we've demonstrated some success."}, {"time": 8469, "text": "So the rise of the for profit companies are a sign of the progress that we've made."}, {"time": 8473, "text": "On the other hand, turning things over to profit maximizing companies, the big concern is that they're gonna try to minimize the amount of therapy and make it so the cost is less, so insurance companies are more likely to cover it and then that they just sell the most drugs."}, {"time": 8492, "text": "The other thing we've seen as an example of this is S ketamine by Johnson and Johnson for depression."}, {"time": 8497, "text": "And it's done by a profit maximizing company."}, {"time": 8500, "text": "They don't know anything about psychedelic psychotherapy or psychotherapy at all."}, {"time": 8504, "text": "And so they've gotten approval for S ketamine on the basis of it's just a pharmacological treatment and it's not delivered with therapy, the results fade pretty quickly, so you need to get more ketamine."}, {"time": 8519, "text": "And so it's designed in a way to maximize the profits for the pharmaceutical company, but it doesn't maximize patient outcomes."}, {"time": 8527, "text": "What we're seeing though in these various clinics that are being set up is that a lot of people are realizing that it works better with therapy."}, {"time": 8537, "text": "And so the clinics are run by people that are therapists so that when they provide therapy, they're making more money and then you need less ketamine."}, {"time": 8546, "text": "Also ketamine itself, S ketamine is a isomer of ketamine that's been patented for depression and they sell it for hundreds of dollars, but ketamine itself is one of the world's essential medicines."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "It's off patent, it's been around for a long time, it was the main battlefield anesthetic in Vietnam."}, {"time": 8564, "text": "And it's only a few bucks because it's generic."}, {"time": 8567, "text": "So a lot of the ketamine clinics are saying, great, thank you, Johnson and Johnson, you've helped demonstrate that ketamine is good for depression, but we're not gonna buy it from you."}, {"time": 8576, "text": "We're gonna buy it for a few bucks and we're gonna add therapy to it."}, {"time": 8580, "text": "Now there's a bunch of ketamine mills you could say that are just prescribing the ketamine and people are making a lot of money there."}, {"time": 8587, "text": "So I am worried about that."}, {"time": 8589, "text": "I think the best thing that we can do is create an alternative narrative, a different kind of example."}, {"time": 8596, "text": "We can lead by example."}, {"time": 8598, "text": "We can't make for profit companies into benefit corporations unless they wanna do that."}, {"time": 8603, "text": "We can't make them to really maximize patient outcomes."}, {"time": 8608, "text": "But if we create an example of something that's different, the hope is that people will gravitate towards that and some of the other companies."}, {"time": 8617, "text": "Like even now we have Exxon and other these companies, oil companies saying, oh, we're big into alternative energy and we're, you know."}, {"time": 8625, "text": "And that starts with companies that show an example that then communicates to the public that this is something exciting and then they demand the same of Exxon and so on."}, {"time": 8636, "text": "The public demands it and you could say the same thing for the public demanding the big pharma to optimize for benefit versus optimize for profit and maybe giving power to the therapists, more power to the therapists, more power to the doctors that ultimately want."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "I think incentives are interesting, but I think doctors ultimately care more because they're in direct contact with humans."}, {"time": 8667, "text": "They want to make people better."}, {"time": 8669, "text": "It's not, you know, sure they wanna make money, but they ultimately want to make people feel better because they get to look at people and it's so joyful to make people feel better at the end of the day."}, {"time": 8679, "text": "So giving more power to them is also perhaps one of the ways that you then incentivize the pharma companies that are trying to do good because the doctors will choose those companies."}, {"time": 8693, "text": "Yeah, now the other part of this is drug policy reform."}, {"time": 8697, "text": "So that if we make it so that you can buy MDMA for 10 or 20 bucks on your own and we've trained people on here's our therapeutic method, here is our ways for peer support, then people have an alternative from buying it from the pharma companies."}, {"time": 8715, "text": "So most of the for profit companies have come to this conclusion that drug policy reform is bad for their business model."}, {"time": 8725, "text": "I think they're making a fundamental mistake."}, {"time": 8728, "text": "And I think the reason is that the more that we de stigmatize this, the more that we sensitize people to this is an approach, even when people can get it on their own and do it with their friends or do it with themselves, there's gonna be even more people that say, oh my God, I've got real serious issues."}, {"time": 8744, "text": "I would rather go to trained professionals covered by insurance."}, {"time": 8749, "text": "And I think it'll increase the business, but most of the for profit companies don't see it that way."}, {"time": 8756, "text": "And so as a nonprofit that owns a benefit corp, we're not trying to maximize sales or profits."}, {"time": 8763, "text": "But I do believe that drug policy reform creates this alternative access point for people and that will help keep the for profits in check to some extent as well."}, {"time": 8778, "text": "Let's put on your wise visionary hat and ask when you look to young folks, is there advice you can give to young people today, whether in high school or college about career, about life?"}, {"time": 8793, "text": "You've lived quite a nonlinear and fascinating life yourself."}, {"time": 8799, "text": "Is there advice you can give either on career or more generally on life?"}, {"time": 8803, "text": "Well, I would say what people often hear is that, we're not actually here for that long a period of time."}, {"time": 8815, "text": "And the world is on fire."}, {"time": 8819, "text": "And whether humanity survives is not clear."}, {"time": 8823, "text": "And how many species are we gonna kill before we figure out not to do that anymore?"}, {"time": 8828, "text": "So I would advise you to really try to develop a combination of what do you need in terms of income for your own survival, but what does the world need in terms of help to make the world better?"}, {"time": 8847, "text": "And Howard Thurman, who we talked about, who ran the Good Friday experiment, the minister there, he said, he's got a famous quote attributed to him."}, {"time": 8856, "text": "He says, and this is exactly it to young people."}, {"time": 8860, "text": "He said, there's nothing particular that you should do, but find what makes you come alive because what the world needs is people that have come alive and are passionate."}, {"time": 8872, "text": "So I would say that be aware of this trap that you need vast resources, that you need all this stuff."}, {"time": 8883, "text": "I keep thinking of the super wealthy people in first class on the Titanic, as the Titanic is sinking."}, {"time": 8892, "text": "Their money's not gonna help them."}, {"time": 8893, "text": "The Earth is like Titanic."}, {"time": 8895, "text": "We're sinking, we're destroying the planets, destroying the environment."}, {"time": 8898, "text": "So you need a certain amount of money to be comfortable to be able to do that."}, {"time": 8905, "text": "You need to be comfortable to not be at that edge of survival, because once you're at that edge of survival, it's hard to think about anything else."}, {"time": 8912, "text": "But I'd say to young people, to the extent that you're able to do this, and again, student debt and all this kind of stuff is a big problem there too, but really just try to find this combination of what the world needs and what you need."}, {"time": 8930, "text": "The other thing to say to young people is that life is a lot shorter than you think, and a 20 year plan is not really that long."}, {"time": 8940, "text": "So if it takes you 20 years to get in a position to do what you wanna do, go for it."}, {"time": 8947, "text": "Have longterm plans."}, {"time": 8948, "text": "The other part that was so important for me to keep doing what I've been doing, basically now it's 49 years that I've sort of been devoting my life on psychedelics since I was 18."}, {"time": 8960, "text": "But when I started, I didn't think it would ever work."}, {"time": 8963, "text": "I just thought this is the only idea I have in this crazy world, this is what I wanna work on."}, {"time": 8969, "text": "Luckily, I had support from my family that took care of my survival needs, so I could do that."}, {"time": 8974, "text": "But I realized that if my happiness was dependent upon accomplishments, that I might never be happy, that I was able to reframe happiness in terms of effort."}, {"time": 8987, "text": "So if I'm trying hard to get stuff to be better, whether it's better or not, I can be happy at the end of each day, I tried."}, {"time": 8998, "text": "And so I think you try to separate out the goals that you have and your happiness to whether you're trying hard."}, {"time": 9006, "text": "The other thing I would say is that everybody has this humanity within them."}, {"time": 9013, "text": "So be very careful about dividing the world into us and them, and try to..."}, {"time": 9020, "text": "So one of the things that I've done that has taken a long time, because I feel like drugs are illegal."}, {"time": 9031, "text": "I always felt like the police were the predator and I'm the prey."}, {"time": 9036,

time police officer, he's also a psychotherapist."}, {"time": 9047, "text": "And he's going through our training program to learn how to give MDMA therapy to other police officers."}, {"time": 9053,

long term relationships."}, {"time": 9088, "text": "You never know what's gonna come around 20 years from now."}, {"time": 9092, "text": "So you help some people try to keep these relationships going
