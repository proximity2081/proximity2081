burden on us, and that's why Sartre says on his view of existentialism, human beings are the beings that are condemned to be free."}, {"time": 359, "text": "Our freedom consists in our ability and our responsibility to make these choices and to become someone through making them."}, {"time": 366, "text": "And we can't get away from that."}, {"time": 368, "text": "But to him, it's terrifying not liberating in the positive meaning of the word liberating."}, {"time": 374, "text": "Well, so he thinks it should be liberating, but he thinks that it takes a very courageous individual to be liberated by it."}, {"time": 382, "text": "Nietzsche, I think, thought something similar."}, {"time": 384, "text": "I think Sartre is really coming out of a Nietzschean sort of tradition."}, {"time": 389, "text": "But what's liberating about it, if it is, is also terrifying because it means in a certain way, you're the ground of your own being."}, {"time": 399, "text": "You become what you do through existing."}, {"time": 403, "text": "So that's one form of existentialism, that's a stark atheistic version of it."}, {"time": 407, "text": "There's lots of other versions, but it's somehow organized around the idea that it's through living your life that you become who you are."}, {"time": 416, "text": "It's not facts that are sort of true about you independent of your living your life."}, {"time": 421, "text": "But then there's no God in that view."}, {"time": 427, "text": "Does any of the decisions matter?"}, {"time": 430, "text": "So how does existentialism differ from nihilism?"}, {"time": 437, "text": "So it's two different ways that you're asking it."}, {"time": 440, "text": "Let me leave nihilism to the side for just a second and think about mattering or is there any way that you can criticize someone for living the way they do if you're in existentialism?"}, {"time": 456, "text": "Sartre addresses that and he says, yes, he says, there is a criticism that you can make of yourself or of others and it's the criticism of living in such a way as to fail to take responsibility for your choices."}, {"time": 470, "text": "He gives these two sort of amazing examples."}, {"time": 474, "text": "One doesn't..."}, {"time": 475, "text": "I don't know if it reads as well for us as it did in sort of mid 20th century Paris, but it's about a waiter."}, {"time": 484, "text": "He gives this in his big book, Being and Nothingness."}, {"time": 487, "text": "And he says, so waiters played, still do I think in a certain way in Paris, a big role in Parisian society."}, {"time": 495, "text": "To be a waiter involved having a certain kind of identity, being a certain way, taking control of and charge of the experience of the people that you're waiting on, but also really being the authority, knowing that this is the way it's supposed to go."}, {"time": 513, "text": "And so Sartre imagines a waiter who does everything that a waiter is supposed to do, the perfect form of the waiter, except that you can somehow see in the way he's doing it that he's doing it because he believes that's the way a waiter should act."}, {"time": 534, "text": "So there's some sense in which he's passing off the responsibility for his actions onto some idea of what those actions should be."}, {"time": 543, "text": "He's not taking responsibility for it."}, {"time": 545, "text": "He's sort of playing a role and the contours of the role are predetermined by someone other than him."}, {"time": 552, "text": "So he starts as acting in bad faith and that's criticizable because it's acting in such a way as to fail to take responsibility for the kind of being Sartre thinks you are."}, {"time": 565, "text": "So you're not taking responsibility."}, {"time": 568, "text": "And I think any teenager, if you've ever met a teenager, you've known someone who does that."}, {"time": 575, "text": "Teenagers try on roles."}, {"time": 576, "text": "They think, if I dressed like this, I would be cool."}, {"time": 581, "text": "So I'll dress like this, or if I spoke like this, or acted like this."}, {"time": 586, "text": "And it's natural for a teenager who's trying to figure out what their identity is to go through a phase like that."}, {"time": 592, "text": "But if you continue to do that, then you're really passing it."}, {"time": 596, "text": "And the other example he gives is an example not of passing off responsibility by pretending that someone else is the ground of your choice, but passing off responsibility by pretending that you might be able to get away with not making a choice at all."}, {"time": 616, "text": "So he says, everything you do is a result of your choices."}, {"time": 621, "text": "And so he gives this other example."}, {"time": 622, "text": "Where you are on the first date, first date."}, {"time": 628, "text": "And the date, the evening reaches moments when it might be appropriate for one person to hold the hand of the other."}, {"time": 640, "text": "That's the moment in the date where you are."}, {"time": 643, "text": "And so you make a choice."}, {"time": 645, "text": "You decide, I think it's that time, and you hold the hand."}, {"time": 650, "text": "And what should happen is that the other person also makes a choice on Sartre's view."}, {"time": 654, "text": "Either they reject the hand, not that time, and I'm taking responsibility for that, or they grasp the hand back."}, {"time": 662, "text": "That's a choice."}, {"time": 663, "text": "But there's a thing that sometimes happens, which is that the other person leaves the hand there cold, dead, and clammy, neither rejecting it nor embracing it."}, {"time": 675, "text": "And Sartre says, that's also bad faith, that's also acting as if we're a kind of being that we're not, because it pretends that it's possible not to make a choice."}, {"time": 687, "text": "And we're the beings who are always making choices."}, {"time": 689, "text": "That was a choice."}, {"time": 691, "text": "And you're pretending as if it's the kind of thing that you don't have to take responsibility for."}, {"time": 696, "text": "So both of the examples you've given, there's some sense in which the social interactions between humans is a kind of moving away from the full responsibility that you as a human in the view of existentialism should take on."}, {"time": 712, "text": "So isn't the basic conversation, a delegation of responsibility, just holding a hand there, you're putting some of the responsibility into the court of the other person."}, {"time": 724, "text": "And for the waiter, if you exist in a society, you are generally trying on a role."}, {"time": 732, "text": "I mean, all of us are trying on a role."}, {"time": 735, "text": "Me wearing clothes is me trying on a role that I was told to try, as opposed to walking around naked all the time."}, {"time": 743, "text": "There's standards of how you operate, and that's a decision that's not my own."}, {"time": 751, "text": "It's me seeing what everyone else is doing and copying them."}, {"time": 755, "text": "So Sartre thinks that in the ideal, you should try to resist that."}, {"time": 763, "text": "Other existentialists think that that's actually a clue to how you should live well."}, {"time": 771, "text": "So Sartre says somewhere else, hell is other people."}, {"time": 776, "text": "Why is hell other people for Sartre?"}, {"time": 777, "text": "Well, because other people are making choices also."}, {"time": 781, "text": "And when other people make choices, they put some pressure on me to think that the choice they made is one that I should copy or one that I should promote."}, {"time": 797, "text": "But if I do it because they did it, then I'm in bad faith for Sartre."}, {"time": 801, "text": "So it is as if Sartre's view is like, we would be better if we were all alone."}, {"time": 807, "text": "I mean, this is really simplifying Sartre's position, and this is really just mostly Sartre in a certain period of his formation."}, {"time": 816, "text": "But anyhow, we can imagine that view."}, {"time": 819, "text": "And I think there's something to the idea that Sartre is attracted to it, at least in the mid 40s."}, {"time": 824, "text": "Can you dig into hell as other people?"}, {"time": 826, "text": "Is there some, obviously, it's kind of almost like a literary, like you push the point strongly to really explore that point."}, {"time": 836, "text": "But is there some sense in that other people ruin the experience of what it means to be human?"}, {"time": 843, "text": "I think for Sartre, the phenomenon is this, like, it's not just that you wear clothes because people wear clothes in our society, like you have a particular style, you wear a particular kind of clothes."}, {"time": 855, "text": "And for Sartre, like to have that style authentically, in good faith, rather than in bad faith, it has to come from you, you have to make the choice."}, {"time": 865, "text": "But other people are making choices also, and like, you're looking at their choices and you're thinking, that guy looks good, maybe I could try that one on."}, {"time": 875, "text": "And if you try it on because you were influenced by the fact that you thought that guy was doing it well, then there's some important sense in which, although that's a resource for a choice for you, it's also acting in bad faith."}, {"time": 890, "text": "And God wouldn't do that, right?"}, {"time": 893, "text": "God wouldn't be influenced by other's decisions, and if that's the model, then I think that's the sense in which he thinks hell is other people."}, {"time": 900, "text": "What do you think parenting is then?"}, {"time": 902, "text": "It's like, what, because God doesn't have a parent, so aren't we significantly influenced, first of all, in the first few years of life, and even the teenager is resisting, like, learning through resistance."}, {"time": 919, "text": "I mean, I think what you're pushing on is the intuition that the ideal that Sartre's aiming at is a kind of inhuman ideal."}, {"time": 931, "text": "I mean, there's many ways in which we're not like the traditional view of what God was."}, {"time": 937, "text": "One is that we're not self generating, we have parents, we were raised into traditions and social norms, and we're raised into an understanding of what's appropriate and inappropriate to do."}, {"time": 955, "text": "And I think that's a deep intuition."}, {"time": 961, "text": "Martin Heidegger, who's the philosopher that Sartre thinks he's sort of taking this from, but I think Sartre's a kind of brilliant French misinterpretation of Heidegger's German phenomenological view, Heidegger says, a crucial aspect of what it is to be us is our thrownness."}, {"time": 980, "text": "We're thrown into a situation, we're thrown into history, we're thrown into our parental lineage, and we don't choose it."}, {"time": 990, "text": "That's stuff that we don't choose, we couldn't choose."}, {"time": 993, "text": "If we were God and we existed outside of time, maybe, but we're not."}, {"time": 997, "text": "We're finite in the sense that we have a beginning that we never chose."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "We have an end that we're often trying to resist or put off or something, and in between there's a whole bunch of stuff that organizes us without our ever having made the choice and without the kind of being that could make the choice to allow it to organize us."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "We have a complicated relationship to that stuff, and I think we should talk about that at a certain point."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "But the first move is to say, Sartre's just got a sort of descriptive problem."}, {"time": 1032, "text": "He's missed this basic fact that there has to be an awful lot about us that's settled without our having made the choice to settle it that way."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "Right, the thrownness of life."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "That's a fundamental part of life, you can't just escape it."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "You can't escape it altogether."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "Altogether."}, {"time": 1057, "text": "But nevertheless, you are riding a wave and you make a decision in the riding of the wave."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "You can't control the wave, but you should be, as you ride it, you should be making certain kinds of decisions and take responsibility for it."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "So why does this matter at all, the chain of decisions you make?"}, {"time": 1080, "text": "Well, because they constitute you."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "They make you the person that you are."}, {"time": 1083, "text": "So what's the opposite view?"}, {"time": 1086, "text": "What's this view against?"}, {"time": 1088, "text": "This view is against most of philosophy from Plato forward."}, {"time": 1094, "text": "Plato says in the Republic, it's a kind of myth, but he says, people will understand their condition well if we tell them this myth."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "He says, look, when you're born, there's just a fact about you."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "Your soul is either gold, silver, or bronze."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "Those are the three kinds of people there are, and you're born that way."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "And if your soul is gold, then we should identify that and make you a philosopher king."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "And if your soul is silver, well, you're not gonna be a philosopher king."}, {"time": 1125, "text": "You're not capable of it, but you could be a good warrior and we should make you that."}, {"time": 1129, "text": "And if your soul is bronze, then you should be a farmer, laborer, something like that."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "And that's a fact about you that identifies you forever and for always, independent of anything you do about it."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "And so that's the alternative view."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "And you could have modern versions of it."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "You could say the thing that identifies you is your IQ or your genetic makeup or the percentage of fast switch muscle fibers you've got or whatever, it could be something totally independent of any choice that you've made, independent of the kind of thing about which you could make a choice and it categorizes you."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "It makes you the person that you are."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "That's the thing that Sartre and the existentialists are against."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "So this idea that something about you is forever limiting the space of possible decisions you can make."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "Sartre says, no, the space is unlimited."}, {"time": 1186, "text": "Sartre is the philosopher of radical freedom."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Radical freedom."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "Yeah, radical freedom."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "And then you could have other existentialists who say, look, we are free, but we gotta understand the way in which our freedom is limited by certain aspects of the kind of being that we are."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "If we were radically free, we really would be like God in the traditional medieval sense."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "And sort of these folks start with the idea that whatever we are, that's a kind of limit point that we're not gonna reach."}, {"time": 1217, "text": "So what are the ways in which we're constrained that that being the way the medieval's understood him wasn't constrained?"}, {"time": 1226, "text": "So can you maybe comment on what is nihilism and is it at all a useful other sort of group of ideas that you resist against in defining existentialism?"}, {"time": 1240, "text": "So nihilism, the philosopher who made the term popular, although it was used before him as Nietzsche, Nietzsche's writing in the end of the 19th century, in various places where he published things, but largely in his unpublished works, he identifies the condition of the modern world as nihilistic, and that's a descriptive claim."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "He's looking around him, trying to figure out what it's like to be us now, and he says it's a lot different from what it was like to be human in 1300 or in the 5th century BCE."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "In 1300, like what people believed, the way they lived their lives was in the understanding that to be human was to be created in the image and likeness of God."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "That's the way they understood themselves."}, {"time": 1300, "text": "And also to be created sinful because of Adam and Eve's transgression in the Garden of Eden, and to have the project of trying to understand how, as a sinful being, you could nevertheless live a virtuous life."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "How could you do that?"}, {"time": 1317, "text": "And it had to do with, for them, getting in the right relation to God."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "Nietzsche says that doesn't make sense to us anymore in the end of the 19th century."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "God is dead, says Nietzsche famously."}, {"time": 1331, "text": "Well, it means something like the role that God used to play in our understanding of ourselves as a culture isn't a role that God can play anymore."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "And so Nietzsche says the role that God used to play was the role of grounding our existence."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "He was what it is in virtue of which we are who we are."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "And Nietzsche says the idea that there is a being that makes us what we are doesn't make sense anymore."}, {"time": 1358, "text": "It's like Sartre's atheism, Sartre is taking that from Nietzsche."}, {"time": 1361, "text": "And so the question is, what does ground our existence?"}, {"time": 1366, "text": "And the answer is Nihil, nothing."}, {"time": 1369, "text": "And so nihilism is the idea that there's nothing outside of us that grounds our existence."}, {"time": 1375, "text": "And then Nietzsche asked the question, well, what are we supposed to do about that?"}, {"time": 1379, "text": "How do we live?"}, {"time": 1382, "text": "And I think Nietzsche has a different story than Sartre about that."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "Nietzsche doesn't emphasize this notion of radical freedom."}, {"time": 1392, "text": "Nietzsche emphasizes something else."}, {"time": 1395, "text": "He says, we're artists of life."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "And artists are interesting because the natural way of thinking about artists is that they're responding to something."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "They find themselves in a situation and they say, this is what's going to make sense of the situation."}, {"time": 1413, "text": "This is what I have to write."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "This is the way I have to dance."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "This is the way I've got to play the music."}, {"time": 1419, "text": "And Nietzsche says, we should live like that."}, {"time": 1421, "text": "There are constraints, but understanding what they are is a complicated aspect of living itself."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "And there's a great story, I think, from music that maybe helps to understand this."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "I think Nietzsche, of course, jazz didn't exist when Nietzsche was writing, but I think Nietzsche really is thinking of something like jazz improvisation."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "He talks about improvisation, there's classical improvisation."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "Nietzsche was, by the way, a musician."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "He was a composer and a pianist, not a great one, really, to be fair, but he loved music."}, {"time": 1459, "text": "And Herbie Hancock, who's a pianist, a jazz pianist, who played with Miles Davis for quite a while in the 60s, tells this kind of incredible story that I think exemplifies Nietzsche's view about the way in which we bear some responsibility for being creative and that gives us a certain kind of freedom, but we don't have the radical freedom that Sartre thinks."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "So what's the story?"}, {"time": 1492, "text": "Herbie Hancock says, I think they were in Stuttgart, he says, playing a show and things were great, he says."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "He's a young pianist and Miles Davis is the master."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "And he says, I'm back in the solo and I'm playing these chords."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "And he says, I played this chord and it was the wrong chord."}, {"time": 1522, "text": "He's like, that's what you got to say, it didn't work right there."}, {"time": 1527, "text": "And I thought, holy mackerel, I screwed up, I screwed up."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "We were tight, everything was working and I blew it for Miles, who's doing his solo."}, {"time": 1535, "text": "And he said, Miles paused for a moment and then all of a sudden he went on in a way that made my chord right."}, {"time": 1551, "text": "And I think that idea that you could be an artist who responds to what's thrown at you in such a way as to make it right, by what measure?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Everyone could hear it, is all you can say, right?"}, {"time": 1568, "text": "Everyone knew, wow, that really works."}, {"time": 1571, "text": "And I think that's not like, there are constraints, not anything would have worked there."}, {"time": 1576, "text": "He couldn't have just played anything."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "Most of what anyone would have played would have sounded terrible."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "But the constraints aren't preexisting, they're what's happening now in the moment for these listeners and these performers."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "And I think that's what Nietzsche thinks the right response to nihilism is, we're involved, but we're not radically free to make any choice and just stand behind it the way Sartre thinks."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "Our choices have to be responsive to our situation and they have to make the situation work."}, {"time": 1607, "text": "They have to make it right."}, {"time": 1610, "text": "And there's something about music too, so you basically have to make music of all the moments of life."}, {"time": 1617, "text": "And there is something about music, why is music so compelling?"}, {"time": 1621, "text": "And when you listen to it, something about certain kinds of music, it connects with you."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "But in that same way, for Nietzsche, you should be a creative force that creates a musical masterpiece."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "And I think what's interesting is the question, what does it mean to be a creative force there?"}, {"time": 1639, "text": "There's a traditional notion of creation that we associate with God."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "God creates ex nihilo, out of nothing."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "And you might think that nihilism thinks that we should do that, create ex nihilo, because it's about how there's nothing at our ground."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "But I think the right way to read Nietzsche is to recognize that we don't create out of nothing."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "Miles Davis wasn't nothing, that situation preexisted him, it was given to him."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "Maybe by accident, maybe it was a mistake, whatever, but he was responding to that situation in a way that made it right."}, {"time": 1677, "text": "He wasn't just creating out of nothing, he was creating out of what was already there."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "So that makes that first date with the climbing hand even more complicated because you're given a climbing hand, you're going to have to make art and music out of that."}, {"time": 1691, "text": "That's the responsibility for both of them."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "Wow, that's a lot of responsibility for a first date because you have to create."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "The emphasis isn't just on making decisions, it's on creating."}, {"time": 1706, "text": "But also on listening, right?"}, {"time": 1708, "text": "I mean, Miles Davis was listening."}, {"time": 1710, "text": "He heard that."}, {"time": 1711, "text": "He knew it was wrong."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "And the question was, what do I play that makes it right?"}, {"time": 1717, "text": "So let me ask about Nietzsche, is God dead?"}, {"time": 1722, "text": "What did he mean by that statement?"}, {"time": 1723, "text": "In your sense, the truth behind the question and the possible set of answers that our world today provides?"}, {"time": 1732, "text": "So, I mean, I think that there's something super perceptive about Nietzsche's diagnosis of the condition at the end of the 19th century."}, {"time": 1742, "text": "So not so far from the condition that I think we're currently in."}, {"time": 1748, "text": "And I think there's an interesting question what we're supposed to do in response."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "But what is the condition that we're currently in?"}, {"time": 1754, "text": "When Nietzsche says God is dead, I think, like I was saying before, he means something like the role that God used to play in grounding our existence is not a role that works for us anymore as a culture."}, {"time": 1769, "text": "And when people talk about a view like that nowadays, they use a different terminology, but I think it's roughly what Nietzsche was aiming at."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "They say we live in a secular age."}, {"time": 1780, "text": "Our age is a secular age."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "And so what do people mean when they say that?"}, {"time": 1784, "text": "I think, first of all, it's a descriptive claim."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "It could be wrong."}, {"time": 1788, "text": "The question is, does this really describe the way we experience ourselves as a culture or as a culture in the West or wherever it is that we are?"}, {"time": 1797, "text": "So what does it mean to say that we live in a secular age, an age in which God is dead?"}, {"time": 1801, "text": "Well, the first thing is it doesn't mean there are no religious believers because there are plenty."}, {"time": 1806, "text": "There are people who go to church or synagogue or mosque every

opened up."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "And different languages open up different possibilities."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "And we had that discussion offline about James Joyce, how I took a course in James Joyce and how I don't think I understood anything besides the dead and the short stories."}, {"time": 2787, "text": "And you suggested that it might be helpful to actually visit Ireland, visit

language."}, {"time": 2804, "text": "It's understanding something much deeper, the music of the language or something, music of the ideas."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "It's very hard to say exactly what that is."}, {"time": 2816, "text": "But when you hear an Irish person who really understands Joyce read some sentences, they have a different cadence, they have a different tonality, they have

certain ways."}, {"time": 2835, "text": "That's what great actors can do."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "But I think language is rich like that."}, {"time": 2842, "text": "And the idea which philosophers tend to have that we're really studying the crucial aspects of language when we think about its logical form, when we think about the sort of claims of philosophical logic that you can make or how do you translate this proposition into some symbolic form, I think that's part of what goes on in language."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "But I think that when language affects us in the deep way that it can when great poets or great writers or great thinkers use it to great effect, it's way more than that."}, {"time": 2878, "text": "And that's the interesting form of language that I'm interested in."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "It's kind of a challenge I'm hoping to take on is I feel like some of the ideas that are conveyed through language are actually can be put outside of language."},

sitting in another room and you hear the music through the wall."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "I get a sense of it."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "I think that would be a waste if I don't try to pursue this

the places where translators diverge in their translations of a given word or a phrase or something like that, you can start to get the idea that somehow the words that we have in English, they don't have the same contours as the word in Russian that's being translated."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "And then you can start to ask about what those differences are."}, {"time": 3007, "text": "And I think

to do a diff where you automatically detect all the differences in the translation just as you're saying and use that, like somebody needs to publish literally just books describing the differences."}, {"time": 3055, "text": "In fact, I'll probably do a little bit of this."}, {"time": 3057, "text": "I heard the individual translators in interviews and in blog posts and articles

felt alive."}, {"time": 3617, "text": "And it could happen in a moment when, I don't know, maybe Miles Davis felt it in that moment when he was responding to Herbie Hancock's chord, or maybe you feel

somebody else do a peak athletic thing."}, {"time": 3645, "text": "But I think there are moments when it feels like it's not like the way Camus is describing things."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "And it's better because of that."}, {"time": 3656, "text": "So I think one really powerful way for me to understand aliveness is to think about going to a darker territory, is to think about suicide."},

question."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "And there is people who, when they're depressed, say, not only do they say, I want to kill myself or I don't, they say, it doesn't matter."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "And that's chemistry, that's whatever that is, that's chemistry in our mind."}, {"time": 3714, "text": "And then on the flip side of that, for me, I've had some low points, but I've been very fortunate to not suffer from that kind of depression."}, {"time": 3723, "text": "I am the opposite, which is not only moments of peak performance in athletics or great music or any of that, I'm just deeply joyful often by mundane things."}, {"time": 3739, "text": "As you were saying it, I was drinking this thing and it's cold, and for some reason the coldness of that was like, oh, great, like refrigeration."}, {"time": 3748, "text": "There was a joy in that, like, I can't put it into words, but it just felt great."}, {"time": 3752, "text": "And then just so many things, you look out in nature, there's a nice breeze and just like, it's amazing."}, {"time": 3760, "text": "So that doesn't feel like I'm embracing the absurd."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "That seems like I'm getting some nice like dopamine hits in whatever the chemistry is from just the basics of life, and that is the source of aliveness."}, {"time": 3776, "text": "However my brain is built, it's gotten a natural sort of mechanism for aliveness."}, {"time": 3785, "text": "And so one nice way to see the absence of aliveness is to look at the chemical, the clinical depression."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And so that Camus doesn't seem to contend with that at all in asking the question of suicide because when you look in the mirror and ask, like, if I ask myself, do I want to kill myself today, I ask that question in a different way, more like a stoic way often, like basically every day is, you know, what if I die today?"}, {"time": 3813, "text": "It's more like contemplating your mortality every single day."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "You know, that excites me, the possibility that this is my last day, that, you know, it just reminds me how amazing life is."}, {"time": 3827, "text": "And that's chemistry, I don't know what that is, but that's not, that's certainly not some kind of philosophical decision I made."}, {"time": 3837, "text": "I am a little bit riding a wave of the chemistry of the genetics I've been given, of the dopamine."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "So that question of suicide, by the way, do you find that formulation of the question of existentialism, I know you didn't want to teach it because obviously suicide is a very difficult word, especially for young minds, but do you think that's a useful formulation of the question of existentialism?"}, {"time": 3865, "text": "Like him saying, this is the most important question of suicide."}, {"time": 3869, "text": "I think there is something to it, if you read the question as the question, what is it in virtue of which it ought to be desirable to live the lives that we're capable of living?"}, {"time": 3883, "text": "That's a deep question."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "Yeah, that's a question that gets focused when someone asks themselves whether they ought to continue to live that life."}, {"time": 3893, "text": "The famous line, nothing focuses the mind more than one's impending execution."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "I think there's something important about that, that recognizing the riskiness and the vulnerability of one's existence is super important."}, {"time": 3913, "text": "And I think that if we didn't have that, our lives wouldn't be capable of being meaningful."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "If they weren't risky and vulnerable, there would be nothing to lose."}, {"time": 3925, "text": "And it's only because there are things to lose that they can come to have the significance that they do."}, {"time": 3929, "text": "So yeah, I think I'm not against the idea that that's a deep way of approaching the questions at the core of existentialism."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "But as you said, I was worried for a while about how I was going to teach it."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "Well, I think there's a difference between suicide and not living because suicide is an action."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "So it feels like to me, like suicide doesn't make sense because, you know, imagine you're in like a hotel and you're saying the room I'm in sucks, but like there's other rooms."}, {"time": 3964, "text": "So like maybe explore those other rooms."}, {"time": 3968, "text": "Maybe you'll find meaning in those other rooms, like basically embracing the fact that you don't know everything and there's a, you need time to explore everything."}, {"time": 3980, "text": "It's like once you've explored everything, then maybe you can make a full decision."}, {"time": 3985, "text": "But it's unfair to make a decision."}, {"time": 3990, "text": "It's I would say unethical to make a decision until you've explored all the rooms in the hotel."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "And this gets focused in the brothers Karamazov, of course."}, {"time": 4000, "text": "There's one brother who is really asking that question, is asking the question of suicide."}, {"time": 4007, "text": "He's asking the question whether the world that we live in is a world that's worth living in."}, {"time": 4014, "text":

think it is possible for someone to be in that situation."}, {"time": 4040, "text": "I think that Ivan Karamazov, who's the character who's asking this question, is, you know, maybe let's say chemically depressed or something like that."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "But I think there's more to it too."}, {"time": 4053, "text": "And I think that Dostoevsky's real view is that the brain chemistry doesn't exist on its own."}, {"time": 4060, "text": "Like the way we interact with one another, the way we care about or isolate ourselves from others, the way we care for the lives that we lead, affects the chemistry of our brain, which goes on and changes the mood that we're in."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "So I think Dostoevsky does think that Ivan's salvation, if he's capable of being saved, is gonna come through the love of his brother Alyosha."}, {"time": 4089, "text": "Let me spring maybe a bit of a tangent on you."}, {"time": 4093, "text": "Do you ever, one of my other favorite

"Like there's a existentialist kind of ideal pervading most of his work."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "But there's more of a, like with Siddhartha, there's more almost like a Buddhist sort of like watch the river and like become the river."}, {"time": 4133, "text": "Like this kind of idea that what it means to truly experience the moment."}, {"time": 4139, "text": "So there is an experiential part of existentialism where you want to, it's not just about, we've been talking about kind of decisions and actions, but also what it means to listen, like you said from Nietzsche, like what it means to really take in the world and experience the moment."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "So he's very good at writing about what it means to experience the moment and experience the full absurdity of the moment."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "And for him, I'm starting to forget, Steppenwolf, I think, is humor."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "It's part of the absurdity, which I think modern day internet explores very well with memes and so on."}, {"time": 4177, "text": "Humor is a fundamental part of the existentialist ethic that's able to deal with absurdity."}, {"time": 4185, "text": "You got to like laugh at it."}, {"time": 4188, "text": "I think there is some, let me just say something about humor because I think you're absolutely right."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "Richard Bard, who is Danish and most people think deeply depressed and so on, is actually an incredibly funny writer."}, {"time": 4202, "text": "And someone who was a classmate of mine in graduate school who left

that's crucial to the important possibilities for us."}, {"time": 4248, "text": "And so there's the idea that there's a moment when a joke is being set up, when you're sort of proceeding as if you're on stable ground, and then the punchline comes and the rug is pulled out from under you."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "And for a moment, it's like you're falling."}, {"time": 4268, "text": "There's nothing supporting you until you're captured by your totally new understanding of what was going on, and that humor necessarily has that kind of destabilizing feature to it."}, {"time": 4283, "text":

possibility of significance."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "And so I think on Eric's reading, Kierkegaard sort of wants to line up the importance of the riskiness and vulnerability in your life to its having meaning with the experience of destabilization that you get in jokes and comedy, which then becomes significant, right?"}, {"time": 4315, "text": "When you remember having heard a joke for the first time, it's got a kind of salience for you."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "Speaking of jokes, and speaking of, you mentioned film and literature, so existentialism in film and literature."}, {"time":

they have German accents."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "So maybe can you talk about notable appearances of existentialism in film, and if you at all ever bring up Big Lebowski, if that ever comes into play?"}, {"time": 4365, "text": "So I know that people think about the Big Lebowski in this context, and I did actually rewatch it not so long ago."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "We have kids, and I

character."}, {"time": 4398, "text": "Jeff Bridges character, yeah."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "He kind of, he drinks like these white Russians, and he just kind of walks around in a very relaxed way,

lives trying to do some big projects that are dramatic in some way, make some huge amounts of money."}, {"time": 4434, "text": "So it kind of actually reminds me of The Idiot by Dostoevsky in a certain kind of sense."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "And then there's these players, I mean, they're phrased as nihilists, but they kind of don't care to enjoy life."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "They want

Donnie, who is a bit clueless, and then there's the John Goodman character that's talking about Vietnam and just takes life way too seriously, too intensely and so on."}, {"time": 4473, "text": "So it just paints a full sort of spectrum of characters that are operating in this world."}, {"time": 4478, "text": "And perhaps most importantly for existentialism are thrown into absurdity and hence the

be."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "And this happened actually in the 20s."}, {"time": 4507, "text": "There was a famous case of a couple of German students, Leopold and Loeb, who'd read a lot of

about AlphaZero when it played Go, it's like it's playing from the future."}, {"time": 9598, "text": "It's making these moves that are just outlandish and there's a kind of brilliance to them that we can't really understand, we'll be catching up to it forever."}, {"time": 9609, "text": "I think in that context, it's mapped the domain and the domain is mappable because it's a combinatorial problem roughly."}, {"time": 9618, "text": "But in something like music or art of a nonfinite form, it feels to me like it's a little harder for me to understand what the analog of our trusting that Stravinsky has recognized something about us that demands that he write this way, that doesn't seem like a finite thing in quite the same way."}, {"time": 9645, "text": "So now we could ask the system, why did you do it?"}, {"time": 9648, "text": "We could ask Stravinsky, why did you do it?"}, {"time": 9652, "text": "And maybe it will have answers, but then it's involved in a kind of

special."}, {"time": 9731, "text": "I think one of the hardest things is the physical space, actually operating touch and the magic of body language and the music of all of that, because it's so

human human prize."}, {"time": 9834, "text": "And he competed for the most human human prize, and he won it, he kept winning it."}, {"time": 9840, "text": "And so he tried to think about what it is

that's how they keep their job."}, {"time": 9921, "text": "And they ask you this question, you've got to answer it."}, {"time": 9924, "text": "And it's as if you're no longer interacting with a person, even though it's a person, because they've so given up everything that's involved normally with being able to make judgments and decisions and act in situations and take responsibility."},

way that the norms for what we're aiming at are being changed to move in the direction of this sort of efficiently and in an optimized way solving a problem and move away from this other kind of thing that we were calling aliveness or significance."}, {"time": 9982, "text": "And so that's the other side of the story."}, {"time": 9985, "text": "And that's the worry."}, {"time": 9986, "text": "But it's very possible that there is, for you and I, the ancient dinosaurs, we may not see the aliveness in TikTok, the aliveness in the digital space, that you see it as us being dragged into this over
