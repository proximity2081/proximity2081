We talk about something that causes mortality fatal."}, {"time": 450, "text": "But what we actually mean is it's full of fate."}, {"time": 453, "text": "And I don't mean in the sense of things are prewritten."}, {"time": 456, "text": "What I mean is the sense of the universe doesn't care about your personal narrative."}, {"time": 464, "text": "You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life."}, {"time": 469, "text": "It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness, and you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die."}, {"time": 478, "text": "That's mortality."}, {"time": 479, "text": "Mortality isn't just some far flung event."}, {"time": 482, "text": "It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way."}, {"time": 489, "text": "So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them."}, {"time": 502, "text": "The death is the indifference of nature of the universe to your existence."}, {"time": 508, "text": "And so in that sense, it is always here with us."}, {"time": 511, "text": "Yeah, but you're vulnerable in so many ways other than just the ending of your biological life."}, {"time": 518, "text": "Because it's interesting, if you rate what people fear most, death is not number one."}, {"time": 523, "text": "They often put public speaking as number one."}, {"time": 527, "text": "Because the death of status or reputation can also be a profound loss for human beings."}, {"time": 534, "text": "It can drive them into despair."}, {"time": 536, "text": "So as the terror management folks would say, as Ernest Becker would say, that a self report on a survey is not an accurate way to capture what is actually at the core of the motivation of a human being."}, {"time": 548, "text": "That we could be terrified of death."}, {"time": 550, "text": "And we, from childhood, since we realized the absurdity of the fact that the right ends, we've learned to really try to forget about it, try to construct illusions that allow us to escape momentarily or for prolonged periods of time the realization that we die."}, {"time": 572, "text": "Okay, so first, I took it seriously, but now I want to say why there's some empirical work that makes me want to reconsider it."}, {"time": 579, "text": "So terror management theory is you do things like you give people a list of words to read."}, {"time": 585, "text": "And in those lists are words associated with death, cough, and funeral."}, {"time": 591, "text": "And then you see what happens to people."}, {"time": 592, "text": "And generally, they start to become more rigid in their thinking."}, {"time": 595, "text": "They tend to identify with their worldview."}, {"time": 598, "text": "They lose cognitive flexibility."}, {"time": 601, "text": "That's if you present it to them in that third person perspective."}, {"time": 604, "text": "But if you get them to go in the first person perspective and imagine that they're dying and that the people that they care about are there with them, they don't show those responses."}, {"time": 617, "text": "In fact, they show us an increase in cognitive flexibility, an increase in openness."}, {"time": 623, "text": "See, so I'm trying to say we might be putting the cart before the horse."}, {"time": 627, "text": "It might not be death per se, but the kind of meaning that is present or absent in death that is the crucial thing for us."}, {"time": 634, "text": "By the way, to push back, I don't think you took it seriously."}, {"time": 637, "text": "I don't think you truly steel manned the case because you're saying that death is always present with us, yes, but isn't there a case to be made that it is one of the major motivators?"}, {"time": 649, "text": "Nietzsche, will to power, Freud wanting to have sex with your mother, all the different explanations of what is truly motivating us human beings."}, {"time": 658, "text": "Isn't there a strong case to be made that this death thing is a really damn good, if not anything, a tool to motivate the behavior of humans?"}, {"time": 672, "text": "I'm not saying that the avoidance of death is not significant for human beings, but I'm proposing to you that human beings have a capacity for considering certain deaths meaningful and certain deaths meaningless, and we have lots of evidence that people are willing to sacrifice their biological existence for a death they consider meaningful."}, {"time": 696, "text": "Are you personally afraid of your death if you think about it?"}, {"time": 700, "text": "As somebody who produces a lot of ideas, records them, writes them down, is a deep thinker, admired thinker, and as the years go on, become more and more admired, does it scare you that the ride ends?"}, {"time": 717, "text": "I mean, you have to talk to me on all my levels."}, {"time": 720, "text": "I'm a biological organism, so if something's thrown at my head, I'll duck and things like that."}, {"time": 726, "text": "But if you're asking me, do I long to live forever, no."}, {"time": 733, "text": "In the Buddhist tradition, there are practices that are designed to make you aware of simultaneously the horror of mortality and the horror of immortality."}, {"time": 742, "text": "The thought of living forever is actually horrific to me."}, {"time": 749, "text": "Are those the only two options?"}, {"time": 752, "text": "Like when you're sitting with a loved one or watching a movie you just really love or a book you really love, you don't want it to end, you don't necessarily always flip it to the other aspect, the complete opposite of the thought experiment."}, {"time": 769, "text": "What happens if the book lasts forever?"}, {"time": 772, "text": "There's got to be a middle ground, like the snooze button."}, {"time": 775, "text": "Sure you don't want to sleep forever, but maybe press the snooze button and get an extra 15 minutes."}, {"time": 781, "text": "There's surely some kind of balance, that fear seems to be a source of an intense appreciation of the moment, in part, and that's what the Stoics talked about, sort of the meditate on one's mortality."}, {"time": 798, "text": "It seems to be a nice wake up call to that life is full of moments that are beautiful and then you don't get an infinite number of them."}, {"time": 809, "text": "Right, and the Stoic response was not the project of trying to extend the duration of your life, but to deepen those moments so they become as satisfying as possible so that when death comes it does not strike you as any kind of calamity."}, {"time": 826, "text": "Does that project ring true for your own personal feelings?"}, {"time": 834, "text": "I don't so much anymore."}, {"time": 839, "text": "Part of it, as I'm older and your temporal horizon flips somewhere in your 30s or 40s, you don't live from your birth, you live towards your death."}, {"time": 849, "text": "That's such a beautiful phrase, the temporal horizon flips."}, {"time": 855, "text": "At what point is that?"}, {"time": 858, "text": "The point before which the world of opportunity and possibility is infinite before you."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Yeah, it's like Peter Pan."}, {"time": 867, "text": "There's all these golden possibilities and you fly around between them."}, {"time": 871, "text": "Yes, very much."}, {"time": 873, "text": "And then when it flips, you start to look for a different model, the Socratic, the Stoic model, Buddhism has also influenced me, which is more about, wait, when I look at my desires, I seem to have two meta desires."}, {"time": 890, "text": "In addition to satisfying a particular desire, I want whatever satisfies my desire to be real and whatever is satisfying my desire to not cause internal conflict but bring something like peace of mind."}, {"time": 905, "text": "And so I more and more move towards how can I live such that those two meta desires are a constant frame within which I'm trying to satisfy my specific desires."}, {"time": 922, "text": "I think mind and life go away completely when we die."}, {"time": 928, "text": "And I think that's actually significantly important for the kind of beings that we are."}, {"time": 937, "text": "We are the kinds of beings that can come to that awareness and then we have a responsibility to decide how we're going to comport ourselves towards it."}, {"time": 948, "text": "Can you linger on what that means, the mind goes away?"}, {"time": 952, "text": "Like when you're playing music and the last instrument is put down, the song is over."}, {"time": 960, "text": "Doesn't mean the song wasn't beautiful."}, {"time": 962, "text": "Doesn't mean the song wasn't complex."}, {"time": 964, "text": "Doesn't mean the song didn't add to the value of the universe and its existence, but it came to an end."}, {"time": 971, "text": "Is there some aspect in which some part of mind was there before the human and remains after?"}, {"time": 980, "text": "Something like panpsychism or is it too much for us limited cognitive beings to understand?"}, {"time": 986, "text": "Something like panpsychism, I take it seriously."}, {"time": 989, "text": "I don't think it's a ridiculous proposal, but I think it has insoluble problems that make me doubt it."}, {"time": 997, "text": "Any idea that the mind is some kind of ultimately immaterial substance also has for me just devastating problems."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "Those are the two kinds of framework that people usually propose in order to support some kind of idea of immortality."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "I find both very problematic."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "The fact that we participate in distributed cognition, that most of our problem solving is not done as individuals but in groups, this is something I work on, I've published on that."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "But most of the people who do work on systems of distributed cognition think that while there's such a thing as collective intelligence, there's no good evidence that there's collective consciousness."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "In fact, it's often called zombie agency for that reason."}, {"time": 1045, "text": "And so while I think it's very clear that no one person runs an airline, and there's a collective intelligence that solves that problem, I do not think that collective intelligence supports any kind of consciousness."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "And so therefore, I don't think the fact that I participate, which I regularly and reliably do in distributed cognition, gives me any reason to believe that that participation grounds some kind of consciousness."}, {"time": 1071, "text": "Okay, there's so many things to mention there."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "First of all, distributed cognition, maybe that's a synonym for collective intelligence."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "So that means a bunch of humans individually are able to think, have cognitive machines, and are somehow able to interact through the process of dialogue, as you talk about, to morph different ideas together, like this idea landscape together."}, {"time": 1100, "text": "It's so interesting to think about, okay, well, you do have these fascinating distributed cognition systems, but consciousness does not propagate in the same way as intelligence."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "But isn't there a case, if we just look at intelligence, if we look at us humans as a collection of smaller organisms, which we are, and so there's like a hierarchy of organisms, tiny ones, work together to form tiny villages that you can then start to see as individual organisms that are then also forming bigger villages and interacting different ways and function becomes more and more complex."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "And eventually we get to us humans to where we start to think, well, we're an individual, but really we're not."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "There's billions of organisms inside us, both domestic and foreign."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "So isn't that building up consciousnesses like turtles all the way up to us, our consciousness?"}, {"time": 1167, "text": "Why does it have to stop with us humans?"}, {"time": 1169, "text": "Are we the only, like, is this the phase transition when it becomes a zombie like giant hierarchical village that first like, oh, there's like a singing angels and it's consciousness is born in just us humans."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "Do bacteria have consciousness?"}, {"time": 1189, "text": "Not bacteria, but maybe you could say bacteria does, but like the interesting complicated organisms that are within us have consciousness."}, {"time": 1197, "text": "I think it's proper to argue, and I have, that like a paramecium or bacteria has a kind of agency and even a kind of intelligence, kind of sense making ability."}, {"time": 1210, "text": "But I do not think that we can attribute consciousness, at least what we mean by consciousness, this kind of self awareness, this ability to introspect, et cetera, et cetera, to bacteria."}, {"time": 1224, "text": "Now the reason why distributed cognition doesn't have consciousness, I think is a little bit more tricky."}, {"time": 1231, "text": "And I think there's no reason in principle why there couldn't be a consciousness for distributed cognition, collective intelligence."}, {"time": 1241, "text": "In fact, many, you know, philosophers would agree with me on that point."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "I think it's more an issue of certain empirical facts, bandwidth, density of connection, speed of information transfer, et cetera."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "It's conceivable that if we got some horrible Frankensteinian neural link and we linked our brains and we had the right density and dynamics and bandwidth and speed that a group consciousness could take shape."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "I don't have any argument in principle against that."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "I'm just saying those contingent facts do not yet exist, and therefore it is implausible that consciousness exists at the level of collective intelligence."}, {"time": 1284, "text": "So you talk about consciousness quite a bit."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "So let's step back and try to sneak up to a definition."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "For me, there are two aspects to answering that question."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "One is, what's the nature of consciousness?"}, {"time": 1300, "text": "How does something like consciousness exist in an otherwise apparently nonconscious universe?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "And then there's a function question, which is equally important, which is, what does consciousness do?"}, {"time": 1312, "text": "The first one is obviously, you know, problematic for most people, like, yeah, consciousness seems to be so different from the rest of the nonconscious universe."}, {"time": 1322, "text": "But I put it to you that the function question is also very hard, because you are clearly capable of very sophisticated, intelligent behavior without consciousness."}, {"time": 1335, "text": "You are turning the noises coming out of my face hole into ideas in your mind, and you have no conscious awareness of how that process is occurring."}, {"time": 1347, "text": "So why do we have consciousness at all?"}, {"time": 1349, "text": "Now, here's the thing."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "There's an extra question you need to ask."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "Should we attempt to answer those questions separately, or should we attempt to answer them in an integrated fashion?"}, {"time": 1361, "text": "I make the case that you actually have to answer them in an integrated fashion."}, {"time": 1366, "text": "What consciousness does, and what it is, we should be able to give it a unified answer to both of those."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "Can you try to elucidate the difference between what consciousness is and what it does, both of which are mysteries, as you say, state versus action?"}, {"time": 1388, "text": "Can you try to explain the difference that's interesting, that's useful, that's important to understand?"}, {"time": 1394, "text": "So that's putting me in a bit of a difficult position, because I actually argue that trying to answer them separately is ultimately incoherent."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "But what I can point to are many published articles in which only one of these problems is addressed, and the other is left unaddressed."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "So people will try and explain what qualia are, how they potentially emerge, without saying what do they do, what problems do they help to solve, how do they make the organism more adaptive."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And then you'll have other people who will say, no, no, this is what the function of consciousness is, but I don't know, I can't tell you, I can't solve the hard problem, I don't know how qualia exist."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "So what I'm saying is many people treat these problems separately, although I think that's ultimately an incoherent way to approach the problem."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "So the hard problem is focusing on what it is."}, {"time": 1446, "text": "So the qualia, that it feels like something to experience a thing, that's what consciousness is."}, {"time": 1451, "text": "And does is more about the functional usefulness of the thing, to the whole beautiful mix of cognition and just function in everyday life."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "Okay, you've also said that you can do very intelligent things without consciousness."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "Yes, clearly."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "I don't know what I'm doing to access my memory."}, {"time": 1483, "text": "It just comes up, and it comes up really intelligently."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "But the mechanisms that create consciousness could be deeply interlinked with whatever is doing the memory access, that's doing the... Oh, I think so, in fact, yes, yes."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "So I guess what I'm trying to say in this will probably sneak up to this question a few times, which is whether we can build machines that are conscious, or machines that are intelligent, one level intelligent or beyond, without building the consciousness."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "I mean, ultimately, that's one of the ways to understand what consciousness is, is to build the thing."}, {"time": 1528, "text": "We can either sort of from the Chomsky way, try to construct models, like he thinks about language in this way, try to construct models and theories of how the thing works, or we can just build the damn thing."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "And that's a methodological principle in cognitive science."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "In fact, one of the things that sort of distinguishes cognitive science from other disciplines dealing with the nature of cognition in the mind is that cognitive science takes the design stance."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "It asks, well, could we build a machine that would not only simulate it, but serve as a bona fide explanation of the phenomenon?"}, {"time": 1569, "text": "Do you find any efforts in cognitive science compelling in this direction?"}, {"time": 1575, "text": "In terms of how far we are, there's, on the computational side of things, something called cognitive modeling, there's all these kinds of packages that you can construct simplified models of how the brain does things and see if complex behaviors emerge."}, {"time": 1592, "text": "Do you find any efforts in cognitive, or what efforts in cognitive science do you find most inspiring and productive?"}, {"time": 1601, "text": "I think the project of trying to create AGI, artificial general intelligence, is where I place my hope of artificial intelligence being of scientific significance."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "This is independent of technological socioeconomic significance, which is already well established."}, {"time": 1621, "text": "But being able to say because of the work in AI, we now have a good theory of cognition, intelligence, perhaps consciousness, I think that's where I place my bets is in the current endeavors around artificial general intelligence."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "And so tackling that problem head on, which has now become central, at least to a group of cognitive scientists, is I think what needs to be done."}, {"time": 1651, "text": "And when you think about AGI, do you think about systems that have consciousness?"}, {"time": 1657, "text": "Let's go back to what I think is at the core of your general intelligence."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "So right now, compared to even our best machines, you are a general problem solver."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "You can solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variety of domains."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "And some of our best machines have a little bit of transfer."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "They can learn this game and play a few other well designed rule bound games, but they couldn't learn how to swim, etc., things like that."}, {"time": 1685, "text": "And so what's interesting is what seems to come up, and this is some of my published work, in all these different domains of cognition across all these different problem types is a central problem."}, {"time": 1702, "text": "And since we do have good sort of psychometric evidence that we do have some general ability that's a significant component of our intelligence, I made an argument as to what I think that general ability is."}, {"time": 1715, "text": "And so it's happening right now."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "The amount of information in this room that you could actually pay attention to is combinatorial explosive."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "The amount of information you have in your memory, long term memory, and all the ways you could combine it, combinatorial explosive."}, {"time": 1734, "text": "The number of possibilities you can consider, also combinatorial explosive."}, {"time": 1738, "text": "The sequences of behavior you can generate, also combinatorial explosive."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "And yet somehow you're zeroing in."}, {"time": 1746, "text": "The right memories are coming up, the right possibilities are opening up, the right sequences of behavior, you're paying attention to the right thing."}, {"time": 1752, "text": "Not infallibly so, but so much so that you reliably find obvious what you should interact with in order to solve the problem at hand."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "That's an ability that is still not well understood within AGI."}, {"time": 1770, "text": "To filtering out the gigantic waterfall of data."}, {"time": 1776, "text": "It's almost like a Zen Koan."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "What makes you intelligent is your ability to ignore so much information and do it in such a way that is somewhere between arbitrary guessing and algorithmic search."}, {"time": 1793, "text": "And to a fault sometimes of course that you, based on the models you construct, you forget, you ignore things that you should probably not ignore."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "And that, hopefully we can circle back to it Lux, is related to the meaning issue."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "Because the very processes that make us adaptively intelligent make us perennially susceptible to self deceptive, self destructive behavior because of the way we misframe the environment in fundamental ways."}, {"time": 1824, "text": "So to you, meaning is also connected to ideas of wisdom and truth and how we interpret and understand and interact intellectually with the environment."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "So what is wisdom?"}, {"time": 1845, "text": "Why do we long for it?"}, {"time": 1846, "text": "How do we and where do we find it?"}, {"time": 1850, "text": "This is what you use to solve your problems, as I was just describing."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "Rationality is how you use your intelligence to overcome the problems of self deception that emerge when you're trying to solve your problems."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "So it's that meta problem."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And then the issue is, do you have just one kind of knowing?"}, {"time": 1872, "text": "I think you have multiple ways of knowing, and therefore you have multiple rationalities."}, {"time": 1878, "text": "And so wisdom is to coordinate those rationalities so that they are optimally constraining and affording each other."}, {"time": 1885, "text": "So in that way, wisdom is rationally self transcending rationality."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "So life is a kind of process where you jump from rationality to rationality and pick up a village of rationalities along the way that then turns into wisdom."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "Yes, if properly coordinated."}, {"time": 1906, "text": "You mentioned framing."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "So what is framing?"}, {"time": 1912, "text": "Is it a set of assumptions you bring to the table in how you see the world, how you reason about the world, how you understand the world?"}, {"time": 1923, "text": "So it depends what you mean by assumptions."}, {"time": 1926, "text": "If by assumption you mean a proposition, representational or rule, I think that's much more downstream from relevance realization."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "I think relevance realization refers to, again, constraints on how you are paying attention."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "And so for me, talking about framing is talking about this process you're doing right now of salient landscaping."}, {"time": 1955, "text": "What's salient to you?"}, {"time": 1957, "text": "And how is what's salient constantly shifting in a sort of a dynamic tapestry?"}, {"time": 1964, "text": "And how are you shaping yourself to the way that salient landscaping is aspectualizing the world, shaping it into aspects for interaction?"}, {"time": 1975, "text": "For me, that is a much more primordial process than any sort of beliefs we have."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "If we mean by beliefs a representational proposition, then we're in this very problematic position."}, {"time": 1994, "text": "Because then we're trying to say that propositions are ultimately responsible for how we do relevance realization."}, {"time": 2001, "text": "And
