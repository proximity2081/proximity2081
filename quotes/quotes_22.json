astronauts because he, it, she believes that they will interfere with the mission."}, {"time": 328, "text": "Yeah, well, there you are."}, {"time": 329, "text": "It's this view."}, {"time": 330, "text": "I don't know whether I disagree with it because in a certain sense it was telling you it's wrong."}, {"time": 335, "text": "See, the machine seemed to think it was superior to the human and so it was entitled to get rid of the human beings and run the show itself."}, {"time": 347, "text": "Well, do you think Hal did the right thing?"}, {"time": 349, "text": "Do you think Hal's flawed evil?"}, {"time": 352, "text": "Or if we think about systems like Hal, would we want Hal to do the same thing in the future?"}, {"time": 358, "text": "What was the flaw there?"}, {"time": 358, "text": "Well, you're basically touching on questions."}, {"time": 361, "text": "You see, it's one supposed to believe that Hal was actually conscious."}, {"time": 366, "text": "I mean, it was played rather that way, as though Hal was a conscious being."}, {"time": 373, "text": "Because Hal showed some pain, some cognizance, Hal appeared to be cognizant of what it means to die."}, {"time": 385, "text": "And therefore had an inkling of consciousness."}, {"time": 388, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure that aspect of it was made completely clear, whether Hal was really just a very sophisticated computer, which really didn't actually have these feelings and somehow, but you're right, it didn't like the idea of being turned off."}, {"time": 405, "text": "How does it change things if Hal was or wasn't conscious?"}, {"time": 409, "text": "Well, it might say that it would be wrong to turn it off if it was actually conscious."}, {"time": 415, "text": "I mean, these questions arise if you think."}, {"time": 417, "text": "I mean, AI, one of the ideas, it's sort of a mixture in a sense."}, {"time": 421, "text": "You say, if it's trying to do everything a human can do, and if you take the view that consciousness is something which would come along when the computer is sufficiently complicated, sufficiently whatever criterion you use to characterize its consciousness in terms of some computational criteria, computational criterion."}, {"time": 448, "text": "So how does consciousness change our evaluation of the decision that Hal made?"}, {"time": 455, "text": "I guess I was trying to say that people are a bit confused about this, because if they say these machines will become conscious, but just simply because it's a degree of computation, and when you get beyond that certain degree of computation, it will become conscious, then of course you have all these problems."}, {"time": 472, "text": "I mean, you might say, well, one of the reasons you're doing AI is because you want to send a device out to some distant planet, and you don't want to send a human out there, because then you'd have to bring it back again, and that costs you far more than just sending it there and leaving it there."}, {"time": 487, "text": "But if this device is actually a conscious entity, then you have to face up to the fact that that's immoral."}, {"time": 493, "text": "And so the mere fact that you're making some AI device and thinking that removes your responsibility to it would be incorrect."}, {"time": 505, "text": "And so this is a sign of flaw in that kind of viewpoint."}, {"time": 509, "text": "I'm not sure how people who take it very seriously, I mean, I had this curious conversation with, I'm going to forget names, I'm afraid, because this is what happens to me at the wrong moment, Hofstadter, Douglas Hofstadter."}, {"time": 525, "text": "Douglas Hofstadter, yeah."}, {"time": 526, "text": "And he'd written this book, God Will Let You Up, which I liked."}, {"time": 530, "text": "I thought it was a fantastic book."}, {"time": 536, "text": "I think he got it wrong, you see."}, {"time": 538, "text": "Well, I'll just tell you my story, you see, because I'd never met him."}, {"time": 542, "text": "And then I knew I was going to meet him, the occasion I realized he was coming in, he wanted to talk to me, and I said, that's fine."}, {"time": 549, "text": "And I thought in my mind, well, I'm going to paint him into a corner, you see, because I'll use his arguments to convince him that certain numbers are conscious."}, {"time": 559, "text": "Some integers, large enough integers are actually conscious."}, {"time": 562, "text": "And this was going to be my reductio ad absurdum."}, {"time": 565, "text": "So I started having this argument with him."}, {"time": 566, "text": "He simply leapt into the corner."}, {"time": 568, "text": "He didn't even need to be painted into it."}, {"time": 571, "text": "He took the view that certain numbers were conscious."}, {"time": 573, "text": "I thought that was a reductio ad absurdum, but he seemed to think it was perfectly a reasonable point of view."}, {"time": 578, "text": "Without the absurdum there."}, {"time": 581, "text": "Interesting, but the thing you mentioned about how is the intuition that a lot of the people, at least in the artificial intelligence world, had and have, I think."}, {"time": 591, "text": "They don't make it explicit, but that if you increase the power of computation, naturally consciousness will emerge."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Yes, I think that's what they think."}, {"time": 600, "text": "But basically that's because they can't think of anything else."}, {"time": 603, "text": "And so it's a reasonable thing."}, {"time": 605, "text": "I mean, you think, what does the brain do?"}, {"time": 606, "text": "Well, it does do a lot of computation."}, {"time": 609, "text": "I think most of what you actually call computation is done by the cerebellum."}, {"time": 613, "text": "I mean, this is one of the things that people don't much mention."}, {"time": 617, "text": "I mean, I come to this subject from the outside and certain things strike me, which you hardly ever hear mentioned."}, {"time": 624, "text": "I mean, you hear mentioned about the left right business."}, {"time": 628, "text": "They move your right arm, that's the left side of the brain and so on and all that sort of stuff."}, {"time": 634, "text": "And it's more than that."}, {"time": 636, "text": "If you have these plots of different parts of the brain, there are two of these things called the homunculi, which you see these pictures of a distorted human figure and showing different parts of the brain, controlling different parts of the body."}, {"time": 653, "text": "And it's not simply things like, okay, the right hand is controlled and both sensory and motor on the left side, left hand on the right side."}, {"time": 664, "text": "It's more than that."}, {"time": 665, "text": "Vision is the back basically, your feet at the top."}, {"time": 671, "text": "And it's as though it's about the worst organization you could imagine."}, {"time": 674, "text": "So it can't just be a mistake in nature."}, {"time": 679, "text": "And this is made more pronounced when you think of the cerebellum."}, {"time": 685, "text": "The cerebellum has, when I was first thinking about these things, I was told that it had half as many neurons or something like that, comparable."}, {"time": 693, "text": "And now they tell me it's got far more neurons than the cerebrum, and cerebrum is this sort of convoluted thing at the top people always talk about."}, {"time": 702, "text": "Cerebellum is this thing just looks a bit like a ball of wool right at the back underneath them."}, {"time": 707, "text": "It's got more neurons."}, {"time": 709, "text": "It's got more connections."}, {"time": 711, "text": "Computationally, it's got much more going on than this from the cerebrum."}, {"time": 718, "text": "But as far as we know, that's slightly controversial, the cerebellum is entirely unconscious."}, {"time": 724, "text": "So the actions, you have a pianist who plays an incredible piece of music and think of, and he moves his little finger into this little key to get it, hit it, just the right moment."}, {"time": 735, "text": "Does he or she consciously will that movement?"}, {"time": 743, "text": "Okay, the consciousness is coming in."}, {"time": 744, "text": "It's probably to do with the feeling of the piece of music that's being performed and that sort of thing, which is going on."}, {"time": 751, "text": "But the details of what's going on are controlled."}, {"time": 755, "text": "I would think almost entirely by the cerebellum."}, {"time": 758, "text": "That's where you have this precision and the really detailed."}, {"time": 764, "text": "Once you get, I mean, you think of a tennis player or something, does that tennis player think exactly which muscles should be moved in what direction and so on?"}, {"time": 772, "text": "No, of course not."}, {"time": 774, "text": "But he or she will maybe think, well, if the ball is angled in such a way in that corner, that will be tricky for the opponent."}, {"time": 782, "text": "And the details of that are all done largely with the cerebellum."}, {"time": 788, "text": "That's where all the precise motions, but it's unconscious."}, {"time": 793, "text": "So why is it interesting to you that so much computation is done in the cerebellum and yet it is unconscious?"}, {"time": 799, "text": "Because it doesn't, it's the view that somehow it's computation which is producing the consciousness."}, {"time": 807, "text": "And it's here you have an incredible amount of computation going on."}, {"time": 813, "text": "And as far as we know, it's completely unconscious."}, {"time": 816, "text": "So why, what's the difference?"}, {"time": 819, "text": "And I think it's an important thing."}, {"time": 821, "text": "What's the difference?"}, {"time": 823, "text": "Why is the cerebrum, all this very peculiar stuff that very hard to see on a computational perspective, like having the, everything have to cross over under the other side and do something which looks completely inefficient."}, {"time": 838, "text": "And you've got funny things like the frontal lobe and the, what do we call the lobes?"}, {"time": 844, "text": "And the place where they come together, you have the different parts, the control, you see one to do with motor and the other to do with sensory."}, {"time": 856, "text": "And they're sort of opposite each other rather than being connected by, it's not as though you've got electrical circuits."}, {"time": 863, "text": "There's something else going on there."}, {"time": 866, "text": "So it's just the idea that it's like a complicated computer just seems to me to be completely missing the point."}, {"time": 874, "text": "There must be a lot of computation going on, but the cerebellum seems to be much better at doing that than the cerebrum is."}, {"time": 882, "text": "So for sure, I think what explains it is like half hope and half we don't know what's going on."}, {"time": 889, "text": "And therefore from the computer science perspective, you hope that a Turing machine can be perfectly, can achieve general intelligence."}, {"time": 911, "text": "These people who developed the idea of what a computation is."}, {"time": 917, "text": "And there were different ideas of what a computation, developed differently."}, {"time": 920, "text": "I mean, Church's way of doing it, was very different from Turing's, but then they were shown to be equivalent."}, {"time": 926, "text": "And so the view emerged that what we mean by computation is a very clear concept."}, {"time": 934, "text": "And one of the wonderful things that Turing did was to show that you could have what we call the universal Turing machine."}, {"time": 943, "text": "It's you just have to have a certain finite device."}, {"time": 946, "text": "Okay, it has to have an unlimited storage space, which is accessible to it, but the actual computation, if you like, is performed by this one universal device."}, {"time": 955, "text": "And so the view comes away, well, you have this universal Turing machine, and maybe the brain is something like that, a universal Turing machine, and it's got maybe not unlimited storage, but a huge storage accessible to it."}, {"time": 972, "text": "And this model is one, which is what's used in ordinary computation."}, {"time": 977, "text": "It's a very powerful model."}, {"time": 979, "text": "And the universallness of computation is very useful."}, {"time": 984, "text": "You could have some problem and you may not see immediately how to put it onto a computer, but if it is something of that nature, then there are all sorts of subprograms and subroutines when all the, I mean, I learned a little bit of computing when I was a student, but not very much."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "But it was enough to get the general ideas."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "And there's something really pleasant about a formal system like that."}, {"time": 1009, "text": "Where you can start discussing about what's provable, what's not, these kinds of things."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And you've got a notion, which is an absolute notion, this notion of computability, and you can address when things are, mathematical problems are computably solvable and what chance."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "And it's a very beautiful area of mathematics, and it's a very powerful area of mathematics."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "And it underlies the whole sort of, I won't say, the principles of computing machines that we have today."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "Could you say, what is Gayle's Incompleteness Theorem?"}, {"time": 1042, "text": "And how does it, maybe also say, is it heartbreaking to you?"}, {"time": 1046, "text": "And how does it interfere with this notion of computation and consciousness?"}, {"time": 1053, "text": "Well, the ideas, basically ideas, which I formulated in my first year as a graduate student in Cambridge."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "I did my undergraduate work in mathematics in London, and I had a colleague, Ian Percival."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "We used to discuss things like computational and logical systems quite a lot."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "I'd heard about Gayle's theorem."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "I was a bit worried by the idea that it seemed to say there were things in mathematics that you could never prove."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "And so when I went to Cambridge as a graduate student, I went to various courses."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "You see, I was doing pure mathematics."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "I was doing algebraic geometry of a sort."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "A little bit different from what my supervisor and people, but it was algebraic geometry."}, {"time": 1097, "text": "And I was interested, I got particularly interested in three lecture courses that were nothing to do with what I was supposed to be doing."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "One was a course by Herman Bondy on Einstein's general theory of relativity, which was a beautiful course."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "He was an amazing lecturer, brought these things alive, absolutely."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "Another was a course on quantum mechanics given by a great physicist, Paul Dirac."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "Very beautiful course in a completely different way."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "It was, he was very kind of organized and never got excited about anything seemingly."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "But it was extremely well put together."}, {"time": 1140, "text": "And I found that amazing too."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "Third course that was nothing to do with what I should be doing was a course on mathematical logic."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "I got excited, as I say, my discussions with Ian Percival was incompleteness theorem already deeply within mathematical logic space."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "Were you introduced to it?"}, {"time": 1160, "text": "I was introduced to it in detail by the course, by Steen."}, {"time": 1165, "text": "And he, it was two things he described which were very fundamental to my understanding."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "One was Turing machines and the whole idea of computability and all that."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "So that was all very much part of the course."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "And it wasn't what I was afraid it was to tell you there were things in mathematics you couldn't prove."}, {"time": 1187, "text": "It was basically, and he phrased it in a way which often people didn't."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "And if you read Douglas Soft status book, he doesn't, you see."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "But Steen made it very clear."}, {"time": 1198, "text": "And also in a sort of public lecture that he gave to a mathematical, I think it may be the Adams Society, one of the mathematical undergraduate societies."}, {"time": 1207, "text": "And he made this point again very clearly."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "That if you've got a formal system of proof, so suppose what you mean by proof is something which you could check with a computer."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "So to say whether you've got it right or not, you've got a lot of steps."}, {"time": 1222, "text": "Have you carried this computational procedure?"}, {"time": 1225, "text": "Well, following the proof, steps of the proof correctly, that can be checked by an algorithm, by a computer."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "So that's the key thing."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "Now what you have to, now you see, is this any good?"}, {"time": 1244, "text": "If you've got an algorithmic system, which claims to say, yes, this is right, this you've proved it correctly, this is true."}, {"time": 1252, "text": "If you've proved it, if you made a mistake, it doesn't say it's true or false."}, {"time": 1255, "text": "But if you have, if you've done it right, then the conclusion you've come to is correct."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "Now you say, why do you believe it's correct?"}, {"time": 1263, "text": "Because you've looked at the rules and you said, well, okay, that one's all right."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "Yeah, that one's all right."}, {"time": 1267, "text": "What about that?"}, {"time": 1268, "text": "Oh, yeah, I see, I see why it's all right."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "Okay, you go through all the rules."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "You say, yes, following those rules, if it says, yes, it's true, it is true."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "So you've got to make sure that these rules are ones that you trust."}, {"time": 1281, "text": "If you follow the rules and it says it's a proof, is the result actually true?"}, {"time": 1287, "text": "And that your belief that it's true depends upon looking at the rules and understanding them."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "And it depends on your trust in the rules."}, {"time": 1319, "text": "Do you believe that the rules only give you truths?"}, {"time": 1322, "text": "If you believe the rules only give you truths, then you believe this other statement is also true."}, {"time": 1327, "text": "I found this absolutely mind blowing."}, {"time": 1329, "text": "When I saw this, it blew my mind."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "I thought, my God, you can see that this statement is true."}, {"time": 1337, "text": "It's as good as any proof, because it only depends on your belief in the reliability of the proof procedure, that's all it is, and understanding that the coding is done correctly."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "And it enables you to transcend that system."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "So whatever system you have, as long as you can understand what it's doing and why you believe it only gives you truths, then you can see beyond that system."}, {"time": 1364, "text": "Now, how do you see beyond it?"}, {"time": 1366, "text": "What is it that enables you to transcend that system?"}, {"time": 1371, "text": "Well, it's your understanding of what the system is actually saying and what the statement that you've constructed is actually saying."}, {"time": 1379, "text": "So it's this quality of understanding, whatever it is, which is not governed by rules."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "It's not a computational procedure."}, {"time": 1387, "text": "So this idea of understanding is not going to be within the rules of the, within the formal system."}, {"time": 1393, "text": "Yes, you're only using those rules anyway, because you have understood them to be rules which only give you truths."}, {"time": 1400, "text": "There'd be no point in it otherwise."}, {"time": 1402, "text": "I mean, people say, well, okay, this is, it's one set of rules as good as any other."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "Well, it's not true."}, {"time": 1408, "text": "You see, you have to understand what the rules mean."}, {"time": 1411, "text": "And why does that understanding of the mean give you something beyond the rules themselves?"}, {"time": 1416, "text": "And that's what it was."}, {"time": 1417, "text": "That's what blew my mind."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "It's somehow understanding why the rules give you truths enables you to transcend the rules."}, {"time": 1425, "text": "So that's where, I mean, even at that time, that's already where the thought entered your mind that the idea of understanding, or we can start calling it things like intelligence or even consciousness is outside the rules."}, {"time": 1440, "text": "See, I've always concentrated on understanding."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "You know, people say, people come and point out things."}, {"time": 1445, "text": "Well, you know, what about creativity?"}, {"time": 1447, "text": "That's something a machine can't do is create."}, {"time": 1449, "text": "What is creativity?"}, {"time": 1451, "text": "And I don't know."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "You know, somebody can put some funny things on a piece of paper and say that's creative and you could make a machine do that."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "Is it really creative?"}, {"time": 1458, "text": "You see, I worry about that one."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "I sort of agree with it in a sense, but it's so hard to do anything with that statement."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "But understanding, yes, you can."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "You can make, go see that understanding, whatever it is, and it's very hard to put your finger on it."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "That's absolutely true."}, {"time": 1475, "text": "Can you try to define or maybe dance around a definition of understanding?"}, {"time": 1481, "text": "To some degree, but I don't, I often wondered about this, but there is something there which is very slippery."}, {"time": 1488, "text": "It's something like standing back."}, {"time": 1492, "text": "And it's got to be something, you see, it's also got to be something which was of value to our remote ancestors."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "Because sometimes, there's a cartoon which I drew sometimes showing you how all these, there's in the foreground, you see this mathematician just doing some mathematical theorem."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "There's a little bit of a joke in that theorem, but let's not go into that."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "He's trying to prove some theorem."}, {"time": 1514, "text": "And he's about to be eaten by a saber tooth tiger who's hiding in the undergrowth, you see."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "See, I don't think consciousness is limited to humans."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "Yeah, that's the interesting question, at which point, if it is indeed connected to the evolutionary process, at which point did we pick up this?"}, {"time": 1571, "text": "A very hard question."}, {"time": 1573, "text": "It's certainly, I don't think it's primates, you know, you see these pictures of African hunting dogs and how they can plan amongst themselves how to catch the antelopes."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "Some of these David Attenborough films, I think this probably was one of them, and you could see the hunting dogs, and they divide themselves into two groups and they go in two routes, two different routes."}, {"time": 1596, "text": "One of them goes and they sort of hide next to the river."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "And the other group goes around and they start yelping at these, they don't bark, I guess whatever noise hunting dogs do, the antelopes, and they sort of round them up and they chase them in the direction of the river."}, {"time": 1614, "text": "And there are the other ones just waiting for them, just to get, because when they get to the river, it slows them down."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "And so they pounce on them."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "So they've obviously planned this all out somehow."}, {"time": 1625, "text": "I have no idea how."}, {"time": 1627, "text": "And there is some element of conscious planning, as far as I can see."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "I don't think it's just some kind of, so much of AI these days is done on what they call bottom up systems, is it?"}, {"time": 1641, "text": "Yeah, where you have neural networks and you give them a zillion different things to look at and then they sort of can choose one thing over another, just because it's seen so many examples and picks up on little signals, which one may not even be conscious of."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "And that doesn't feel like understanding."}, {"time": 1663, "text": "There's no understanding in that whatsoever."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "Well, you're being a little bit human centric, so."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "Well, I'm talking about, I'm not with the dogs, am I?"}, {"time": 1672, "text": "No, you're not."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "Sorry, not human centric, but I misspoke."}, {"time": 1676, "text": "Biology centric."}, {"time": 1679, "text": "Is it possible that consciousness would just look slightly different?"}, {"time": 1683, "text": "Well, I'm not saying it's biological, because we don't

lateral flow tests."}, {"time": 1865, "text": "And you take a swab, you swab the front of your nose, you dunk that swab into some buffer, and then you put a couple of drops of that buffer onto the

up into individual ones."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "And if there's any virus on that buffer, as it flows across, the antibodies grab that virus, and it creates a little reaction with some colloids in here that cause it to turn dark."}, {"time": 1924, "text": "Just like a pregnancy test, one line means negative, it means a control strip worked, and two lines mean positive."}, {"time": 1933, "text":

simple."}, {"time": 1941, "text": "It is the exact same technology as pregnancy tests."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "It's the technology, this particular one from Abbott, this has been used for other infectious diseases like malaria, and actually a number of these companies have made malaria tests that do the exact same thing."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "So they just coopted the same form factor

this Abbott one here is, there's the, in this case, instead of being put in a plastic sheath, it's just put in a cardboard thing and literally glued on."}, {"time": 1976, "text": "I mean, it looks like nothing, you know, it's just, it looks like a, like, I mean, it's just the simplest thing you could imagine."}, {"time": 1984, "text": "The exterior packaging looks very Apple like, it's nice."},

these, you turn around and you immediately test on a different test."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "You could either do it on the same, but for good measure, you want to use a separate test that is somewhat orthogonal, meaning that it shouldn't turn falsely positive for the same reason."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "This particular test here, this detect test because it is looking for the RNA and

recommendations that I've had, especially if people start using antigen tests before you get onto a plane or as what I call entrance screening, if somebody is positive, you don't immediately tell

negative, then the antigen test would be considered falsely positive."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "It does look like there's only a single line, so this is very exciting news."}, {"time": 2945, "text":

that."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "The odds are pretty good."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "The odds are very good."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "The packaging, very iPhone like."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "I'm digging the sexy packaging."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "I'm a sucker for good packaging, okay."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "So then there's this test here, which is, this is another, it's funny."},

the exact same way as this, essentially, but what you can see is it's got lights in it and a power button and stuff."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "This is called an allume test, which is fine, and it's a really nice test, to be honest, but it has to pair with an iPhone."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "And so it's good as a, I think that this is gonna become, there's a lot of use for this from a medical perspective, where you want good reporting."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "This can, because it pairs with an iPhone, it can immediately send the report to a department of health, whereas these paper strip tests, they're just paper."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "They don't report anything unless you wanna report it."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Okay, so I'm gonna just pick it apart."}, {"time": 3028,

any of these."}, {"time": 3065, "text": "But when you compare this thing with a battery and a circuit board and all this stuff, it's got its purpose, but it's not a public health tool."}, {"time":

was using a slightly different one, one of these, but that requires an instrument called the BD Veritor."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "And he got a false positive, or no, I shouldn't say, he didn't

two were positive."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "But what really happened once he shared his PCR results and they were very low positive."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "So really what was happening is, my guess is he found himself right at the edge of his positivity, of his infectiousness."}, {"time": 3219, "text": "And so the test worked how it was supposed to work."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "It probably had he used it two days earlier, it would have been screaming positive."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "He wouldn't have gotten discrepant results, but he found himself right at the edge by the time he used the test."}, {"time": 3232, "text": "So the PCR would always pick it up cause it's still, cause that will still stay positive then for weeks potentially."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "But the rapid antigen test was starting to falter, not in a bad way, but just he probably was really no longer particularly infectious."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "And so it was kind of when it gets to be a very low viral load, it becomes stochastic."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "It's fascinating this duality."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "So one you can think from an individual perspective, it's unclear when you take four and half are positive, half are negative, like what are you supposed to do?"}, {"time": 3265, "text": "But from a societal perspective, it seems like if just one of them is positive, just stay home for a couple of days, for a while."}, {"time": 3274, "text": "So when you're a CEO of a company, you're launching astronauts to space, you may not want to rely absolutely on

positive, then you make decisions based on that."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "And then that scales really nicely to an entire society of hundreds of millions of people."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "And

three days earlier when he was probably most infectious."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "But my guess is the fact that it was catching two out of the four, even when he was down at a CT value of really, really very, very low viral load on the PCR test suggests that it was doing its job."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "And you just wanna, and the nice thing is because these can be produced at such scale, getting one positive doesn't immediately have to mean 10 days of isolation."}, {"time": 3351, "text": "That's the CDC is more conservative stance to say, if you're positive on any tests, stay home for 10 days and isolate."}, {"time": 3359, "text": "But here, people would just have more tests."}, {"time": 3361, "text": "So the recommendation should be test daily."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "If you turn positive, test daily until you've been negative for 24, 48 hours and then go back to work."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "And the nice thing there is right now, people just aren't testing because

Elon thinks about this idea of rapid testing for everybody?"}, {"time": 3383, "text": "So I understood I need to look at that whole Twitter thread."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "So I understand his perhaps criticism of, he had like a conspiratorial tone from my vague look at it of like, what's going on here with these tests?"}, {"time": 3397, "text": "But what does he actually think about this very practical to me engineering solution of just deploying rapid tests to everybody?"}, {"time": 3405, "text": "It seems like that's a way to open up the economy in April."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "Well, to be honest, I've been trying to get in touch with him again."}, {"time": 3411, "text": "I think, take somebody like Elon Musk with the engineering prowess within his ranks, to easily, easily build these at the tens of millions a day."}, {"time": 3424, "text": "He could build the machines from scratch."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "A lot of the companies, they buy the machines from South

Elon Musk on it, take some of his best engineers and say, look, the US needs a solution in two weeks."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "Build these machines, figure it out."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "He'll do it, he could do it."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "This is a guy who is literally, he has started multiple entirely new industries."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "He has the capital to do it without the US government if he wanted to."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "And you know what, it would, the return on investment for him would be huge."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "But frankly, the return on investment in the country would be hundreds of billions of dollars, because it means we could get society open."}, {"time": 3475, "text": "So I know that his first experience with these rapid tests was confusing, which is how I ended up having this Twitter kind of conversation with him very briefly."}, {"time": 3486, "text": "But I think that if he understood sort of a little bit more, and I think he does, I really love to talk to him about it, because I think he could totally change the course of this pandemic in the United States, single handedly."}, {"time": 3498, "text": "He loves grand things."},

the engineering solution."}, {"time": 3515, "text": "So this is something I've been really trying to, I'm an engineer, my previous history was all engineering, and that's really how I think."}, {"time": 3524, "text": "I then went into medicine and PhD world, but I think that the world, like one of the major catastrophes, or one of the major problems, is that we have physicians making the decisions about public health and a pandemic, when really we need engineers."}, {"time": 3543, "text": "This is an engineering problem."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "And so what I've been trying to do, I actually really want to start a whole new field called public health engineering."}, {"time": 3552, "text": "And so I've been, eventually I want to try to bring it to MIT and get MIT to want to start a new department or something."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "That's a doubly awesome idea."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "That, this is really, okay."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "I love this, I love every aspect."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "I love everything you're talking about."}, {"time": 3569, "text": "A lot of people believe, because vaccines started being deployed currently, that we are no longer

the next, what is it, three, four months maybe?"}, {"time": 3602, "text": "The vaccine rollout isn't gonna be as peachy as everyone is hoping."}, {"time": 3607, "text": "And I hate to be the Debbie Downer here, but there's a lot of unknowns with this vaccine."}, {"time": 3613, "text": "You've already mentioned one, which is there's a lot of people who just don't want to get the vaccine."},

don't know how effective the vaccine is gonna be after two or three months."}, {"time": 3628, "text": "We've only measured it in the first two or three months, which is a massive problem, which we can go into biologically, because there's very good reasons to believe that the efficacy could fall way down after two or three months."}, {"time": 3642, "text": "We don't know if it's gonna stop transmission."}, {"time": 3644, "text": "And if it doesn't stop transmission, then there's, you know, herd immunity is much, much more difficult to get because that's all based on transmission blockade."}, {"time": 3654, "text": "And frankly, we don't know how easily we're going to be able to roll it out."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "Some of the vaccines need really significant cold chains, have very short half lives outside of that cold chain."}, {"time": 3665, "text": "We need to organize massive numbers of people to be able to distribute these."}, {"time": 3671, "text": "Most hospitals today are saying that they're not equipped to hire the right people to be even administering enough of these vaccines."}, {"time": 3679, "text": "And then a lot of the hospitals are frustrated because they're getting much lower, smaller allocations than they were expecting."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "So I think right now, like you say, right now is the best time, you know, besides three or four or five or six months ago, right now is the best time to get these rapid tests out."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "And we need to, I mean, the country has the capacity to build them."}, {"time": 3702, "text": "We have, we're shipping them overseas right now."}, {"time": 3705, "text": "We just need to flip a switch, get the FDA to recognize that there's more important things than diagnostic medicine, which is the effectiveness of the public health program when we're dealing with a pandemic."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "They need to authorize these as public health tools, or, you know, frankly, the president could, you know, there's a lot of other ways to get these tests to not have to go through the normal FDA authorization program, but maybe have the NIH and the CDC give a stamp of approval."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "And if we could, we could get these out tomorrow."}, {"time": 3739, "text": "And that's where that article came from, you know, how we can stop the spread of this virus by Christmas, we could, you know, now it's getting late."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "And so we have to keep updating that timeframe, maybe putting Christmas in the title wasn't, I should have said how we can stop the spread of this virus in a month."}, {"time": 3755, "text": "It would be a little bit more timeless, but we could do it, you know, we really could do it."},

at the FDA and other places just can't seem to get their head around the fact that this is a public health problem, not a bunch of medical problems."}, {"time": 3778, "text": "Is there a way to change that policy wise?"}, {"time": 3780, "text": "So this is a much bigger thing that you're speaking to, which I love in terms of the MIT engineering approach to public health."}, {"time": 3791, "text": "Is there a way to push this?"}, {"time": 3793, "text": "Is this a political thing?"}, {"time": 3794, "text": "Like where some Andrew Yang type characters need to like start screaming about it?"},

the ideas here?"}, {"time": 3814, "text": "I think it's a little of both."}, {"time": 3817, "text": "I think it's political on the one hand, and I've certainly been talking to Congress a lot, talking to senators."}, {"time": 3822, "text": "Are they receptive?"}, {"time": 3824, "text": "I mean, that's the crazy thing."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "Everyone but the FDA is receptive."}, {"time": 3827,

to senators, governors, and then all the way down to mayors of towns and things."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "And I mean, months ago I held a round table discussion with Mayor Garcetti, who's the mayor

public health solution."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "It's a myopic or very tunnel visioned approach to a virus that's spreading."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "This is a simple solution with essentially no downfall."}, {"time": 3920, "text": "There is nothing bad about this."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "It's just giving people a result."}, {"time": 3925, "text": "And it's bipartisan."}, {"time": 3927,

everyone recognizes that."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "So why do you think, like the mayor of LA, why do you think politicians are going for these, from my perspective, like kind of half ass lockdowns, which is not, so I have seen good evidence that like a complete lockdown can work, but that's in theory, it's just like communism in theory can work."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "Like theoretically speaking, but it just doesn't, at least in this country, we don't, I think it's just impossible to have complete lockdown."}, {"time": 3977, "text": "And still politicians are going for these kind of lockdowns that everybody hates, that's really hurting small businesses."}, {"time": 3988, "text": "Like why are they going for that?"}, {"time": 3989, "text": "And big businesses, and yeah, all businesses, but like basically not just hurting, they're destroying small businesses, right?"}, {"time": 3998, "text": "Which is going to have potentially, I mean, yeah, I've been reading as I don't shut up about the rise and fall of the Third Reich, and there's economic effects that take a decade to, there's going to be long lasting effects that may be destructive to the very fabric of this nation."}, {"time": 4022, "text": "So why are they doing it, and why are they not using the solution?"}, {"time": 4026, "text": "Is there any intuition?"}, {"time": 4027, "text": "I mean, you've said that FDA has a stranglehold, I guess, on this whole public health problem."}, {"time": 4034, "text": "Is that all it is?"}, {"time": 4036, "text": "That's honestly, it's pretty much all it is."},

course the federal government, including the president's own teams, and the heads of the NIH, the heads of the CDC about this."}, {"time": 4065, "text": "The problem is the tests don't exist in this country at the level that we need them to right now to make that kind of policy, to make that kind of program."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "They could, but they don't."}, {"time": 4079, "text": "And so what that means is that when Mayor Garcetti says, okay, what are my actual options today, despite these sounding like a great idea, he looks around and he says, well, they're not authorized."},

everyone is deferential, including the heads of all the other government agencies because that is their role."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "But what everyone is failing to see is that the FDA doesn't even have a mandate or a remit to evaluate these tests as public health tools."}, {"time": 4130, "text": "So they're just falling in this weird gray zone where the FDA is saying, look, we evaluate medical products."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "That's the only thing that I meant, like Tim Stenzel, head of in vitro diagnostics at the FDA, he's doing what his job is, which is to evaluate medical tools."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "Unfortunately, this is where I think the CDC has really blundered."}, {"time": 4153, "text": "They haven't made the right distinction to say, look, okay, the FDA is evaluating these for doctors to use and all that, but we're the CDC and we're the public health agency of this country and we recognize that these tools require a different authorization pathway and a different use, not prescription."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "There's a difference between medical devices and public health."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "And I guess FDA is not designed for this public health, especially in emergency situations."}, {"time": 4180, "text": "And they actually explicitly say that."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "I mean, when I go and talk to Tim, and he's a very reasonable guy, but when I talk to him, he says, look, we don't, we just do not evaluate a public health tool."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "If you're telling me this is a public health tool, great, go and use it."}, {"time": 4199, "text": "And so I say, okay, great, we'll go and use it."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "And then the comment is, but does it give a result back to somebody?"}, {"time": 4208, "text": "I say, well, yes, of course it gives a result back to somebody, it's being done in their home."}, {"time": 4213, "text": "So then it's defined as a medical tool, can't use it."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "So it's stuck in this gray zone where unfortunately, there's this weird definition that any tool, any test that gives a result back to an individual is defined by CMS, Centers for Medicaid Services, as a medical device requiring medical authorization."}, {"time": 4234, "text": "But then you go and ask, it gets crazier, because then you go and ask Seema Verma, the head of CMS, you know, okay, can these be authorized as public health tools and not fall under your definition of a medical device?"}, {"time": 4250, "text": "So then the FDA doesn't have to be the ones authorizing it as a public health tool."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "And Seema Verma says, oh, we don't have any jurisdiction over point of care and sort of rapid devices like this."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "We only have jurisdiction over lab devices."}, {"time": 4267, "text": "So it's like nobody has ownership over it, which means that they just keep, they stay in this purgatory of not being approved."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "And so this is where I think, frankly, it needs a president."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "It needs a presidential order to just unlock them, to say this is more important than having a prescription."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "And in fact, I mean, really what's happening now, because there is this sense that tests are public health tools, even if they're not being defined as such, the FDA now is pretty much, not only are they not authorizing these as public health tools, what they're doing by authorizing what are effectively public health tools as medical devices, they're just diluting down the practice of medicine."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "I mean, his answer right now, unfortunately is, well, I don't know why you want these to be sort of available to everyone without a prescription."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "We've already said that a doctor can write a whole prescription for a whole college campus."}, {"time": 4324, "text": "It's like, well, if you're going in that direction then, and that's no longer medicine, having a doctor write a prescription for a college campus, for everyone on the campus to have repeat testing, now we're just in the territory of eroding medicine and eroding all of the legal rules and reasons that we have prescriptions in the first place."}, {"time": 4343, "text": "So it's just everything about it is just destructive instead of just making a simple solution, which is these are okay as public health tools as long as they meet X and Y metrics, go and CDC can put their stamp of approval on them."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "What do you think, sorry if I'm stuck on this, your mention of MIT and public health engineering, right?"}, {"time": 4367, "text": "I mean, it has a sense of, I talked to computational biology folks."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "It's always exciting to see computer scientists start entering the space of biology."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "And there's actually a lot of exciting things that happen because of that, trying to understand the fundamentals of biology."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "So from the engineering approach to public health, what kind of problems do you think can be tackled?"}, {"time": 4389, "text": "What kind of disciplines are involved?"}, {"time": 4391, "text": "Like, do you have ideas in this space?"}, {"time": 4395, "text": "I mean, I can speak to one of the major activities that I wanna do."}, {"time": 4400, "text": "So what I normally do in my research lab is develop technologies that can take a drop of somebody's blood or some saliva and profile for hundreds of thousands of different antibodies against every single pathogen that somebody could be possibly exposed to."}, {"time": 4416, "text": "So this is all new technology that we've been developing more from a bioengineering perspective."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "But then I use a lot of the mathematics tools to A, interpret that."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "But what I really wanna do, for example, to kind of kick off this new field of what I consider public health engineering is to create, maybe it's a little ambitious, but create a weather system for viruses."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "I want us to be able to open up our iPhones, plug in our zip code and get a better sense, get a probability of why my kid has a runny nose today."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "Is it COVID?"}, {"time": 4453,

know that's not impossible now."}, {"time": 4474, "text": "Is it always perfect?"}, {"time": 4475, "text": "No, but does it offer, does it completely change the way that we go about our days?"},

have to have masks all the time."}, {"time": 4505, "text": "But if we know the rules of the game that these viruses play by, we can start preparing for those."}, {"time": 4510, "text": "And every year, we go into every flu season blindfolded with our hands tied behind our back, just saying, I hope this isn't a bad flu season this year."}, {"time": 4521, "text": "I don't, I mean, this is, we're in the 21st century."}, {"time": 4528, "text": "We have the tools at our disposal now to not have that attitude."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "This isn't like 1920s."}, {"time": 4535, "text": "You know,

example, we don't just use our umbrellas all day long, every single day, in case it might rain."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "We don't board up our homes every single day in case there's a hurricane."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "We wait, and if we know that there's one coming, then we act for a small period of time accordingly."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "And then we go back, and we've prepared ourselves in like these little bursts to not have it ruin our days."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "I can't tell you how exciting that vision of the future is."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "I think that's incredible."}, {"time": 4574, "text": "And it seems like it should be within our reach, the, just these like weather maps of viruses floating about the Earth, and it seems obvious."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "It's one of those things where right now, it seems like maybe impossible."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "And then looking back like 20 years from now, we'll wonder like why the hell this hasn't been done way earlier."}, {"time": 4599, "text": "Though one difference between weather, I don't know if you have interesting ideas in this space."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "The difference between weather and viruses is it includes, the collection of the data includes the human body, potentially."}, {"time": 4614, "text": "And that means that there is some, as with the contact tracing question,

there's this weird place where it's like obvious that if we do, if we collect a lot of data about human beings and maintain privacy and maintain all like basic respect for that data, just like honestly common sense respect for the data, that we can do a lot of amazing things for the world, like a weather map for viruses."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "Is there a way forward to gain trust of

"There's no reason not to have that."}, {"time": 4729, "text": "I've said, instead of saying, well, how do we possibly get enough people on board to send in samples all the time?"}, {"time": 4736, "text": "Well, just go to the source."}, {"time": 4737, "text": "So there's a company in Massachusetts that makes 80% of all the instruments that are used globally to collect plasma from plasma donors."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "So I went to this company, Hemenetics, and said, is there a way you have 80% of the global market on plasma donations?"}, {"time": 4758, "text": "Can we start getting plasma samples from healthy people that use your machines?"}, {"time": 4764, "text": "So that hooked me up with this company called Octopharma."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "And Octopharma has a huge reach and offices all over the country where they're just collecting people's plasma."}, {"time": 4772, "text": "They actually pay people for their plasma and then that gets distributed to

the type of thinking that I have in terms of like, how do you actually capture huge numbers of specimens?"}, {"time": 4817, "text": "You can't ask everyone to participate on sort of a, I mean, you maybe could if you have the right tools and you can offer individuals something in return like 23andMe does."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "That's a great way to get people to give specimens and they get results back."}, {"time": 4831, "text": "So with these technologies that I've been building along with some collaborators at Harvard, we can come up with tools that people might actually want."}, {"time": 4839, "text": "So I can offer you your immunological history."}, {"time": 4843, "text": "I can say, give me a drop of your blood on a filter paper, mail it in and I will be able to tell you

mind first and foremost."}, {"time": 4901, "text": "So privacy can be, you can keep these samples 100% anonymous."}, {"time": 4907, "text": "They are just, when I get them, they show up with nothing."}, {"time": 4909, "text": "They're literally just tubes."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "I know a date that they were collected and a zip code that they're collected from or even just sort of a

4937, "text": "But I've been recognizing that we can take somebody's immunological profile and we can make a biological fingerprint out of it."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "And it's actually stable

sufficient information in that immunological history to match the samples."}, {"time": 4996, "text": "Or from a privacy perspective, that's really exciting."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "Does that generally hold for humans?"}, {"time": 5000, "text": "So you're saying there's enough uniqueness to match?"}, {"time": 5003, "text": "Yeah, because it's very stochastic, even twins."}, {"time": 5005,

this pathogen."}, {"time": 5066, "text": "And you might form, if you get a coronavirus, for example, you might form hundreds of different antibodies, not just one antibody against the spike protein,

patterns."}, {"time": 5153, "text": "Exactly, we're doing a lot of that already."}, {"time": 5154, "text": "And that's how, how do we have this going?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "You know, I've been trying to get this funded for years now."}, {"time": 5160, "text": "And I've spoken to governments, you know, everyone says, cool idea, not gonna do it."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "You know, why do we need it?"}, {"time": 5168, "text": "The why do you need it?"}, {"time": 5168, "text": "Yeah, the why do you need it."}, {"time": 5170, "text": "And of course now, you know, I mean, I wrote in 2015 about this, why we would, why this would be useful."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "And of course, now we're seeing why it would be useful."}, {"time": 5181, "text": "Had we had this up and running in 2019, had we had it going, we were drawing blood from, you know, we're getting blood samples from hospitals and clinics and blood donors from New York City, let's just say, you know, that could have, we didn't run the first PCR test for coronavirus until probably a month and a half or two months after the virus started transmitting in New York City."}, {"time": 5206, "text": "So it's like with the rain, we didn't start wearing umbrella or taking out umbrellas."}, {"time": 5212, "text": "Exactly, for two months, but different than the rain, we couldn't actually see that it was spreading right now."}, {"time": 5218, "text": "And so Andrew Cuomo had no choice but to leave the city open."}, {"time": 5222, "text": "You know, there were hints that maybe the virus was spreading in New York City,

spread before it starts."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "And so they waited until the first PCR tests were coming about."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "And then the moment they started running PCR tests, they find out it's everywhere."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "You know, and so that was a disaster because of course New York City, you know, was just hit so bad because nobody was, you know, we were blind to it."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "We didn't have to be blind to it."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "And the nice thing about this technology is we wouldn't have, with the exact same technology we had in 2017, we could have detected this novel coronavirus spreading in New York City in 2020."}, {"time": 5276, "text": "Not because we changed, not because we are actually actively looking for this novel coronavirus, but because we would see, we would have seen patterns in people's immune responses using AI, or just frankly using our, just the raw data itself."}, {"time": 5290, "text": "We could have said, hey, it looks like there's something that looks like known coronavirus is spreading in New York, but there's gaps."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "You know, there's, for some reason, people aren't developing an immune response to this coronavirus that seems to be spreading to these normal things that, you know, and it just looks, the profile looks different."}, {"time": 5309, "text": "And we could have seen that and immediately, especially since we had an idea that there was a novel coronavirus circulating in the world, we could have very quickly and easily seen, hey, clearly we're seeing a spike of something that looks like a known coronavirus, but people are responding weirdly to it."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "Our AI algorithms would have picked it up, and just our basic, heck, you could have put it in an Excel spreadsheet, we would have seen it."}, {"time": 5336, "text": "Some basic visualization would have shown it."}, {"time": 5338, "text": "Exactly, we would have seen spikes, and they would have been kind of like off, you know, immune responses that the shape of them just looked a little bit different, but they would have been growing, and we would have seen it,

at scale, just super exciting, and then the kind of obvious at scale solution to the current virus and future ones is the rapid testing."}, {"time": 5370, "text": "Can we talk about the future of viruses that might be threatening our very existence?"}, {"time": 5379, "text": "So do you think like a future natural virus can have an order of magnitude greater effect on human civilization than anything we've ever seen?"}, {"time": 5392, "text": "So something that either kills all humans, or kills, I don't know, 60, 70% of humans."}, {"time": 5401, "text": "So something like something we can't even imagine."}, {"time": 5409, "text": "Because it seems to not have happened yet."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "So maybe like the entirety, whoever the programmer is of the simulation that sort of launched the evolution from the Big Bang seems to not want to destroy us humans."}, {"time": 5424, "text": "Or maybe that's the natural side effect of the evolutionary process that humans are useful."}, {"time": 5430, "text": "But do you think it's possible that the evolutionary process will produce a virus that will kill all humans?"}, {"time": 5435, "text": "I think it could."}, {"time": 5436, "text": "I don't think it's likely."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "And the reason I don't think it's likely is on the one hand, it hasn't happened yet, in part because mobility is a recent phenomena."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "People weren't particularly mobile until fairly recently."}, {"time": 5455, "text": "Now, of course, now that we have people flying back and forth across the globe all the time, the chances of global pandemics has escalated exponentially, of course."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "And so on the one hand, that's part of why it hasn't happened yet."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "We can look at things like Ebola."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "Now, Ebola, we haven't generally had major Ebola epidemics in the past, not because Ebola wasn't transmitting and infecting humans, but because it was largely affecting and infecting humans in disconnected communities."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "So you see out in rural parts of Africa, for example, in Western Africa, you might end up having isolated Ebola outbreaks, but there weren't connections that were fast enough that would allow people to then spread it into the cities."}, {"time": 5505, "text": "Of course, we saw back in 2014, 15 massive Ebola outbreak that wasn't because it was a new strain of Ebola, but it was because there's new inroads and connections between the communities and people got it to the city."}, {"time": 5524, "text": "And so we saw it start to spread."}, {"time": 5527, "text": "So that should be a little bit foreshadowing of what's to come."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "And now we have this pandemic."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "We had 2009, we have this."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "There is a benefit or there is sort of a natural check."}, {"time": 5543, "text": "And this is like kind of like a Voltaire predator prey dynamic kind of systems, ecological systems and mathematics that if you have something that's so deadly, people will respond more maybe with a greater panic, a greater sense of panic, which alone could, you know, destroy humanity."}, {"time": 5563, "text": "But at the same time, we now know that we can lock down."}, {"time": 5567, "text": "We know that that's possible."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "And so if this was a worse virus that was actually killing 60% of people as infecting, we would lock down very quickly."}, {"time": 5575, "text": "My biggest fear though, is let's say that was happening."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "You need serious lockdowns if you're gonna keep things going."}, {"time": 5583, "text": "So the only reason we were able to keep things going during our lockdowns is because it wasn't so bad that we were still able to have people work in the grocery stores."}, {"time": 5593, "text": "Still have people work in the shipping to get the food onto the shelves."}, {"time": 5596, "text": "So on the one hand, we could probably figure out how to stop the virus, but can we stop the virus without starving?"}, {"time": 5604, "text": "You know, and I'm not sure that that, if this was another acute respiratory virus that say had a slightly, say it transmitted the same way, but say it actually did worse damage to your heart, but it was like a month later that people started having heart attacks in mass."}, {"time": 5621, "text": "You know, it's like not just one offs, but really severe."}, {"time": 5625, "text": "Well, that could be a serious problem for humanity."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "So in some ways I think that there are lots of ways that we could end up dying at the hand of a virus."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "I mean, we're already seeing it."}, {"time": 5637, "text": "Just, I mean, my fear is still, I think coronaviruses have demonstrated a keen ability to destroy or to create outbreaks that can potentially be deadly to large numbers of people."}, {"time": 5650, "text": "Flu strains, though, are still by and large my concern."}, {"time": 5654, "text": "So you think the bad one might come from the flu, the influenza?"}, {"time": 5658, "text": "Yeah, their replication cycle, they're able to genetically recombine in a way that coronaviruses aren't."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "They have segmented genomes, which means that they can just swap out whole parts of their genomes, no problem, repackage them, and then boom, you have a whole antigenic shift, not a drift."}, {"time": 5675, "text": "What that means is that on any occasion, any day of the year, you can have, boom, a whole new virus that didn't exist yesterday."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "And now with farming and industrial livestock, we're seeing animals and humans come into contact much more."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "Just the opportunities for an influenza strain that is unique and deadly to humans increases."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "All the while, transmission and mobility has increased."}, {"time": 5706, "text": "It's just a matter of time, in my opinion."}, {"time": 5709, "text": "What about from immunology perspective of the idea of engineering a virus?"}, {"time": 5716, "text": "So not just the virus leaking from a lab or something, but actually being able to understand the protein, like everything about what makes a virus enough to be able to figure out ways to maybe target it or untarget it, attack biologics."}, {"time": 5736, "text": "Subverse immunity."}, {"time": 5739, "text": "Is that something, obviously that's somewhere on the list of concerns, but is that anywhere close of the top 10 highlights along with nuclear weapons and so on that we should be worried about?"}, {"time": 5753, "text": "Or is the natural pandemic really the one that's much greater concern?"}, {"time": 5758, "text": "I would say that the former, that manmade viruses and genetically engineered viruses should be right up there with the greatest concerns for humanity right now."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "We know that the tools, for better or worse, the tools for creating a virus are there."}, {"time": 5779, "text": "We can do it."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "And I mean, heck, the human species is no longer vaccinated against smallpox."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "I didn't get a smallpox vaccine."}, {"time": 5789, "text": "You didn't get a smallpox vaccine, at least I don't think."}, {"time": 5792, "text": "And so if somebody wanted to make smallpox and distribute it to the world in some way, it could be exceedingly deadly and detrimental to humans."}, {"time": 5806, "text": "And that's not even sort of using your imagination to create a new virus."}, {"time": 5812, "text": "That's one that we already have."}, {"time": 5814, "text": "Unlike the past when smallpox would circulate, you had large fractions of the community that was already immune to it."}, {"time": 5822, "text": "And so it wouldn't spread or it would spread a little bit slower."}, {"time": 5825, "text": "But now we have essentially in a few years, we'll have a whole global population that is susceptible."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "Let's look at measles."}, {"time": 5832, "text": "We have an entire, I mean, measles, I have, there are some researchers in the world right now, which for various reasons are working on creating a measles strain that evades immunity."}, {"time": 5846, "text": "It's not for bioterrorism, at least that's not the expectation."}, {"time": 5849, "text": "It's for using measles as an oncolytic virus to kill cancer."}, {"time": 5854, "text": "And the only way you can really do that is if your immune system doesn't, if you take a measles virus and there's, we don't have to go into the details of why it would work, but it could work."}, {"time": 5864, "text": "Measles likes to target potentially cancer cells."}, {"time": 5869, "text": "But to get your immune system not to kill off the virus if you're trying to use the virus to target it, you maybe want to make it blind to the immune system."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "But now imagine we took some virus like measles, which has an R naught of 18, transmits extremely quickly."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "And now we have essentially, let's say we had a whole human race that is susceptible to measles."}, {"time": 5890,

the dangers of gain of function testing, where in the lab we are intentionally creating viruses that are exceedingly deadly under the auspices of trying to learn about them."}, {"time": 5939, "text":

means."}, {"time": 5954, "text": "The concern though is, okay, that's one thing, but what if that virus got out on somebody's shoe?"}, {"time": 5960, "text": "Just what if?"}, {"time": 5964, "text":

a lot to do with viruses."}, {"time": 6009, "text": "It seems like being able to use machine learning to design proteins that achieve certain kinds of functions will naturally allow you to use maybe down the line, not yet, but allow you to use machine learning to design basically viruses, maybe like measles, like for good, which is like to attack cancer cells, but also for bad."}, {"time": 6037,

series of algorithms."}, {"time": 6063, "text": "And it does demonstrate, to me, it demonstrates just how powerful, everything in the world has rules."}, {"time": 6072, "text": "We just don't know the

then."}, {"time": 7233, "text": "But once you get past that stage, you start entering into like all these other, you go through the kind of, I went through this like pretty trippy stage, which is a

to learn it and you start to say, hey, I'm picking up this glass is actually 18 little movements."}, {"time": 7464, "text": "Then all of a sudden it becomes extremely exciting and exhilarating to just breathe."}, {"time": 7469, "text": "Breathing alone and the rise and fall of your abdomen or the way the air pushes in and out of your nose becomes almost interesting."}, {"time": 7477, "text": "And

are likely to lead to a certain outcome."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And so what you're suggesting is you want to discover systems whose decision tree, all the possible things that could happen, feel like there's choice being made, but ultimately one of the parties doesn't have any choice in what the actual final outcome is."}, {"time": 820, "text": "You're making them feel like they're playing a game too."}, {"time": 823, "text": "So it's not like you don't feel trapped."}, {"time": 826, "text": "It's kind of like."}, {"time": 827, "text": "Well, the best traps, you don't look very threatening."}, {"time": 830, "text": "So I'm like, oh, I'll walk over there."}, {"time": 832, "text": "I guess wouldn't that, I guess that's kind of an interesting thing."}, {"time": 836, "text": "If a lion, when does a lion roar?"}, {"time": 838, "text": "It's an interesting thing when you watch like lions hunting."}, {"time": 841, "text": "Don't roar when they hunt."}, {"time": 843, "text":

like water covered."}, {"time": 850, "text": "It's like furry water."}, {"time": 852, "text": "And I guess like when you keep that in mind, it's funny how, like for us a hobby actually, a brilliant guy, like one of my MMA coaches and the head coach at TriStar, he brought this up one time."}, {"time": 863, "text": "I thought it was a really salient point."}, {"time": 865, "text": "Said, let's say we have a million person bracket."}, {"time": 867, "text": "Impossibly huge."}, {"time": 868, "text": "Like Frank Dukes went in the Kumite level huge bracket."}, {"time": 871, "text": "He claimed to

880, "text": "But anyway, that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 881, "text": "But to come back a little improbable, pretty cool."}, {"time": 885, "text": "So let's say for instance, like there's no cheating going on, no cheating going on and we're flipping coins, right?"}, {"time": 891, "text": "Someone is gonna have an unbroken string of victory through that bracket, which is pretty insane."}, {"time": 897, "text": "How many consecutive like toss ups this person won."}, {"time": 901, "text": "And then at the end of it all, imagine like aliens show up and we go, hey, they wanna flip a coin for whether or not Earth, whether or not Earth gets to continue."}, {"time": 912, "text": "They'd be like, oh, I'll do it."}, {"time": 915, "text": "I'm good at this."}, {"time": 917, "text": "That would be tempting as a person to do."}, {"time": 919, "text": "You're like, I'm a lucky guy."}, {"time": 922, "text": "Maybe, I mean, maybe effectively you are."}, {"time": 923, "text": "We could argue that effectively you're incredibly lucky."}, {"time": 925, "text": "But basically is that an actual ability?"}, {"time": 927, "text": "Is that like a perk in a video game or is that just this thing that happened?"}, {"time": 930, "text": "So anyway, how many times are someone, you could go through an entire career, particularly in a fight sport."}, {"time": 937, "text": "Well, let's say you get 15 knockouts and 15 toss up scenarios."}, {"time": 941, "text": "Cause you see that happening all the time in the fight game, a toss up scenario."}, {"time": 943, "text": "It's not like you're mounted on me and that's not a toss up scenario."}, {"time": 947, "text": "Many, many, many, many, many striking scenarios."}, {"time": 949, "text": "A lot of grappling ones, but tons of striking scenarios are dead toss ups."}, {"time": 953, "text": "And somebody wins by knockout."}, {"time": 955, "text": "They win five times in a row."}, {"time": 956, "text": "Then they lose a couple of times in a row."},

"text": "And then they win five more and they go, ah, back on track."}, {"time": 963, "text": "Can you imagine that?"}, {"time": 964, "text": "You're flipping a coin."}, {"time": 965, "text": "I'm like heads, heads, heads, heads, tails."}, {"time": 967, "text": "Tails, tails, heads again."}, {"time": 969, "text": "Oh man, I'm back on it."}, {"time": 969, "text": "I'm flipping good now."}, {"time": 971, "text": "That's basically what's going on."}, {"time": 972, "text": "I think the vast majority of the time and then humanity's tendency to see a sign in almost anything, it starts to present itself."}, {"time": 980, "text": "And then we build a narrative in our mind to convince ourselves that we're in some sort of control."}, {"time": 985, "text": "When in reality, I was in a marginal situation at best the whole time."}, {"time": 990, "text": "Yeah, without having much control, without having a deep understanding of the system."}, {"time": 993, "text": "The same story is told in the stock market."}, {"time": 995, "text": "With many of these distributed human systems, we start telling narratives and start seeing patterns without understanding actually the system that's generating these patterns."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "So if we can see the system, that's incredibly valuable, but then you go, well, what system is above all of the systems?"}, {"time": 1009, "text":

world, about the site and talk to someone that doesn't have everyone who's got coronavirus now, so no one can taste or smell."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "They're like, this is delicious, like, is it?"}, {"time": 1037, "text": "So anyway, you know, again, what senses am I missing or what understanding am I missing that's preventing me from seeing the dots connect in the world all around me?"},

what I'm doing that I can't take a step back and realize, you know, that I'm in a forest, not just headbutting a tree."}, {"time": 1062, "text": "And I may be doing both, maybe both, two things should be true at once."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "But so I would say when it comes to strategy, trying to understand that, but then also you go, well, okay, well, how can, that sounds cool, but how can you actually do that?"}, {"time": 1074, "text": "And then I'd say, that's a really good question because if I imagine I say, man, I should fight like Steven Thompson, I should fight like Wonderboy, it's like, good idea, go do that."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "I'm like, not the guy."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "I would fight like Khabib Nurmagomedov if I could."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "You know, it seems to work."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "So anyway, you go, well, what if I could develop, what if I could take my time developing skills so that when these strategies become apparent, they are executable to you."}, {"time": 1099, "text": "You actually have the ability to like, in or to again, to be the person in the arena, to be the person required, whereas there's plenty of great ideas like dunking a basketball is a fantastic idea."}, {"time": 1109, "text": "Alas, for me, unless there's a small trampoline nearby, I'm not the guy."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "But that doesn't make it any less good of an idea."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "I just haven't developed the ability or I lack the ability."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "So anyway, I think a lot of times, at least when I watch people in fighting, I'll use an example."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "We're so concerned with trying to win early on rather than develop skills that I'm going like, well, what's the best way to fight with my current set of skills?"}, {"time": 1131, "text": "And usually the path forward is like the barbarian route, like you put on the one ring, take the damage you need to take to hit that guy."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "And that was something I realized very early on in my MMA career was like, I'm not that good at striking at that time, not a world class striker now, but I'm way better at striking than I'm given any credit for because it helps people sleep at night, I think."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "But I'm serious."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "But... Yeah, yeah, you're always introduced as like this master grappler."}, {"time": 1157, "text": "I'm like, that's nice of them to say that."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "Maybe I'm not that good at grappling."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "We haven't even seen that."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "But the funny thing is where I'm like, just because people almost go like, well, Lex, see, you're really good at this, but you gotta understand, we're equal, man."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "I'm good at this other thing."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "Maybe you're really good at what you do and I'm just mediocre at what I do."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "That's also possible."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "So there's plenty of people that define themselves as a striker that do that just because that's for lack of other options."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "It's not because they're really good striker."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "I'm a grappler."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "I was a grappler as a blue belt."}, {"time": 1181, "text": "So anyway, I guess to come back, if I'm constantly going, how can I win with what I've got right now?"}, {"time": 1187, "text": "I think oftentimes I never take the time to develop the skills that I wanna develop and I also never take the time to develop the strategies that I wanna develop."}, {"time": 1193, "text": "And that has actually been a one big blessing of fighting someone frequently, which has been really frustrating as a result of injuries and time away and some of those people being hesitant to get in the game."}, {"time": 1203, "text": "But it

actually dominating the world as a black belt?"}, {"time": 1384, "text": "Well, actually, it's funny, because I took a little bit of money that they're like, hey, we're paying you."}, {"time": 1388,

little bit of a time off."}, {"time": 1542, "text": "And then I did another fight against a tough guy named Magid Hamo."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "He was five and two at the time."}, {"time": 1547,

definitely am a lot, I like to think I'm pretty hard to hurt, although I try not to lean on that."}, {"time": 1577, "text": "And I played baseball for like 16 years, so I can hit things pretty hard."}, {"time": 1580, "text": "I just wasn't able to, I recognized pretty early on that I had no idea how to actually hit things hard without becoming hitable myself."}, {"time": 1588, "text": "So I think that's kind of the big thing is a lot of times, like we almost were mentioning before, if you try to go and get people too early, you can hit them if they're not that good, but you're going to get hit yourself."}, {"time": 1600, "text": "So you're making, you're basically making a wager."}, {"time": 1602, "text": "You're making a trade of your own life for the ability to hit them."},

you."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "It's like fighting a ghost that periodically shows up with a hammer and smokes you in the melon and then disappears into the ether again."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "So the way they approach the fighting game is thinking, how can I attack without being hit?"}, {"time": 1662, "text": "So every strategy, every idea you have about what you're going to do has to do with like that minimizing the returns."}, {"time": 1673, "text": "I mean, that's what all good fighting is done."}, {"time": 1674, "text": "All poor fighting, you know, throughout the course of history, most generals, whether they're, so I read, or, you know, they did battles by attrition."}, {"time": 1681, "text": "You know, it's like, yeah, man, I've got 150 guys."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "You've got 50."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "You're like, yeah, if 60 of my guys die killing your 50, like, that's great for me."}, {"time": 1688, "text": "But that's not so great for the 60 guys that died."},

everything."}, {"time": 1697, "text": "You know, if you've got to run across the beach in Normandy, so be it."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "But that better be, you should have, we make sure we thought this through and there's like, hey, there's no way we can like, you know, walk around the side, huh?"}, {"time": 1707, "text": "Because oftentimes there is, and I think a lot of times there's a lot of incentives in professional fighting too, for people to want to do that."}, {"time": 1714, "text": "And we come up with all sorts of, well, I'm trying to be exciting."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "Is that

heartbreaking."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And also like the beating that he absorbed in that fight changed him for the rest of his life."}, {"time": 1762, "text": "And also, you know, don't think he'd

that that's kind of what we're shooting for."}, {"time": 1782, "text": "And, you know, the lionization of absorbing damage and that not being a big deal, like you hear that all the time."}, {"time":

damage is a part of you."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "I mean, I guess that, don't get me wrong, that is an attribute that's nice to have if you need it."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "But there's plenty of people that actually have really porous defense that are just very, very difficult to hurt for whatever reason."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "That's a fascinating fighter's perspective on the thing."}, {"time": 1812, "text": "I mean, the story that is inspiring and I know it goes against the artistry of fighting is when you have taken the damage to still rise up and be able to defeat the opponent."}, {"time": 1829, "text": "So it's, but that's a flip side of a basically you failing to defend yourself properly, right?"}, {"time": 1839, "text": "But let's say for, I think it's a triumph, that's a triumph of humanity."}, {"time": 1842, "text": "That's a triumph, that's amazing."}, {"time": 1844, "text": "To witness such a thing is unbelievable."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "But you still go, this is, there is a cost here."}, {"time": 1850, "text": "It's like, I've been fortunate enough to spend some time working with the military and I've been like around and read Medal of Honor citations, they're unbelievable."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "Like you read the story and you're like, it'll floor you."}, {"time": 1860, "text": "But it's still a cost and you don't wanna be paying that cost a long time."}, {"time": 1863, "text": "And most of the time the cost was everything."}, {"time": 1866, "text": "And then sometimes you go, hey, yeah, the value here, it's worth everything."}, {"time": 1870, "text": "It's like, I defend your family, defend your country under certain circumstances."}, {"time": 1874, "text": "And if that point is extension of your family,

{"time": 1882, "text": "And like you said, it's still an amazing thing to see, but."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "But it's also amazing to see you not take damage as the Floyd Mayweather, it's the artistry of like not being hit."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "And I wonder if maybe that's why people don't resonate with Floyd as much, is obviously Muhammad Ali was such a time and place, a great man for so many different reasons."}, {"time": 1898, "text": "Although it was funny to remember like there were times when he wasn't very popular."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "We love him now because of time of context, time to move away from some of the nonsense he had to deal with."}, {"time": 1907, "text": "But we got to see him struggle."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "And also he had unbelievable sacrifice, both in and out of the ring, that we all got to witness."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "We've never really seen Floyd struggle like that."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "And granted, obviously Floyd isn't like a civil rights figure like Muhammad Ali was, it's different time, different place, and he's a different man."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "But basically, I wonder if part of the thing that made everyone think of Muhammad Ali as the greatest, in addition to, of course, the unbelievable things that he did out in the world and the stands that he made, we saw him struggle in the ring."}, {"time": 1937, "text": "It's almost, it's humanizing."}, {"time": 1939, "text": "You know, it's weird when people respect Khabib, but again, we saw GSP lose and GSP came back stronger."}, {"time": 1946, "text": "Khabib is amazing."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "But I wonder how people feel about him longterm."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "Not like they won't think of him as amazing and great."},

coupled with Ali had a way of being poetic about sort of the way he was in the ring, sort of being able to explain the artistry that he, I mean, there's like joking as being playful, but really he was able to describe the flow, like a butterfly sting like a bee."}, {"time": 1979, "text": "Like he was able to actually talk about his strategy without talking, without crossing that line into the Floyd Mayweather, when you're just talking about money and just talking shit."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "Actually Conor McGregor, when he's not talking shit, it's pretty good at like talking about the art of the martial, like the first mug guy."}, {"time": 1999, "text": "And I wish Khabib did the same."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "Actually from like the Setia brothers, there's a few, there's a culture of like being poetic about like being scholars and also bards or whatever, the poets of the game."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "And Khabib was more like just simple and he lets his actions speak, which is great too."}, {"time": 2024, "text": "It's a cool thing in its own way."}, {"time": 2026, "text": "But it's nice when you can tell stories and that's probably why Ali was the great."}, {"time": 2033, "text": "Catch me up to, you went to three fights, I think undefeated, BJ Penn, we talked about last time you defeated BJ Penn."}, {"time": 2042, "text": "That's an incredible accomplishment, but you fought a lot of really tough guys."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "When was your last fight?"}, {"time": 2052, "text": "And then catch me up with the injuries."}, {"time": 2054, "text": "A lot of people kept more and more and more were unwilling to fight you."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "Yeah, that's been, that was why I was out for two years following the Gray Maynard fight between the fighting Gray and BJ and the Gray Maynard fight was actually one I'm really proud of because Gray was very tough."}, {"time": 2071, "text": "He's very big, very strong, very experienced."}, {"time": 2073, "text":

what I had in December, 2016."}, {"time": 2083, "text": "And that, it really took a lot of discipline, a lot of focus, a lot of challenge, to stay the course, to do what I needed to do in that fight and to win in ultimately dominating fashion, just not in the dominating, obvious sense that you see when someone runs across and just does that to somebody, but that wasn't on the list for me at that time."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "So that was an interesting one, but the time away again was very frustrating."}, {"time": 2105, "text": "That was incredibly difficult."}, {"time": 2107, "text": "Before that fight?"}, {"time": 2108, "text": "After that fight, well, because I beat Artem Lobov in the final of the Ultimate Fighter and Artem is another guy that's tough, a lot of experience and he's a funny guy and he said some things on the internet, so he gets a lot of heat for that."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "But he just knocked out three of my teammates."}, {"time": 2124, "text": "I'm like, he put a couple of people in a pretty rough shape at the end of that."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "So he was doing well and that was a tough fight."}, {"time": 2129, "text": "Again, if I got to go back and fight that fight now, it would be not competitive at all."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "I mean, it wasn't competitive at that time, but it was a compelling phase."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "It wasn't close, but it was competitive."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "So you were improving and growing fast."}, {"time": 2140, "text": "Yeah, and it was nice to have time away."}, {"time": 2142, "text": "I wish I'd had more time in the ring, but again, I'd only been doing MMA for three years at that time."}, {"time": 2146, "text": "So the improvement from doing what, the Bitcoin mining was overriding

me navigate the conversation to a positive conclusion?"}, {"time": 2822, "text": "And I think about that for, let's say, fighting, it's a good example, like confidence, plenty of people believe plenty of things that aren't real, myself included, I'm sure, all the time."}, {"time": 2832, "text": "And anyway, believing that you can do something, I'm like, hey, I think I can win, doesn't guarantee you

positive, what's the happy ending here?"}, {"time": 2880, "text": "And if they go, well, there is no happy ending, I'm like, okay, so now what?"}, {"time": 2884, "text": "So what do we do here?"},

anyone responsible for anything if free will isn't real?"}, {"time": 2911, "text": "Well, no, that's exactly the point."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "But at the surface level, what you're saying is true, but perhaps if we truly internalize that free will is an illusion, we'll start to figure out something that transforms the way we see society."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "For example, we are very individual centric, so believing that free will is real puts a lot of responsibility and blame on people when they do something bad."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "Maybe if we truly internalize that free will is an illusion, we start to think about the system of humans together as this mechanism for progress, as opposed to where individual people are responsible for their actions, good or bad."},

right?"}, {"time": 2986, "text": "And it's hard to say whether that would be better or worse, but I guess I'll use this as a convenient one for me."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "So I remember the last

people live in the world that they wanna believe in."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "Well, if free will doesn't exist, and it's just about how things move forward, when are we gonna be high fiving this guy

up, or I brought up, there's literally a giant book about Hitler."}, {"time": 3025, "text": "So I've been obsessed with Hitler, World War II, and Stalin recently."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "For

positive?"}, {"time": 3040, "text": "Like cat in the hat or something, I don't know."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "But you brought up Hitler as an example of something particular, some philosophical discussions we're having."}, {"time": 3048, "text": "And the excellent, eloquent, and the full of integrity MMA journalist clipped out something you've said about Hitler and said that, I forget what the headlines are, but they were the most ridiculous possible implementation."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "Basically, it was intentionally misunderstanding what I'm saying."}, {"time": 3073, "text":

3080, "text": "Yeah, exactly, I can't give you a pass on that."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "But basically, intentionally misunderstanding what's going on."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "But what I find funny is that, hey, we gotta be careful what we believe."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "And again, back to the cancel culture thing that we discussed last time as well, where would I like to apologize?"}, {"time": 3097, "text": "I mean, no, actually something about cancel culture that we've been seeing things culturally, I'm like, I will be damned if I apologize for anything that I don't need to apologize for because I was intentionally misunderstood in that instance."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "Now, you could say that I'm not a historical scholar, which I would agree immediately."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "And also that I oftentimes in eloquently or inarticulately phrase things, which I'll agree is again."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "But ultimately, going, hey, I wanna make you believe, live in the world that you're suggesting ought to exist."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "Okay, so if there's no free will, how far of a step back are we willing to take cosmically before we start going, hey, this is good because we're experiencing a social reckoning in our country at the moment, for good and for other probably, I guess."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "And basically, but hey, it all worked out, right?"}, {"time": 3147, "text": "So that's probably not something that would fly."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "And I think that's a fair thing."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "It might not fly from the individual perspective, but if you zoom out and think, appreciate society as just like an ant colony as a beautifully complex system, like we kinda, from the individual perspective, we value progress, especially progress of the individual, but in whole progress of societies."}, {"time": 3174, "text": "But if you accept that this is just a complex system that's not necessarily headed anywhere, that this is almost like that river is just flowing, I think that removes the burden of always striving, of always trying, of always like the struggle and so on."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "So it's possible

lives matter and so on."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "Maybe if we convince ourselves that we're just sort of like little things in a stream and ultimately none of it matters, there might be some kind of

important point."}, {"time": 3236, "text": "I guess almost anything like capitalism, I only get to experience it as I sit here now and I get to live, I was raised in the United States, have traveled

hours."}, {"time": 5075, "text": "There's no way around that."}, {"time": 5077, "text": "But what did you put in those hours?"}, {"time": 5078, "text": "So when you say drilling, can you break that

acting in the other person's self interest."}, {"time": 5303, "text": "And I guess a lot of times I can't, this kind of goes beyond what we can demonstrate here."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "But I would just say trying to understand what my base operating assumptions are and consistently reevaluate them, which can be fricking exhausting, frankly, and also constantly confidence destroying."}, {"time":

me to win?"}, {"time": 5374, "text": "And now I did happen to win that with the 50, 50 heel hook, which was 50, 50, but basically, which was one of the early examples of like, hey guys, by the way, people can try to hurt your legs."}, {"time": 5385, "text": "And that was something like, we mentioned John Danaher, mentioned like, you know, myself, Dean Lister, a lot of the guys from the Henzo

what to do, I try to polish what I've got."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "So if I've got a knife and I'm like, I don't know how to use them, I'm like, okay, I'm just gonna sharpen the edge and polish it

all trained with people that make us think about beating the ever loving crap."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "I never wanted to be that guy."}, {"time": 5475, "text": "And I was basically saying like, if

I'm incentivized to be a nice guy, even if I'm internally a scumbag, which I like to think that I'm not, but basically going like, hey, this guy's way more likely to help me or this person's way more likely to help me if I shake their hand, say thank you, I really appreciate you helping me out."}, {"time": 5504, "text": "And that thing that they tap me with four or five times, I'm gonna ask them about it."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "And then they don't have to tell me, they're under no obligation, but I'll say, and whether they tell me or don't tell me, thank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it."}, {"time": 5514, "text": "And that's it, you know?"}, {"time": 5517, "text": "Okay, so to summarize, the way you brilliantly described, I just wanna make sure we're keeping

which is difficult, I wonder if we can break it apart a little bit, is don't trust authority, essentially."}, {"time": 5533, "text": "Keep asking why."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "Be respectful without trusting authority, right?"}, {"time": 5536, "text": "Right, which is, and then the second thing is be the kind of person that others like training with or like being around, sort of being a good friend."}, {"time": 5547, "text": "So so many people just enjoy being around."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "So one is completely, which is, yeah, you're right, it's attention, which is like completely disrespect the way that things are done."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "So asking why constantly."}, {"time": 5560, "text": "One of it is your own flaws and not understanding the fundamentals of what's being described."}, {"time": 5564, "text": "And then once you get good enough, not understanding, like going against the fact that the instructor doesn't understand."}, {"time": 5573, "text": "And my inability to understand what you're saying, though, doesn't invalidate it."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "And that's something like you mentioned, like me mentioning, keeping in mind our own flaws."},

5587, "text": "I don't, you know, I like to sit in the corner."}, {"time": 5589, "text": "But so everyone's a little bit different."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "Some people, you know, I wasn't terribly popular in high school."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "You know, like, I didn't like high school very much."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "But anyway, I would, not gonna be rude to people, though."}, {"time":

where I'm like, oh man, how do I become great at jiu jitsu?"}, {"time": 5617, "text": "It's like, well, I'll start by not pissing off this person who can beat the crap out of me and not disrespecting the person who is probably the closest thing to a font of knowledge at that time for me."}, {"time": 5628, "text": "So, and then recognizing that I should do that for its own virtue because it's the right thing to do and I should try to treat people decently."}, {"time": 5635, "text": "But beyond that, even selfishly, it's in my interest to do that."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "But see, the thing is, this is interesting, is there's a culture in martial arts, a culture that I like where the instructor, legitimately so, carries an aura of authority."}, {"time": 5653, "text": "And it's not comfortable to really ask why."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "I'm not, it's a skill to be able to have a discussion as a white belt or the black belt instructor of like, why is it done this way?"}, {"time": 5669, "text": "Like, and saying why again."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "Like, I mean, it's a skill to show that you're actually a legitimately curious and passionate and compassionate student

because like, it's the drilling thing."}, {"time": 5692, "text": "And, you know, I, for example, like in my, when I was coming out, there was so much emphasis placed on like, close guard, for example."}, {"time": 5703, "text": "And you might actually teach me now, I don't know, but to me it was like, why do I need to master the close guard?"}, {"time": 5712, "text": "Like, why is the close guard on top or the bottom?"}, {"time": 5716, "text": "But the bottom really, the fundamental basics of jiu jitsu."}, {"time": 5720, "text": "Who decided that?"}, {"time": 5721, "text": "My body is not, my body says this is wrong."}, {"time": 5725, "text": "I'm like, this, like I have short legs, but it doesn't even matter the length of the legs."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "There's something about me that just, I don't understand how leverage here works for my particular body."}, {"time": 5737, "text": "Like, so it's just, it's a feel thing too."}, {"time": 5740, "text": "Like, it feels like in my basic understanding of leverage and movement and timing and so on, it feels like these certain, like butterfly guard, or even like half, basically every guard except close guard."},

times."}, {"time": 6518, "text": "So you were trying to replicate what Marcelo was saying as opposed to understanding the fundamentals from which it was coming."}, {"time": 6526, "text": "Right, I couldn't see, I couldn't see where it was coming from."}, {"time": 6528, "text": "And also, sometimes I'm like, well, why can't you explain it in the way that I would want you to explain it?"},

self discovery, but all performance is self expression."}, {"time": 6592, "text": "And I always thought that Marcelo was a brilliant master of letting what's inside out."}, {"time": 6596, "text": "He was so consistent in his performances."}, {"time": 6599, "text": "And a lot of times I felt like there was a block there personally, particularly at the end of Jiu Jitsu when I was very, very results

ended up being like 18 hours long and I was like, oh my God, we gotta chop it in half."}, {"time": 6734, "text": "And when it comes together, the whole thing, I think I hope people will like it."}, {"time": 6737, "text": "Yeah, well it's even part one is really good."}, {"time": 6740, "text": "Yeah, people on Reddit were really excited for part two as well."}, {"time": 6744, "text": "And you also have a back."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "Oh, the old one."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "The old one that I, that was really helpful to me to understand some very basic aspects of control for the back."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "Yeah, that was, you know, that clicked with me."}, {"time": 6757, "text": "There's very few instructionals."}, {"time": 6759, "text": "There's very few things I've watched that ever clicked with me and that was definitely it."}, {"time": 6765, "text": "It taught me one thing, I don't know, it's you drop a lot of sort of bombs, you drop a lot of really interesting details and it's funny that there's only specific things that really click."}, {"time": 6780, "text": "Like a lot of it rings true and you kind of take it in and it's like, oh, that's interesting, okay, yeah, but there's certain things that really click."}, {"time": 6787, "text": "And I remember when that first instruction will click with me is like the importance."}, {"time": 6794, "text": "I don't remember any more like how you communicated it because I've now integrated, it's now mine, you know what I mean?"}, {"time": 6801, "text": "But it was more about you just describing upper body control and the importance of the upper body control from the back."}, {"time": 6809, "text": "And just like the, there's certain grip, like you did describe different details on the grips and so on and as I started trying it, I realized how important upper body control is versus like me maybe as a blue belt or something was I thought like you have achieved victory when you got the two hooks in."}, {"time": 6831, "text": "And then I realized like at least for me that the hooks were not even for my body type, for my style, for the way I approach things, they were not even important at all."}, {"time": 6841, "text": "It's supplemental for the most part, yeah."}, {"time": 6842, "text": "So they were there for the points but I can establish a huge amount of control."}, {"time": 6848, "text": "In fact, the hooks were, you were talking about like illusion of choice, it almost made people panic a lot more when you were like fighting for it or establishing that kind of control."}, {"time": 6860, "text": "They were a lot less panicked when the hooks weren't involved even though they should be a lot more panicked."}, {"time": 6865, "text": "Anyway, I realized a lot of those kinds of things, especially that had to do with judo because so much of judo on the ground is centered around aggressive, efficient, very fast choking, like different kinds of clock chokes and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 6881, "text": "What a brilliant thing that is only gonna start to make its way into jiu jitsu coming up but like the judo style approach to like clock choking, triangling from the top of the turtle and stuff, so powerful."}, {"time": 6890, "text": "Yeah, and there's something about judo that emphasizes obviously due to the rules, the urgency."}, {"time": 6897, "text": "So you only do techniques that go fast."}, {"time": 6900, "text": "And then the other thing is, which I guess jiu jitsu emphasizes too but judo really does, which is the transition."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "So like while the person's flying in the air is the easiest time."}, {"time": 6914, "text": "I mean, this is like Ryan Hall type of shit, which is like, why not put in your submissions or positional control while they're in the air?"}, {"time": 6923, "text": "If you could, why would you not, right?"}, {"time": 6926, "text": "It's like, oh, well, I don't throw well."}, {"time": 6927, "text": "We'll learn how to throw and then do it."}, {"time": 6929, "text": "And so you should think, I mean, in the transition, when they're flying is the easiest time to put in stuff."}, {"time": 6935, "text": "And that's when you think about chokes, as you're throwing, you should be thinking about the choke and then everything becomes a lot easier."}, {"time": 6942, "text": "You ever see Flabio Canto?"}, {"time": 6946, "text": "Man, Brazilian judoka is just so cool."}, {"time": 6948, "text": "Like with stuff like that."}, {"time": 6949, "text": "Yeah, exactly, but that has to do with the first starting principle of like, stop thinking this as a two phase game of standing and then ground."}, {"time": 6960, "text": "Start thinking about like the standing and the, the standing comes before and the ground comes after, but everything happens in a transition."}, {"time": 6967, "text": "Well, unless you're attacking, what is the art of war?"}, {"time": 6969, "text": "Like, we all like, everyone's like, oh yeah, the art of war, oh yes, yes, yes."}, {"time": 6972, "text": "And then they immediately throw it away and then fight like a fricking barbarian."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "But, I mean like, I'm serious, but how many people quote stuff and then like, it's like the, what is it, the family guy joke where they're like, quoting Jesus and Jesus walks in, he's like, you're not listening to my work, what are you talking about?"}, {"time": 6987, "text": "And anyway, basically, like the art of war, one of the things that's like the only thing that you can be sure of being successful in attacking is something that's undefended."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "We're like, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "But you know, in a fight though, they're defended."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "Well, are they?"}, {"time": 7004, "text": "There's moments all the time where I'm borderline defenseless."}, {"time": 7007, "text": "And if you were to attack at that moment, if you could see it and then seize the moment, if you were capable of both, you should not only expect to be successful, you should be damn sure you're gonna be successful."},

that's the trick of almost all like conflict, right?"}, {"time": 7025, "text": "It's like showing up when the other person's taking a nap."}, {"time": 7029, "text": "And then it's so funny, like we take like a protracted war."}, {"time": 7031, "text": "It's like, oh, it takes five years."}, {"time": 7033, "text": "And there's lulls and there's a battle this month, but then there's a couple of weeks, another battle."}, {"time": 7037, "text": "It's like, well, if you just shrink that down, it's the microcosm, macrocosm idea."}, {"time": 7040, "text": "That same thing, that whole war is taking place in five minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes."}, {"time": 7044, "text": "And there's moments of lulls of person effectively going for a snack, being like in a horror movie, like, hey guys, I'm gonna go get a beer from around the way."}, {"time": 7053, "text": "Like I'm dead for sure."}, {"time": 7055, "text": "Is there, on this particular instructional, if you can convert it to words, you talk about finishing the submission."}, {"time": 7063, "text": "Is there some interesting insights that you find beautiful or profound about finishing the rear neck and choke or just finishing the submissions for the back control?"}, {"time": 7074, "text": "Is there something like, you know, you talk about the squeeze and the crush and all these kinds of principles."}, {"time": 7081, "text":

examples."}, {"time": 7111, "text": "Like first off, I saw someone finishing a 50, 50 heel hook in the UFC one promo."}, {"time": 7116, "text": "It was like some chubby dude in karate, like inside heel hook and another dude."}, {"time": 7123, "text": "Well, I didn't know they were doing that back then at least."}, {"time": 7125, "text": "And whether they were doing it all, how many times did someone do something and then that works?"}, {"time": 7130, "text": "And then we go, okay, cool."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "Versus, hey, maybe we should do that all the time."}, {"time": 7133, "text": "So anyway, how long were we all taught to do the seatbelt the way we all do the seatbelt in jiu jitsu?"}, {"time": 7138, "text": "Like long time, why?"}, {"time": 7139, "text": "Works."}, {"time": 7140, "text": "In fact, it works so well."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "And it was so, it was then the people who used it were so prolific that we went, well, solve that one."}, {"time": 7148, "text":

would say almost all of these things, all the tactics and all the strategies."}, {"time": 7186, "text": "So I guess that was something that we came to like training in the gym like a year ago, maybe,

the consequences?"}, {"time": 7214, "text": "What's the fallout of all this, right?"}, {"time": 7216, "text": "So what if we start with jujitsu, the idea of the guard, right?"}, {"time": 7220, "text":

what is the guard?"}, {"time": 7227, "text": "A guard's a defensive idea where you're kind of on your back to some extent or another, and you're using your legs as a wall between you and the other

a, I guess, widely accepted way of holding your arm."}, {"time": 7362, "text": "Like best practices on those kinds of things."}, {"time": 7362, "text": "Best practices, yeah, and it's worked so well."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "So it's a one arm over, one arm under, and there's a certain side you're supposed to be on when you're on the back."}, {"time": 7373, "text": "Everyone teaches,

the innovation that I see is not innovation."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "It's like basically changing the color of a car or polishing like the window a little bit, where you're like, hey, you made it,

issue, like, yeah."}, {"time": 9328, "text": "I feel like everything else is already an issue."}, {"time": 9330, "text": "It's already an issue, yeah."}, {"time": 9331, "text": "Because the tie to me,

invent a few interesting ways to use it as leverage, as control and so on, but there's just so many more things around the gi belt that are better."}, {"time": 9386, "text": "And so for me, the tie, what people don't realize."}, {"time": 9389, "text": "Are we trying to sell a DVD here and have some widgets and bells and whistles?"}, {"time": 9392, "text": "Because in that case, the belt is really

what happens."}, {"time": 9457, "text": "No, like to the death, what is their clothing that's useful, you know?"}, {"time": 9463, "text": "From my perspective."}, {"time": 9464, "text": "You mean like for your use or their use?"}, {"time": 9466, "text": "Both, my use, their use."}, {"time": 9468, "text": "No, like I like how you wanted to take the belt off and use the buckle to hit them with."},

was figuring was when they started to see me take my pants off in the fight, they were like, what?"}, {"time": 9484, "text": "They're gonna pause and rethink the situation for a second?"}, {"time": 9488, "text": "And I'm making dead eye contact, obviously, this is going on."}, {"time": 9490, "text": "Yeah, exactly, nodding."}, {"time": 9492, "text": "And then, you know, by the time they realized you took a belt off until you could whip them with it, you actually, you're already one, possibly two steps ahead."}, {"time": 9498, "text": "Okay, so fine, let's not talk about your own clothing, let's talk about their clothing."}, {"time": 9502, "text": "Okay, I'll take off their belt and hit them with it."}, {"time": 9503, "text": "No, but that's much harder to do."}, {"time": 9505, "text": "No question, but if you can do it."}, {"time": 9506, "text": "Oh, I'm maintaining, I can, no, I just said."}, {"time": 9509, "text": "Like, how did it come to this?"}, {"time": 9511, "text": "There's, but the point is there's alternatives that are perhaps more effective."}, {"time": 9517, "text": "In my perspective, this might be clueless, there's almost no clothing that's more effective than almost assuming the situation is no geek grappling."}, {"time": 9526, "text": "Like, I feel like clothing."}, {"time": 9529, "text": "Particularly when you start to add hitting, like every single time I start grabbing your clothes, if you start hitting and it's not like nothing could work, but most of the time you're like, why am I not using my arms for something better than what I'm doing them right now?"}, {"time": 9541, "text": "It's very difficult for me to, I don't know, in terms of just distance, I can't imagine a case of different distances, even like situations where, let's not talk about like, like a situation where you haven't both yet agreed that a fight is happening."}, {"time": 9558, "text": "Solid clothing is nice if they have it on then."}, {"time": 9561, "text": "Solid clothing?"}, {"time": 9562, "text": "Oh yeah, like something like a good jacket because you can snatch somebody on their face."}, {"time": 9565, "text": "Snatch down."}, {"time": 9566, "text": "Yeah, you know, it's like, if you, if you took my, like, you know, like you snap down and judo, like how easy it is to snap down a beginner."}, {"time": 9574, "text": "Actually a tie in that sense might be a really effective way to snap down."}, {"time": 9577, "text": "So like the snap down is really powerful to change the like disorient the situation and give you a lot of different opportunities for, you know, taking their back, taking them down."}, {"time": 9589, "text": "Doing hilarious stuff, like snapping them down with a tie into your knee."}, {"time": 9592, "text": "And then when they come back up doing this, you're already."}, {"time": 9595, "text": "So yeah, in that sense, I agree, but not as a choking mechanism because the concern Joe had is choke."}, {"time": 9600, "text": "I think you would probably choke me with your tie more easily than I could choke you with your tie."}, {"time": 9605, "text": "Cause like, if you get, you can get, like you get my back and you can put it around somebody's neck, you know, like, like, like, you ever see a diehard?"}, {"time": 9612, "text": "Yeah, you remember when the super Swedish looking blonde dude or whatever was, it was trying to choke Bruce Willis with the, with the chain and then he ended up getting choked himself with the chain if I recall this properly."}, {"time": 9622, "text": "But anyway, yeah, like, like that."}, {"time": 9623, "text": "But I don't, I don't feel like, I feel like if I start grabbing your tie, you have too many other great options."}, {"time": 9629, "text": "I mean, I do like the snap down that you actually made me realize."}, {"time": 9632, "text": "No, I think you have a good there."}, {"time": 9634, "text": "I think you're on the right path with it."}, {"time": 9635, "text": "With a snap down?"}, {"time": 9636, "text": "Yeah, particularly if you start with like one of these, like, you know, like, like you, like you poke your finger in my chest and then snap down real quick."}, {"time": 9643, "text": "And also, socially speaking, it's not a threatening thing to, you know, to reach for the tie."}, {"time": 9649, "text": "It's not particularly like a business setting."}, {"time": 9651, "text": "They'll never see it coming."}, {"time": 9653, "text": "Cause I was thinking choke, but it's not, it's a really good leverage point cause like grabbing a jacket, the jacket will slide if you try to snap down."}, {"time": 9660, "text": "You really have to get a hole, like a really good hold."}, {"time": 9664, "text": "Cause it's around the back of the neck."},

heuristics, just a basic kind of generalizations and apply your own expertise as an expert of, in this case, grappling, to see how that can be coded as a rule."}, {"time": 9229, "text": "Now, the other approach, Elon Musk and Tesla are taking this approach, which is called machine learning, which is create a basic framework of the kind of things you should be observing and what are the

anything that involves human movement, like grappling."}, {"time": 9328, "text": "So that's, my sense is, if we first look at the hard encoding, if you were to try to describe Gordon Ryan to a machine, how many rules are in there, do you think?"}, {"time": 9341, "text": "Yeah, first off, let me tell you, that's one of the most fascinating questions I've ever been asked."}, {"time": 9346,

around this is by the use of heuristics."}, {"time": 9586, "text": "These are rules of thumb, which give general guidelines to action."}, {"time": 9591, "text": "So for example, in jiu jitsu, I could

things they study is human supervision over automation."}, {"time": 1316, "text": "So you have like pilots, you know, supervising an airplane that's mostly flying autonomously."}, {"time": 1322,

the urgency of driving."}, {"time": 1385, "text": "I can't, I'm not sure why, but there's something about the risk, I think the fact that you might die is still keeping people awake."}, {"time": 1394,

have, that's where the big disagreement was, you need to have driver sensing, meaning driver facing camera that tracks some kind of information about the face that can tell you drowsiness."}, {"time":

heavy lifting here."}, {"time": 1427, "text": "Yeah, so there needs to be that dance of interaction of a human and machine, but currently it's mostly steering wheel based."}, {"time": 1436, "text":

perspective."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "So in your study of sleep, do you think the hard question of consciousness that it feels like something to be us, is that like a nice little feature, like a quirk of our mind, or is it somehow fundamental?"}, {"time": 1491, "text": "Because sleep feels like we take a step out of that consciousness a little bit."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "So from all your

whole panoply of biological benefits."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "But to your point about sleep, what is interesting if you do a lot of dream research and we've done some, it's very, very rare at all,

"text": "But so I place that as a backdrop against your astute question, because despite all of that psychosis, there is still a present self nested at the heart of it, meaning that I think it's very difficult for us to abandon our conscious sense of self."}, {"time": 1644, "text": "And if it's that hard, the old adage in some ways, that you can't outrun your shadow."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "But here it's more of a philosophical question, which is about the conscious mind and what the state of consciousness actually means in a human being."}, {"time": 1658, "text": "So I think that that to me, you become so dislocated from so many other rational ways of waking consciousness."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "But one thing that won't go away, that won't get perturbed or sort of, you know, manacled, is this your sense of conscious self?"}, {"time": 1678, "text": "Yeah, that's a strong sign that consciousness is fundamental to the human mind."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "Or we're just

established now."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "But I think that the counterpoint to that, well, firstly, the dose and the timing make the poison."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "And I'll perhaps come back to that in just a second."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "But for coffee, it's actually not the caffeine."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "So, a lot of people have asked me about this rightful paradox between the fact that sleep provides all of these incredible health benefits and then coffee, which can have a deleterious impact on your sleep has a whole collection of health benefits."}, {"time": 2903, "text":

answer is very simple."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "It's called antioxidants, that it turns out that for most people in Western civilization because of diet, not being quite what it should be, the major source through which they obtain antioxidants is the coffee bean."}, {"time": 2930, "text": "So the humble coffee bean has now been asked to carry the astronomical weight of serving up the large majority of people's antioxidant needs."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "And you can see this if, for example, you look at the health benefits of decaffeinated coffee, it has a whole constellation of really great health benefits too."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "So it's not the caffeine."}, {"time": 2953, "text": "And that's why I liked what you said, this sort of separation of church and state between coffee and caffeine."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "It's not the caffeine, it's the coffee bean itself that provides those health benefits."}, {"time": 2964, "text": "But coming back to how it impacts sleep, it impacts sleep in probably at least three different ways."}, {"time": 2973, "text": "The first is that for most people, caffeine can make it obviously a little harder to fall asleep."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "Caffeine can make it harder to stay asleep."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "But let's say that you are one of those individuals and I think you are, and you can say, look, I can have three or four espressos with dinner and I fall asleep just fine and I stay asleep soundly across the night."}, {"time": 2994, "text": "So there's no problem."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "The downside there is that even if that is true, the amount of deep sleep that you get will not be as deep."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "And so you will actually lose somewhere between 10 to 30% of your deep sleep if you drink caffeine in the evening."}, {"time": 3011, "text": "So to give you some context, to drop your deep sleep by let's say 20%, I'd probably have to age you by 15 years, or you could do it every night with a cup of coffee."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "I think the fourth component that is perhaps less well understood about coffee is its timing, and that's why I was saying the timing and the dose make the poison."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "The dose, by the way, once you get past about three cups of coffee a day, the health benefits actually start to turn down in the opposite direction."}, {"time": 3040, "text": "So there is a U shape function."}, {"time": 3041, "text": "It's sort of the Goldilocks syndrome, not too little, not too much, just the right amount."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "The second component is the timing though."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Caffeine has half life of about five to six hours, meaning that after five to six hours, 50% of that on average for the average adult is still in the system, which means that it has a quarter life of 10 to 12 hours."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "So in other words, if you have a coffee at noon, a quarter of that caffeine is still circulating in your brain at midnight."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "So having a cup of coffee at noon, one could argue is the equivalent of tucking yourself into bed at midnight, and before you turn the light out, you swig a quarter of a cup of coffee."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "But that doesn't still answer your question as to why are you so immune?"}, {"time": 3086, "text": "So I'm someone who is actually unfortunately very sensitive to caffeine."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "And if I have even two cups of coffee in the morning, I don't sleep as well that night."}, {"time":

think I would love to be invested in it."}, {"time": 3106, "text": "It's just terrible for my sleep."}, {"time": 3107, "text": "So I switched to decaf."}, {"time": 3109, "text": "There is a difference from one individual to the next, and it's controlled by a set of liver enzymes called cytochrome P450 enzymes."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "And there is a particular gene that if you have a different sort of version of this gene, it's called CYP1A2."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "That gene will determine the speed of the clearance of caffeine from your system."}, {"time": 3138, "text": "Some people will have a version of that gene that is very effective and efficient at clearing that caffeine."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "And so their half life could be as short as two hours rather than five to six hours."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "Other people, hands up Matt Walker, have a version of that gene that is not very effective at clearing out the caffeine."}, {"time": 3160, "text": "And therefore their half life sort of sensitivity could be somewhere between eight to nine hours."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "So we understand that there are individual differences, but overall, I guess the top line here is drink coffee and understand that it's not the caffeine, it's the coffee that's the benefit and the dose makes the poison."}, {"time": 3181, "text": "Is there some aspect to it that it's like a muscle in terms of all the combination of letters and numbers that you just said?"}, {"time": 3189, "text": "Is there some aspect that if I can improve the quarter life, the half life, could decrease that number if I just practice?"}, {"time": 3199, "text": "Like I drink a lot of coffee, so like habit alters how your body's able to get rid of the caffeine."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "Not how the body is able to get rid of the caffeine, but it does alter how sensitive the body is to the caffeine."}, {"time": 3214, "text": "And it's not at the level of the enzyme degrading the caffeine."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "It's at the level of the receptors that caffeine will act upon."}, {"time": 3224, "text": "Now it turns out that those are called adenosine receptors and maybe we can speak about what adenosine is and sleep pressure and all of that good stuff."}, {"time": 3231, "text": "But as you start to drink more and more coffee, the body tries to fight back and it happens with many different drugs by the way, and it's called tolerance."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "And so one of the ways that your body becomes tolerant to a drug is that the receptors that the drug is binding to, these sort of welcome sites, these sort of picture myths, as it were, that receive the drug, those start to get taken away from the surface of the cell and it's what we call receptor internalization."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "So the cell starts to think, gee whiz, there's a lot of stimulation going on, this is too much."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "So I'm just going to, when normally I would coat my cell with let's just say five of these receptors for argument's sake, things are going a little bit too ballistic right now."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "I'm going to take away at least two of those receptors and downscale it to just having three of those."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "And now you need two cups of coffee to get the same effect that one cup of coffee got you before."}, {"time": 3295, "text": "And that's why then when you go cold turkey on coffee, all of a sudden the system has equilibrated itself to expecting X amount of stimulation and now all of that stimulation is gone."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "So it's now got too few receptors and you have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "And that's why, for example, with drugs of abuse, things like heroin, when people go into abstinence, as they're sort of moving into their addiction, they will build up a progressive tolerance to that drug."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "So they need to take more of it to get the same high."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "But then if they go cold turkey for some period of time, the system goes back to being more sensitive again."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "It starts to repopulate the surface of the cell with these receptors."}, {"time": 3344, "text": "But now when they reuse and they fall off the wagon, if they go back to the same dose that they were using before 10 weeks ago or three months ago, that dose can kill them."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "They can have an overdose."}, {"time": 3358, "text": "Even though they were using the same amount at those two different times, the difference is that it's not the dose of the drug, it's the sensitivity of the system."}, {"time": 3368, "text": "And that's the same thing that we see with caffeine."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "In terms of training the muscle, as it were, the system becomes less sensitive, can calibrate."}, {"time": 3377, "text": "Is there a time, the number of hours before bed, that's a safe bet to most people to recommend you shouldn't drink caffeine this many hours?"}, {"time": 3391, "text": "Like, is there an average half life that you should be aiming at?"}, {"time": 3395, "text": "Or is this advice kind of impossible because there's so much variability?"}, {"time": 3399, "text": "There is huge variability."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "And I think everyone themselves to a degree knows it, although I'll put a caveat on that too because it's a slightly dangerous point."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "So the recommendation for the average adult and who, where is the average adult in society?"}, {"time": 3415, "text": "There is no such thing."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "But for the average adult, it would be probably cutting yourself off maybe 10 hours

affect learning?"}, {"time": 3445, "text": "Sleep before learning, sleep after learning, which are both fascinating kind of dynamics of the mind's interaction with this extra conscious state."}, {"time": 3457, "text": "Yeah, sleep is profoundly and very intimately related to your memory systems and your informational systems."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "The first is you just mentioned is that sleep before learning will essentially prepare your brain almost like a dry sponge ready to sort of, you know, initially soak up new information."}, {"time": 3479, "text": "In other words, you need sleep before learning to effectively imprint information into the brain to lay down fresh memory traces."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain, and we know we've studied these memory circuits, will, you know, they essentially become waterlogged as it were for the sponge analogy, and you can't absorb the information as effectively."}, {"time": 3503, "text": "So you need sleep before learning, but you also need sleep unfortunately after learning too, to then take those freshly minted memories and effectively hit the save button on them, but it's nowhere near as quick as a digital system."}, {"time": 3518, "text": "It takes hours because it's a physical biological change that happens at the level of brain cells."}, {"time": 3525, "text": "But sleep after learning will cement and solidify that new memory into the neural architecture of the brain, therefore making it less likely to be forgotten."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "So, you know, I often think of sleep in that way as, it's almost sort of future proofing information."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "Well, it means that it gives it a higher degree of assurance to be remembered in the future rather than go through the sort of degradation that we think of as forgetting."}, {"time": 3593, "text": "So sleep after learning then sort of, you know, sets that information like amber in solidification."}, {"time": 3602, "text": "The third benefit, however, is that sleep, we've learned more recently is much more intelligent than we ever gave it credit for."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "Sleep doesn't simply just take individual memories and strengthen them."}, {"time": 3615, "text": "Sleep will then intelligently integrate and cross link and associate that information together."},

normal time at night."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "So then you're gonna get into bed thinking, well, I had a terrible night of sleep last night."}, {"time": 7315, "text": "And yes, I slept in this

the same thing is, if you go to bed any earlier, so don't wake up any later, wake up at the same time, don't go to bed any earlier, because then you're just probably your chronotype, your biological rhythm doesn't want you to be asleep."}, {"time": 7346, "text": "And you think, well, it's a terrible night, I'm gonna get into bed at 9 p.m. rather than my standard 10, I'm just gonna be lying in bed awake for that hour."}, {"time": 7355, "text": "Naps will take our double edged sword, they can have wonderful benefits."}, {"time": 7358, "text": "And we've done lots of studies on naps for both the

like a valve on a pressure cooker."}, {"time": 7372, "text": "When you nap during the day, you can take some of that healthy sleepiness that you've been building up during the day."}, {"time": 7378, "text": "And for some people, not all people, but for some people that can then make it harder for them to fall asleep at night and then stay asleep soundly across the night."}, {"time": 7387, "text": "So the advice would be, if you're struggling with sleep at night, don't nap during the day."}, {"time": 7392, "text": "But if you are not struggling with sleep, and you can nap regularly, naps are just fine."}, {"time": 7397, "text": "And we can play around with optimal durations depending on what you want."}, {"time": 7401, "text": "Just try not to nap too late into the day because napping late into the day is like snacking before your main meal."}, {"time": 7407, "text": "It just takes the edge off your sleep hunger as it were."}, {"time": 7410, "text": "But that would be, so that's my unconventional second piece of advice regarding insomnia."}, {"time": 7417, "text": "The third is meditation."}, {"time": 7419, "text": "I found meditation to be incredibly powerful."}, {"time": 7421,

before bed incredibly powerful."}, {"time": 7454, "text": "The meditation app companies were perplexed at this at first."}, {"time": 7457, "text": "They want people to meditate during the day."}, {"time": 7459, "text": "But when they looked at their usage statistics, they found that they would have people in the morning meditating."}, {"time": 7464, "text": "And then there's a huge number of people using the meditation app in the evening."}, {"time": 7468, "text": "What they were doing was self medicating their insomnia."}, {"time": 7472, "text": "And they finally, rather than railing against it, they started to see it as a cash cow, rightly so."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "So I found meditation to be helpful."}, {"time": 7481, "text": "Having a wind down routine is the other thing that's critical for me."}, {"time": 7485, "text": "I can't just go from, because when my mind is switched on and I think you may be like this too, if I get into bed, that Rolodex of thoughts and information and excitement and anxiety and worry is just whirling away."}, {"time": 7502, "text": "And it's not gonna be a good night for me."}, {"time": 7505, "text": "So I have to find a wind down routine."}, {"time": 7507, "text": "And that makes sense when you realize what sleep is like."}, {"time": 7510, "text": "Sleep is not like a light switch."}, {"time": 7514, "text": "Sleep is much more like trying to land a plane."}, {"time": 7516, "text": "You know, it takes time to descend down onto the terra firma that we call sound sleep at night."}, {"time": 7523, "text": "And we have this for kids."}, {"time": 7524, "text": "You know, I don't have children, but you know, a lot of parents will say, you know, we have to have the bedroom, sorry, the bedtime routine."}, {"time": 7535, "text": "You know, you bathe the kid, you put them in bed, you read them a story."}, {"time": 7538, "text": "You have to go through this routine, this wind down routine for them."}, {"time": 7542, "text": "And then they fall asleep wonderfully."}, {"time": 7544, "text": "Why do we abandon that?"}, {"time": 7546, "text": "As adults, we need that same wind down routine."}, {"time": 7551, "text": "So that's been the other thing that's been very helpful to me."}, {"time": 7554, "text": "So don't do anything different."}, {"time": 7557, "text": "If you have a bad night of sleep, keep doing the same thing."}, {"time": 7560, "text": "Manage your anxiety, understand it, rationalize it."}, {"time": 7565, "text": "Then meditation, and then finally having some kind of disengagement wind down routine."}, {"time": 7571, "text": "Those are the four things that have been very helpful to me."}, {"time": 7576, "text": "So the regularities really do a lot of work against insomnia."}, {"time": 7580, "text": "Is there, is it possible to have a healthy sleep life without the regularities?"}, {"time": 7590, "text": "I say that because I'm all over the place and I've gotten good at being all over the place."}, {"time": 7598, "text": "So I'll often, like what happens, I'll go stretches of time."}, {"time": 7602, "text": "There'll be sometimes a month where I, my days are like, this is embarrassing to admit, but they're like, just you and I here, just you and I."}, {"time": 7611, "text": "It's like 28 hours or 30 hour days."}, {"time": 7615, "text": "Like I'll just go all the way around comfortably and happily, I love it."}, {"time": 7620, "text": "And then there'll be a nap."}, {"time": 7622, "text": "I mean, if you like add up the hours when I'm just like sleeping as much as I want, it'd probably be like six hour average per 24 hours."}, {"time": 7632, "text": "Like that kind of, so it works out nicely, maybe even seven hours, I don't know."}, {"time": 7638, "text": "But that it's obviously irregular and there's chaos in the whole thing."}, {"time": 7643, "text": "Like sometimes it's shorter sleep, sometimes it's longer."}, {"time": 7646, "text": "Is that totally not a good thing, do you think?"}, {"time": 7651, "text": "The best evidence that we have to speak to this question is people who are doing rotating shifts."}, {"time": 7657, "text": "And unfortunately the news is not good."}, {"time": 7661, "text": "They usually have a higher instance of many diseases such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, stroke."}, {"time": 7674, "text":

see some of the pressure stress fractures in the system."}, {"time": 7738, "text": "But again, to your point, if that's something that you don't mind, you know, adopting and understanding and then I think you should keep doing what you're doing."}, {"time": 7752, "text": "Yeah, it's complicated."}, {"time": 7753, "text": "Of course you have to be a student of your own body and explore it."},

certain things that I've seen very successful people that I know in my life when they get, when they have kids, they actually, the productivity goes up, they get their shit together."}, {"time": 7791,

point on that too."}, {"time": 7806, "text": "You know, we often think about sleep as a cost, but instead I think of sleep as an investment."}, {"time": 7818, "text": "And the reason is because your effectiveness and your efficiency when you're well slept typically exceeds that when you're not."}, {"time": 7827, "text": "And to me, it's the idea of if I'm going to boil a pot of water, why would I boil it on medium when I could boil it in half the time on high?"}, {"time": 7839, "text": "And I sometimes worry that when I speak to Fortune 500 companies and they're of this mentality of longer

think I'm speaking about."}, {"time": 7912, "text": "It's just simply that I think maybe this notion of wanting to be awake for longer to try and get more done can sometimes be at odds with the fact that you can actually get so much more done if you're well slept."}, {"time": 7932, "text": "And it's this trade off."}, {"time": 7934, "text": "I actually admire people that take the big risk and work hard, whether that means staying up late at night, all those kinds of things, but it cannot be in the framework, in the context like what Edison said, which is sleep feels like a waste of time."}, {"time": 7949, "text": "So if you're not sleeping because you think sleep is stupid, that's totally wrong."}, {"time": 7956, "text": "But if you're not sleeping because you're deeply

"text": "Is there a good science on the interaction between fasting and sleep?"}, {"time": 8189, "text": "We have some data, I would prefer more, but we have data both on time restricted eating and then we have some data on fasting to a degree."}, {"time": 8205, "text": "On time restricted eating, I think that it has some benefits, although the human replication studies have actually not borne out quite the same health benefit extent that the animal studies have."}, {"time": 8219, "text": "There've been some disappointing studies, one here close to where we are right now at UCSF recently."}, {"time": 8226, "text": "So I think time restricted eating can be a good thing and there are many benefits of time restricted eating."}, {"time": 8233, "text": "Is sleep one of them?"}, {"time": 8234, "text": "No, it doesn't seem to be because there are probably at the time that we're recording this, three pretty decent studies that I'm aware of."}, {"time": 8242, "text": "Two out of the three were in obese individuals, one out of the three were in healthy weight individuals."}, {"time": 8249, "text": "And what they found is that time restricted eating in all three of those

fasting though, which is a different state, we don't have too many studies, experimental studies with longterm fasting."}, {"time": 8269, "text": "The best data that we have is probably from religious practices and probably the most data we have is during Ramadan where people will fast for 29 to 30 days from sunrise to sunset."}, {"time": 8284, "text": "And under those conditions, there are probably five distinct changes that we've seen."}, {"time": 8293, "text": "None of them seem to be particularly good for sleep."}, {"time": 8296, "text": "The first is that the amount of melatonin that you release, and melatonin is a hormone."}, {"time": 8300, "text": "It's often called the hormone of darkness or the vampire hormone, not because it makes you look longingly at people's necklines, but it's just because it comes out at night."}, {"time": 8311, "text": "Melatonin signals to your brain and your body that it's dark, it's nighttime, and it's time to sleep."}, {"time": 8316, "text": "Those individuals, when they were undergoing that regimen of fasting, the amount of melatonin that was released and when it was released, the amount of melatonin decreased and when it was released came later."}, {"time": 8330, "text": "That was the first thing."}, {"time": 8332, "text": "The second thing was that they ended up finding it harder to fall asleep as quickly as they normally would otherwise."}, {"time": 8340, "text": "The third thing was that the total amount of sleep that they were getting decreased."}, {"time": 8345, "text": "The fourth fascinating thing was that a wake promoting chemical called orexin increased."}, {"time": 8352, "text": "And this is why a lot of people will say, when I'm fasting, it feels like I can stay awake for longer and I'm more alert, I'm more active."}, {"time": 8361, "text": "And I'll come back from an evolutionary perspective why we understand that to be the case."}, {"time": 8366, "text": "And then the fourth factor is that fasting didn't decrease the amount of deep sleep that seemed to be unaffected."}, {"time": 8373, "text": "It did, however, decrease the amount of REM sleep or dream sleep."}, {"time": 8377, "text": "And we know that REM sleep dreaming is essential for emotional first aid, mental health, it's critical for memory, creativity."}, {"time": 8385, "text": "It's also critical for several hormone functions."}, {"time": 8387, "text": "It's when there's direct correlations between testosterone release peaks just before you go into REM sleep and during REM sleep too."}, {"time": 8397, "text": "So REM sleep is critical."}, {"time": 8400, "text": "But so those are the five changes that we've seen."}, {"time": 8402, "text": "None of them seem to be that advantageous for sleep."}, {"time": 8405, "text": "But the fourth point that I mentioned, which was orexin, which is this wake promoting chemical and a good demonstration or a very sad demonstration of its power is when it becomes very deficient in the brain and it leads to a condition called narcolepsy where you're just unpredictable with your sleep."}, {"time": 8426, "text": "So orexin when it's in high concentrations keeps you awake when you lose it."}, {"time": 8435, "text": "It can put you very much into a state of narcolepsy where you're sleeping a lot of the time in unpredictable sleep."}, {"time": 8443, "text": "Why on earth when you are fasting would the brain release awake promoting chemical?"}, {"time": 8451, "text": "And our answer is right now is the following."}, {"time": 8454, "text": "One of the few times that I mentioned before that we see animals undergoing insufficient sleep or prolonged sleep deprivation is under conditions of starvation."}, {"time": 8466, "text": "And that is an extreme evolutionary pressure."}, {"time": 8471, "text": "And at that point, the brain will forgo some."}, {"time": 8474, "text": "It won't forgo all, but it will forgo some of its sleep."}, {"time": 8478, "text": "And the reason is so that it can stay awake for longer because the sign of starvation is saying to the brain, you can't find food in your normal foraging perimeter, you need to stay awake for longer so you can travel outside of your perimeter for a further distance and maybe you will find food and save the organism."}, {"time": 8497, "text": "So in other words, when we fast, it's giving our brain this evolutionary signal that you are under conditions of starvation."}, {"time": 8506, "text": "So the brain responds by saying, oh my goodness, I need to release the chemical that helps the organism stay awake for longer which is orexin."}, {"time": 8514, "text": "So that they can forage for more food."}, {"time": 8517, "text": "Now, of course, your brain from an evolutionary perspective doesn't know about this thing called Safeway that you could easily go to and break the fast."}, {"time": 8525, "text": "But that's how we understand fasting."}, {"time": 8528, "text": "And I think my dear friend, Peter Attia has done a lot of work in this area too."}, {"time": 8534, "text": "I think fasting and David Sinclair's brilliant work, goodness me, what an individual too."}, {"time": 8540, "text": "The work is pretty clear there that time restricted eating and fasting have wonderful health benefits."}, {"time": 8547, "text": "Fasting creates this thing called hormesis, just like exercise and low level stress and sauna, heat, shock."}, {"time": 8559, "text": "And hormesis is a biological process I think as David Sinclair has once said, in simple layman's terms is, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger."}, {"time": 8567, "text": "And I think there is certainly good data that fasting and time restricted eating has many benefits."}, {"time": 8577, "text": "It doesn't seem to be, it doesn't seem to enhance sleep."}, {"time": 8580, "text": "But it's interesting to understand its effects on sleep."}, {"time": 8584, "text": "I've fasted, it's a study of NF2."}, {"time": 8592, "text": "I once fasted 72 hours and another time 48 hours."}, {"time": 8596, "text": "And I found that I got much less sleep and it was very restful though."}, {"time": 8602, "text": "I hesitate to say this, but this is how I felt, which is I needed less sleep."}, {"time": 8606, "text": "I wonder if my brain is deceiving me because it feels like I'm getting a whole extra amount of focus for free."}, {"time": 8615, "text": "And I wonder if there's longterm impacts of that."}, {"time": 8619, "text": "Because if I fast 24 hours, get the same amount of calories, one meal a day, there's a little bit of discomfort."}, {"time": 8627, "text": "Like just maybe your body gets a little bit colder."}, {"time": 8630, "text": "Maybe there's just, I mean, hunger."}, {"time": 8634, "text": "But the amount of focus is crazy."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "And so I wonder, it's like, I'm a little suspicious of that."}, {"time": 8642, "text": "I feel like I'm getting something for free."}, {"time": 8644, "text": "I'm the same way with sweetener, like a Splendor or something."}, {"time": 8647, "text": "It's like, it's gotta be really bad for you, right?"}, {"time": 8650, "text": "Because why is it so tasty, right?"}, {"time": 8652, "text": "And I think, yeah, as we said before with biology, if there's a gain, there's often a cost too."}, {"time": 8665, "text": "But we at least understand the biological basis of what you're describing."}, {"time": 8669, "text": "It's not that you actually don't need less sleep."}, {"time": 8673, "text": "It's that this chemical is present that forces you more awake."}, {"time": 8679, "text": "And so subjectively you feel as though I don't need as much sleep because I'm wide awake."}, {"time": 8685, "text": "And those two things are quite different."}, {"time": 8687, "text": "It's not as though your sleep need has decreased."}, {"time": 8691, "text": "It's that your brain has hit the overdrive switch, the overboost switch to say, we need to keep you awake because food is in short supply."}, {"time": 8700, "text": "So you mentioned during sleep, there's a simulation, all those kinds of things for learning purposes, but there's also these, you mentioned the five ways in which we become psychotic in dreams."}, {"time": 8711, "text": "What do you think dreams are about?"}, {"time": 8716, "text": "Why do you think we dream?"}, {"time": 8717, "text": "What place do we go to when we dream?"}, {"time": 8721, "text": "And why are they useful?"}, {"time": 8722, "text": "Not just the assimilation aspect, but just like all the crazy visuals that we get with dreams."}, {"time": 8729, "text": "Is there something you can speak to that's actually useful?"}, {"time": 8733, "text": "Like why we have such fun experiences in that dream world?"}, {"time": 8738, "text": "So one of the camps in the sleep field is that dreams are meaningless, that they are an epiphenomenal byproduct of this thing called REM sleep from which dreams come from as a physiological state."}, {"time": 8755, "text": "So the analogy would be, let's think of a light bulb, that the reason that you create the apparatus of a light bulb is to produce this thing called light in the same way that we've evolved to this thing called REM sleep to serve whatever functions REM sleep serves."}, {"time": 8773, "text": "But it turns out that when you create light in that way, you also produce something called heat."}, {"time": 8779, "text": "It was never the reason that you designed the light bulb, it's just what happens when you create light in that way."}, {"time": 8786, "text": "And the belief so too was that dreaming was essentially the heat of the light bulb."}, {"time": 8792, "text": "That REM sleep is critical, but when you have REM sleep with a complex brain like ours, you also produce this conscious epiphenomenon called dreaming."}, {"time": 8804, "text": "I don't believe that for a second."}, {"time": 8806, "text": "And from a simple perspective is that I suspect that dreaming is more metabolically costly as a conscious experience than not dreaming."}, {"time": 8816, "text": "So you could still have REM sleep, but absent the conscious experience of dreaming was probably less metabolically costly."}, {"time": 8825, "text": "And whenever mother nature burns the energy unit called ATP, which is the most valuable thing, there's usually a reason for it."}, {"time": 8835, "text": "So if it's more energetically demanding, then I suspect that there is a function to it."}, {"time": 8842, "text": "And we've now since discovered that dreams have a function."}, {"time": 8846, "text": "The first, as we mentioned, creativity."}, {"time": 8849, "text": "The second is that dreams provide a form of overnight therapy."}, {"time": 8855, "text": "Dreaming is a form of emotional first aid."}, {"time": 8858, "text": "And it's during dream sleep at night that we take these difficult, painful experiences that we've had during the day, sometimes traumatic, and dream sleep acts almost like a nocturnal soothing balm."}, {"time": 8871, "text": "And it sort of just takes the sharp edges off those difficult, painful experiences so that you come back the next day and you feel better about them."}, {"time": 8881, "text": "And so I think in that sense, dreaming, it's not time that heals all wounds."}, {"time": 8887, "text": "It's time during dream sleep that provides emotional convalescence."}, {"time": 8892, "text": "So dreaming is almost a form of emotional windscreen wipers."}, {"time": 8899, "text": "And I think, and by the way, it's not just that you dream."}, {"time": 8904, "text": "It's what you dream about that also matters."}, {"time": 8910, "text": "So for example, scientists have done studies with learning and memory where they have people learn a virtual maze."}, {"time": 8917, "text": "And what they discovered was that those people who then dreamed, but dreamed of the maze were the only ones who, when they woke up, ended up being better at navigating the maze."}, {"time": 8930, "text": "Whereas those people who dreamed, but didn't dream about the maze itself, they were no better at navigating the maze."}, {"time": 8937, "text": "So it's not just that you, it's not sort of necessary, but not sufficient."}, {"time": 8942, "text": "It's necessary that you dream, but it's not sufficient to produce the benefit."}, {"time": 8946, "text": "You have to be dreaming about certain things itself."}, {"time": 8949, "text": "And the same is true for mental health."}, {"time": 8953,

difficult event itself, they go on to gain resolution to their clinical depression one year later."}, {"time": 8971, "text": "Whereas people who were dreaming just as much, but not dreaming about the trauma itself, did not go on to gain as much clinical resolution to their depression."}, {"time": 8982, "text": "So it's, I think to me, those are the lines of evidence that tell me dreaming is not epiphenomenal."}, {"time": 8990, "text": "And it's not just about the act of dreaming, it's about the content of the dreams, not just the fact of a dream itself."}, {"time": 9000, "text": "It's, first of all, it's fascinating."}, {"time": 9001, "text": "It makes a lot of sense, but then immediately takes my mind to, from an engineering perspective, how that could be useful in, for example, AI systems of, if you think about dreaming as an important part about learning and cognition and filtering previous memories of what's important, integrating them."}, {"time": 9025, "text": "You know, maybe you can correct me, but I see dreaming as a kind of simulation of worlds that are not constrained by physics."}, {"time": 9034, "text": "So like you get a chance to take some of your memories, some of your thoughts, some of your anxieties, and play with them, like construct virtual worlds and see how it evolves."}, {"time": 9046, "text": "Like to play with those worlds in a safe environment of your mind, safe in quotes, because you could probably get into a lot of trouble with the places your mind will go."}, {"time": 9056, "text": "But this definitely is applied in much cruder ways in artificial intelligence."}, {"time": 9065, "text": "So one context in which this is applied is the process called self play, which is a reinforcement learning where agents play against itself or versions of itself."}, {"time": 9079, "text": "And it's all simulated of trying different versions of themselves and playing against each other to see what ends up being a good."}, {"time": 9089,

been a theory that's been put forward, which is that dreaming is a virtual reality test space that is largely consequence free."}, {"time": 9127, "text": "What an incredible gift to give a conscious

very difficult thing to do because it requires a lot of intelligence, it requires consciousness."}, {"time": 9158, "text": "This has been effectively recently being used in a self supervised learning for computer vision with the process of what's called data augmentation."}, {"time": 9170, "text": "That's a very crude version of dreams, which is you take data and you mess with it and you start to learn how a picture of a cat truly represents a cat by messing with it in different ways."}, {"time": 9186, "text": "Now the crude methods currently are cropping, rotating, distorting, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 9191, "text": "But you can imagine much more complicated generative processes that start hallucinating different cats in order for you to understand deeply of what it means for

different."}, {"time": 9454, "text": "It's almost as though we're injecting a greater amount of noise into the neural architecture of the brain during dream sleep, as if it's chemically brute forced

up."}, {"time": 9478, "text": "So it is a state that seems to be very, I mean, if you were to show me a brain scan of REM sleep and tell me that it's not REM sleep, just say, look, based on the

win?"}, {"time": 1044, "text": "It's because of a remarkable assemblage of qualities that no one of them was the clear winner but it made these sort of compromises between a number of different influences."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "It had that really excellent gate oxide that allowed us to make MOSFETs, these high performance transistors, so quickly and cheaply and easily without having to do a lot of materials development."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "The band gap of silicon is actually, so in a semiconductor there's an important parameter which is called the band gap which tells you there are sort of electrons that fill up to one level in the energy diagram and then there's a gap where electrons aren't allowed to have an energy in a certain range and then there's another energy level above that."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "And that difference between the lower sort of filled level and the unoccupied level, that tells you how much voltage you have to apply in order to induce a current to flow."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "So with germanium, that's about 0.75 electron volts."}, {"time": 1107, "text": "That means you have to apply 0.75 volts to get a current moving."}, {"time": 1112, "text": "And it turns out that if you compare that to the thermal excitations that are induced just by the temperature of our environment, that gap's not quite big enough."}, {"time": 1122,

computation."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "Silicon's band gap is just a little higher, 1.1 electron volts, but you have an exponential dependence on the number of carriers that are present that can induce those errors."}, {"time": 1146, "text": "It decays exponentially with that voltage."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "So just that slight extra energy in that band gap really puts it in an ideal position to be operated in the conditions of our ambient environment."}, {"time": 1160, "text": "It's kind of fascinating that, like you mentioned, errors decrease exponentially with the voltage."}, {"time": 1167, "text": "So it's funny because this error thing comes up when you start talking about quantum computing."}, {"time": 1174, "text": "And it's kind of amazing that everything we've been talking about, the errors, as we scale down, seems to be extremely low."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "And like all of our computation is based on the assumption that it's extremely low."}, {"time": 1187,

absolute zero."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And what happens at that temperature, at very low temperatures in certain materials is that the noise of atoms moving around, the lattice vibrating, electrons colliding with each other, that becomes sufficiently low that the electrons can settle into this very special state."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "It's sometimes referred to as a macroscopic quantum

makes sense but I don't have a capacitive penalty."}, {"time": 3118, "text": "Sometimes these are called wiring parasitics."}, {"time": 3121, "text": "There are no parasitics associated with light in that same sense."}, {"time": 3124, "text": "So this might be a dumb question but how do I catch a photon on the other end?"}, {"time": 3131, "text": "Is it material?"}, {"time": 3132, "text": "Is it the polymer stuff you were talking about for a different application for photolithography?"}, {"time": 3139, "text": "Like how do you catch a photon?"}, {"time": 3140, "text": "There's a lot of ways to catch a photon."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "It's a deep and important question that basically defines a lot of the work that goes on in our group at NIST."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "One of my group leaders, Seywoon Nam, has built his career around these superconducting single photon detectors."}, {"time": 3158, "text": "So if you're going to try to sort of reach a lower limit and detect just one particle of light, superconductors come back into our conversation and just picture a simple device where you have current flowing through a superconducting wire and... A loop again or no?"}, {"time": 3176, "text": "Let's say yes, you have a loop."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "So you have a superconducting wire that goes straight down like this and on your loop branch, you have a little ammeter, something that measures current."}, {"time": 3185, "text": "There's a resistor up there too."}, {"time": 3187, "text": "Go with me here."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "So your current biasing this, so there's current flowing through that superconducting branch."}, {"time": 3194, "text": "Since there's a resistor over here, all the current goes through the superconducting branch."}, {"time": 3198, "text": "Now a photon comes in, strikes that superconductor."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "We talked about this superconducting macroscopic quantum state."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "That's going to be destroyed by the energy of that photon."}, {"time": 3208, "text": "So now that branch of the circuit is resistive too."}, {"time": 3212, "text": "And you've properly designed your circuit so that the resistance on that superconducting branch is much greater than the other resistance."}, {"time": 3218, "text": "Now all of your current's going to go that way."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "Your ammeter says, oh, I just got a pulse of current."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "That must mean I detected a photon."}, {"time": 3225, "text": "Then where you broke that superconductivity in a matter of a few nanoseconds, it cools back off, dissipates that energy and the current flows back through that superconducting branch."}, {"time": 3234, "text": "This is a very powerful superconducting device that allows us to understand quantum states of light."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "I didn't realize a loop like that could be sensitive to a single photon."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "I mean, that seems strange to me because, I mean, so what happens when you just barrage it with photons?"}, {"time": 3256, "text": "If you put a bunch of photons in there, essentially the same thing happens."}, {"time": 3259, "text": "You just drive it into the normal state, it becomes resistive and it's not particularly interesting."}, {"time": 3265, "text": "So you have to be careful how many photons you send."}, {"time": 3267, "text": "Like you have to be very precise with your communication."}, {"time": 3271, "text": "So I would say that that's actually in the application that we're trying to use these detectors for."}, {"time": 3277, "text": "That's a feature because what we want is for, if a neuron sends one photon to a synaptic connection and one of these superconducting detectors is sitting there, you get this pulse of current."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "And that synapse says event, then I'm gonna do what I do when there's a synapse event, I'm gonna perform computations, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "But if accidentally you send two there or three or five, it does the exact same."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "And so this is how in the system that we're devising here, communication is entirely binary."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "And that's what I tried to emphasize a second ago."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "Communication should not change the information."}, {"time": 3317, "text": "You're not saying, oh, I got this kind of communication event for photons."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "No, we're not keeping track of that."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "This neuron fired, this synapse says that neuron fired, that's it."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "So that's a noise filtering property of those detectors."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "However, there are other applications where you'd rather know the exact number of photons that can be very useful in quantum computing with light."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "And our group does a lot of work around another kind of superconducting sensor called a transition edge sensor that Adrian Alita in our group does a lot of work on that."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "And that can tell you based on the amplitude of the current pulse you divert exactly how many photons were in that pulse."}, {"time": 3360, "text": "What's that useful for?"}, {"time": 3362, "text": "One way that you can encode information in quantum states of light is in the number of photons."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "You can have what are called number states and a number state will have a well defined number of photons and maybe the output of your quantum computation encodes its information in the number of photons that are generated."}, {"time": 3380, "text": "So if you have a detector that is sensitive to that, it's extremely useful."}, {"time": 3384, "text": "Can you achieve like a clock with photons or is that not important?"}, {"time": 3390, "text": "Is there a synchronicity

distribute a clock across any appreciable size computational system, you wanna use light."}, {"time": 3420, "text": "Yeah, I wonder how these giant systems work, especially like supercomputers."}, {"time": 3427, "text": "Do they need to do clock distribution or are they doing more ad hoc parallel like concurrent programming?"}, {"time": 3435, "text": "Like there's some kind of locking mechanisms or something."}, {"time": 3438, "text": "That's a fascinating question, but let's zoom in at this very particular question of computation on a processor and communication between processors."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "So what does this system look like that you're envisioning?"}, {"time": 3458, "text": "One of the places you're envisioning it is in the paper on optoelectronic intelligence."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "Are we talking about something that starts to look a lot like the human brain or does it still look a lot like a computer?"}, {"time": 3471, "text": "What are the size of this thing?"}, {"time": 3472, "text": "Is it going inside a smartphone or as you said, does it go inside something that's more like a house?"}, {"time": 3478, "text": "Like what should we be imagining?"}, {"time": 3481, "text": "What are you thinking about when you're thinking about these fundamental systems?"}, {"time": 3485, "text": "Let me introduce the word neuromorphic."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "There's this concept of neuromorphic computing where what that broadly refers to is computing based on the information processing principles of the brain."}, {"time": 3499, "text": "And as digital computing seems to be pushing towards some fundamental performance limits, people are considering architectural advances, drawing inspiration from the brain, more distributed parallel network kind of architectures and stuff."}, {"time": 3514, "text": "And so there's this continuum of neuromorphic from things that are pretty similar to digital computers, but maybe there are more cores and the way they send messages is a little bit more like the way brain neurons send spikes."}, {"time": 3532, "text": "But for the most part, it's still digital electronics."}, {"time": 3536, "text": "And then you have some things in between where maybe you're using transistors, but now you're starting to use them instead of in a digital way, in an analog way."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "And so you're trying to get those circuits to behave more like neurons."}, {"time": 3550, "text": "And then that's a little bit, quite a bit more on the neuromorphic side of things."}, {"time": 3554, "text": "You're trying to get your circuits, although they're still based on silicon, you're trying to get them to perform operations that are highly analogous to the operations in the brain."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And that's where a great deal of work is in neuromorphic computing, people like Giacomo Indoveri and Gert Kauenberg, Jennifer Hasler, countless others."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "It's a rich and exciting field going back to Carver Mead in the late 1980s."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "And then all the way on the other extreme of the continuum is where you say, I'll give up anything related to transistors or semiconductors or anything like that."}, {"time": 3591, "text": "I'm not starting with the assumption that I'm gonna use any kind of conventional computing hardware."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "And instead, what I wanna do is try and understand what makes the brain powerful at the kind of information processing it does."}, {"time": 3603, "text": "And I wanna think from first principles about what hardware is best going to enable us to capture those information processing principles in an artificial system."}, {"time": 3616, "text": "And that's where I live."}, {"time": 3617, "text": "That's where I'm doing my exploration these days."}, {"time": 3621, "text": "So what are the first principles of brain like computation communication?"}, {"time": 3629, "text": "Right, yeah, this is so important and I'm glad we booked 14 hours for this because."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "I only have 13, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 3638, "text": "Okay, so the brain is notoriously complicated."}, {"time": 3641, "text": "And I think that's an important part of why it can do what it does."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "But okay, let me try to break it down."}, {"time": 3649, "text": "Starting with the devices, neurons, as I said before, they're sophisticated devices in and of themselves and synapses are too."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "They can change their state based on the activity."}, {"time": 3663, "text": "So they adapt over time."}, {"time": 3664, "text": "That's crucial to the way the brain works."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "They don't just adapt on one timescale, they can adapt on myriad timescales from the spacing between pulses, the spacing between spikes that come from neurons all the way to the age of the organism."}, {"time": 3683, "text": "Also relevant, perhaps I think the most important thing that's guided my thinking is the network structure of the brain, so."}, {"time": 3693, "text": "Which can also be adjusted on different scales."}, {"time": 3696, "text": "Absolutely, yes, so you're making new, you're changing the strength of contacts, you're changing the spatial distribution of them, although spatial distribution doesn't change that much once you're a mature organism."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "But that network structure is really crucial."}, {"time": 3712, "text": "So let me dwell on that for a second."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "You can't talk about the brain without emphasizing that most of the neurons in the neocortex or the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that we think is most responsible for high level reasoning and things like that, those neurons make thousands of connections."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "So you have this network that is highly interconnected."}, {"time": 3735, "text": "And I think it's safe to say that one of the primary reasons that they make so many different connections is that allows information to be communicated very rapidly from any spot in the network to any other spot in the network."}, {"time": 3750, "text": "So that's a sort of spatial aspect of it."}, {"time": 3753, "text": "You can quantify this in terms of concepts that are related to fractals and scale invariants, which I think is a very beautiful concept."}, {"time": 3763, "text": "So what I mean by that is kind of, no matter what spatial scale you're looking at in the brain within certain bounds, you see the same general statistical pattern."}, {"time": 3774, "text": "So if I draw a box around some region of my cortex, most of the connections that those neurons within that box make are gonna be within the box to each other in their local neighborhood."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "And that's sort of called clustering, loosely speaking."}, {"time": 3789, "text": "But a non negligible fraction is gonna go outside of that box."}, {"time": 3792, "text": "And then if I draw a bigger box, the pattern is gonna be exactly the same."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "So you have this scale invariants, and you also have a non vanishing probability of a neuron making connection very far away."}, {"time": 3805, "text": "So suppose you wanna plot the probability of a neuron making a connection as a function of distance."}, {"time": 3812, "text": "If that were an exponential function, it would go e to the minus radius over some characteristic radius, and it would drop off up to some certain radius, the probability would be reasonably close to one, and then beyond that characteristic length R zero, it would drop off sharply."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "And so that would mean that the neurons in your brain are really localized, and that's not what we observe."}, {"time": 3838, "text": "Instead, what you see is that the probability of making a longer distance connection, it does drop off, but it drops off as a power law."}, {"time": 3845, "text": "So the probability that you're gonna have a connection at some radius R goes as R to the minus some power."}, {"time": 3853, "text": "And that's more, that's what we see with forces in nature, like the electromagnetic force between two particles or gravity goes as one over the radius squared."}, {"time": 3863, "text": "So you can see this in fractals."}, {"time": 3864, "text": "I love that there's like a fractal dynamics of the brain that if you zoom out, you draw the box and you increase that box by certain step sizes, you're gonna see the same statistics."}, {"time": 3876, "text": "I think that's probably very important to the way the brain processes information."}, {"time": 3881, "text": "It's not just in the spatial domain, it's also in the temporal domain."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "And what I mean by that is... That's incredible that this emerged through the evolutionary process that potentially somehow connected to the way the physics of the universe works."}, {"time": 3897, "text": "Yeah, I couldn't agree more that it's a deep and fascinating subject that I hope to be able to spend the rest of my life studying."}, {"time": 3904, "text": "You think you need to solve, understand this, this fractal nature in order to understand intelligence and communication."}, {"time": 3911, "text": "I think they're deeply intertwined."}, {"time": 3913, "text": "Yes, I think power laws are right at the heart of it."}, {"time": 3916, "text": "So just to push that one through, the same thing happens in the temporal domain."}, {"time": 3921, "text": "So suppose your neurons in your brain were always oscillating at the same frequency, then the probability of finding a neuron oscillating as a function of frequency would be this narrowly peaked function around that certain characteristic frequency."}, {"time": 3936, "text": "That's not at all what we see."}, {"time": 3937, "text": "The probability of finding neurons oscillating or producing spikes at a certain frequency is again a power law, which means there's no defined scale of the temporal activity in the brain."}, {"time": 3953, "text": "At what speed do your thoughts occur?"}, {"time": 3956, "text": "Well, there's a fastest speed they can occur and that is limited by communication and other things, but there's not a characteristic scale."}, {"time": 3963, "text": "We have thoughts on all temporal scales from a few tens of milliseconds, which is physiologically limited by our devices, compare that to tens of picoseconds that I talked about in superconductors, all the way up to the lifetime of the organism."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "You can still think about things that happened to you when you were a kid."}, {"time": 3982, "text": "Or if you wanna be really trippy then across multiple organisms in the entirety of human civilization, you have thoughts that span organisms, right?"}, {"time": 3989, "text": "Yes, taking it to that level, yes."}, {"time": 3991, "text": "If you're willing to see the entirety of the human species as a single organism with a collective intelligence and that too on a spatial and temporal scale, there's thoughts occurring."}, {"time": 4001, "text": "And then if you look at not just the human species, but the entirety of life on earth as an organism with thoughts that are occurring, that are greater and greater sophisticated thoughts, there's a different spatial and temporal scale there."}, {"time": 4014, "text": "This is getting very suspicious."}, {"time": 4017, "text": "Well, hold on though, before we're done, I just wanna just tie the bow and say that the spatial and temporal aspects are intimately interrelated with each other."}, {"time": 4026, "text": "So activity between neurons that are very close to each other is more likely to happen on this faster timescale and information is gonna propagate and encompass more of the brain, more of your cortices, different modules in the brain are gonna be engaged in information processing on longer timescales."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "So there's this concept of information integration where neurons are specialized."}, {"time": 4051, "text": "Any given neuron or any cluster of neuron has its specific purpose, but they're also very much integrated."}, {"time": 4059, "text": "So you have neurons that specialize, but share their information."}, {"time": 4063, "text": "And so that happens through these fractal nested oscillations that occur across spatial and temporal scales."}, {"time": 4069, "text": "I think capturing those dynamics in hardware, to me, that's the goal of neuromorphic computing."}, {"time": 4077, "text": "So does it need to look, so first of all, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 4080, "text": "We stated some clear principles here."}, {"time": 4083, "text": "Now, does it have to look like the brain outside of those principles as well?"}, {"time": 4089, "text": "Like what other characteristics have to look like the human brain?"}, {"time": 4093, "text": "Or can it be something very different?"}, {"time": 4095, "text": "Well, it depends on what you're trying to use it for."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "And so I think a lot of the community asks that question a lot."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "What are you gonna do with it?"}, {"time": 4104, "text": "And I completely get it."}, {"time": 4106, "text": "I think that's a very important question."}, {"time": 4108, "text": "And it's also sometimes not the most helpful question."}, {"time": 4111, "text": "What if what you wanna do with it is study it?"}, {"time": 4113, "text": "What if you just wanna see, what do you have to build into your hardware in order to observe these dynamical principles?"}, {"time": 4123, "text": "And also, I ask myself that question every day and I'm not sure I'm able to answer that."}, {"time": 4129, "text": "So like, what are you gonna do with this particular neuromorphic machine?"}, {"time": 4133, "text": "So suppose what we're trying to do with it is build something that thinks."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "We're not trying to get it to make us any money or drive a car."}, {"time": 4140, "text": "Maybe we'll be able to do that, but that's not our goal."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "Our goal is to see if we can get the same types of behaviors that we observe in our own brain."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "And by behaviors in this sense, what I mean the behaviors of the components, the neurons, the network, that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 4156, "text": "I think there's another element that I didn't really hit on that you also have to build into this."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "And those are architectural principles."}, {"time": 4162, "text": "They have to do with the hierarchical modular construction of the network."}, {"time": 4167, "text": "And without getting too lost in jargon, the main point that I think is relevant there, let me try and illustrate it with a cartoon picture of the architecture of the brain."}, {"time": 4178, "text": "So in the brain, you have the cortex, which is sort of this outer sheet."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "It's actually, it's a layered structure."}, {"time": 4186, "text": "You can, if you could take it out of your brain, you could unroll it on the table and it would be about the size of a pizza sitting there."}, {"time": 4193, "text": "And that's a module."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "It does certain things."}, {"time": 4197, "text": "It processes as Yogi Buzaki would say, it processes the what of what's going on around you."}, {"time": 4203, "text": "But you have another really crucial module that's called the hippocampus."}, {"time": 4208, "text": "And that network is structured entirely differently."}, {"time": 4210, "text": "First of all, this cortex that had described 10 billion neurons in there."}, {"time": 4214, "text": "So numbers matter here."}, {"time": 4216, "text": "And they're organized in that sort of power law distribution where the probability of making a connection drops off as a power law in space."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "The hippocampus is another module that's important for understanding how, where you are, when you are keeping track of your position in space and time."}, {"time": 4237, "text": "And that network is very much random."}, {"time": 4239, "text": "So the probability of making a connection, it almost doesn't even drop off as a function of distance."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "It's the same probability that you'll make it here to over there, but there are only about 100 million neurons there, so you can have that huge densely connected module because it's not so big."}, {"time": 4257, "text": "And the neocortex or the cortex and the hippocampus, they talk to each other constantly."}, {"time": 4264, "text": "And that communication is largely facilitated by what's called the thalamus."}, {"time": 4269, "text": "I'm not a neuroscientist here."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "I'm trying to do my best to recite things."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "Cartoon picture of the brain, I gotcha."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "So this thalamus is coordinating the activity between the neocortex and the hippocampus and making sure that they talk to each other at the right time and send messages that will be useful to one another."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "So this all taken together is called the thalamocortical complex."}, {"time": 4291, "text": "And it seems like building something like that is going to be crucial to capturing the types of activity we're looking for because those responsibilities, those separate modules, they do different things, that's gotta be central to achieving these states of efficient information integration across space and time."}, {"time": 4315, "text": "By the way, I am able to achieve this state by watching simulations, visualizations of the thalamocortical complex."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "There's a few people I forget from where."}, {"time": 4326, "text": "They've created these incredible visual illustrations of visual stimulation from the eye or something like that."}, {"time": 4334, "text": "And this image flowing through the brain."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "Wow, I haven't seen that, I gotta check that out."}, {"time": 4340, "text": "So it's one of those things, you find this stuff in the world, and you see on YouTube, it has 1,000 views, these visualizations of the human brain processing information."}, {"time": 4352, "text": "And because there's chemistry there, because this is from actual human brains, I don't know how they're doing the coloring, but they're able to actually trace the different, the chemical and the electrical signals throughout the brain, and the visual thing, it's like, whoa, because it looks kinda like the universe, I mean, the whole thing is just incredible."}, {"time": 4373, "text": "I recommend it highly, I'll probably post a link to it."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "But you can just look for, one of the things they simulate is the thalamocortical complex and just visualization."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "You can find that yourself on YouTube, but it's beautiful."}, {"time": 4389, "text": "The other question I have for you is, how does memory play into all of this?"}, {"time": 4394, "text": "Because all the signals sending back and forth, that's computation and communication, but that's kinda like processing of inputs and outputs, to produce outputs in the system, that's kinda like maybe reasoning, maybe there's some kind of recurrence."}, {"time": 4410, "text": "But is there a storage mechanism that you think about in the context of neuromorphic computing?"}, {"time": 4415, "text": "Yeah, absolutely, so that's gotta be central."}, {"time": 4417, "text": "You have to have a way that you can store memories."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "And there are a lot of different kinds of memory in the brain."}, {"time": 4425, "text": "That's yet another example of how it's not a simple system."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "So there's one kind of memory, one way of talking about memory, usually starts in the context of Hopfield networks."}, {"time": 4439, "text": "You were lucky to talk to John Hopfield on this program."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "But the basic idea there is working memory is stored in the dynamical patterns of activity between neurons."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "And you can think of a certain pattern of activity as an attractor, meaning if you put in some signal that's similar enough to other previously experienced signals like that, then you're going to converge to the same network dynamics and you will see these neurons participate in the same network patterns of activity that they have in the past."}, {"time": 4477, "text": "So you can talk about the probability that different inputs will allow you to converge to different basins of attraction and you might think of that as, oh, I saw this face and then I excited this network pattern of activity because last time I saw that face, I was at some movie and that's a famous person that's on the screen or something like that."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "So that's one memory storage mechanism."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "But crucial to the ability to imprint those memories in your brain is the ability to change the strength of connection between one neuron and another, that synaptic connection between them."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "So synaptic weight update is a massive field of neuroscience and neuromorphic computing as well."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "So there are two poles on that spectrum."}, {"time": 4526, "text": "Okay, so more in the language of machine learning, we would talk about supervised and unsupervised learning."}, {"time": 4532, "text": "And when I'm trying to tie that down to neuromorphic computing, I will use a definition of supervised learning, which basically means the external user, the person who's controlling this hardware has some knob that they can tune to change each of the synaptic weights, depending on whether or not the network is doing what you want it to do."}, {"time": 4553, "text": "Whereas what I mean in this conversation when I say unsupervised learning is that those synaptic weights are dynamically changing in your network based on nothing that the user is doing, nothing that there's no wire from the outside going into any of those synapses."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "The network itself is reconfiguring those synaptic weights based on physical properties that you've built into the devices."}, {"time": 4577, "text": "So if the synapse receives a pulse from here and that causes the neuron to spike, some circuit built in there with no help from me or anybody else adjust the weight in a way that makes it more likely to store the useful information and excite the useful network patterns and makes it less likely that random noise, useless communication events will have an important effect on the network activity."}, {"time": 4605, "text": "So there's memory encoded in the weights, the synaptic weights."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "What about the formation of something that's not often done in machine learning, the formation of new synaptic connections?"}, {"time": 4616, "text": "Right, well, that seems to, so again, not a neuroscientist here, but my reading of the literature is that that's particularly crucial in early stages of brain development where a newborn is born with tons of extra synaptic connections and it's actually pruned over time."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "So the number of synapses decreases as opposed to growing new long distance connections."}, {"time": 4639, "text": "It is possible in the brain to grow new neurons and assign new synaptic connections but it doesn't seem to be the primary mechanism by which the brain is learning."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "So for example, like right now, sitting here talking to you, you say lots of interesting things and I learn from you and I can remember things that you just said and I didn't grow new axonal connections down to new synapses to enable those."}, {"time": 4667, "text": "It's plasticity mechanisms in the synaptic connections between neurons that enable me to learn on that timescale."}, {"time": 4675, "text": "So at the very least, you can sufficiently approximate that with just weight updates."}, {"time": 4681, "text": "You don't need to form new connections."}, {"time": 4682, "text": "I would say weight updates are a big part of it."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "I also think there's more because broadly speaking, when we're doing machine learning, our networks, say we're talking about feed forward, deep neural networks, the temporal domain is not really part of it."}, {"time": 4696, "text": "Okay, you're gonna put in an image and you're gonna get out a classification and you're gonna do that as fast as possible."}, {"time": 4702, "text": "So you care about time but time is not part of the essence of this thing really."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "Whereas in spiking neural networks, what we see in the brain, time is as crucial as space and they're intimately intertwined as I've tried to say."}, {"time": 4716, "text": "And so adaptation on different timescales is important not just in memory formation, although it plays a key role there, but also in just keeping the activity in a useful dynamic range."}, {"time": 4730, "text": "So you have other plasticity mechanisms, not just weight update, or at least not on the timescale of many action potentials, but even on the shorter timescale."}, {"time": 4740, "text": "So a synapse can become much less efficacious."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "It can transmit a weaker signal after the second, third, fourth, that can second, third, fourth action potential to occur in a sequence."}, {"time": 4753, "text": "So that's what's called short term synaptic plasticity, which is a form of learning."}, {"time": 4757, "text": "You're learning that I'm getting too much stimulus from looking at something bright right now."}, {"time": 4761, "text": "So I need to tone that down."}, {"time": 4764, "text": "There's also another really important mechanism in learning that's called metoplasticity."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "What that seems to be is a way that you change not the weights themselves, but the rate at which the weights change."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "So when I am in say a lecture hall and my, this is a potentially terrible cartoon example, but let's say I'm in a lecture hall and it's time to learn, right?"}, {"time": 4791, "text": "So my brain will release more, perhaps dopamine or some neuromodulator that's gonna change the rate at which synaptic plasticity occurs."}, {"time": 4802, "text": "So that can make me more sensitive to learning at certain times, more sensitive to overriding previous information and less sensitive at other times."}, {"time": 4810, "text": "And finally, as long as I'm rattling off the list, I think another concept that falls in the category of learning or memory adaptation is homeostasis or homeostatic adaptation, where neurons have the ability to control their firing rate."}, {"time": 4827, "text": "So if one neuron is just like blasting way too much, it will naturally tone itself down."}, {"time": 4833, "text": "Its threshold will adjust so that it stays in a useful dynamical range."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "And we see that that's captured in deep neural networks where you don't just change the synaptic weights, but you can also move the thresholds of simple neurons in those models."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "And so to achieve the spiking neural networks, you want to use, you want to implement the first principles that you mentioned of the temporal and the spatial fractal dynamics here."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "So you can communicate locally, you can communicate across much greater distances and do the same thing in space and do the same thing in time."}, {"time": 4878, "text": "Now, you have like a chapter called Superconducting Hardware for Neuromorphic Computing."}, {"time": 4884, "text": "So what are some ideas that integrate some of the things we've been talking about in terms of the first principles of neuromorphic computing and the ideas that you outline in optoelectronic intelligence?"}, {"time": 4898, "text": "Yeah, so let me start, I guess, on the communication side of things, because that's what led us down this track in the first place."}, {"time": 4907, "text": "By us, I'm talking about my team of colleagues at NIST, Saeed Han, Bryce Brimavera, Sonia Buckley, Jeff Chiles, Adam McCallum to name, Alex Tate to name a few, our group leaders, Saewoo Nam and Rich Mirren."}, {"time": 4921, "text": "We've all contributed to this."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "So this is not me saying necessarily just the things that I've proposed, but sort of where our team's thinking has evolved over the years."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "Can I quickly ask, what is NIST and where is this amazing group of people located?"}, {"time": 4938, "text": "NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology."}, {"time": 4943, "text": "The larger facility is out in Gaithersburg, Maryland."}, {"time": 4946, "text": "Our team is located in Boulder, Colorado."}, {"time": 4951, "text": "NIST is a federal agency under the Department of Commerce."}, {"time": 4956, "text": "We do a lot with, by we, I mean other people at NIST, do a lot with standards, making sure that we understand the system of units, international system of units, precision measurements."}, {"time": 4969, "text": "There's a lot going on in electrical engineering, material science."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "And it's historic."}, {"time": 4976, "text": "I mean, it's one of those, it's like MIT or something like that."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "It has a reputation over many decades of just being this really a place where there's a lot of brilliant people have done a lot of amazing things."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "But in terms of the people in your team, in this team of people involved in the concept we're talking about now, I'm just curious, what kind of disciplines are we talking about?"}, {"time": 4998, "text": "Mostly physicists and electrical engineers, some material scientists, but I would say, yeah, I think physicists and electrical engineers, my background is in photonics, the use of light for technology."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "So coming from there, I tend to have found colleagues that are more from that background."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "Although Adam McConn, more of a superconducting electronics background, we need a diversity of folks."}, {"time": 5024, "text": "This project is sort of cross disciplinary."}, {"time": 5026, "text": "I would love to be working more with neuroscientists and things, but we haven't reached that scale yet."}, {"time": 5034, "text": "You're focused on the hardware side, which requires all the disciplines that you mentioned."}, {"time": 5039, "text": "And then of course, neuroscientists may be a source of inspiration for some of the longterm vision."}, {"time": 5044, "text": "I would actually call it more than inspiration."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "I would call it sort of a roadmap."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "We're not trying to build exactly the brain, but I don't think it's enough to just say, oh, neurons kind of work like that."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "Let's kind of do that thing."}, {"time": 5060, "text": "I mean, we're very much following the concepts that the cognitive sciences have laid out for us, which I believe is a really robust roadmap."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "I mean, just on a little bit of a tangent, it's often stated that we just don't understand the brain."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "And so it's really hard to replicate it because we just don't know what's going on there."}, {"time": 5080, "text": "And maybe five or seven years ago, I would have said that, but as I got more interested in the subject, I read more of the neuroscience literature and I was just taken by the exact opposite sense."}, {"time": 5093, "text": "I can't believe how much they know about this."}, {"time": 5095, "text": "I can't believe how mathematically rigorous and sort of theoretically complete a lot of the concepts are."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "That's not to say we understand consciousness or we understand the self or anything like that, but what is the brain doing and why is it doing those things?"}, {"time": 5113, "text": "Neuroscientists have a lot of answers to those questions."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "So if you're a hardware designer that just wants to get going, whoa, it's pretty clear which direction to go in, I think."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "Okay, so I love the optimism behind that, but in the implementation of these systems that uses superconductivity, how do you make it happen?"}, {"time": 5139, "text": "So to me, it starts with thinking about the communication network."}, {"time": 5143, "text": "You know for sure that the ability of each neuron to communicate to many thousands of colleagues across the network is indispensable."}, {"time": 5152, "text": "I take that as a core principle of my architecture, my thinking on the subject."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "So coming from a background in photonics, it was very natural to say, okay, we're gonna use light for communication."}, {"time": 5165, "text": "Just in case listeners may not know, light is often used in communication."}, {"time": 5170, "text": "I mean, if you think about radio, that's light, it's long wavelengths, but it's electromagnetic radiation."}, {"time": 5175, "text": "It's the same physical phenomenon obeying exactly the same Maxwell's equations."}, {"time": 5180, "text": "And then all the way down to fiber, fiber optics."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "Now you're using visible or near infrared wavelengths of light, but the way you send messages across the ocean is now contemporary over optical fibers."}, {"time": 5193, "text": "So using light for communication is not a stretch."}, {"time": 5198, "text": "So you might ask, well, why don't you use light for communication in a conventional microchip?"}, {"time": 5205, "text": "And the answer to that is, I believe, physical."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "If we had a light source on a silicon chip that was as simple as a transistor, there would not be a processor in the world that didn't use light for communication, at least above some distance."}, {"time": 5221, "text": "How many light sources are needed?"}, {"time": 5224, "text": "Oh, you need a light source at every single point."}, {"time": 5226, "text": "A light source per neuron."}, {"time": 5228, "text": "Per neuron, per little, but then if you could have a really small and nice light source, your definition of neuron could be flexible."}, {"time": 5237, "text": "Could be, yes, yes."}, {"time": 5239, "text": "Sometimes it's helpful to me to say, in this hardware, a neuron is that entity which has a light source."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "That, and I can explain."}, {"time": 5247, "text": "And then there was light."}, {"time": 5249, "text": "I mean, I can explain more about that, but."}, {"time": 5252, "text": "Somehow this like rhymes with consciousness because people will often say the light of consciousness."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "So that consciousness is that which is conscious."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "That's not my quote."}, {"time": 5264, "text": "That's me, that's my quote."}, {"time": 5267, "text": "You see, that quote comes from my background."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "Yours is in optics, mine in light, mine's in darkness."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "So go ahead."}, {"time": 5276, "text": "So the point I was making there is that if it was easy to manufacture light sources along with transistors on a silicon chip, they would be everywhere."}, {"time": 5288, "text": "People have been trying for decades and it's actually extremely difficult."}, {"time": 5291, "text": "I think an important part of our research is dwelling right at that spot there."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "Is it physics or engineering?"}, {"time": 5299, "text": "So, okay, so it's physics, I think."}, {"time": 5302, "text": "So what I mean by that is, as we discussed, silicon is the material of choice for transistors and it's very difficult to imagine that that's gonna change anytime soon."}, {"time": 5315, "text": "Silicon is notoriously bad at emitting light."}, {"time": 5319, "text": "And that has to do with the immutable properties of silicon itself."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "The way that the energy bands are structured in silicon, you're never going to make silicon efficient as a light source at room temperature without doing very exotic things that degrade its ability to interface nicely with those transistors in the first place."}, {"time": 5339, "text": "So that's like one of these things where it's, why is nature dealing us that blow?"}, {"time": 5345, "text": "You give us these beautiful transistors and you give us all the motivation to use light for communication, but then you don't give us a light source."}, {"time": 5351, "text": "So, well, okay, you do give us a light source."}, {"time": 5354, "text": "Compound semiconductors, like we talked about back at the beginning, an element from group three and an element from group five form an alloy where every other lattice site switches which element it is."}, {"time": 5363, "text": "Those have much better properties for generating light."},

it, okay."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "However, I say it's physics, not engineering, because it's very difficult to get those compound semiconductor light sources situated with your silicon."}, {"time": 5387, "text": "In order to do that ion implantation that I talked about at the beginning, high temperatures are required."}, {"time": 5392, "text": "So you gotta make all of your transistors first and then put the compound semiconductors on top of there."}, {"time": 5398, "text": "You can't grow them afterwards because that requires high temperature."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "It screws up all your transistors."}, {"time": 5404, "text": "You try and stick them on there."}, {"time": 5405, "text": "They don't have the same lattice constant."}, {"time": 5407, "text": "The spacing between atoms is different enough that it just doesn't work."}, {"time": 5411, "text": "So nature does not seem to be telling us that, hey, go ahead and combine light sources with your digital switches for conventional digital computing."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "And conventional digital computing will often require smaller scale, I guess, in terms of like smartphone."}, {"time": 5430, "text": "So in which kind of systems does nature hint that we can use light and photons for communication?"}, {"time": 5440, "text": "Well, so let me just try and be clear."}, {"time": 5442, "text": "You can use light for communication in digital systems, just the light sources are not intimately integrated with the silicon."}, {"time": 5450, "text": "You manufacture all the silicon, you have your microchip, plunk it down."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "And then you manufacture your light sources, separate chip, completely different process made in a different foundry."}, {"time": 5460, "text": "And then you put those together at the package level."}, {"time": 5463, "text": "So now you have some, I would say a great deal of architectural limitations that are introduced by that sort of package level integration as opposed to monolithic on the same chip integration, but it's still a very useful thing to do."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "And that's where I had done some work previously before I came to NIST."}, {"time": 5484, "text": "There's a project led by Vladimir Stoyanovich that now spun out into a company called IR Labs led by Mark Wade and Chen Sun where they're doing exactly that."}, {"time": 5494, "text": "So you have your light source chip, your silicon chip, whatever it may be doing, maybe it's digital electronics, maybe it's some other control purpose, something."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "And the silicon chip drives the light source chip and modulates the intensity of the lights."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "You can get data out of the package on an optical fiber."}, {"time": 5512, "text": "And that still gives you tremendous advantages in bandwidth as opposed to sending those signals out over electrical lines."}, {"time": 5520, "text": "But it is somewhat peculiar to my eye that they have to be integrated at this package level."}, {"time": 5527, "text": "And those people, I mean, they're so smart."}, {"time": 5529, "text": "Those are my colleagues that I respect a great deal."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "So it's very clear that it's not just they're making a bad choice."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "This is what physics is telling us."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "It just wouldn't make any sense to try to stick them together."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "Yeah, so even if it's difficult, it's easier than the alternative, unfortunately."}, {"time": 5551, "text": "And again, I need to go back and make sure that I'm not taking the wrong way."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "I'm not saying that the pursuit of integrating compound semiconductors with silicon is fruitless and shouldn't be pursued."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "It should, and people are doing great work."}, {"time": 5563, "text": "Kai Mei Lau and John Bowers, others, they're doing it and they're making progress."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "But to my eye, it doesn't look like that's ever going to be just the standard monolithic light source on silicon process."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "I just don't see it."}, {"time": 5580, "text": "Yeah, so nature kind of points the way usually."}, {"time": 5582, "text": "And if you resist nature, you're gonna have to do a lot more work."}, {"time": 5585,

computing system that simulates all of our realities."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "It currently is Mantra Matrix 4."}, {"time": 5599, "text": "So this thing, this powerful computer, how does it operate?"}, {"time": 5604, "text": "So what are the neurons?"}, {"time": 5607, "text": "What is the communication?"}, {"time": 5610, "text": "All right, so let me now, after spending 45 minutes trashing light source integration with silicon, let me now say why I'm basing my entire life, professional life, on integrating light sources with electronics."}, {"time": 5624, "text": "I think the game is completely different when you're talking about superconducting electronics."}, {"time": 5629, "text": "For several reasons, let me try to go through them."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "One is that, as I mentioned, it's difficult to integrate those compound semiconductor light sources with silicon."}, {"time": 5641, "text": "With silicon is a requirement that is introduced by the fact that

ways."}, {"time": 5653, "text": "You're not using that silicon in precisely the same way for the electronics."}, {"time": 5657, "text": "You're now depositing superconducting materials on top of that."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "The prospects for integrating light sources with that kind of an electronic process are certainly less explored, but I think much more promising because you don't need those light sources to be intimately integrated with the transistors."}, {"time": 5676, "text": "That's where the problems come up."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "They don't need to be lattice matched to the silicon, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "Instead, it seems possible that you can take those compound semiconductor light sources, stick them on the silicon wafer, and then grow your superconducting electronics on the top of that."}, {"time": 5692, "text": "It's at least not obviously going to fail."}, {"time": 5695, "text": "So the computation would be done on the superconductive material as well?"}, {"time": 5700, "text": "Yes, the computation is done in the superconducting electronics, and the light sources receive signals that say, hey, a neuron reached threshold, produce a pulse of light, send it out to all your downstream synaptic connections."}, {"time": 5712, "text": "Those are, again, superconducting electronics."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "Perform your computation, and you're off to the races."}, {"time": 5719, "text": "Your network works."}, {"time": 5720, "text": "So then if we can rewind real quick, so what are the limitations of the challenges of superconducting electronics when we think about constructing these kinds of systems?"}, {"time": 5731, "text": "So actually, let me say one other thing about the light sources, and

you're at four Kelvin, silicon is not obviously a terrible light source."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "It's still not as efficient as compound semiconductors, but it might be good enough for this application."}, {"time": 5768, "text": "The final thing that I'll mention about that is, again, leveraging superconductors, as I said, in a different context, superconducting detectors can receive one single photon."}, {"time": 5779, "text": "In that conversation, I failed to mention that semiconductors can also receive photons."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "That's the primary mechanism by which it's

about, that they rely heavily on these superconducting loops."}, {"time": 6773, "text": "So even in a lot of forms of digital computing with superconductors, storing a signal in a superconducting loop is a primary technique."}, {"time": 6785, "text": "In this particular case, it's just loops everywhere you look."}, {"time": 6788, "text": "So the strength of a synaptic weight is gonna be set by the

"The coupling between, say, a synapse and a dendrite or a synapse in the neuron cell body occurs through loop coupling through transformers."}, {"time": 6813, "text": "So current circulating in a synapse is gonna induce current in a different loop, a receiving loop in the neuron cell body."}, {"time": 6820, "text": "So since all of the computation is happening in these flux storage loops and they play such a central role in how the information is processed, how memories are formed, all that stuff, I didn't think too much about it, I just called them loop neurons because it rolls off the tongue a little bit better than superconducting optoelectronic neurons."}, {"time": 6842, "text": "Okay, so how do you design circuits for these loop neurons?"}, {"time": 6849, "text": "There's a lot of different scales of design."}, {"time": 6852, "text": "So at the level of just one synapse, you can use conventional methods."}, {"time": 6858, "text": "They're not that complicated as far as superconducting electronics goes."}, {"time": 6863, "text": "It's just four Joseph's injunctions or something like that depending on how much complexity you wanna add."}, {"time": 6869, "text": "So

"text": "So you're just explicitly solving the differential equations that describe the circuit elements."}, {"time": 6884, "text": "And then you can stack these things together in that simulation software to then build circuits."}, {"time": 6888, "text": "You can, but that becomes computationally expensive."}, {"time": 6891, "text": "So one of the things when COVID hit, we knew we had to turn some attention to more things you can do at home in your basement or whatever, and one of them was computational modeling."}, {"time": 6902, "text": "So we started working on adapting, abstracting out the circuit performance so that you don't have to explicitly solve the circuit equations, which for Joseph's injunctions usually needs to be done on like a picosecond timescale and you have a lot of nodes in your circuit."}, {"time": 6921, "text": "So it results in a lot of differential equations that need to be solved simultaneously."}, {"time": 6926, "text": "We were looking for a way to simulate these circuits that is scalable up to networks of millions or so neurons is sort of where we're targeting right now."}, {"time": 6936, "text": "So we were able to analyze the behavior of these circuits."}, {"time": 6940, "text": "And as I said, it's based on these simple building blocks."}, {"time": 6943, "text": "So you really only need to understand this one building block."},

based on now it's one differential equation that you need to solve."}, {"time": 6957, "text": "So one differential equation for every synapse, dendrite or neuron in your system."}, {"time": 6963,

is a leaky integrator."}, {"time": 6973, "text": "So I'm really fascinated by how this one simple component can be used to achieve lots of different types of dynamical activity."}, {"time": 6984,

exactly what we're working with here."}, {"time": 7006, "text": "So it's a very exciting platform, both from a modeling perspective and from a hardware manifestation perspective where we can hopefully start to have this test bed where we can explore things, not just related to neuroscience, but also related to other things that connected to other physics like critical phenomenon, Ising models, things like that."}, {"time": 7028, "text": "So you were asking how we simulate these circuits."}, {"time": 7033, "text": "It's at different levels and we've got the simple spice circuit stuff."},

differential equation."}, {"time": 7047, "text": "And then we can also step through it on a much coarser time grid."}, {"time": 7050, "text": "So it ends up being something like a factor of a thousand

like that."}, {"time": 7065, "text": "And just like simulating quantum mechanical systems with a quantum computer."}, {"time": 7069, "text": "So the goal here is to understand such systems."},

possible."}, {"time": 7365, "text": "It's just, it's gonna have to get that performance."}, {"time": 7368, "text": "And this is sort of what you were asking about before is like how much better than

fast communication."}, {"time": 7485, "text": "The interesting aspect of Tesla is you have a company that at least at this time is so singularly focused on solving a particular machine learning

fine."}, {"time": 7745, "text": "Because that's not too much of an added cost."}, {"time": 7749, "text": "Most of your power is being dissipated by the circuits themselves, not the cooling."},

quantum gravity, other approaches to unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity, as you can read about in his most recent book, I believe, and he's been on your show as well."}, {"time": 8484,

role in it, what technology is doing here."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "But there's a couple more pieces that need to be set up first."}, {"time": 8502, "text": "So the beginning of our universe is largely accepted to be the big bang."}, {"time": 8507, "text": "And what that means is if you look back in time by looking far away in space, you see that everything used to be at one point and it expanded away from there."}, {"time": 8518, "text": "There was an era in the evolutionary process of our universe that was called inflation."}, {"time": 8525, "text": "And this idea was developed primarily by Alan Guth and others, Andre Linde and others in the 80s."}, {"time": 8533, "text": "And this idea of inflation is basically that when a singularity begins this process of growth, there can be a temporary stage where it just accelerates incredibly rapidly."}, {"time": 8550, "text": "And based on quantum field theory, this tells us that this should produce matter in precisely the proportions that we find of hydrogen and helium in the big bang, lithium too, lithium also, and other things too."}, {"time": 8564, "text": "So the predictions that come out of big bang inflationary cosmology have stood up extremely well to empirical verification, the cosmic microwave background, things like this."}, {"time": 8575, "text": "So most scientists working in the field think that the origin of our universe is the big bang."}, {"time": 8583, "text": "And I base all my thinking on that as well."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "I'm just laying this out there so that people understand that where I'm coming from is an extension, not a replacement of existing well founded ideas."}, {"time": 8599, "text": "In a paper, I believe it was 1986 with Alan Guth and another author Farhi, they

indistinguishable from a black hole."}, {"time": 8624, "text": "And Lee Smolin based his thinking on that idea, I believe, I don't mean to speak for him, but this is my reading of it."}, {"time": 8632, "text": "So what Lee Smolin will say is that a black hole in one universe is a big bang in another universe."}, {"time": 8640, "text": "And this allows us to have progeny, offspring."}, {"time": 8644, "text": "So a universe can be said to have come before another universe."}, {"time": 8650, "text": "And very crucially, Smolin argues, I think this is potentially one of the great ideas of all time, that's my opinion, that when a black hole forms, it's not a classical entity, it's a quantum gravitational entity."}, {"time": 8664, "text": "So it is subject to the fluctuations that are inherent in quantum mechanics, the properties, what we're calling the parameters that describe the physics of that system are subject to slight mutations so that the offspring universe does not have the exact same parameters defining its physics as its parent universe."}, {"time": 8688, "text": "They're close, but they're a little bit different."}, {"time": 8690, "text": "And so now you have a mechanism for evolution, for natural selection."}, {"time": 8697, "text": "So there's mutation, so there's, and then if you think about the DNA of the universe are the basic parameters that govern its laws."}, {"time": 8705, "text": "Exactly, so what Smolin said is our universe results from an evolutionary process that can be traced back some, he estimated, 200 million generations."}, {"time": 8717, "text": "Initially, there was something like a vacuum fluctuation that produced through random chance a universe that was able to reproduce just one."}, {"time": 8727, "text": "So now it had one offspring."}, {"time": 8728, "text": "And then over time, it was able to make more and more until it evolved into a highly structured universe with a very long lifetime, with a great deal of complexity and importantly, especially importantly for Lee Smolin, stars, stars make black holes."}, {"time": 8747, "text": "Therefore, we should expect our universe to be optimized, have its physical parameters optimized to make very large numbers of stars because that's how you make black holes and black holes make offspring."}, {"time": 8759, "text": "So we expect the physics of our universe to have evolved to maximize fecundity, the number of offspring."}, {"time": 8766, "text": "And the way Lee Smolin argues you do that is through stars that the biggest ones die in these core collapse supernova that make a black hole and a child."}, {"time": 8775, "text": "Okay, first of all, I agree with you that this is back to our fractal view of everything from intelligence to our universe."},

perspective here on earth, the evolution of those and then the evolution of the laws of physics that led to us."}, {"time": 8811, "text": "I mean, it's beautiful."}, {"time": 8812, "text": "And then you stacking on top of that, that maybe we are one of the offspring."}, {"time": 8817, "text": "Right, okay, so before getting into where I'd like to take that idea, let me just a little bit more groundwork."}, {"time": 8825, "text": "There is this concept of the multiverse and it can be confusing."}, {"time": 8828, "text": "Different people use the word multiverse in different ways."},

that, so let me ask there, whatever, I mean, broadly thinking, because we tend to think other alien civilizations would be very human like, but if we think of alien civilizations out there as

parameters that allow even microbial life to form are not just a fluke."}, {"time": 9984, "text": "But anyway, that aside, yes, then there was this long dormant period, not dormant, things were happening, but important things were happening for some two and a half billion years or something after the metabolic process that releases oxygen was developed."}, {"time": 10002, "text": "Then basically the planet's just sitting there, getting more and more oxygenated, more and more oxygenated until it's enough that you can build these large, complex organisms."}, {"time": 10014, "text":

problems and technique and repetition, here's a thing called toughness, mental toughness, something that maybe you or maybe even Iowa in general is a little bit known for."}, {"time": 975, "text": "So how do you train mental toughness as a coach?"}, {"time": 979, "text": "You train mental toughness by putting them in situations that they're willing to go through but don't think they can make it, and then they go through it, and then all of a sudden those berries are down."}, {"time": 991, "text": "Does that have to do with physical usually exhaustion, the four reps on the ropes?"}, {"time": 998, "text": "It has to do with that, and it has to do with understanding why we're doing it."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "And sometimes understanding why we're doing it might not come for months, but

asks a lot of questions, but he doesn't, and he's been here four months now, four and a half months now, and he's getting better every day."}, {"time": 1027, "text": "So mental toughness too is a matter of repetition."}, {"time": 1031, "text": "Mental toughness is a matter of repetition and having an open mind and being extremely accountable, and not only accountable that when you maybe, when something doesn't go your way, that you look in the mirror and own it, but accountable to the point of view that, you know what, I gotta get tough in this situation right here, right now, and this is what's gonna make or break me."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "And I talked about my own career being defined by, you know, a couple of minutes on the mat, but that's when you're gonna be defined."},

much?"}, {"time": 1090, "text": "How big of a concern is it?"}, {"time": 1091, "text": "I think peaking and burnout are frames of mind or burnout is a like you let things probably get to the point

at the end of the tunnel."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "I mean, you're good to go."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "So you think about Gable and that whole dream of being carried off the mat because you worked

other."}, {"time": 763, "text": "So you change one thing here, it has a recursive effect here, it changes something over there and it's quite hard to control."}, {"time": 772, "text": "Like there's a

there like a systematic process?"}, {"time": 1090, "text": "You've spoken about first principles thinking, but is there a kind of process to it?"}, {"time": 1094, "text": "Well, yeah, like saying like physics is a law and everything else is a recommendation."}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Like I've met a lot of people that can break the law, but I haven't met anyone who could break physics."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "So the first, for any kind of technology problem, you have to sort of just make sure you're not violating physics."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "And first principles analysis, I think, is something that can be applied to really any walk of life, anything really."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "It's really just saying, let's boil something down to the most fundamental principles."}, {"time": 1138, "text": "The things that we are most confident are true at a foundational level."}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And that sets your axiomatic base, and then you reason up from there, and then you cross check your conclusion against the axiomatic truths."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "So some basics in physics would be like, are you violating conservation of energy or momentum or something like that?"}, {"time": 1161, "text": "Then it's not gonna work."}, {"time": 1169, "text": "So that's just to establish, is it possible?"}, {"time": 1172, "text": "And another good physics tool is thinking about things in the limit."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "If you take a particular thing and you scale it to a very large number or to a very small number, how do things change?"}, {"time": 1185, "text": "Both like in number of things you manufacture or something like that, and then in time?"}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Yeah, like let's say take an example of like manufacturing, which I think is just a very underrated problem."}, {"time": 1200, "text": "And like I said, it's much harder to take an advanced technology product and bring it into volume manufacturing than it is to design it in the first place."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "My orders of magnitude."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "So let's say you're trying to figure out is like why is this part or product expensive?"}, {"time": 1223, "text": "Is it because of something fundamentally foolish that we're doing or is it because our volume is too low?"}, {"time": 1231, "text": "And so then you say, okay, well, what if our volume was a million units a year?"}, {"time": 1234, "text": "Is it still expensive?"}, {"time": 1235, "text": "That's what I mean by thinking about things in the limit."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "If it's still expensive at a million units a year, then volume is not the reason why your thing is expensive."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "There's something fundamental about the design."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "And then you then can focus on reducing the complexity or something like that in the design."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "You gotta change the design to change the part to be something that is not fundamentally expensive."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "But like that's a common thing in rocketry because the unit volume is relatively low."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "And so a common excuse would be, well, it's expensive because our unit volume is low."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "And if we were in like automotive or something like that, or consumer electronics, then our costs would be lower."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "I'm like, okay, so let's say now you're making a million units a year."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "If the answer is yes, then economies of scale are not the issue."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "Do you throw into manufacturing, do you throw like supply chain?"}, {"time": 1286, "text": "Talked about resources and materials and stuff like that."}, {"time": 1288, "text": "Do you throw that into the calculation of trying to reason from first principles, like how we're gonna make the supply chain work here?"}, {"time": 1295, "text": "And then the cost of materials, things like that."}, {"time": 1297, "text": "Or is that too much?"}, {"time": 1342, "text": "And that sets the asymptotic limit for how low the cost of the vehicle can be unless you change the materials."}, {"time": 1351, "text": "So, and then when you do that, I call it like maybe the magic one number or something like that."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "So that would be like, if you had the, like just a pile of these raw materials, again, you could wave the magic wand and rearrange the atoms into the final shape."}, {"time": 1367, "text": "That would be the lowest possible cost that you could make this thing for unless you change the materials."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So then, and that is almost always a very low number."}, {"time": 1377, "text": "So then what's actually causing things to be expensive is how you put the atoms into the desired shape."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "Yeah, actually, if you don't mind me taking a tiny tangent, I often talk to Jim Keller, who's somebody that worked with you as a friend."}, {"time": 1394, "text": "Jim was, yeah, did great work at Tesla."}, {"time": 1397, "text": "So I suppose he carries the flame with the same kind of thinking that you're talking about now."}, {"time": 1406, "text": "And I guess I see that same thing at Tesla and SpaceX folks who work there, they kind of learn this way of thinking and it kind of becomes obvious almost."}, {"time": 1416, "text": "But anyway, I had argument, not argument, but he educated me about how cheap it might be to manufacture a Tesla bot."}, {"time": 1426, "text": "We just, we had an argument."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "How can you reduce the cost of scale of producing a robot?"}, {"time": 1432, "text": "Because I've gotten the chance to interact quite a bit, obviously, in the academic circles with humanoid robots and then Boston Dynamics and stuff like that."}, {"time": 1441, "text": "And they're very expensive to build."}, {"time": 1444, "text": "And then Jim kind of schooled me on saying like, okay, like this kind of first principles thinking of how can we get the cost of manufacturing down?"}, {"time": 1453, "text": "I suppose you do that, you have done that kind of thinking for Tesla bot and for all kinds of complex systems that are traditionally seen as complex."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "And you say, okay, how can we simplify everything down?"}, {"time": 1467, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think if you are really good at manufacturing, you can basically make, at high volume, you can basically make anything for a cost that asymptotically approaches the raw material value of the constituents plus any intellectual property that you need to do license."}, {"time": 1490, "text": "It's not like that's a very hard thing to do, but it is possible for anything."}, {"time": 1494, "text": "Anything in volume can be made, like I said, for a cost that asymptotically approaches this raw material constituents plus intellectual property license rights."}, {"time": 1505, "text": "So what'll often happen in trying to design a product is people will start with the tools and parts and methods that they are familiar with and then try to create the product using their existing tools and methods."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "The other way to think about it is actually imagine the, try to imagine the platonic ideal of the perfect product or technology, whatever it might be."}, {"time": 1531, "text": "And say, what is the perfect arrangement of atoms that would be the best possible product?"}, {"time": 1538, "text": "And now let us try to figure out how to get

the only reusable rocket out there, but the booster comes back and lands, and you've seen the videos, and we get the nose cone fairing back, but we do not get the upper stage back."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "So that means that we have a minimum cost of building an upper stage."}, {"time": 2336, "text": "And you can think of like a two stage rocket of sort of like two airplanes, like a big airplane and a small airplane."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "And we get the big airplane back, but not the small airplane."}, {"time": 2345, "text": "And so it still costs a lot."}, {"time": 2347,

for, it's by far better than any rocket ever in history."}, {"time": 2381, "text": "But with full and rapid reusability, we can reduce the cost per ton to orbit by a factor of 100."}, {"time": 2391, "text": "But just think of it like, like imagine if you had an aircraft or something or a car."}, {"time": 2398, "text": "And if you had to buy a new car every time you went for a drive, that would be very expensive."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "It'd be silly, frankly."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "But in fact, you just refuel the car or recharge the car."}, {"time": 2413, "text": "And that makes your trip like, I don't know, a thousand times cheaper."}, {"time": 2420, "text": "So it's the same for rockets."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "If you, it's very difficult to make this complex machine that can go to orbit."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "And so if you cannot reuse it and have to throw even any part of, any significant part of it away, that massively increases the cost."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "So, you know, Starship in theory could do a cost per launch of like a million, maybe $2 million or something like that."}, {"time": 2446, "text": "And put over a hundred tons in orbit, which is crazy."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "So you're saying like it's by far the biggest bang for the buck is to make it fully reusable versus like some kind of brilliant breakthrough in theoretical physics."}, {"time": 2465, "text": "No, no, there's no, there's no brilliant break."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "No, there's no, just make the rocket reusable."}, {"time": 2471, "text": "This is an

philosophical fun question."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "Gotta ask, I know you're focused on getting to Mars, but once we're there on Mars, what do you, what form of government, economic system,

about the future."}, {"time": 2504, "text": "I know you're really focused about the short term engineering dream, but it's like, I don't know, there's something about imagining an actual civilization on Mars that gives people, really gives people hope."}, {"time": 2515, "text": "Well, it would be a new frontier and an opportunity to rethink the whole nature of government, just as was done in the creation of the United States."}, {"time": 2522, "text": "So, I mean, I would suggest having a direct democracy, people vote directly on things as opposed to representative democracy."}, {"time": 2538, "text": "So representative democracy, I think, is too subject to a special interest and a coercion of the politicians and that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2549, "text": "So I'd recommend that there was just direct democracy, people vote on laws, the population votes on laws themselves, and then the laws must be short enough that people can understand them."}, {"time": 2566, "text": "Yeah,

that."}, {"time": 2592, "text": "That's exactly how I feel."}, {"time": 2593, "text": "Why do they, why do they keep wanting me to accept it?"}, {"time": 2596, "text": "What do they want with this cookie?"}, {"time": 2599, "text": "Like somebody got upset with accepting cookies or something somewhere, who cares?"}, {"time": 2603, "text": "Like so annoying to keep accepting all these cookies."},

implementation of a good idea done really horribly."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "Yeah, it's somebody who was like, there's some good intentions of like privacy or whatever, but now everyone's just has to accept cookies and it's not, you know, you have billions of people who have to keep clicking accept cookie."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "It's super annoying."}, {"time": 2642, "text": "Then we just accept the damn cookie, it's fine."}, {"time": 2645, "text": "There is like, I think a fundamental problem that we're, because we've not really had a major, like a world war or something like that in a while."}, {"time": 2654, "text": "And obviously we would like to not have world wars."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "There's not been a cleansing function for rules and regulations."}, {"time": 2661, "text": "So wars did have, you know, some sort of aligning in that there would be a reset on rules and regulations after a war."}, {"time": 2669, "text": "So World Wars I and II, there were huge resets on rules and regulations."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "Now, if society does not have a war and there's no cleansing function or garbage collection for rules and regulations, then rules and regulations will accumulate every year because they're immortal."}, {"time": 2685, "text": "There's no actual, humans die, but the laws don't."}, {"time": 2688, "text": "So we need a garbage collection function for rules and regulations."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "They should not just be immortal because some of the rules and regulations that are put in place will be counterproductive, done with good intentions, but counterproductive."}, {"time": 2702, "text": "Sometimes not done with good intentions."}, {"time": 2703, "text": "So if rules and regulations just accumulate every year

thousands of little strings."}, {"time": 2719, "text": "And we see that in, you know, US and like basically all economies that have been around for a while and regulators and legislators create new

fight to not get it removed."}, {"time": 2757, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, I guess the problem with the constitution is it's kind of like C versus Java because it doesn't have any garbage collection built in."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "I think there should be, when you first said the metaphor of garbage collection, I loved it."}, {"time": 2770, "text": "Yeah, from a coding standpoint."}, {"time": 2772, "text": "From a coding standpoint, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "It would be interesting if the laws themselves kind of had a built in thing where they kind of die after a while unless somebody explicitly publicly defends them."}, {"time": 2783, "text": "So that's sort of, it's not like somebody has to kill them."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "They kind of die themselves."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "They disappear."}, {"time": 2792, "text": "Not to defend Java or anything, but you know, C++, you know, you could also have a great garbage collection in Python and so on."}, {"time": 2799, "text": "Yeah, so yeah, something needs to happen or just the civilization's arteries just harden over time and you can just get less and less done because there's just a rule against everything."}, {"time": 2814, "text": "So I think like, I don't know, for Mars or whatever, I'd say, or even for, you know, obviously for Earth as well, like I think there should be an active process for removing rules and regulations and questioning their existence."}, {"time": 2827, "text": "Just like if we've got a function for creating rules and regulations, because rules and regulations can also think of us like they're like software or lines of code for operating civilization."}, {"time": 2838, "text": "That's the rules and regulations."}, {"time": 2841, "text": "So it's not like we shouldn't have rules and regulations, but you have code accumulation, but no code removal."}, {"time": 2847, "text": "And so it just gets to become basically archaic bloatware after a while."}, {"time": 2853, "text": "And it's just, it makes it hard for things to progress."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "So I don't know, maybe Mars, you'd have like, you know, any given law must have a sunset, you know, and require active voting to keep it up there, you know."}, {"time": 2872, "text": "And I actually also say like, and these are just, I don't know, recommendations or thoughts, ultimately will be up to the people on Mars to decide."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "But I think it should be easier to remove a law than to add one because of the, just to overcome the inertia of laws."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "So maybe it's like, for argument's sake, you need like say 60% vote to have a law take effect, but only a 40% vote to remove it."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "So let me be the guy, you posted a meme on Twitter recently where there's like a row of urinals, and a guy just walks all the way across, and he tells you about crypto."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "I mean, that's happened to me

chance, we've talked about political systems on Mars, that Doge coin is the official currency of Mars at some point in the future?"}, {"time": 3022, "text": "Well, I think Mars itself will need to

is on a practical day to day basis because of PayPal."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "We really got in deep there."}, {"time": 3112, "text": "And right now, the money system, actually, for practical

information theory standpoint allows an economy to function the best."}, {"time": 3215, "text": "And, you know, crypto is an attempt to reduce the error in money that is contributed by governments

standpoint."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "So, it is perhaps useful to solve an aspect of the money database problem, which is the sort of store of wealth or an accounting of relative obligations, I

debt."}, {"time": 3446, "text": "Debt and equity shift obligations across time."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "Then what does the best job of that?"}, {"time": 3453, "text": "Part of the reason why I think there's some Merit Doge coin, even though it was obviously created as a joke, is that it actually does have a much higher transaction volume capability than Bitcoin."}, {"time": 3469, "text":

high."}, {"time": 3480, "text": "So, you could not use it effectively for most things."}, {"time": 3484, "text": "And nor could it even scale to a high volume."}, {"time": 3491, "text": "And when

years, it's like comically low."}, {"time": 3530, "text": "And I think there's some value to having a linear increase in the amount of currency that is generated."}, {"time": 3538, "text": "So, because some amount of the currency, like if a currency is too deflationary, or I should say, if a currency is expected to increase in value over time, there's reluctance to spend it."}, {"time": 3554, "text": "Because you're like, oh, I'll just hold it and not spend it because it's scarcity is increasing with time."}, {"time": 3559, "text": "So, if I spend it now, then I will regret spending it."}, {"time": 3562, "text": "So, I will just, you know, hodl it."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "But if there's some dilution of the currency occurring over time, that's more of an incentive to use it as a currency."}, {"time": 3571, "text": "So, those coins, somewhat randomly has just a fixed, a number of sort of coins or hash strings that are generated every year."}, {"time": 3586, "text": "So,

that."}, {"time": 3974, "text": "So, I mean, what it comes down to at the end of the day is to solve self driving, you basically need to recreate what humans do to drive, which is humans drive with optical sensors, eyes and biological neural nets."}, {"time": 3994, "text": "And so in order to, that's how the entire road system is designed to work with basically passive optical and neural nets, biologically."}, {"time": 4006, "text": "And now that we need to, so for actually for full self driving to work, we have to recreate that in digital form."}, {"time": 4012, "text": "So we have to,

4074, "text": "You have to figure out like what's involved in driving, like especially in all the different edge cases."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "And then, I mean, maybe you can comment on this, how much game theoretic kind of stuff needs to be involved at a four way stop sign."}, {"time": 4092, "text": "As humans, when we drive, our actions affect the world."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "Like it

hard part in this whole beautiful, complex problem?"}, {"time": 4130, "text": "So it's a lot of freaking software, man."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "A lot of smart lines of code."}, {"time": 4137, "text": "For sure, in order to have, create an accurate vector space."}, {"time": 4143, "text": "So like you're coming from image space, which is like this flow of photons, you're going to the camera,

and turn that bitstream into a vector space."}, {"time": 4184, "text": "By vector space, I mean like, you know, you've got cars and humans and lane lines and curves and traffic lights and that kind of thing."}, {"time": 4199, "text": "Once you've got all of that in your head, once you have an accurate vector space, the control problem is similar to that of a video game, like a Grand Theft Auto of

{"time": 4229, "text": "Having an accurate vector space is very difficult."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "Yeah, I think we humans don't give enough respect to how incredible the human perception system is to mapping the raw photons to the vector space representation in our heads."}, {"time": 4244, "text": "Your brain is doing an incredible amount of processing and giving you an image that is a very cleaned up image."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "Like when we look around here, we see, like you see color in the corners of your eyes, but actually your eyes have very few cones, like cone receptors in the peripheral vision."}, {"time": 4262, "text": "Your eyes are painting color in the peripheral vision."}, {"time": 4265, "text": "You don't realize it, but their eyes are actually painting color and your eyes also have like this blood vessels and all sorts of gnarly things and there's a blind spot, but do you see your blind spot?"}, {"time": 4276, "text": "No, your brain is painting in the missing, the blind spot."}, {"time": 4281, "text": "You're gonna do these things online where you look here and look at this point and then look at this point and if it's in your blind spot, your brain will just fill in the missing bits."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "The peripheral vision is so cool."}, {"time": 4295, "text": "It makes you realize all the illusions for vision sciences, so it makes you realize just how incredible the brain is."}, {"time": 4300, "text": "The brain is doing crazy amount of post processing on the vision signals for your eyes."}, {"time": 4309, "text": "And then even once you get all those vision signals, your brain is constantly trying to forget as much as possible."}, {"time": 4317, "text": "So human memory is, perhaps the weakest thing about the brain is memory."}, {"time": 4321, "text": "So because memory is so expensive to our brain and so limited, your brain is trying to forget as much as possible and distill the things that you see into the smallest amounts of information possible."}, {"time": 4336, "text": "So your brain is trying to not just get to a vector space, but get to a vector space that is the smallest possible vector space of only relevant objects."}, {"time": 4346, "text": "And I think you can sort of look inside your brain or at least I can, when you drive down the road and try to think about what your brain is actually doing consciously."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "And it's like you'll see a car, because you don't have cameras, I don't have eyes in the back of your head or a side."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "So you basically have like two cameras on a slow gimbal."}, {"time": 4380, "text": "And eyesight is not that great."}, {"time": 4381, "text": "Okay, human eyes are like, and people are constantly distracted and thinking about things and texting and doing all sorts of things they shouldn't do in a car, changing the radio station."}, {"time": 4390, "text": "So having arguments is like, so when's the last time you looked right and left and rearward, or even diagonally forward to actually refresh your vector space?"}, {"time": 4410, "text": "So you're glancing around and what your mind is doing is trying to distill the relevant vectors, basically objects with a position and motion."}, {"time": 4420, "text": "And then editing that down to the least amount that's necessary for you to drive."}, {"time": 4429, "text": "It does seem to be able to edit it down or compress it even further into things like concepts."}, {"time": 4435, "text": "So it's not, it's like it goes beyond, the human mind seems to go sometimes beyond vector space to sort of space of concepts to where you'll see a thing."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "It's no longer represented spatially somehow."}, {"time": 4447, "text": "It's almost like a concept that you should be aware of."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "Like if this is a school zone, you'll remember that as a concept, which is a weird thing to represent, but perhaps for driving, you don't need to fully represent those things."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "Or maybe you get those kind of indirectly."}, {"time": 4465, "text": "You need to establish vector space and then actually have predictions for those vector spaces."}, {"time": 4472, "text": "So if you drive past, say a bus and you see that there's people, before you drove past the bus, you saw people crossing or some, just imagine there's like a large truck or something blocking site."}, {"time": 4495, "text": "But before you came up to the truck, you saw that there were some kids about to cross the road in front of the truck."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "Now you can no longer see the kids, but you would now know, okay, those kids are probably gonna pass by the truck and cross the road, even though you cannot see them."}, {"time": 4512, "text": "So you have to have memory, you have to need to remember that there were kids there and you need to have some forward prediction of what their position will be at the time of relevance."}, {"time": 4525, "text": "So with occlusions and computer vision, when you can't see an object anymore, even when it just walks behind a tree and reappears, that's a really, really, I mean, at least in academic literature, it's tracking through occlusions, it's very difficult."}, {"time": 4540, "text": "Yeah, we're doing it."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "So some of it."}, {"time": 4544, "text": "It's like object permanence, like same thing happens with humans with neural nets."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "Like when like a toddler grows up, like there's a point in time where they develop, they have a sense of object permanence."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "So before a certain age, if you have a ball or a toy or whatever, and you put it behind your back and you pop it out, if they don't, before they have object permanence, it's like a new thing every time."}, {"time": 4565, "text": "It's like, whoa, this toy went poof, just fared and now it's back again and they can't believe it."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "And that they can play peekaboo all day long because peekaboo is fresh every time."}, {"time": 4573, "text": "But then we figured out object permanence, then they realize, oh no, the object is not gone, it's just behind your back."}, {"time": 4582, "text": "Sometimes I wish we never did figure out object permanence."}, {"time": 4586, "text": "Yeah, so that's a..."}, {"time": 4588, "text": "So that's an important problem to solve."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "Yes, so like an important evolution of the neural nets in the car is memory across both time and space."}, {"time": 4603, "text": "So now you can't remember, like you have to say, like how long do you want to remember things for?"}, {"time": 4608, "text": "And there's a cost to remembering things for a long time."}, {"time": 4613, "text": "So you can like run out of memory to try to remember too much for too long."}, {"time": 4618, "text": "And then you also have things that are stale if you remember them for too long."}, {"time": 4623, "text": "And then you also need things that are remembered over time."}, {"time": 4626, "text": "So even if you like say have like, for our good sake, five seconds of memory on a time basis, but like let's say you're parked at a light and you saw, use a pedestrian example, that people were waiting to cross the road and you can't quite see them because of an occlusion, but they might wait for a minute before the light changes for them to cross the road."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "You still need to remember that that's where they were and that they're probably going to cross the road type of thing."}, {"time": 4660, "text": "So even if that exceeds your time based memory, it should not exceed your space memory."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "And I just think the data engine side of that, so getting the data to learn all of the concepts that you're saying now is an incredible process."}, {"time": 4676, "text": "It's this iterative process of just, it's this hydranet of many."}, {"time": 4680, "text": "Hydranet."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "We're changing the name to something else."}, {"time": 4685, "text": "Okay,

times it's crazy."}, {"time": 4697, "text": "Oh, so every time there's a new major version, you'll rename it to something more ridiculous or memorable and beautiful, sorry."}, {"time": 4705, "text": "Not ridiculous, of course."}, {"time": 4708, "text": "If you see the full array of neural nets that are operating in the cars, it kind of boggles the mind."}, {"time": 4716, "text": "There's so many layers, it's crazy."}, {"time": 4723, "text": "And we started off with simple neural nets that were basically image recognition on a single frame from a single camera and then trying to knit those together with C, I should say we're really primarily running C here because C++ is too much overhead and we have our own C compiler."}, {"time": 4751, "text": "So to get maximum performance, we actually wrote our own C compiler and are continuing to optimize our C compiler for maximum efficiency."}, {"time": 4760, "text": "In fact, we've just recently done a new river on our C compiler that'll compile directly to our autopilot hardware."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "If you want to compile the whole thing down with your own compiler, like so efficiency here, because there's all kinds of compute, there's CPU, GPU, there's like basic types of things and you have to somehow figure out the scheduling across all of those things."}, {"time": 4780, "text": "And so you're compiling the code down that does all, okay."}, {"time": 4784, "text": "So that's why there's a lot of people involved."}, {"time": 4786, "text": "There's a lot of hardcore software engineering at a very sort of bare metal level because we're trying to do a lot of compute that's constrained to our full self driving computer."}, {"time": 4803, "text": "So we want to try to have the highest frames per second possible in a sort of very finite amount of compute and power."}, {"time": 4815, "text": "So we really put a lot of effort into the efficiency of our compute."}, {"time": 4823, "text": "And so there's actually a lot of work done by some very talented software engineers at Tesla that at a very foundational level to improve the efficiency of compute and how we use the trip accelerators, which are basically, you know, doing matrix math dot products, like a bazillion dot products."}, {"time": 4847, "text": "And it's like, what are neural nets?"}, {"time": 4849, "text": "It's like compute wise, like 99% dot products."}, {"time": 4857, "text": "And you want to achieve as many high frame rates like a video game."}, {"time": 4860, "text": "You want full resolution, high frame rate."}, {"time": 4865, "text": "High frame rate, low latency, low jitter."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "So I think one of the things we're moving towards now is no post processing of the image through the image signal processor."}, {"time": 4886, "text": "So like what happens for cameras is that, almost all cameras is they, there's a lot of post processing done in order to make pictures look pretty."}, {"time": 4900, "text": "And so we don't care about pictures looking pretty."}, {"time": 4903, "text": "We just want the data."}, {"time": 4905, "text": "So we're moving just raw photon counts."}, {"time": 4908, "text": "So the system will, like the image that the computer sees is actually much more than what you'd see if you represented it on a camera."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "It's got much more data."}, {"time": 4920, "text": "And even in a very low light conditions, you can see that there's a small photon count difference between this spot here and that spot there, which means that, so it can see in the dark incredibly well because it can detect these tiny differences in photon counts."}, {"time": 4936, "text": "Like much better than you could possibly imagine."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "So, and then we also save 13 milliseconds on a latency."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "From removing the post processing on the image?"}, {"time": 4952, "text": "It's like, it's incredible."}, {"time": 4954, "text": "Cause we've got eight cameras and then there's roughly, I don't know, one and a half milliseconds or so, maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency for each camera."}, {"time": 4966, "text": "And so like going to just, basically bypassing the image processor gets us back 13 milliseconds of latency, which is important."}, {"time": 4979, "text": "And we track latency all the way from, you know, photon hits the camera to, you know, all the steps that it's got to go through to get, you know, go through the various neural nets and the C code."}, {"time": 4993, "text": "And there's a little bit of C++ there as well."}, {"time": 4997, "text": "Well, I can maybe a lot, but it, the core stuff is heavy duty computers all in C. And so we track that latency all the way to an output command to the drive unit to accelerate the brakes just to slow down the steering, you know, turn left or right."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "So, cause you go to output a command that's got to go to a controller."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "And like some of these controllers have an update frequency that's maybe 10 Hertz or something like that, which is slow."}, {"time": 5027, "text": "That's like now you lose a hundred milliseconds potentially."}, {"time": 5030, "text": "So, so then we want to update the, the drivers on the like say steering and braking control to have more like a hundred Hertz instead of 10 Hertz."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "And then you've got a 10 millisecond latency instead of a hundred millisecond worst case latency."}, {"time": 5046, "text": "And actually jitter is more of a challenge than latency."}, {"time": 5049, "text": "Cause latency is like, you can, you can, you can anticipate and predict, but if you're, but if you've got a stack up of things going from the camera to the, to the computer through then a series of other computers, and finally to an actuator on the car, if you have a stack up of tolerances of timing tolerances, then you can have quite a variable latency, which is called jitter."}, {"time": 5070, "text": "And, and that makes it hard to, to, to anticipate exactly what, how you should turn the car or accelerate, because if you've got maybe a hundred, 50, 200 milliseconds of jitter, then you could be off by, you know, up to 0.2 seconds."}, {"time": 5085, "text": "And this can make, this could make a big difference."}, {"time": 5087, "text": "So you have to interpolate somehow to, to, to, to deal with the effects of jitter."}, {"time": 5092, "text": "So that you can make like robust control decisions."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "You have to, so the jitters and the sensor information, or the jitter can occur at any stage in the pipeline."}, {"time": 5105, "text": "You can, if you have just, if you have fixed latency, you can anticipate and, and like say, okay, we know that our information is for argument's sake, 150 milliseconds stale."}, {"time": 5119, "text": "Like, so for, for, for 150 milliseconds from photon second camera to where you can measure a change in the acceleration of the vehicle."}, {"time": 5133, "text": "So then, then you can say, okay, well, we're going to enter, we know it's 150 milliseconds."}, {"time": 5139, "text": "So we're going to take that into account and, and compensate for that latency."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "However, if you've got then 150 milliseconds of latency plus a hundred milliseconds of jitter, that's which could be anywhere from zero, zero to a hundred milliseconds on top."}, {"time": 5152, "text": "So, so then your latency could be from 150 to 250 milliseconds."}, {"time": 5155, "text": "Now you've got a hundred milliseconds that you don't know what to do with."}, {"time": 5158, "text": "And that's basically random."}, {"time": 5161, "text": "So getting rid of jitter is extremely important."}, {"time": 5164, "text": "And that affects your control decisions and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 5169, "text": "Yeah, the car's just going to fundamentally maneuver better with lower jitter."}, {"time": 5173, "text": "The cars will maneuver with superhuman ability and reaction time much faster than a human."}, {"time": 5180, "text": "I mean, I think over time the autopilot, full self driving will be capable of maneuvers that are far more than what like James Bond could do in like the best movie type of thing."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "That's exactly what I was imagining in my mind, as you said it."}, {"time": 5200, "text": "It's like an impossible maneuvers that a human couldn't do."}, {"time": 5205, "text": "Well, let me ask sort of looking back the six years, looking out into the future, based on your current understanding, how hard do you think this, this full self driving problem, when do you think Tesla will solve level four FSD?"}, {"time": 5221, "text": "I mean, it's looking quite likely that it will be next year."}, {"time": 5225, "text": "And what does the solution look like?"}, {"time": 5227, "text": "Is it the current pool of FSD beta candidates, they start getting greater and greater as they have been degrees of autonomy, and then there's a certain level beyond which they can do their own, they can read a book."}, {"time": 5245, "text": "I mean, you can see that anybody who's been following the full self driving beta closely will see that the rate of disengagements has been dropping rapidly."}, {"time": 5257, "text": "So like disengagement be where the driver intervenes to prevent the car from doing something dangerous, potentially, so."}, {"time": 5269, "text": "So the interventions per million miles has been dropping dramatically at some point."}, {"time": 5277, "text": "And that trend looks like it happens next year is that the probability of an accident on FSD is less than that of the average human, and then significantly less than that of the average human."}, {"time": 5293, "text": "So it certainly appears like we will get there next year."}, {"time": 5301, "text": "Then of course, then there's gonna be a case of, okay, well, we now have to prove this to regulators and prove it to, you know, and we want a standard that is not just equivalent to a human, but much better than the average human."}, {"time": 5313, "text": "I think it's gotta be at least two or three times two or three times higher safety than a human."}, {"time": 5319, "text": "So two or three times lower probability of injury than a human before we would actually say like, okay, it's okay to go, it's not gonna be equivalent, it's gonna be much better."}, {"time": 5328, "text": "So if you look, FSD 10.6 just came out recently, 10.7 is on the way, maybe 11 is on the way, so we're in the future."}, {"time": 5338, "text": "Yeah, we were hoping to get 11 out this year, but 11 actually has a whole bunch of fundamental rewrites on the neural net architecture, and some fundamental improvements in creating vector space, so."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "There is some fundamental like leap that really deserves the 11, I mean, that's a pretty cool number."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "Yeah, 11 would be a single stack for all, you know, one stack to rule them all."}, {"time": 5376, "text": "But there are just some really fundamental neural net architecture changes that will allow for much more capability, but at first they're gonna have issues."}, {"time": 5391, "text": "So like we have this working on like sort of alpha software and it's good, but it's basically taking a whole bunch of C, C++ code and leading a massive amount of C++ code and replacing it with a neural net."}, {"time": 5406, "text": "And Andre makes this point a lot, which is like neural nets are kind of eating software."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "Over time there's like less and less conventional software, more and more neural net, which is still software, but it's, you know, still comes out the lines of software, but it's more neural net stuff and less, you know, heuristics basically."}, {"time": 5433, "text": "More matrix based stuff and less heuristics based stuff."}, {"time": 5438, "text": "And, you know, like one of the big changes will be, like right now the neural nets will deliver a giant bag of points to the C++ or C and C++ code."}, {"time": 5460, "text": "We call it the giant bag of points."}, {"time": 5463, "text": "And it's like, so you've got a pixel and something associated with that pixel."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "Like this pixel is probably car."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "The pixel is probably lane line."}, {"time": 5473, "text": "Then you've got to assemble this giant bag of points in the C code and turn it into vectors."}, {"time": 5481, "text": "And it does a pretty good job of it, but it's, we want to just, you know, we need another layer of neural nets on top of that to take the giant bag of points and distill that down to a vector space in the neural net part of the software, as opposed to the heuristics part of the software."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "This is a big improvement."}, {"time": 5511, "text": "Neural nets all the way down."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "It's not even all neural nets, but this will be just a, this is a game changer to not have the bag of points, the giant bag of points that has to be assembled with many lines of C++ and have the, and have a neural net just assemble those into a vector."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "So the neural net is outputting much, much less data."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "It's outputting, this is a lane line."}, {"time": 5542, "text": "This is a curb."}, {"time": 5543, "text": "This is drivable space."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "This is a car."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "This is a pedestrian or a cyclist or something like that."}, {"time": 5549, "text": "It's outputting, it's really outputting proper vectors to the C, C++ control code, as opposed to the sort of constructing the vectors in C, which we've done, I think, quite a good job of, but we're kind of hitting a local maximum on how well the C can do this."}, {"time": 5579, "text": "So this is really a big deal."}, {"time": 5582, "text": "And just all of the networks in the car need to move to surround video."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "There's still some legacy networks that are not surround video."}, {"time": 5591, "text": "And all of the training needs to move to surround video and the efficiency of the training, it needs to get better and it is."}, {"time": 5598, "text": "And then we need to move everything to raw photon counts as opposed to processed images, which is quite a big reset on the training because the system's trained on post processed images."}, {"time": 5615, "text": "So we need to redo all the training to train against the raw photon counts instead of the post processed image."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "So ultimately, it's kind of reducing the complexity of the whole thing."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "So reducing the... Lines of code will actually go lower."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "So you're doing fusion of all the sensors and reducing the complexity of having to deal with these... Fusion of the cameras."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "Fusion of the cameras, really."}, {"time": 5643, "text": "Same with humans."}, {"time": 5645, "text": "Well, I guess we've got ears too."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "Yeah, we'll actually need to incorporate sound as well because you need to listen for ambulance sirens or fire trucks or somebody yelling at you or something."}, {"time": 5661, "text": "There's a little bit of audio that needs to be incorporated as well."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "Do you need to go back for a break?"}, {"time": 5666, "text": "Yeah, sure, let's take a break."}, {"time": 5668, "text": "Honestly, frankly, the ideas are the easy thing and the implementation is the hard thing."}, {"time": 5675, "text": "The idea of going to the moon is the easy part."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "Not going to the moon is the hard part."}, {"time": 5679, "text": "It's the hard part."}, {"time": 5680, "text": "And there's a lot of hardcore engineering that's got to get done at the hardware and software level."}, {"time": 5686, "text": "Like I said, optimizing the C compiler and just cutting out latency everywhere."}, {"time": 5695, "text": "If we don't do this, the system will not work properly."}, {"time": 5699, "text": "So the work of the engineers doing this, they are like the unsung heroes, but they are critical to the success of the situation."}, {"time": 5708, "text": "I think you made it clear."}, {"time": 5709, "text": "I mean, at least to me, it's super exciting."}, {"time": 5711, "text": "Everything that's going on outside of what Andre is doing."}, {"time": 5715, "text": "Just the whole infrastructure, the software."}, {"time": 5717, "text": "I mean, everything is going on with Data Engine, whatever it's called."}, {"time": 5721, "text": "The whole process is just work of art to me."}, {"time": 5724, "text": "The sheer scale of it boggles my mind."}, {"time": 5726, "text": "Like the training, the amount of work done with, like we've written all this custom software for training and labeling and to do auto labeling."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "Auto labeling is essential."}, {"time": 5738, "text": "Because especially when you've got surround video, it's very difficult."}, {"time": 5742, "text": "To label surround video from scratch is extremely difficult."}, {"time": 5748, "text": "Like take a human such a long time to even label one video clip, like several hours."}, {"time": 5754, "text": "Or the auto label, basically we just apply heavy duty, like a lot of compute to the video clips to preassign and guess what all the things are that are going on in the surround video."}, {"time": 5769, "text": "And then there's like correcting it."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "And then all the human has to do is like tweet, like say, adjust what is incorrect."}, {"time": 5776, "text": "This is like increases productivity by in fact a hundred or more."}, {"time": 5782, "text": "So you've presented Tesla Bot as primarily useful in the factory."}, {"time": 5785, "text": "First of all, I think humanoid robots are incredible."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "From a fan of robotics, I think the elegance of movement that humanoid robots, that bipedal robots show are just so cool."}, {"time": 5798, "text": "So it's really interesting that you're working on this and also talking about applying the same kind of all the ideas, some of which we've talked about with Data Engine, all the things that we're talking about with Tesla Autopilot, just transferring that over to just yet another robotics problem."}, {"time": 5814, "text": "I have to ask, since I care about human robot interaction, so the human side of that."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "So you've talked about mostly in the factory."}, {"time": 5821, "text": "Do you see part of this problem that Tesla Bot has to solve is interacting with humans and potentially having a place like in the home."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "So interacting, not just not replacing labor, but also like, I don't know, being a friend or an assistant or something like that."}, {"time": 5838, "text": "Yeah, I think the possibilities are endless."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "It's not quite in Tesla's primary mission direction of accelerating sustainable energy, but it is an extremely useful thing that we can do for the world, which is to make a useful humanoid robot that is capable of interacting with the world and helping in many different ways."}, {"time": 5869, "text": "I think if you say extrapolate to many years in the future, I think work will become optional."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "There's a lot of jobs that if people weren't paid to do it, they wouldn't do it."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "It's not fun necessarily."}, {"time": 5894, "text": "If you're washing dishes all day, it's like, you know, even if you really like washing dishes, you really want to do it for eight hours a day every day."}, {"time": 5905, "text": "And then there's like dangerous work."}, {"time": 5907, "text": "And basically, if it's dangerous, boring, it has like potential for repetitive stress injury, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 5914, "text": "Then that's really where humanoid robots would add the most value initially."}, {"time": 5920, "text": "So that's what we're aiming for is for the humanoid robots to do jobs that people don't voluntarily want to do."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "And then we'll have to pair that obviously with some kind of universal basic income in the future."}, {"time": 5940, "text": "So do you see a world when there's like hundreds of millions of Tesla bots doing different, performing different tasks throughout the world?"}, {"time": 5952, "text": "Yeah, I haven't really thought about it that far into the future, but I guess there may be something like that."}, {"time": 5960, "text": "Can I ask a wild question?"}, {"time": 5962, "text": "So the number of Tesla cars has been accelerating."}, {"time": 5965, "text": "There's been close to two million produced."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "Many of them have autopilot."}, {"time": 5970, "text": "I think we're over two million now."}, {"time": 5972, "text": "Do you think there will ever be a time when there will be more Tesla bots than Tesla cars?"}, {"time": 5982, "text": "Actually, it's funny you asked this question, because normally I do try to think pretty far into the future, but I haven't really thought that far into the future with the Tesla bot, or it's codenamed Optimus."}, {"time": 5995, "text": "I call it Optimus subprime."}, {"time": 5999, "text": "It's not like a giant transformer robot."}, {"time": 6007, "text": "But it's meant to be a general purpose, helpful bot."}, {"time": 6014, "text": "And basically, like the things that we're basically like, like, Tesla, I think is the has the most advanced real world AI for interacting with the real world, which are developed as a function of to make self driving work."}, {"time": 6030, "text": "And so along with custom hardware and like a lot of, you know, hardcore low level software to have it run efficiently and be power efficient because it's one thing to do neural nets if you've got a gigantic server room with 10,000 computers."}, {"time": 6045, "text": "But now let's say you just you have to now distill that down into one computer that's running at low power in a humanoid robot or a car."}, {"time": 6053, "text": "That's actually very difficult."}, {"time": 6054, "text": "A lot of hardcore software work is required for that."}, {"time": 6059, "text": "So since we're kind of like solving the navigate the real world with neural nets problem for cars, which are kind of robots with four wheels, then it's like kind of a natural extension of that is to put it in a robot with arms and legs and actuators."}, {"time": 6080, "text": "So like the two hard things are like you basically need to make the have the robot be intelligent enough to interact in a sensible way with the environment."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "So you need real world AI and you need to be very good at manufacturing, which is a very hard problem."}, {"time": 6104, "text": "Tesla is very good at manufacturing and also has the real world AI."}, {"time": 6110, "text": "So making the humanoid robot work is basically means developing custom motors and sensors that are different from what a car would use."}, {"time": 6124, "text": "But we've also we have I think we have the best expertise in developing advanced electric motors and power electronics."}, {"time": 6135, "text": "So it just has to be for humanoid robot application on a car."}, {"time": 6142, "text": "Still, you do talk about love sometimes."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "This isn't like for like sex robots or something like that."}, {"time": 6149, "text": "Love is the answer."}, {"time": 6153, "text": "There is something compelling to us, not compelling, but we connect with humanoid robots or even like robots like with the dog and shapes of dogs."}, {"time": 6163, "text": "It just it seems like, you know, there's a huge amount of loneliness in this world."}, {"time": 6168, "text": "All of us seek companionship with other humans, friendship and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 6172, "text": "We have a lot of here in Austin, a lot of people have dogs."}, {"time": 6176, "text": "There seems to be a huge opportunity to also have robots that decrease the amount of loneliness in the world or help us humans connect with each other."}, {"time": 6189, "text": "So in a way that dogs can."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "Do you think about that with TeslaBot at all?"}, {"time": 6194, "text": "Or is it really focused on the problem of performing specific tasks, not connecting with humans?"}, {"time": 6203, "text": "I mean, to be honest, I have not actually thought about it from the companionship standpoint, but I think it actually would end up being it could be actually a very good companion."}, {"time": 6214, "text": "And it could develop like a personality over time that is that is like unique, like, you know, it's not like they're just all the robots are the same and that personality could evolve to be, you know, match the owner or the, you know, yes, the owner."}, {"time": 6239, "text": "Well, whatever you want to call it."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "The other half, right?"}, {"time": 6245, "text": "In the same way that friends do."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "See, I think that's a huge opportunity."}, {"time": 6249, "text": "Yeah, no, that's interesting."}, {"time": 6254, "text": "Because, you know, like there's a Japanese phrase I like, Wabi Sabi, you know, the subtle imperfections are what makes something special."}, {"time": 6263, "text": "And the subtle imperfections of the personality of the robot mapped to the subtle imperfections of the robot's human friend."}, {"time": 6274, "text": "I don't know, owner sounds like maybe the wrong word, but could actually make an incredible buddy, basically."}, {"time": 6282, "text": "In that way, the imperfections."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "Like R2D2 or like a C3PO sort of thing, you know."}, {"time": 6286, "text": "So from a machine learning perspective, I think the flaws being a feature is really nice."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "You could be quite terrible at being a robot for quite a while in the general home environment or in general world."}, {"time": 6300, "text": "And that's kind of adorable."}, {"time": 6302, "text": "And that's like, those are your flaws and you fall in love with those flaws."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "So it's very

quickly."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "That's the controversial thing about him, I think."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "I guess he thought like even children had sexual desires, that they're like dealing

they're even all primal drives."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "The moralistic drives, they're taught, and they're taught in ways that ultimately relate back to survival, and you could even say, selfish

drives and desires, and they interrelate to each other, they involve different aspects of the brain and the history of the person, and actions and choices come out of the result of that overall

you think, I mean, you have Daniel Kahneman with System One and System Two."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "There's just these very compelling categorizations of the human mind that seem to be sticky in

in terms of deeper understanding of how the mind actually works?"}, {"time": 3239, "text": "You know, it's from modern neuroscience, whenever we seem to get closer to addressing a question like this

made?"}, {"time": 3300, "text": "Well?"}, {"time": 3302, "text": "Yeah, at one level, you might think, how excited would Jung have been to see this or Freud or the early psychoanalyst to see where this starts."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "But it's not so simple because an emerging theme in very recent neuroscience, literally over the last few years, is that things sort of all start together all across the brain."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "And so you can be recording from the cortex, this rim of cells at the surface of the brain, or you can be recording deeper in a structure called the striatum, which is a little older."}, {"time": 3334, "text": "It's more tightly linked to action."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "And then structures called the thalamus, other parts of the brain."},

farther away."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "Because that often is the feeling until you're actually there."}, {"time": 3398, "text": "So like, you know, see that's when I'm running and I know there's only a mile left, it just feels like that mile is just getting longer and longer, but eventually you finish."}, {"time": 3410, "text": "So maybe we're getting close to cracking open these beginnings

say we shouldn't generalize or make absolutist statements, but I would say right now, the reason things are looking even harder to crack than we had initially thought, we now have the data streams

regions or locations."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "And let's get a few questions on that."}, {"time": 3474, "text": "Is the answer, high level question by your intuition, is the answer within the data?"}, {"time": 3481, "text": "Or do we need different kind of data?"}, {"time": 3484, "text": "So we should also say that when you collect data about the brain, there's like the richness of information you're collecting, but there's also human doing stuff."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "And information, so static information about the human and dynamic information about the human and you can get them to do different stuff and you can select different humans and that's part of the collection of data aspect."}, {"time": 3510, "text": "So like when you're collecting data about the brain, there's some truths that you can, you know, in machine learning is like annotations, like supervised learning."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "There's some true things you can hold on to before you look at

testing becomes very valuable because then instead of just passively observing, well, here are the activity patterns and then here's the choice made by the animal."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "As we've gotten more powerful at reaching in and causing things to happen in the brain, turning up or down the activity of certain types of cells or defined populations of cells and seeing how that affects actions, these causal perturbations have turned out to be very valuable."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "We're just now getting to the point where we can apply these in very wide swaths of the brain at cellular resolution and so we're gonna be able, hopefully to make some headway on this question with causality and that's the one thing that optogenetics provides us this way of using light that we develop to control cells."}, {"time": 3612, "text": "This is an untapped, relatively untapped at this broad brain wide scale and hopefully we can get there in the near future."}, {"time": 3618,

really powerful because you get to, I mean, as opposed to collecting data passively, you get your collecting data actively."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "So can you maybe describe one of the many things you're known for, one of the big things is called optogenetics, what is it?"}, {"time": 3643, "text": "Optogenetics is a way of causing things to happen."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "It's a way of determining what actually matters in terms of the activity of the brain for the amazing things it does, sensation, cognition, action."}, {"time": 3658, "text": "And what it does is it provides activity."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "It's a way of playing in, if you will, activity patterns into precisely defined cells."}, {"time": 3667, "text": "And the way we do it is pretty cool, I think."},

stream of activity into this cell and that cell and that cell but not these other cells?"}, {"time": 3723, "text": "Yeah, so if you could, exactly, so if you could turn on or off the brain or parts of the brain or cell types or individual cells at the natural rate and rhythm and timing of normal brain activity, that would be immensely valuable because you could determine what actually mattered, what could cause complex things to happen and what could prevent complex things from happening in a specific way."}, {"time": 3747, "text": "But right away, you've got a problem if you wanna do this

wanna do this kind of thing and you imagine like, how do I get inside the brain?"}, {"time": 3802, "text": "It's pretty difficult."}, {"time": 3804, "text": "It's pretty difficult and then even once you get in, it's hard because all brain cells are electrical, all neurons are electrically activated."}, {"time": 3811, "text": "And so if you wanted to use electricity as what you were putting in,

regulate the respiratory rate changes, the breathing changes of fear and anxiety."}, {"time": 10672, "text": "So we know when we're in a state of fear and anxiety, we need, we cope better if we have

there in the pons too, right next to the lacrimal duct, the tear gland neurons."}, {"time": 10692, "text": "And so almost certainly this fear anxiety induced crying arose from a very slightly

they're not bullshitting you."}, {"time": 10819, "text": "And so that was what made, presumably, that tear recruitment so powerful, is it just landed in this very high value real estate for social communication."}, {"time": 10829, "text": "If it had gone to, you know, there's a lot of neurons in the pons that control movement of large muscles elsewhere, that would have been much less effective

10850, "text": "And because it was coming from the fear and anxiety circuits that regulate that necessary involuntary change in heart rate and respiratory rate, it also was involuntary and that became valuable as a truth signal, as social beings."}, {"time": 10865, "text": "So very interesting when you think about the origins of the human family, the origins of social structures and our ability and

that make us, it's like the sense of self that you talked about in the mice."}, {"time": 10936, "text": "Maybe it's a subset of those cells that are just creating a richer sense of self and that's it."}, {"time": 10942, "text": "So this is a great question."}, {"time": 10946, "text": "All neuroscientists think about this and a lot of non neuroscientists too."}, {"time": 10949, "text": "It's the reason a lot of people came to the study of the brain is to think about consciousness and not just being awake or alert but really what's sometimes called the hard problem of consciousness which is
