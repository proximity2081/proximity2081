"text": "And that's a very plausible theory."}, {"time": 321, "text": "It's just that there's no evidence for it."}, {"time": 323, "text": "And the nature of the interaction is, do most people kind of suggest this at the wet markets?"}, {"time": 329, "text": "So the interaction of the humans with the animal is in the form of it's either a live animal as being sold to be eaten or a recently live animal, but newly dead animal being sold to be eaten."}, {"time": 341, "text": "That's certainly one very possible possibility, a possible possibility, I don't know if that's a word."}, {"time": 348, "text": "But the people who believe in the wet market origin, that's what they're saying."}, {"time": 352, "text": "So they had one of these animals, they were cutting it up, let's say, in a market and maybe some of the blood got into somebody's, maybe had a cut on their hand or maybe it was aerosolized and so somebody breathed it."}, {"time": 365, "text": "And then that virus found this new host and that was the human host."}, {"time": 371, "text": "But you could also have that happen in, let's say, a farm."}, {"time": 374, "text": "So it's happened in the past that let's say that there are farms and because of human encroachment into wild spaces, we're pushing our farms and our animal farms further and further into what used to be just natural habitats."}, {"time": 390, "text": "And so it's happened in the past, for example, that there were bats roosting over pig pens and the bat droppings went into the pig pens."}, {"time": 398, "text": "The viruses in those droppings infected the pigs and then the pigs infected the humans."}, {"time": 405, "text": "And that's why it's a plausible theory."}, {"time": 408, "text": "It's just that there's basically no evidence for it."}, {"time": 411, "text": "If it was the case that SARS CoV2 comes from this type of interaction, as in most of the at least recent past outbreaks, we'd see evidence of that."}, {"time": 423, "text": "Viruses are messy."}, {"time": 425, "text": "They're constantly undergoing Darwinian evolution and they're changing and it's not that they're just ready for prime time, ready to infect humans on day one."}, {"time": 433, "text": "Normally you can trace the viral evolution prior to the time when it infects humans."}, {"time": 440, "text": "But for SARS CoV2, it just showed up on the scene ready to infect humans."}, {"time": 446, "text": "And there's no history that anybody has found so far of that kind of viral evolution."}, {"time": 453, "text": "With the first SARS, you could track it by the genome sequencing that it was experimenting."}, {"time": 459, "text": "And SARS CoV2 was very, very stable, meaning it had already adapted to humans by the time it interacted with us."}, {"time": 469, "text": "It's fully adapted."}, {"time": 470, "text": "So with SARS, there's a rapid evolution when it first kind of hooks onto a human."}, {"time": 478, "text": "Yeah, because it's trying."}, {"time": 479, "text": "Like a virus, its goal is to survive and replicate."}, {"time": 482, "text": "Yeah, no, it's true."}, {"time": 483, "text": "It's like, oh, we're gonna try this."}, {"time": 485, "text": "We'll try it exactly like a startup."}, {"time": 488, "text": "And so we don't see that."}, {"time": 490, "text": "And so there are some people who say, well, one hypothesis is you have a totally isolated group of humans, maybe in Southern China, which is more than a thousand miles away from Wuhan."}, {"time": 502, "text": "And maybe they're doing their animal farming right next to these areas where there are these horseshoe bats."}, {"time": 511, "text": "And maybe in this totally isolated place that no one's ever heard of, they're not connected to any other place, one person gets infected."}, {"time": 520, "text": "And it doesn't spread to anybody else because they're so isolated."}, {"time": 524, "text": "They're like, I don't know."}, {"time": 525, "text": "I can't even imagine that this is the case."}, {"time": 528, "text": "Then somebody gets in a car and drives all night, more than a thousand miles through crappy roads to get to Wuhan, doesn't stop for anything, doesn't infect anybody on the way."}, {"time": 539, "text": "No one else in that person's village infects anyone."}, {"time": 541, "text": "And then that person goes straight to the Huanan seafood market, according to this, in my mind, not very credible theory, and then unloads his stuff and everybody gets infected."}, {"time": 552, "text": "And they're only delivering those animals to the Wuhan market, which doesn't even sell very many of these kinds of animals that are likely intermediate species and not anywhere else."}, {"time": 563, "text": "So that's, I mean, it's a little bit of a straw man, but on top of that, the Chinese have sequenced more than 80,000 animal samples, and there's no evidence of this type of viral evolution that we would otherwise expect."}, {"time": 577, "text": "Let's try to, at this moment, steel man the argument for the natural origin of the virus."}, {"time": 586, "text": "So just to clarify, so Wuhan is actually, despite what it might sound like to people, is a pretty big city."}, {"time": 593, "text": "There's a lot of people that live in it."}, {"time": 595, "text": "11 million."}, {"time": 595, "text": "So not only is there, at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, there's other centers that do work on viruses, but there's also a giant number of markets."}, {"time": 606, "text": "And everything we're talking about here is pretty close together."}, {"time": 609, "text": "So when I kind of look at the geography of this, I think when you zoom out, it's all Wuhan, but when you zoom in, there's just a lot of interesting dynamics that could be happening and what the cases are popping up and what's being reported, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 624, "text": "So I think the people that argue for the natural origin, and there's a few recent papers that come out arguing this, it's kind of fascinating to watch this whole thing, but I think what they're arguing is that there's this Hunan market that's one of the major markets, the wet markets in Wuhan, that there's a bunch of cases that were reported from there."}, {"time": 678, "text": "So people who argue against this say that this is a later stage already."}, {"time": 684, "text": "So he says no, he says this is the epicenter, and this is a clear evidence, circumstantial evidence, but evidence nevertheless that this is where the jump happened to humans, the big explosion, maybe not case zero, I don't know if he argues that, but the early cases."}, {"time": 707, "text": "So what do you make of this whole idea?"}, {"time": 709, "text": "Can you steel man it before we talk about the alternative?"}, {"time": 712, "text": "And my goal here isn't to attack people on the other side, and my feeling is if there is evidence that's presented that should change my view, I hope that I'll be open minded enough to change my view."}, {"time": 726, "text": "And certainly Michael Warby is a thoughtful person, a respected scientist, and I think this work is contributive work, but I just don't think that it's as significant as has been reported in the press."}, {"time": 742, "text": "And so what his argument is, is that there is an early cluster in December of 2019 around the Huanan seafood market."}, {"time": 753, "text": "And even though he himself argues that the original breakthrough case, the original case, the index case where the first person infected happened earlier, happened in October or November, so not in December."}, {"time": 769, "text": "His argument is, well, what are the odds that you would have this number, this cluster of cases in the Huanan seafood market, and if the origin happened someplace else, wouldn't you expect other clusters?"}, {"time": 783, "text": "And it's not an entirely implausible argument, but there are reasons why I think that this is not nearly as determinative as has been reported."}, {"time": 792, "text": "And I certainly had a lot of, I and others had tweeted a lot about this."}, {"time": 797, "text": "And that is first, the people who were infected in this cluster, it's not the earliest known virus of the SARS CoV2, it began mutating."}, {"time": 808, "text": "So this is, it's not the original SARS CoV2 there."}, {"time": 811, "text": "So it had to have happened someplace else."}, {"time": 814, "text": "Two, the people who were infected in the market weren't infected in the part of the market where they had these kinds of animals that are considered to be candidates as an intermediary species."}, {"time": 829, "text": "And third, there was a bias, and actually I'll have four things."}, {"time": 833, "text": "Third, there was a bias in the early assessment in China of what they were looking for."}, {"time": 839, "text": "They were asked, did you have exposure to the market?"}, {"time": 842, "text": "Because I think in the early days when people were figuring things out, that was one of the questions that was asked."}, {"time": 848, "text": "And fourth, and probably most significantly, we have so little information about those early cases in China, and that's really unfortunate."}, {"time": 858, "text": "I know we'll talk about this later because the Chinese government is preventing access to all of that information, which they have, which could easily help us get to the bottom, at least know a ton more about how this pandemic started."}, {"time": 871, "text": "And so this is, it's like grasping at straws in the dark with gloves on."}, {"time": 879, "text": "But to steel man the argument, we have this evidence from this market, and yes, the Chinese government has turned off the lights essentially, so we have very little data to work with, but this is the data we have."}, {"time": 893, "text": "So who's to say that this data doesn't represent a much bigger data set that a lot of people got infected at this market where even at the parts, or especially at the parts where the infected meat was being sold?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "So that could be true, and it probably is true."}, {"time": 913, "text": "The question is, is this the source?"}, {"time": 916, "text": "Is this the place where this began?"}, {"time": 918, "text": "Or was this just a place where it was amplified?"}, {"time": 922, "text": "And I certainly think that it's extremely likely that the Huanan seafood market was a point of amplification."}, {"time": 931, "text": "And it's just answering a different question."}, {"time": 933, "text": "Basically what you're saying is it's very difficult to use the market as evidence for anything because it's probably not even the starting point."}, {"time": 942, "text": "So it's just a good place for it to continue spreading."}, {"time": 945, "text": "That's certainly my view."}, {"time": 947, "text": "What Michael Warby's argument is, Marco, is that, well, what are the odds of that?"}, {"time": 953, "text": "That we're seeing this amplification in the market."}, {"time": 957, "text": "And if we, let me put it this way."}, {"time": 960, "text": "If we had all of the information, if the Chinese government hadn't blocked access to all of this, because there's blood bank information, there's all sorts of information, and based on a full and complete understanding, we came to believe that all of the early cases were at this market."}, {"time": 979, "text": "I think that would be a stronger argument than what this is so far."}, {"time": 983, "text": "But everything leads to the fact that why is it that the Chinese government, which was, frankly, after a slow start, the gold standard of doing viral tracking for SARS 1, why have they apparently done so little and shared so little?"}, {"time": 1001, "text": "I think it asks, it begs a lot of questions."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "Okay, so let's then talk about the Chinese government."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "There's several governments, right?"}, {"time": 1011, "text": "So one is the local government of Wuhan."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And not just the Chinese government."}, {"time": 1016, "text": "Let's talk about government."}, {"time": 1019, "text": "No, let's talk about human nature."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "Let's just keep zooming out."}, {"time": 1023, "text": "Let's talk about planet Earth."}, {"time": 1024, "text": "No, so there's the Wuhan local government."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "There's the Chinese government led by Xi Jinping."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "And there's governments in general."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "I'm trying to empathize."}, {"time": 1038, "text": "So my father was involved with Chernobyl."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "I'm trying to put myself into the mind of local officials, of people who are like, oh shit, there's a potential catastrophic event happening here and it's my ass because there's incompetence all over the place."}, {"time": 1059, "text": "Yeah, human nature is such that there's incompetence all over the place and you're always trying to cover it up."}, {"time": 1064, "text": "And so given that context, I want to lay out all the possible incompetence, all the possible malevolence, all the possible geopolitical tensions here."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "All right, where in your sense did the coverup start?"}, {"time": 1086, "text": "So there's this suspicious fact, it seems like that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had a public database of thousands of sampled bad coronavirus sequences and that went offline in September of 2019."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "So let me talk about that specific and then I'll also follow your path of zooming out and it's a really important."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "Is that a good starting point?"}, {"time": 1115, "text": "It's a great starting point, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "So but there's a bigger story but let me talk about that."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "So the Wuhan Institute of Virology and we can go into the whole history of the Wuhan Institute of Virology either now or later because I think it's very relevant to the story but let's focus for now on this database."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "They had a database of 22,000 viral samples and sequence information about viruses that they had collected."}, {"time": 1145, "text": "Some of which, the collection of some of which was supported through funding from the NIH, not a huge NIH through the EcoHealth Alliance."}, {"time": 1152, "text": "It's a relatively small amount, $600,000 but not nothing."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "The goal of this database was so that we could understand viral evolution so that exactly for this kind of moment where we had an unknown virus, we could say, well, is this like anything that we've seen before?"}, {"time": 1173, "text": "And that would help us both understand what we're facing and be better able to respond."}, {"time": 1179, "text": "So this was a password protected public access database."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "In 2019, in September 2019, it became inaccessible and then the whole, a few months later, the entire database disappeared."}, {"time": 1195, "text": "What the Chinese have said is that because there were all kinds of computer attacks on this database but why would that happen in September 2019 before the pandemic, at least as far as we know."}, {"time": 1211, "text": "So just to clarify."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "It went down to September 2019 just so we get the year straight."}, {"time": 1219, "text": "January 2020 is when the virus really started getting the press."}, {"time": 1225, "text": "So we're talking about December 2019, a lot of early infections happened."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "September 2019 is when this database goes down."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "Just to clarify because you said it quickly, the Chinese government said that their database was getting hacked."}, {"time": 1244, "text": "Therefore, Xu Zhengli, the director of this part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "Oh really, she was the one that said it?"}, {"time": 1253, "text": "She was the one who said it."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Oh boy, I did not even know that part."}, {"time": 1257, "text": "Well, she's an interesting character."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "We'll talk about her."}, {"time": 1260, "text": "So the excuse is that it's getting cyber attacked a lot so we're gonna take it down without any further explanation which seems very suspicious."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "And then this virus starts to emerge in October, November, December."}, {"time": 1277, "text": "There's a lot of argument about that, but after."}, {"time": 1279, "text": "Sorry to interrupt, but some people are saying that the first outbreak could have happened as early as September."}, {"time": 1285, "text": "I think it's more likely it's October, November, but for the people who are saying that the first outbreak, the first incident of a known outbreak, at least to somebody, happened in September, they make the argument, well, what if that also happened in mid September of 2019?"}, {"time": 1302, "text": "I'm not prepared to go there, but there are some people who make that argument."}, {"time": 1340, "text": "CYA, yeah."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "Yeah, and then coming up with really shady excuses."}, {"time": 1345, "text": "It's like you're in a relationship and your girlfriend wants to see your phone, and you're like, I'm sorry, I'm just getting attacked by the Russians now."}, {"time": 1353, "text": "The cyber security issue, I can't."}, {"time": 1355, "text": "Yeah, I wish I could."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "I wish I could, it's just unsafe right now."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "So would it be okay if I give you my kind of macro view of the whole information space and why I believe this has been so contentious?"}, {"time": 1370, "text": "If I had to give my best guess, and I underline the word guess of what happened, and your background, your family background with Chernobyl I think is highly relevant here."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "So after the first SARS, there was a recognition that we needed to distribute knowledge about virology and epidemiology around the world, that people in China and Africa and Southeast Asia, they were the frontline workers, and they needed to be doing a lot of the viral monitoring and assessment so that we could have an early alarm system."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "And that was why there was a lot of investment in all of those places in building capacity and training people and helping to build institutional capacity."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "And the Chinese government, they recognized that they needed to ramp things up."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "And then the World Health Organization and the World Health Assembly, they had their international health regulations that were designed to create a stronger infrastructure."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So that was the goal."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "There were a lot of investments, and I know we'll talk later about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and I won't go into that right now."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "So there was all of this distributed capacity."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "And so in the early days, there's a breakout in Wuhan."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "We don't know, is it September, October, November?"}, {"time": 1450, "text": "Maybe December is when the local authorities start to recognize that something's happening."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "But at some point in late 2019, local officials in Wuhan understand that something is up."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "And exactly like in Chernobyl, these guys exist within a hierarchical system, and they are going to be rewarded if good things happen, and they're going to be in big trouble if bad things happen under their watch."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "So their initial instinct is to squash it."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And my guess is they think, well, if we squash this information, we can most likely beat back this outbreak, because lots of outbreaks happen all the time, including of SARS 1, where there was multiple lab incidents out of a lab in Beijing."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "And so they start their coverup on day one."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "They start screening social media."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "They send nasty letters to different doctors and others who are starting to speak up."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "But then it becomes clear that there's a bigger issue."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "And then the national government of China, again, this is just a hypothesis, the national government gets involved."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "They say, all right, this is getting much bigger."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "They go in and they realize that we have a big problem on our hands."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "They relatively quickly know that it's spreading human to human."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "And so the right thing for them to do then is what the South African government is doing now is to say, we have this outbreak."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "We don't know everything, but we know it's serious."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "We need help."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "But that's not the instinct of people in most governments and certainly not in authoritarian governments like China."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "And so the national government, they have a choice at that point."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "They can do option one, which is what we would hear called the right thing, which is total transparency."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "They criticize the local officials for having this coverup."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "And they say, now we're going to be totally transparent."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "But what does that do in a system like the former Soviet Union, like China now?"}, {"time": 1570, "text": "If local officials say, wait a second, I thought my job was to cover everything up, to support this alternative reality that authoritarian systems need in order to survive."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "Well, now I'm gonna be held accountable for if I'm not totally transparent, like your whole system would collapse."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "So the national government, they have that choice and their only choice according to the logic of their system is to be all in on a coverup."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "And that's why they block the World Health Organization from sending its team to Wuhan for over three weeks."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "They overtly lie to the World Health Organization about human to human transmission."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "And then they begin their coverups."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "So they begin very, very quickly destroying samples, hiding records, they start imprisoning people for asking basic questions."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Soon after they establish a gag order, preventing Chinese scientists from writing or saying anything about pandemic origins without prior government approval."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "And what that does means that there isn't a lot of data, there's not nearly enough data coming out of China."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "And so lots of responsible scientists outside of China who are data driven say, well, I don't have enough information to draw conclusions."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "And then into that vacuum step a relatively small number of largely virologists, but also others, respected scientists."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "And I know we'll talk about the, I think, infamous Peter Daszak who say, well, without any real foundation in the evidence, they say, we know pretty much this comes from nature and anyone who's raising the possibility of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "So that message starts to percolate."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "And then in the United States, we have Donald Trump and he's starting to get criticized for America's failure to respond, prepare for and respond adequately to the outbreak."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "And so he starts saying, well, I know first after praising Xi Jinping, he starts saying, well, I know that China did it and the WHO did it and he's kind of pointing fingers at everybody but himself."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "And then we have a media here that had shifted from the traditional model of he said, she said journalism, so and so said X and so and so said Y and then we'll present both of those views."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "With Donald Trump, he would make outlandish starting positions."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "So he would say, Lex is an ax murderer."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And then in the early days, they would say, Lex is an ax murderer, Lex's friend says he's not an ax murderer and we have a four day debate, is he or isn't he?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "And then at day four, someone would say, why are we having this debate at all?"}, {"time": 1746, "text": "Because the original point is just is baseless."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And so the media just got in the habit, here's what Trump said and here's why it's wrong."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "It's very complicated to figure out what is the role of a politician?"}, {"time": 1761, "text": "What is the role of a leader in this kind of game of politics?"}, {"time": 1765, "text": "But certainly in when there's a tragedy, when there's a catastrophic event, what it takes to be a leader is to see clearly through the fog and to make big bold decisions that does speak to the truth of things."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "And even if it's unpopular truth, to listen to the people, to listen to all sides, to the opinions, to the controversial ideas and to see past all the bullshit, all the political bullshit and just speak to the people, speak to the world and make bold, big decisions."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "That's probably what was needed in terms of leadership."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "And I'm not so willing to criticize whether it's Joe Biden or Donald Trump on this."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "I think most people cannot be great leaders, but that's why when great leaders step up, we write books about them."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "And even though, I mean, I think of myself as a progressive person, I certainly was a critic of a lot of what President Trump did."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "But on this particular case, even though he may have said it in an uncouth way, Donald Trump was actually, in my view, right."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "I mean, when he said, hey, let's look at this lab."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "I mean, he said, I have evidence, I can't tell you."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "I don't think he even had the evidence."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "But his intuition that this probably comes from a lab, in my view was a correct intuition."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "And certainly I started speaking up about pandemic origins early in 2019."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "And my friends, my democratic friends were brutal with me saying, what are you doing?"}, {"time": 1869, "text": "You're supporting Trump in an election year."}, {"time": 1871, "text": "And I said, just because Donald Trump is saying something doesn't mean that I need to oppose it."}, {"time": 1877, "text": "If Donald Trump says something that I think is correct, well, I wanna say it's correct, just

here."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "And I think in many ways it's a human story."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "It's a story of politics, it's a story of human nature."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "But let's talk about the story of the virus."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "And let's talk about the Wuhan Institute of Virology."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "So maybe this is a good time to try to talk about its history, about its origins, about what kind of stuff it works on, about biosafety levels, and about Batwoman."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "Yeah, Xu Zhengli, yes."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "Xu Zhengli."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "So what is the Wuhan Institute of Virology, when did it start?"}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Yeah, so it's a great question."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "So after SARS 1, which was in the early 2000, 2003, 2004, there was this effort to enhance, as I mentioned before, global capacity, including in China."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been around for decades before then."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "But there was an agreement between the French and the Chinese governments to build the largest BSL4 lab, BSL4 lab, so biosafety level four."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "So in these what are called high containment labs, there's level four, which is the highest level."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "And people have seen that on TV and elsewhere, where you have the people in the different suits and all of these protections."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "And then there's level three, which is still very serious, but not as much as level four."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "And then level two is just kind of goggles and some gloves and maybe a face mask, much less."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "So the French and the Chinese governments agreed that France would help build the first and still the largest BSL4 plus some mobile BSL3 labs."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "And they were going to do it in Wuhan."}, {"time": 2002, "text": "And Wuhan is kind of like China's Chicago."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "And I had actually been, it's a different story."}, {"time": 2006, "text": "I'd been in Wuhan relatively not that long before the pandemic broke out."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "And that was why I knew that Wuhan, it's not some backwater where there are a bunch of yokels eating bats for dinner every night."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "This is a really sophisticated, wealthy, highly educated and cultured city."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And so I knew that it wasn't like that even the one on seafood market wasn't like some

"I'm gonna have to talk to you about some of the, including the Wuhan market, just some of the wild food going on here."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "Because you've traveled that part of the world."},

2101, "text": "And it was going to be with French standards, and there were going to be 50 French experts who were going to work there and supervise the work that happened even after the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the new location started operating."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "And he said, we can't support, we have no idea what this is, whether it's safe or not."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "And when this lab opened, remember it was supposed to have 50 French experts, it had one French expert."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "And so the French were really disgusted."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "And actually when the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its new location opened in 2018, two things happened."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "One, French intelligence privately approached US intelligence saying, we have a lot of concerns about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, about its safety, and we don't even know who's operating there, is it being used as a dual use facility?"}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And also in 2018, the US embassy in Beijing sent some people down to Wuhan to go and look at, well, at this laboratory."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "And they wrote a scathing cable that Josh Rogin from the Washington Post later got his hands on saying, this is really unsafe, they're doing work on dangerous bat coronaviruses in conditions where a leak is possible."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "And so then you mentioned Shujing Li, and I'll connect that to these virologists who I was talking about."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "So there's a very credible thesis that because these pathogenic outbreaks happen in other parts of the world, having partnerships with experts in those parts of the world must be a foundation of our efforts."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "We can't just bring everything home because we know that viruses don't care about borders and boundaries, and so if something happens there, it's going to come here."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "So very correctly, we have all kinds of partnerships with experts in these labs, and Shujing Li was one of those partners."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "And her closest relationship was with Peter Daszak, who's a British, I think now American, but the president of a thing called EcoHealth Alliance, which was getting money from NIH."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "And basically, EcoHealth Alliance was a pass through organization."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "And over the years, it was only about $600,000."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "So almost all of her funding came from the Chinese government, but there's a little bit that came from the United States."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "And so she became their kind of leading expert and the point of contact between the Wuhan Institute of Virology and certainly Peter Daszak, but also with others."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "And that was why in the earliest days of the outbreak, I didn't mention that, I did mention that there were these virologists who had this fake certainty that they knew it came from nature and it didn't come from a lab and they called people like me conspiracy theorists just for raising that possibility."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "But when Peter Daszak was organizing that effort in February of 2020, what he said is we need to rally behind our Chinese colleagues."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "And the basic idea was these international collaborations are under threat."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "And I think it was because of that, because Peter Daszak's basically his major contribution as a scientist was just tacking his name on work that Shujang Li had largely done."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "He was defending a lot, certainly for himself and his organization."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "So you think EcoHealth Alliance and Peter is less about money, it's more about kind of almost like legacy because you're so attached to this work?"}, {"time": 2366, "text": "Is it just on a human level?"}, {"time": 2369, "text": "I mean, I've been criticized for being actually, I'm certainly a big critic of Peter Daszak, but I've been criticized by some for being too lenient."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "I mean, it's so easy to say, oh, somebody they're like an evil ogre and just trying to do evil and cackling in their closet or whatever."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "But I think for most of us, even those of us who do terrible, horrible things, the story that we tell ourselves and we really believe is that we're doing the thing that we most believe in."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "I mean, I did my PhD dissertation on the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "They genuinely saw themselves as idealists."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "They thought, well, we need to make radical change to build a better future."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "And what they described as, that they felt was radical change was a monstrous atrocities by us."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "So the criticism here of Peter is that he was a part of an organization that was kind of, well, funding an effort that was an unsafe implementation of a biosafety level four laboratory."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "So what he thought he was doing was, and then what he thought he was doing is itself highly controversial because there's one there that in 2011, there were, I know you've talked about this with other guests, but in 2011, there were the first published papers on this now infamous gain of function research."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "And basically what they did, both in different labs and certainly in the United States, in Wisconsin and in the Netherlands, was they had a bird flu virus that was very dangerous, but not massively transmissive."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "And they had a gain of function process through what's called serial passage, which means basically passing advice, like natural selection, but forcing natural selection by just passing a virus through different cell cultures and then selecting for what it is that you want."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "So relatively easily, they took this deadly, but not massively transmissive virus and turned it into, in a lab, a deadly and transmissive virus."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "And that showed that this is really dangerous."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "And so there were, at that point, there was a huge controversy."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "There were some people, like Richard Ebright and Mark Lipsitch at Harvard, who were saying that this is really dangerous."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "We're in the idea that we need to create monsters to study monsters."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "I think maybe even you have said that in the past."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "It doesn't make sense because there's an unlimited number of monsters."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "And so what are we gonna do?"}, {"time": 2545, "text": "Create an unlimited number of monsters."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And if we do that, eventually the monsters are going to get out."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "Then there was the Peter Daszak camp, and he got a lot of funding, particularly from the United States, who said, well, and certainly Collins and Fauci were supportive of this."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "And they thought, well, there's a safe way to go out into the world to collect the world's most dangerous viruses and to poke and prod them to figure out how they might mutate, how they might become more dangerous with the goal of predicting future pandemics."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "And that certainly never happened with the goal of creating vaccines and treatments."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "And that largely never happened, but that was, so Peter Daszak kind of epitomized that second approach."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "And as you've talked about in the past, in 2014, there was a funding moratorium in the United States, and then in 2017, that was lifted."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "It didn't affect the funding that went to the EcoHealth Alliance."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "So when this happened in the beginning, and again, coming back to Peter's motivations, I don't think, here's the best case scenario for Peter."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "I'm gonna give you what I imagine he was thinking, and then I'll tell you what I actually think."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "So I think here's what he's thinking."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "This is most likely a natural origin outbreak."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "Just like SARS one, again, in Peter's hypothetical mind, just like SARS one, this is most likely a natural outbreak."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "We need to have an international coalition in order to fight it."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "If we allow these political attacks to undermine our Chinese counterparts and the trust in these relationships that we've built over many years, we're really screwed because they have the most local knowledge of these outbreaks."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "That's a strong, positive discussion because it's true that there's a lot of political BS and a lot of kind of just bickering and lies as we've talked about."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "And so it's very convenient to say, you know what?"}, {"time": 2721, "text": "Let's just ignore all of these quote unquote lies and my favorite word, misinformation."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "And then because the way out from this serious pandemic is for us to work together."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "So let's strengthen our partnerships and everything else is just like noise."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "Yeah, so let's, and so then now I wanna do my personal indictment of Peter Daszak because that's my view, but I wanted to fairly."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "Because I think that we all tell ourselves stories and also when you're a science communicator, you can't in your public communications give every doubt that you have or every nuance, you kind of have to summarize things."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "And so I think that he was, again, in this benign interpretation trying to summarize in the way that he thought the conversations should go."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "Here's my indictment of Peter Daszak."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "And I feel like a Brutus here, but I have not come here to praise Peter Daszak because while Peter Daszak was doing all of this and making all of these statements about, well, we pretty much know it's a natural origin."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "Then there was this February, 2020 Lancet letter where it turns out, and we only knew this later that he was highly manipulative."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "So he was recruiting all of these people."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "He drafted the infamous letter calling people like me, conspiracy theorists."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "He then wrote to people like Ralph Barak and Linfa Wang, who are also very high profile virologists saying, well, let's not put our names on it."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "So it doesn't look like we're doing it, even though they were doing it."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "He didn't disclose a lot of information that they had."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "It was a strategic move."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "So just in case people are not familiar, February, 2020, Lancet letter was TLDR, is a lab leak hypothesis, is a conspiracy theory."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "Essentially, yes."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "So like with the authority of science, not saying like it's highly likely, saying it's obvious, duh, it's natural origin."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "Everybody else is just, everything else is just misinformation."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "And look, there's a bunch of really smart people that signed this, therefore it's true."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "Yeah, not only that, so there were the people who, 27 people signed that letter."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "And then after President Trump cut funding to EcoHealth Alliance, then he organized 77 Nobel laureates to have a public letter criticizing that."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "But what Peter knew then that we didn't fully know is that in March of 2018, EcoHealth Alliance, in partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and others, had applied for a $14 million grant to DARPA, which is kind of like the VC side of the venture capital side of the Defense Department."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "They're kind of, where they do kind of big ideas."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "By the way, as a tiny tangent, I've gotten a lot of funding from DARPA."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "They fund a lot of excellent robotics research."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "And DARPA is incredible."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "And among the things that they applied for is that we, meaning Wuhan Institute of Virology, is gonna go and it's gonna collect the most dangerous bat coronaviruses in Southern China."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "And then we, as this group, are going to genetically engineer these viruses to insert a furin cleavage site."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "So I think when everyone's now seen the image of the SARS CoV2 virus, it has these little spike proteins, these little things that stick out, which is why they call it a coronavirus."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "Within that spike protein are these furin cleavage sites, which basically help with the virus getting access into our cells."}, {"time": 2958, "text": "And they were going to genetically engineer these furin cleavage sites into these bat coronaviruses, the serbicoviruses."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "And then, and so then a year and a half later, what do we see?"}, {"time": 2971, "text": "We see a bat coronavirus with a furin cleavage site unlike anything that we've ever seen before in that category of SARS like coronaviruses."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "That, well, yes, I mean, the DARPA very correctly didn't support that application."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "Well, let's actually, let's like pause on that."}, {"time": 2993, "text": "So for a lot of people, that's like the smoking gun."}, {"time": 2996, "text": "Okay, let's talk about this 2018 proposal to DARPA."}, {"time": 3002, "text": "So I guess who's drafted the proposal?"}, {"time": 3004, "text": "Is it EcoHealth, but the proposal is to do research."}, {"time": 3009, "text": "EcoHealth is technically a US funded organization."}, {"time": 3014, "text": "Primarily."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "And then the idea was to do work at Wuhan Institute of Virology."}, {"time": 3020, "text": "With, yeah, so it was."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "With EcoHealth."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "Yes, so EcoHealth, basically the Wuhan Institute of Virology was gonna go and they were gonna collect these viruses and store them at Wuhan Institute of Virology."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "But they're also gonna do the actual task."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "According, it's a really important point."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "According to their proposal, the actual work was going to be done at the lab of Ralph Barak at the University of North Carolina, who's probably the world's leading expert on coronaviruses."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "And so we know that DARPA didn't fund that work."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "We know, I think quite well that Ralph Barak's lab, in part because it was not funded by DARPA, they didn't do that specific work."}, {"time": 3066, "text": "What we don't know is, well, what work was done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology because WIV was part of this proposal."}, {"time": 3075, "text": "They had access to all of the plans."}, {"time": 3078, "text": "They had done, they had their own capacity and they had already done a lot of work in genetically altering this exact category of viruses."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "They had created chimeric mixed viruses."}, {"time": 3093, "text": "They had mastered pretty much all of the steps in order to achieve this thing that they applied for funding with EcoHealth to do."}, {"time": 3102, "text": "And so the question is, did the Wuhan Institute of Virology go through with that research anyway?"}, {"time": 3110, "text": "And in my mind, that's a very, very real possibility."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "It would certainly explain why they're giving no information."}, {"time": 3117, "text": "And as you know, I've been a member of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee on Human Genome Editing, which Dr. Tedros created in the aftermath of the announcement of the world's first CRISPR babies."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And it was just basically the first time and it was just basically the exact same story."}, {"time": 3134, "text": "So Ho Chiang Kui, a Chinese scientist, it was not a first tier scientist, but a perfectly adequate second tier scientist, came to the United States, learned all of these capacities, went back to China and said, well, there's a much more permissive environment."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "I'm gonna be a world leader."}, {"time": 3150, "text": "I'm gonna establish both myself and China."}, {"time": 3153, "text": "So in every scientific field, we're seeing this same thing where you kind of learn a model and then you do it in China."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "So is it possible that the Wuhan Institute of Virology with this exact game plan was doing it anyway?"}, {"time": 3169, "text": "Do we, possible?"}, {"time": 3171, "text": "We have no clue what work was being done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology."}, {"time": 3176, "text": "It seems extremely likely that at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and this is certainly the US government position, there was the work that was being done in Dr. Hsu's lab, but that wasn't the whole WIV."}, {"time": 3190, "text": "We know, at least according to the United States government, that there was the Chinese military, that PLA was doing work there."}, {"time": 3197, "text": "Were they doing this kind of work, not to create a bioweapon, but in order to understand these viruses, maybe to develop vaccines and treatments?"}, {"time": 3208, "text": "It seems like a very, very logical possibility."}, {"time": 3213, "text": "And then, so we know that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had all of the skills."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "We know that they were part of this proposal."}, {"time": 3220, "text": "And then you have Peter Daszak, who knows all of this, that at that time, in February of 2020, we didn't know."}, {"time": 3227, "text": "But then he comes swinging out of the gate, saying anybody who's raising this possibility of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist."}, {"time": 3237, "text": "I mean, it really makes him look, in my mind, very, very bad."}, {"time": 3241, "text": "And yet, not to at least be somewhat open minded on this, because he knows all the details."}, {"time": 3246, "text": "He knows that it's not 0%."}, {"time": 3248, "text": "I mean, there's no way in his mind could you even argue that."}, {"time": 3252, "text": "So it's potential because of the bias, because of your focus."}, {"time": 3256, "text": "I mean, it could be the Anthony Fauci masks thing, whereas he knows there's some significant probability that this is happening."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "But in order to preserve good relations with our Chinese colleagues, we want to make sure we tell a certain kind of narrative."}, {"time": 3273, "text": "So it's not really lying."},

like..."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "I think it's quite likely that that was the story that he was telling himself."}, {"time": 3289, "text": "But it's that lack of transparency, in my mind, is fraudulent, that we were struggling to understand something that we didn't understand."}, {"time": 3302, "text": "And that I just think that people who possess that kind of information, especially when the existence, like the entire career of Peter Daszak is based on US taxpayers, there's a debt that comes with that."}, {"time": 3316, "text": "And that debt is honesty and transparency."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "And for all of us, and you talked about your girlfriend checking your phone."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "For all of us, being honest and transparent in the most difficult times is really difficult."}, {"time": 3329, "text": "If it were easy, everybody would do it."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "And I just feel that Peter was the opposite of transparent and then went on the offensive."}, {"time": 3339, "text": "And then had the gall of joining, I know we can talk about this, this highly compromised joint study process with the international experts and their Chinese government counterparts."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "And used that as a way of furthering this, in my mind, fraudulent narrative that it almost certainly came from natural origins and a lab origin was extremely unlikely."}, {"time": 3372, "text": "Just to stick briefly on the proposal to wrap that up, because I do think, in a kind of John Stewart way, if you heard that a bit yet, sort of kind of like common sense way, the 2018 proposal to DARPA from EcoHealth Alliance and Wuhan Institute of Virology, just seems like a bit of a smoking gun to me, like that."}, {"time": 3403, "text": "So

beginning."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "Now it's become much, much better."}, {"time": 5018, "text": "But again, it was the pressure of outsiders that played such an important role in shifting our national and international institutions."}, {"time": 5028, "text": "And while that's better than nothing, it would have been far better if our governments and international organizations had done the right thing from the start."}, {"time": 5036, "text": "If I could just make a couple of comments about Joe Rogan."}, {"time": 5044, "text": "So there's a bunch of people in my life who have inspired me, who have taught me a lot, who I even look up to, many of them are alive, most of them are dead."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "I wanna say that Joe said a few critical words about the conversation with Francis Collins, most of it offline, with a lot of great conversations about it, some he said publicly."}, {"time": 5072, "text": "And he was also critical to say that me asking hard questions in an interview is not my strong suit."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "And I really want to kind of respond to that, which I did privately as well, but publicly, to say that Joe is 100% right on that."}, {"time": 5101, "text": "But that doesn't mean that always has to be the case."}, {"time": 5104, "text": "And that is definitely something I wanna work on."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "Because most of the conversations I have, I wanna see the beautiful ideas in people's minds."}, {"time": 5113, "text": "But there's some times where you have to ask the hard questions to bring out the beautiful ideas."}, {"time": 5123, "text": "It's a skill."}, {"time": 5124, "text": "And Joe is very good at this."}, {"time": 5126, "text": "He says the way he put it in his criticisms, and he does this in his conversations, which is, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop."}, {"time": 5134, "text": "There's a kind of sense like, did you just say what you said?"}, {"time": 5138, "text": "Let's make sure we get to the bottom, we'll clarify what you mean."}, {"time": 5144, "text": "Because sometimes really big negative or difficult ideas can be said as a quick aside in a sentence, like it's nothing, but it could be everything."}, {"time": 5162, "text": "And you wanna make sure you catch that and you talk about it."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "And not as a gotcha, not as a kinda way to destroy another human being, but to reveal something profound."}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And that's definitely something I wanna work on."}, {"time": 5176, "text": "I also want to say that, as you said, you disagree with Joe on quite a lot of things."}, {"time": 5184, "text": "So for a long time, Joe was somebody that I was just a fan of and listened to."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "He's now a good friend."}, {"time": 5190, "text": "And I would say we disagree more than we agree."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "And I love doing that."}, {"time": 5198, "text": "But at the same time, I learned from that."}, {"time": 5201, "text": "So it's like dual, like nobody in this world can tell me what to think."}, {"time": 5208, "text": "But I think everybody has a lesson to teach me."}, {"time": 5214, "text": "I think that's a good way to approach it."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "Whenever somebody has words of criticism, I assume they're right and walk around with that idea to really sort of empathize with that idea because there's a lesson there."}, {"time": 5229, "text": "And oftentimes, my understanding of a topic is altered completely or it becomes much more nuanced or much richer for that kind of empathetic process."}, {"time": 5247, "text": "But definitely, I do not allow anybody to tell me what to think, whether it's Joe Rogan or Fyodor Dostoevsky or Nietzsche or my parents or the proverbial girlfriend, which I don't actually have."}, {"time": 5267, "text": "But she's still busting my balls."}, {"time": 5271, "text": "In my imagination, I have a girlfriend in Canada that I have imagined, exactly, imagining conversations."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "So I want to mention that."}, {"time": 5281, "text": "But also, I don't know if you've gotten a chance to see this, but I'd love to also mention this Twitter feud between two other interesting people, which is Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris or Sam Harris and others in general."}, {"time": 5298, "text": "And it kind of breaks my heart that these two people I listen to that are very thoughtful about a bunch of issues."}, {"time": 5305, "text": "Let's put COVID aside because people are very emotional about this topic."}, {"time": 5310, "text": "I mean, I think they're deeply thoughtful and intelligent, whether you agree with them or not."}, {"time": 5319, "text": "And I always learn something from their conversations."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "And they are legitimately or have been for a long time friends."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "And it's a little bit heartbreaking to me to see that they basically don't talk in private anymore."}, {"time": 5333, "text": "And there's occasional jabs on Twitter."}, {"time": 5337, "text": "And I hope that changes."}, {"time": 5340, "text": "I hope that changes in general for COVID, that COVID brought out the, I would say, the most emotional sides of people, the worst in people."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "And I think there hasn't been enough love and empathy and compassion."}, {"time": 5356, "text": "And to see two people from whom I've learned a lot, whether it's Eric Weinstein, Brett Weinstein, Sam Harris, you can criticize them as much as you want, their ideas as much as you want."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "But if you're not sufficiently open minded to admit that you have a lot to learn from their conversations, I think you're not being honest."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "And so I do hope they have those conversations."}, {"time": 5380, "text": "And I hope we can kind of, I think there's a lot of repairing to be done post COVID of relationships, of conversations."}, {"time": 5389, "text": "And I think empathy and love can help a lot there."}, {"time": 5393, "text": "This is also just a, I talked to Sam privately, but this is also a public call out to put a little bit more love in the world."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "And for these difficult conversations to happen."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "Because Brett Weinstein could be very wrong about a bunch of topics here around COVID, but he could also be right."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "And the only way to find out is to have those conversations."}, {"time": 5431, "text": "Because there's a lot of people listening to both Sam Harris and Brett Weinstein."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "And if you go into these silos where you just keep telling each other that you are the possessors of truth and nobody else is the possessor of truth, what starts happening is you both lose track or the capability of arriving at the truth."}, {"time": 5456, "text": "Because nobody's in the possession of the truth."}, {"time": 5458, "text": "So anyway, this is just a call out that we should have a little bit more conversation, a little bit more love."}, {"time": 5464, "text": "And both of those guys are guys who I respect."}, {"time": 5468, "text": "And as you know, Brett, and again, as I mentioned, they're just a handful of us, who were the early people raising questions about the origins of this."}, {"time": 5477, "text": "Of this pandemic, right."}, {"time": 5479, "text": "He was there also talking."}, {"time": 5481, "text": "So people have heard him speak quite a bit about any viral drugs and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5486, "text": "But he was also raising concerns about lab leak early on."}, {"time": 5491, "text": "And so, but I completely agree with you that we don't have to agree with everybody, but it's great to have healthy conversations."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "That's how we grow."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "And absolutely, we live in a world where we're kind of, if we're not careful, pushed into these little information pockets."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "And certainly on social media, I have different parts of my life."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "One is focusing on issues of COVID origins."}, {"time": 5518, "text": "And then I have genetics and biotechnology."}, {"time": 5520, "text": "And then I have, which maybe we'll talk about later, one shared world, which is about how do we build a safer future?"}, {"time": 5526, "text": "And when I say critical things like the Chinese government, we'd have to demand a full investigation into pandemic origins."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "This is an outreach."}, {"time": 5535, "text": "Then it's really popular."}, {"time": 5536, "text": "When I say, let's build a better future for everyone in peace and love, it's like, wow, three people liked it."}, {"time": 5542, "text": "And one was my mother."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "And so I just feel like we need to build, we used to have that connectivity just built in because we had these town squares and you couldn't get away from them."}, {"time": 5555, "text": "Now we can get away from them."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "So engaging with people who are of a different background is really essential."}, {"time": 5562, "text": "I'm on Fox News sometimes three, four times a week."}, {"time": 5567, "text": "And I wouldn't, in my normal life, I'm not watching that much of Fox News or even television more generally."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "But I just feel like if I just speak to people who are very similar to me, maybe it'll be comfortable."}, {"time": 5583, "text": "But what have I contributed?"}, {"time": 5585, "text": "So I think we really have to have those kinds of conversations and recognize that at the end of the day, most people want to be happy."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "They want to live in a better world."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "They maybe have different paths to get there."}, {"time": 5600, "text": "But if we just break into camps that don't even connect with each other, that's a much more dangerous world."}, {"time": 5608, "text": "Let's dive back into the difficult pool."},

5626, "text": "But even China, like there's this kind of gray area that people just fall into."}, {"time": 5632, "text": "And I'm really uncomfortable with that."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "Perhaps because in my mind, in my heart, in my blood are echoes of the Cold War and that kind of tension."}, {"time": 5641, "text": "But it feels like we almost desire conflict."}, {"time": 5649, "text": "So we see demons when there is none."}, {"time": 5652, "text": "So I'm a little cautious to demonize."}, {"time": 5655, "text": "But at the same time, you have to be honest."}, {"time": 5658, "text": "So it's like honest with the demons that are there and honest when they're not."}, {"time": 5665, "text": "This is kind of a geopolitical therapy session of sorts."}, {"time": 5669, "text": "So let's keep talking about China a little bit from different angles."}, {"time": 5673, "text": "So let's return to the director of the Center of Emerging Infectious Disease at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Xi Zhengli, colloquially referred to as Batwoman."}, {"time": 5687, "text": "So do you think she's lying?"}, {"time": 5692, "text": "Do you think she's being forced to lie?"}, {"time": 5695, "text":

about earlier, it's a different thing living, being a scientist, or really kind of anything."}, {"time": 5740, "text": "It's different being one of those people in an authoritarian society than it is being in a different type of society."}, {"time": 5750, "text": "And so when Xi Zhengli said that the reason the WIV database was taken offline in September 19 was because of computer hacks, I don't think that's the story."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "I don't think she thinks that's the story."}, {"time": 5767, "text": "When I asked her in March of 2021, March of this year, in a Rutgers online forum, when I asked her whether the Chinese military had any engagement with the Wuhan Institute of Virology in any way, and she said, absolutely not, paraphrasing, I think she was lying."}, {"time":

about, and that could be one."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "Could she have said that the personnel at the Wuhan Institute of Virology have all had to go through classification training so that they can

why I progressed as I did is I felt like I had two keys, and I had one key as I live in the science world through my work with WHO and my books and things like that."}, {"time": 5870, "text": "But I also have another part of my life in the world of geopolitics as an Asia quote unquote expert and former National Security Council official and other things."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "And I felt for me, I needed both keys to open that door."}, {"time": 5886, "text": "But if I only had the science key, I wouldn't have had the level of doubt and suspicion that I have."}, {"time": 5892, "text": "But

her mind, whether it's fear or habit, because I think a lot of people in the former Soviet Union, it's like Chernobyl, it's not really fear, it's almost like a momentum."}, {"time": 5920, "text":

us are doing the clothes thing."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "Although there was a startup years ago called Naked News."}, {"time": 5939, "text": "Did you ever hear about that?"}, {"time": 5940, "text":

think, I mean, because the reason I asked that question is, how do we kind of take steps to improve without any kind of revolutionary action?"}, {"time": 5967, "text": "You could say, we need to inspire the Chinese people to elect, to sort of revolutionize the system from within, but like, who are we to suggest that?"}, {"time": 5982, "text": "Because we have our flaws too."}, {"time": 5984,

"text": "How can we improve this?"}, {"time": 5997, "text": "Well, so I don't know about small acts of rebellion, but I'll try to answer your question from a few different perspectives."}, {"time": 6007, "text": "So right now, actually, as we speak, there is a special session of the World Health Assembly going on."}, {"time": 6014, "text": "And the World Health Assembly is the governing authority over the World Health Organization, where it's represented by states and territories, 194 of them, tragically not including Taiwan, because of the Chinese government's assistance."},

6042, "text": "But unfortunately, for the exact same reasons that we have failed, I mean, we had a similar process after the first SARS, we set up what we thought was the best available system, and it has totally failed here."}, {"time": 6055, "text": "And it's failed here because of the inherent pathologies of the Chinese government system."}, {"time": 6062, "text": "We are suffering from a pandemic that exists because of the internal pathologies of the Chinese state."}, {"time": 6071, "text": "And that's why on one hand, I totally get this impulse."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "Well, we do it our way, they do it their way."}, {"time": 6077, "text": "Who's to say that one way is better?"}, {"time": 6080, "text": "And certainly right now in the United States, we're at each other's throats."}, {"time": 6085, "text": "We have a hard time getting anything meaningful done."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "And I'm sure there are people who are saying, well, that model looks appealing."}, {"time": 6093, "text": "But just as people could look to the United States and say, well, because the United States has such a massive reach, what we do domestically has huge implications for the rest of the world, they become stakeholders in our politics."}, {"time": 6108, "text": "And that's why I think for a lot of years, people have just been looking at US politics, not because it's interesting, but because the decisions that we make have big implications for their lives."}, {"time": 6118, "text": "The same is true for ours."}, {"time": 6119, "text": "You could say that the lack of civil and political rights in China is, I mean, it's up to the Chinese, not even people, because they have no say, but to their government."}, {"time": 6132, "text": "And they weren't democratically elected, that they are recognized as the government."}, {"time": 6137, "text": "But some significant percentage of the 15 million people now dead from COVID are dead because in the earliest days following the outbreak, whatever the origin, the voices of people sounding the alarm were suppressed, that the Chinese government had an, just like in Chernobyl, the Chinese government had a greater incentive to lie to the international community than to tell the truth."}, {"time": 6166, "text": "And everybody was incentivized to pretty much do the wrong thing."}, {"time": 6171, "text": "And so that's why I think one of the big messages of this pandemic is that all of our fates are tied to everybody else's fates."}, {"time": 6180, "text": "And so while we can say and should say, well, let's focus on our own communities and our countries, we're all stakeholders in what happens elsewhere."}, {"time": 6189, "text": "Can I ask you a weird question?"}, {"time": 6194, "text":

usually speaking in these kinds of formats."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "Do you think it's possible to interview Xi Jinping?"}, {"time": 6220, "text": "Do you think it's possible to interview somebody like her or anyone in the Chinese government?"}, {"time": 6229, "text": "And I think the reason is because I think they would, one, be uncomfortable being in any environment where really unknown questions will be asked."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "And I actually, so as you know, on this topic, the Chinese, as I mentioned earlier, the Chinese government has a gag order on Chinese scientists."},

forums."}, {"time": 6257, "text": "I mentioned this Rutgers event."}, {"time": 6259, "text": "What was the nature of that forum, the Rutgers event?"}, {"time": 6263, "text": "All of them were kind of science conversations about the pandemic, including the origins issue."}, {"time": 6273, "text": "But I think that she, in her response to my question, it was kind of this funny thing."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "So they had this event organized by Rutgers."}, {"time": 6282, "text": "And I went on, there was an online event on Zoom, but I got on there and I just realized it was very poorly organized."}, {"time": 6289, "text": "Like normally the controls that you would have about who gets to chat to who, who gets to ask questions, none of them were set."}, {"time": 6296, "text": "And so I kind of couldn't believe it."}, {"time": 6298, "text": "I was just sitting at home in my neon green fleece and I just started sending chat messages to Xu Zhengli."}, {"time": 6306, "text": "So you could, anybody could send any."}, {"time": 6308, "text": "Anybody could, it was insane."}, {"time": 6309, "text": "But I thought, wow, this is incredible."}, {"time": 6311, "text": "And so then it was unclear who got to ask questions."}, {"time": 6316, "text": "And so I was like posting questions and then I was sending chats to the organizers of the event saying, I really have a question."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "And first they said, well, you can submit your questions and we'll have submitted questions."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "And then if we have time, we'll open up."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "So I just, I mean, I just thought, well, what the hell?"}, {"time": 6333, "text": "I just sent messages to everybody."}, {"time": 6334, "text": "And then the event was already done."}, {"time": 6337, "text": "They were 15 minutes over time."}, {"time": 6339, "text": "And then they said, all right, we have time just for one question."}, {"time": 6342, "text": "And it's Jamie Metzl."}, {"time": 6344, "text": "And like, as I'm sitting there in my running clothes, like I wasn't, I was like multitasking and I heard my name."}, {"time": 6350, "text": "And so I went diving back and I asked this question about, did you know all of the work that was happening at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, not just your work?"}, {"time": 6366, "text": "And can you confirm that US intelligence has said that the military played a role, was engaged with the Wuhan Institute of Virology?"}, {"time": 6376, "text": "Do you deny that the Chinese military was involved in any way with the Wuhan Institute of Virology?"}, {"time": 6381, "text": "And as I said before, she said, this is crazy."}, {"time": 6386, "text": "It got, it actually got, that one question got covered in the media because it was like, I think an essential question."}, {"time": 6392, "text": "But I just think that since then, to my knowledge, she's not been in any public forums, but that's why most people would be shocked that to date there has been no comprehensive international investigation into pandemic origins."}, {"time": 6406, "text": "There is no whistleblower provision."}, {"time": 6409, "text": "So if you're, my guess is there are at least tens, maybe hundreds of people in China who have relevant information about the origins of the pandemic who are terrified and don't dare share it."}, {"time": 6421, "text": "And let's just say somebody wanted to get that information out, to send it somewhere."}, {"time": 6428, "text": "There's no official address."}, {"time": 6430, "text":

barrier is a thing."}, {"time": 6453, "text": "Because I've talked to, so I understand Russian culture, I think, or not understand, this is the thing."}, {"time": 6460, "text": "I don't understand

culture."}, {"time": 6475, "text": "It's just not something I've experienced."}, {"time": 6477, "text": "So it's a beautiful, rich, complex culture."}, {"time": 6480, "text": "And from my sense, it

believe I kind of do because I did martial arts my whole life, but even that, it's just so distant."}, {"time": 6500, "text": "People who've lived in Japan, foreigners for like 20 years say the exact same thing, yeah."}, {"time": 6505, "text": "This makes me sad."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "It makes me sad because I will never be able to fully appreciate the literature, the conversations, the

authoritarian perspective, you can just say that's misinformation, that's conspiracy theories, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 7348, "text": "But at least I think if you open up that freedom of

that increased the GDP of the country."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "So I think there's a lot of benefits."}, {"time": 7366, "text": "I feel like you can still play, we're playing some like dark thoughts

part of a small six person delegation advising the government of North Korea on how to establish special economic zones because other countries have used these SEZs as a way of building their

flew to China across the border into North Korea."}, {"time": 7464, "text": "And then we were met by our partners from the North Korean Development Organization."}, {"time": 7470, "text": "And then we zigzagged the country for almost two weeks visiting all these sites for where they were intended to create these special economic zones."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "And in each site, they had their local officials and they had a map and they showed us where everything that was going to be built."}, {"time": 7487, "text": "And the other people who were like really technical experts on how to set up a special economic zone, they were asking questions, well, like, should you put the entrance over here or shouldn't you put it over there and what if there's flooding?"}, {"time": 7498, "text":

know anything about who you're competing against?"}, {"time": 7507, "text": "Are you empowering your workers to innovate because everybody else is innovating?"}, {"time": 7512, "text": "So at the end of the trip, they flew us to Pyongyang and they put us in this, it looked kind of like the United Nations."}, {"time": 7517, "text": "They probably had 500 people there and I gave a speech to them."}, {"time": 7522, "text": "I obviously was in English and it was translated and I figured, you know, I've come all this way, I'm just going to be honest."}, {"time": 7530, "text": "If they arrest me for being honest, that's on them."}, {"time": 7534, "text": "And I said, I'm here because I believe we can never give up hope, that we always have to try to connect."}, {"time": 7541, "text": "I'm also here because I think that North Korea connecting to the world economy is an important first step."}, {"time": 7550, "text": "But having visited all of your special economic zone sites and having met with all of your, or many of your officials, I don't think your plan has any chance of succeeding because you're trying to sell into a global market, but you need to have market information that, and I gave examples of GE and others that the innovation can't only happen at one place."}, {"time": 7574, "text": "And if you want innovation to happen from the people who are doing this, you have to empower them, they have to have access, they have to have voice."}, {"time": 7583, "text": "I mean, nobody, I mean, the people after, they kind of had to condemn me because what I was saying was challenging."}, {"time": 7592, "text": "So I certainly agree with you."}, {"time": 7593, "text": "And then just one side story of then that night, and it was just kind of bizarre because North Korea is, it's so desperately poor, but they were trying to impress us."}, {"time": 7604, "text": "And so we had these embarrassingly sumptuous banquets."}, {"time": 7609, "text": "And so for our final dinner that night, really it looked like something from Beauty and the Beast."}, {"time": 7614, "text": "I mean, it was like China and waiters and tuxedos, and they had this beautiful dinner."}, {"time": 7622, "text": "And then afterwards, because we'd now spent two weeks with our North Korean partners, they brought out this karaoke machine and our North Korean counterparts, they sang songs to us in Korean."}, {"time": 7635, "text": "And so I said, well, we want to reciprocate."}, {"time": 7638, "text": "Do you have any English songs on your karaoke machine?"}, {"time": 7641, "text":

North Korean delegation."}, {"time": 7650, "text": "She was able just to play the piano, just like you could hum a tune and she could play it on the piano."}, {"time": 7656, "text": "And so I said, all right, here's this tune, which I whispered in her ear."}, {"time": 7661, "text": "When I give you the signal, just play this tune over and over."}, {"time": 7665, "text": "And so I got these, I mean, there were the six of us and maybe 20 North Koreans, and we were all in a circle, so everybody hold hands and then put your right, just try to put your right foot in front of your left and then left foot in front of the right, going sideways."}, {"time": 7680, "text": "And I said, all right, hit it."}, {"time": 7682, "text": "And she played a North Korean version of Hava Nagila."}, {"time":

be that there's infectee zero and patient zero."}, {"time": 7777, "text": "It could be that the first person infected was asymptomatic because we know there's a lot of people who are asymptomatic."},

that diagnosis could be made."}, {"time": 7796, "text": "So can we actually linger on that definition?"}, {"time": 7799, "text": "So is that to you a good definition of patient zero?"}, {"time": 7802, "text": "Okay, there's a bunch of stuff here because this virus is weird."}, {"time": 7806, "text": "So one is who gets infected, one who is infectious or the first person infect others."}, {"time": 7815, "text": "And who shows up to a hospital."}, {"time": 7817, "text": "Yeah, so I think that's why I'm calling the first person to show up to a hospital who's diagnosed with COVID 19."}, {"time":

showed up in a hospital because maybe they were asymptomatic and never get sick, so got sick."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "So let me start with what I'm calling infectee zero."}, {"time": 7840, "text":

virus, which I mentioned, RATG13, and there's a whole history of that because it had a different name and it looked, and Xiaojiang Li provided wrong information about when it had been sequenced."},

saying RATG13 is the backbone, but is there, I believe there is a possibility that other viruses that were collected either in that mine in Yunnan in Southern China or in Laos or Cambodia, because

"In my mind, that's almost certainly why they are preventing any kind of meaningful investigation."}, {"time": 8326, "text": "So my hypothesis is not that what RITG13 says is because as I mentioned earlier, the genetics of virus are constantly recombinating."}, {"time": 8339, "text": "So that what that means is if you have, you don't have very many total outlier viruses in a bat community

not the World Health Assembly, but the leadership of the WHO, announced the establishment of what's called SAGO, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens."}, {"time": 9651, "text": "And basically what they did was overrule their own governing board and say, we're going to create our own entity."}, {"time": 9659, "text": "So it basically dissolved that international,

of lab incidents."}, {"time": 9733, "text": "And then one of the, so they added those two."}, {"time": 9737, "text": "And then when they just released the list of people who are part of SAGO, this one

allow you to send a team to collect your own information."}, {"time": 9867, "text": "And we're not going to allow you to have any kind of independent surveillance, there was very little that the WHO

we're going to give you money to do this or that."}, {"time": 9921, "text": "So we need a stronger WHO to protect us, but we also have to build that."}, {"time": 9928, "text": "So looking a little bit into the future, let's first step into the past, sort of the philosophical question about China."}, {"time": 9939, "text": "If you were to put yourself in the shoes of the Chinese government, if they were to be more transparent, how should they be more transparent?"}, {"time": 9951, "text": "Because it's easier to say, we want to see this."}, {"time": 9957, "text": "But from a perspective of government, and not just the Chinese government, but a government on WHO's geographic territory, say it's a lab leak, a lab leak occurred that has resulted in trillions of dollars of loss, countless

something in geopolitical sense, the United States will bring up, oh, remember that time you cost us trillions of dollars because of your fuck up?"}, {"time": 10021, "text": "So what is the incentive

incident."}, {"time": 10189, "text": "Well, what happens?"}, {"time": 10190, "text": "You could easily imagine Xi Jinping has had two terms as the leader of China."}, {"time": 10197, "text": "And he

question, if I were, let's just say I were the Chinese government, not, I mean, kind of an idealized version of the Chinese government."}, {"time": 10363, "text": "And let's just say that they had come to the conclusion that it was a lab incident."}, {"time": 10369, "text": "And let's just say they knew that even if they continued to cover it up, eventually this information would come out."},

now?"}, {"time": 10389, "text": "What I would do is I would hold a press conference and I would say, we had this terrible accident."}, {"time": 10396, "text": "The reason why we were doing this research in Wuhan and elsewhere is that we had SARS one and we felt a responsibility to do everything possible to prevent that kind of terrible thing happening again for our country and for the

began, we didn't know how it started."}, {"time": 10433, "text": "And that was why we wanted to look into things."}, {"time": 10437, "text": "When the process of investigating became so political, it gave us pause and we were worried that our enemies were trying to use this investigation in order to undermine us."}, {"time": 10449, "text": "Having said that, now that we've dug deeper, we have recognized because we have access to additional information that we didn't have then, that this pandemic started from an accidental lab incident."}, {"time": 10463, "text": "And we feel really terribly about that."}, {"time": 10465, "text": "And we know that we were very aggressive in covering up information in the beginning, but the reason we were doing that is because we thoroughly, we fully believe that it came from a natural origin."}, {"time": 10477, "text": "Now that we see otherwise, we feel terribly."}, {"time": 10481, "text": "Therefore, we're doing a few different things."}, {"time": 10484, "text": "One is we are committing ourselves to establishing a stronger WHO, a new pandemic treaty that addresses the major challenges that we face and allows the World Health Organization to pierce the veil of absolute sovereignty because we know that when these pandemics happen, they affect everybody."}, {"time": 10508, "text": "We are also putting, and you can pick your number, but let's start with five trillion US dollars, some massive amount, into a fund that we will be distributing to the victims of COVID 19 and their, and their."}, {"time": 10526, "text": "China would do that?"}, {"time": 10527, "text": "This is a fantasy speech."}, {"time": 10529, "text": "But I disagree with your, I mean, okay."}, {"time": 10534, "text": "So you think China has a responsibility?"}, {"time": 10536, "text": "Well, so it's not the, like just a lab leak."}, {"time": 10540, "text": "Like if China on day one had said we have this outbreak, we don't know where it came from, we want to have a full investigation, we call on international, responsible international partners to join us in that process, and we're going to do everything in our power to share the relevant information because however this started, we're all victims."}, {"time": 10563, "text": "That's a totally different story than punishing Australia, preventing the WHO, blocking any investigation, condemning people who are trying to look, and so that's."}, {"time": 10573, "text": "So cover up for a couple weeks, you can understand maybe, because there's so much uncertainty."}, {"time": 10580, "text": "You're like, oh, let's hide all the Winnie the Pooh pictures while we figure this out."}, {"time": 10586, "text": "But the moment you really figure out what happened, you always, as a Jew I can say this, always find like a blame the Jews kind of situation a little bit, just a little bit."}, {"time": 10596, "text": "Be like, all right, it's not us."}, {"time": 10601, "text": "But be proactive in saying."}, {"time": 10604, "text": "Just to start here, but the joke about that is there's a big problem because a lot of people have to leave the Jewish socialist conspiracy to make it for the Jewish capitalist conspiracy meeting."}, {"time": 10619, "text": "So I would say not five trillion, but some large amount, and I would really focus on the future, which is every time we talk about the lab leak, the unfortunate thing is I feel like people don't focus enough about the future."}, {"time": 10633, "text": "To me, the lab leak is important because we want to construct a kind of framework of thinking and a global conversation that minimizes the damage done by future lab leaks, which will almost certainly happen."}, {"time": 10650, "text": "And so to me, any lab leak is about the future."}, {"time": 10655, "text": "I would launch a giant investment in saying we're going to create a testing infrastructure, like all of this kind of infrastructure investments that help minimize the damage of a lab leak here and the rest of the world."}, {"time": 10671, "text": "So the challenge with that is one, it's hard to imagine a fully accountable future system to prevent these kinds of terrible pandemics that's built upon obfuscation and coverup regarding the origins of this worst pandemic in a century."}, {"time": 10689, "text": "So it's just like that foundation isn't strong enough."}, {"time": 10694, "text": "Second, China across the fields of science is looking to leapfrog the rest of the world."}, {"time": 10700, "text": "So China now has current plans to build BSL4 labs in every of its province."}, {"time": 10707, "text": "Yeah, they're scaling up the."}, {"time": 10708, "text": "Scaling up everything ends up with the plan on leading."}, {"time": 10712, "text": "And that's why, again, I was saying before, I think there's a lot of similarity between this story, at least as I see it, at least the most probable case, and these other areas where China gets knowledge and then tries to leapfrog."}, {"time": 10724, "text": "It's the same with AI and autonomous killer robots."}, {"time": 10728, "text": "It's the same with human genome editing, with animal experimentations, with so many, basically all areas of advanced science."}, {"time": 10738, "text": "So the question is, would China stop in that process?"}, {"time": 10741, "text": "And then third, it's a little bit of a historical background, but defending national sovereignty is one of the core principles of, certainly of the Chinese state."}, {"time": 10756, "text": "And the historical issue is, for those of us who come from the West, I mean, one of the lessons of the postwar planners was that absolute national sovereignty was actually a major feeder into the first and second world wars, that we had all these conflicting states."}, {"time": 10774, "text": "And therefore the logic of the postwar system is we need to in some ways pool sovereignty that's like the EU and have transnational organizations like the UN organizations and the Bretton Woods organizations."}, {"time": 10787, "text": "For most Asian states, and also even for some African, and the people who were kind of on the colonized side of history, sovereignty was the thing that was denied them."}, {"time": 10798, "text": "That was the thing that they want, that the European power is denied."}, {"time": 10801, "text": "And so the idea of giving up sovereignty was the absolute opposite."}, {"time": 10807, "text": "And so that's why China is, and again, I mentioned this Rush Doshi book."}, {"time": 10812, "text": "It's not that China is trying to strengthen this rules based international order, which is based on the principle that while there are certain things that we share and how do we build a governance system to protect those things, what it seems to be doing is trying to advance its own sovereignty."}, {"time": 10831, "text": "And so I think I agree with you, but I don't think that we can just go forward without some accountability for the."}, {"time": 10839, "text": "So the coverup was a big problem."}, {"time": 10841, "text": "It's like, I often, I find myself playing devil's advocate because I'm trying to sort of empathize and then I forget that like two or three people listen to this thing and then they're like, look, Lex is defending the Chinese government with their coverup."}, {"time": 10859, "text": "No, I'm not, I'm just trying to understand."}, {"time": 10865, "text": "I mean, it's the same reason I'm reading Mein Kampf now is like you have to really understand the minds of people as if I too could have done that."}, {"time": 10878, "text": "You know, you have to understand that we're all the same to some degree and that kind of empathy is required to figure out solutions for the future."}, {"time": 10889, "text": "It's just in empathizing with the Chinese government in this whole situation, I'm still not sure I understand how to minimize the chance of a coverup in the future, whether for China or for the United States."}, {"time": 10904, "text": "If the virus started in the United States, I'm not exactly sure we would be with all the emphasis we put on freedom of speech, with all the emphasis we put on freedom of the press and access to the press, the sort of all aspects of government."}, {"time": 10922, "text":

true."}, {"time": 10941, "text": "And so let's just say that the Texas Horseshoe Bats only exist in Texas, but in Montana, we have a thing, it's called the Montana Institute of Virology."}, {"time":

called the Texas Horseshoe Bat pandemic."}, {"time": 10975, "text": "And let's just say that people in Montana, in the same town where this Montana Institute of Virology is, start getting a version of this Texas Horseshoe Bat syndrome that is genetically relatively similar to the outbreak in Texas."}, {"time": 10995, "text": "There are no horseshoe bats there."}, {"time": 10998, "text": "And the government says, it's your same point, Alina's point about the unicorns, like nothing to see here, just move along."}, {"time": 11008, "text": "Would Joe Rogan and Brett Weinstein and Josh Rogan,

11036, "text": "But you want the government to have the transparent, like, I don't think Joe Rogan is enough to hold the government accountable."}, {"time": 11044, "text": "I think they're going to do their thing anyway."}, {"time": 11046, "text": "But I think that's our system, and that was the genius of the founding fathers."}, {"time": 11053, "text": "That the government probably is going to have a lot of instincts to do the wrong thing."}, {"time": 11058, "text": "That was the experience in England before."}, {"time": 11062, "text": "And so that's why we have free speech, to hold the government accountable."}, {"time": 11067, "text": "I mean, I'm kind of broadly a gun control person, but the people who say, well, we need to have broad gun rights."}, {"time": 11074, "text": "As

fought against the British, if the government's wrong, we want to at least have some authority."}, {"time": 11091, "text": "So that's our system, is to have that kind of voice."}, {"time": 11093,

around five days in this PGT process, a few cells are extracted."}, {"time": 11832, "text": "So let's say you have 10 fertilized eggs, early stage embryos, a few cells are extracted from each, and

we shift towards a much greater understanding of genetics, and that is part of our, just the broader genetics revolution, but within that, in our transition from personalized to precision healthcare,

millions, but very soon, billions of people who've had their whole genome sequenced."}, {"time": 11902, "text": "And then we'll have big databases of people's genetic genotypic information and life or phenotypic information."}, {"time": 11910, "text": "And using, coming into your area, our tools of machine learning and data analytics, we're going to be able to increasingly understand patterns of

more, always more and more."}, {"time": 11930, "text": "And so with that information, we aren't going to just be, even now, we aren't going to just be selecting based on which of these 10 early stage embryos is carrying a deadly genetic disorder, but we can, we'll be able to know everything that can be partly or entirely predicted by genetics."}, {"time": 11952, "text": "And there's a lot of our humanity that fits into that category."}, {"time": 11957, "text": "And certainly simple traits like height and eye color and things like that."}, {"time": 11963, "text": "I mean, height is not at all simple, but it's, if you have good nutrition, it's entirely or mostly genetic."}, {"time": 11971, "text": "But even personality traits and personality styles, there are a lot of things that we see just as the experience, the beauty of life that are partly have a genetic foundation."}, {"time": 11982, "text": "And so whatever part of these traits are definable and influenced by genetics, we're going to have greater and greater predictability within a range."}, {"time": 11994, "text": "And so selecting those embryos will be informed by that kind of knowledge."}, {"time": 12002, "text": "And that's why in Hacking Darwin, I talk about embryo selection as being a key driver of the future of human evolution."}, {"time": 12011, "text": "But then on top of that, there is in 2012, Shinya Yamanaka, an amazing Japanese scientist won the Nobel Prize for developing a process for creating what are called induced pluripotent stem cells, IPS cells."}, {"time": 12027, "text": "And what IPS cells are is you can induce an adult cell to go back in evolutionary time and become a stem cell."}, {"time": 12035, "text": "And a stem cell is like when we're a fertilized egg, like our entire blueprint is in that one cell and that cell can be anything, but then it starts to, our cells start to specialize."}, {"time": 12048, "text": "And that's why we have skin cells and blood cells and all the different types of things."}, {"time": 12051, "text": "So with the Yamanaka process, we can induce an adult cell to become a stem cell."}, {"time": 12059, "text": "So the relevance to this story is what you can do."}, {"time": 12062, "text": "And it works now in animal models."}, {"time": 12065, "text": "And as far as I know, it hasn't yet been done in humans, but it works pretty well in

those stem cells into egg precursor cells."}, {"time": 12091, "text": "Then you induce those egg precursor cells into eggs, egg cells."}, {"time": 12097, "text": "Then because we have this massive overabundance of male sperm, then you could fertilize, let's call it 10,000 of the mother's eggs."}, {"time": 12109, "text": "So you have 10,000 eggs, which are fertilized."}, {"time": 12112, "text": "Sounds like a party."}, {"time": 12114, "text": "Then you have an automated process for what I mentioned before in preimplantation genetic testing, you grow them all for five days, you extract a few cells from each, you test them."}, {"time": 12127, "text": "And that's why I had a piece in the New York Times a couple of years ago, imagining what it would be like to go to a fertility clinic in the year 2050."}, {"time": 12134, "text": "And the choice is not."}, {"time": 12135, "text": "No humans involved."}, {"time": 12137, "text": "Well, no, no, there are, but the choice is not, do you want a kid who does or doesn't have, let's call it Tay Sachs."}, {"time": 12145, "text": "It's a whole range of possibilities, including very intimate traits like height, IQ, personality style."}, {"time": 12155, "text": "It doesn't mean you can predict everything, but it means there will be increasing predictability."}, {"time": 12161, "text": "So if you're choosing from 10,000 eggs, fertilized eggs, early stage embryos, that's a lot of choice."}, {"time": 12169, "text": "And on top of that, then we have the new technology of human genome editing."}, {"time": 12177, "text": "Many people have heard of CRISPR, but what I say is if you think of human genome editing as a pie, sorry, human genome engineering as a pie, genome editing is a slice and CRISPR is just a sliver of that slice."}, {"time": 12191, "text": "It's just one of our tools for genome editing and things are getting better and better."}, {"time": 12196, "text": "Then you can go in and change."}, {"time": 12200, "text": "Let's say, I mean, again, it starts simple."}, {"time": 12203, "text": "A small number of genes, let's say you've selected from among the one of 10 or the one of 10,000, but there are a number of changes that you would like to make to achieve some kind of outcome."}, {"time": 12213, "text": "And biology is incredibly complex and it's not that one gene does one thing."}, {"time": 12218, "text": "One gene does probably a lot of things simultaneously, which is why the decision about changing one gene if it's causing deathly harm is easier than when we think about the complexity of biology."}, {"time": 12231, "text": "But then the machine learning gets better and better at predicting the full complexity of biology."}, {"time": 12235, "text": "So as one gets better, then you're editing your ability to reliably edit such that the conclusions are predictable, it gets better and better."}, {"time": 12245, "text": "So those two are coupled together."}, {"time": 12247, "text": "You got it, that's exactly it."}, {"time": 12248, "text": "And then, so that's why, and people would say, well, that, I mean, I wrote about that in my two science fiction novels, Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata years ago, and especially with Genesis Code, I wrote about that."}, {"time": 12260, "text": "And as a sci fi, and I had actually testified before Congress, but now 15 years ago saying, here's what the future looks like."}, {"time": 12270, "text": "But even I, and in my first edition of Hacking Darwin, when it was already in production, and then in November 2018, this scientist, Hojong Kui,

making it so they would have increased resistance to HIV."}, {"time": 12307, "text": "And so I called my publisher, and I said, I've got good news and bad news."}, {"time": 12311, "text": "I'll start

in China, and here's why."}, {"time": 12337, "text": "And all we need to do is add a few more sentences, and that was the hardback, and then I updated it more in the paperback, saying, and it happened, and it was announced on this day."}, {"time": 12350, "text": "Well, then let's fast forward."}, {"time": 12352, "text": "Given your predictions are slowly becoming reality, let's talk about some philosophy, and ethics, I suppose."}, {"time": 12363, "text": "So I can, I'm not being too self deprecating here, and saying if my parents had the choice, I would be probably less likely to come

Charles Murray and then that spawned kind of a whole industry of debate."}, {"time": 12550, "text": "So first, just the background of IQ and it's from the early 20th century and there was the idea that we can measure people's general intelligence and there are so many different kinds of intelligence."}, {"time": 12563, "text": "This was measuring a specific thing."}, {"time": 12565, "text": "So my feeling is that IQ is not a perfect measure of intelligence, but it's a perfect measure of IQ."}, {"time": 12573, "text": "Like it's measuring what it's measuring, but that thing correlates to a lot of things which are rewarded in our society."}, {"time": 12583, "text": "So every study of IQ has shown that people with higher IQs, they make more money, they live longer, they have more stable relationships."}, {"time": 12593, "text": "I mean, that could be something in the testing, but as Sam Harris has talked about a lot, you could line up all of these kind of IQ and IQ like tests

sure that it's all true in the sense that we have millions of people who are getting vaccinated and different things."}, {"time": 14156, "text": "And what Sanjay should have said was, I know that's anecdote."}, {"time": 14161, "text": "Here's another anecdote of like when Francis Collins was with you and he talked about the world wrestling guy who was like 6.6 and a big muscly guy, and then he

was just fine."}, {"time": 14237, "text": "So that anecdotal case, I mean, Francis should not have done that."}, {"time": 14241, "text": "So if I have any, so I have a bunch of criticism of how that

{"time": 14264, "text": "And one of them was why, when you're trying to present some kind of critical, like criticize Joe Rogan, why bring up anecdotal evidence at all?"}, {"time": 14278, "text": "And if you do bring up anecdotal evidence, which is not scientific, if you're a scientist, you should not be using anecdotal evidence."}, {"time": 14286, "text": "If you do bring it up, why bring up one that's first not true and you know it's not true?"}, {"time": 14295, "text": "So I know, pretend, so you don't know it's not true."}, {"time": 14298, "text": "So yes, that would find another case where, exactly."}, {"time": 14303, "text": "So the basic thing coming back to Sanjay and Joe's conversation was that Sanjay was trying to use statistical evidence and Joe was using anecdotal evidence."}, {"time": 14313, "text": "And so I think that for Sanjay, and there are all kinds of things where there are debates where often the person who's better at debating wins the debate regardless of the topic."}, {"time": 14326, "text": "So I think what Sanjay could have done, and Sanjay is such a smart guy, is to say, well, that's an anecdote, here's another anecdote."}, {"time": 14337, "text": "And there are lots of different anecdotes."}, {"time": 14340, "text": "And there certainly are people who have taken the vaccine and have had problems that could reasonably be traced to the vaccines."}, {"time": 14348, "text": "And there certainly are lots of people, I would argue, more people who've not had the vaccine, but who've gotten COVID and have either died or our hospitals are now full of people who weren't vaccinated."}, {"time": 14360, "text": "And in many ways, I mean, our emergency rooms are full of unvaccinated people here in the United States."}, {"time": 14366, "text": "So I think what Sanjay could have done, but there was a conflict between wanting to kind of win the debate and wanting to take the temperature down."}, {"time": 14376, "text":

was the thing."}, {"time": 14388, "text": "So I think it's a healthy conversation."}, {"time": 14390, "text": "We can't, I mean, there are a lot of people who are afraid of the vaccine."}, {"time":

the vaccines, there was this big movement, let's make sure that the poorest people in the city have first access to the vaccines because they're the ones, they have higher density in their homes, they're relying on public transport."}, {"time": 14437, "text": "So there was this whole liberal effort."}, {"time": 14439, "text": "And then in the black community in New York, according to the New

there must be something wrong with it."}, {"time": 14454, "text": "They must be doing something."}, {"time": 14456, "text": "And so we have to listen to each other."}, {"time": 14459, "text": "Like I

opinion."}, {"time": 14585, "text": "Don't roll your eyes, don't do any of that dismissive stuff."}, {"time": 14587, "text": "And the same thing in the scientific community around COVID and so on,

what they're saying, then don't talk about it."}, {"time": 14603, "text": "Like if you're a scientific leader and the communicator, you need to look into it."}, {"time": 14607, "text": "It's not that much effort."}, {"time": 14609, "text": "And I think that humility, it's a constant theme of your podcasts and I love that."}, {"time": 14615, "text": "And so after the conversation debate, whatever it was between Sanjay and Joe, I reached out on Twitter to someone I've never met in person, but I'm in touch privately to a guy named Daniel Griffin, who's a professor at Columbia Medical School and

don't we have an honest process to get the people who are raising concerns about the vaccines in their own words to raise what are their concerns?"}, {"time": 14668, "text": "And then let's do our best job of saying, well, here are these concerns."}, {"time": 14674, "text": "And then here is our evidence making a counterclaim and here are links to if you want to look at the studies upon which these claims are made, here they are."}, {"time": 14685, "text": "And Daniel, who's incredibly busy, I mean, he reads every, I mean, it seems every paper that comes out every week and it's unbelievable."}, {"time": 14695, "text": "But he sent me a link to the CDC Q&A page on the CDC website."}, {"time": 14702, "text": "And it wasn't that, it was people who were, I mean, it was written by people like me who were convinced in the benefit of these vaccines."}, {"time": 14713, "text": "So the questions were framed, they were kind of like, they weren't really the framing of the people with the concerns."}, {"time": 14721, "text": "They were framing of people who were just kind of imagining something else."}, {"time": 14725, "text": "I mean, you always talk about kind of humility and active listening."}, {"time": 14729, "text": "I know you don't mean, and it doesn't mean that we don't stand for something."}, {"time": 14733, "text": "Like I certainly am a strong proponent of vaccines and masks and all of those things."}, {"time": 14739, "text": "But if we don't hear other people, if we don't let them hear their voice in the conversation, if it's just saying, well, you may think this and here's why it's wrong, the argument may be right."}, {"time": 14752, "text": "It'll just never break through."}, {"time": 14753, "text": "By the way, my interpretation of Joe and Sanjay, I listened to that conversation without looking at Twitter or the internet and I thought that was a great conversation and I thought Sanjay actually really succeeded in bringing the temperature down."}, {"time": 14765, "text": "To me, the goal was bringing the temperature down."}, {"time": 14768, "text": "I didn't even think of it as a debate."}, {"time": 14770, "text": "I was like, oh, cool, this isn't gonna be some weird, it's like two friendly people talking."}, {"time": 14775, "text": "And then I look at the internet and then the internet says, Joe Rogan slammed Sanjay like as if it was a heated debate that Joe won."}, {"time": 14784, "text": "And it's like, all right, it's really the temperature being brought down."}, {"time": 14790, "text": "Real conversation between two humans."}, {"time": 14792, "text": "That wasn't really a debate."}, {"time": 14794, "text": "It was just a conversation and that was a success."}, {"time": 14798, "text": "I definitely think it was a success, but I also felt that a takeaway, and again, because this is something that I don't agree with, even though I have great, as I've said, respect for Joe, I think a reasonable person listening to that conversation would come away with the conclusion that all in all these vaccines are a good thing, but if you're young and healthy, you probably don't need it."}, {"time": 14831, "text": "And I just felt that there was a stronger case to be made, even though Sanjay made it."}, {"time": 14837, "text": "It wasn't that Sanjay didn't make it."}, {"time": 14839, "text": "It was just that in the flow of that conversation, I felt that the case for the vaccines and the vaccines both as an individual choice and then certainly again, as I said before, I think that while people can be afraid of the vaccines, the virus itself is much scarier and we're seeing it now in real time with these variations and variants."}, {"time": 14863, "text": "I just felt that that was kind of the rough takeaway from that conversation."}, {"time": 14870, "text": "And I felt that Sanjay, again, whom I love, I felt it could have made his case a little bit stronger."}, {"time": 14876, "text": "So the thing he succeeded is he didn't come off as like a science expert looking down at everybody, talking down to everybody."}, {"time": 14889, "text": "So he succeeded in that, which is very respectful."}, {"time": 14892, "text": "But I also think sort of making the case for taking the vaccine when you're a young, healthy person, when you're sitting across from Joe Rogan is like a high difficulty on the video game level."}, {"time": 14906, "text": "So it's difficult to do."}, {"time": 14911, "text": "And also it's difficult to do because it's not as simple as like, look at the data."}, {"time": 14918, "text": "There's a lot of data to go through here."}, {"time": 14922, "text": "And there's also a lot of non data stuff, like the fact that, first of all, questioning the sources of the data, the quality of the data, because it's also disappointing about COVID is that the quality of the data is not great."}, {"time": 14964, "text": "I mean, vaccination is not just a public health tool."}, {"time": 14968, "text": "It's also a tool for a government to gain more control over the populace."}, {"time": 14973, "text": "Like, there's a lot of truth to that too."}, {"time": 14976, "text": "Things that have a lot of benefit can also be used as a Trojan horse to increase bureaucracy and control."}, {"time": 14987, "text": "But that has to be on the table for a conversation."}, {"time": 14989, "text": "I think it has to be on the conversation."}, {"time": 14992, "text": "But your parents, when they were in the Soviet Union and here in the United States, and actually it was a big collaboration between US and Soviet Union, when the polio vaccine came out, there were people all around the world who had a different life trajectory, no longer living in fear."}, {"time": 15009, "text": "And all of these people who were paralyzed or killed from polio, smallpox has been eradicated."}, {"time": 15015, "text": "It was one of the great successes in human history."}, {"time": 15020, "text": "And while it for sure is true that you could imagine some kind of fraudulent vaccination effort, but here I genuinely think, I mean, whatever the number, 15 million, 16 million is the economist number of dead from COVID 19, many, many, many more people would be dead but for these vaccines."}, {"time": 15041, "text": "And so I get that any activity that needs to be coordinated by a central government has the potential to increase bureaucracy and increase control."}, {"time": 15053, "text": "But there are certain things that central governments do, like the development, particularly these mRNA vaccines, which it's purely a US government victory."}, {"time": 15065, "text": "I mean, it was huge DARPA funding and then the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, NIH funding."}, {"time": 15073, "text": "I mean, this was a public private partnership throughout and that we got a working vaccine 11 months was a miracle."}, {"time": 15081, "text": "So I, yeah."}, {"time": 15081, "text": "It's not purely a victory."}, {"time": 15084, "text": "Again, you have to be open minded."}, {"time": 15086, "text": "I'm with you here playing a bit of devil's advocate, but the people who discuss any viral drugs like ivermectin and other alternatives would say that the extreme focus on the vaccine distracted us from considering other possibilities."}, {"time": 15102, "text": "And saying that this is purely a success is distracting from the story that there could have been other solutions."}, {"time": 15110, "text": "So yes, it's a huge success that the vaccine was developed so quickly and surprisingly way more effective than it was hoped for."}, {"time": 15122, "text": "But there could have been other solutions and they completely distracted from us from that."}, {"time": 15128, "text": "In fact, it distracted us from looking into a bunch of things like the lab leak."}, {"time": 15132, "text": "And so it's not a pure victory."}, {"time": 15135, "text": "And there's a lot of people that criticize the overreach of government and all of this."}, {"time": 15140, "text": "That one of the things that makes the United States great is the individualism and the hesitancy to ideas of mandates."}, {"time": 15151, "text": "Even if the mandates on mass will have a positive, even strongly positive result, many Americans will still say no."}, {"time": 15163, "text": "Because in the long arc of history, saying no in that moment will actually lead to a better country and a better world."}, {"time": 15173, "text": "So that's a messed up aspect of America, but it's also a beautiful part."}, {"time": 15179, "text": "We're skeptical even about good things."}, {"time": 15183, "text": "I agree and certainly we should all be cautious about government overreach, absolutely."}, {"time": 15191, "text": "And it happens in all kinds of scenarios with incarceration with a thousand things."}, {"time": 15197, "text": "And we also should be afraid of government underreach that if there is a problem that could be solved by governments and that's why we have governments in the first place is that there's just certain things that individuals can't do on their own."}, {"time": 15211, "text": "And that's why we pool our resources and we, in some ways, sacrifice our rights for this common thing."}, {"time": 15219,

rules."}, {"time": 15229, "text": "And so, while I fully agree that we need to respect and we need to listen, we need to find that right balance."}, {"time": 15236, "text": "And you've raised the magic I word, ivermectin."}, {"time": 15240, "text": "And so, an ivermectin, like my view has always been, ivermectin could be effective, it could not be effective."}, {"time": 15249, "text": "Let's study it through a full process."}, {"time": 15252, "text": "And when you had Francis Collins with you, even while he was making up stories about this wrestler, he was saying, yeah, exactly."}, {"time": 15262, "text": "But he was saying that they're going to do a full randomized highest level trial of ivermectin."}, {"time": 15268, "text": "And if ivermectin works, then that's another tool in our toolbox."}, {"time": 15272, "text": "And I think we should."}, {"time": 15274, "text": "And I think that Sanjay was absolutely correct to concede the point to Joe, that it was disingenuous for people, including people on CNN, to say that ivermectin is for livestock."}, {"time": 15288, "text": "And so, I definitely think that we have to, like we have to have some kind of process that allows us to come together."}, {"time": 15297, "text": "And I totally agree that the great strength of America is that we empower individuals."}, {"time": 15303, "text": "It's the history of our frontier mentality in our country."}, {"time": 15306, "text": "So we, I 100% agree that we have to allow that, even if sometimes it creates messy processes and uncomfortable feelings and all those sorts of things."}, {"time": 15319, "text": "You are an ultra marathon runner."}, {"time": 15323, "text": "What are you running from?"}, {"time": 15328, "text": "It's the right, it's the funny thing is, so I'm an ultra marathoner and I've done 13 Ironmans."}, {"time": 15334, "text": "And people say, oh my God, that's amazing."}, {"time": 15336, "text": "13 Ironmans."}, {"time": 15337, "text": "And what I

kind of let the demons sit in the attic."}, {"time": 15353, "text": "No, what have you learned about yourself, about your mind, about your body, about life, from taking your body limit in that kind of way to running those kinds of distances?"}, {"time": 15367, "text": "Well, it's a great question."}, {"time": 15368, "text": "And I know that you are also kind of exploring the limits of the physical."}, {"time": 15372, "text": "And so for me in doing the Ironmans and the ultra marathons, it's always the same kind of lesson, which is just when you think you have nothing left, you actually have a ton left."}, {"time": 15387, "text": "There are a lot of resources that are there if you call on them."}, {"time": 15392, "text": "And the ability to call on them has to be cultivated."},

for me, these extreme sports are my process of exploring what's possible."}, {"time": 15441, "text": "And I feel like it applies in so many different areas of life where you're kind of pushing and it

differently."}, {"time": 15701, "text": "And we need to listen to our bodies because our bodies are communicating."}, {"time": 15708, "text": "But I think it was kind of little by little magic is possible."}, {"time": 15713, "text": "And what I will say is, and I also have done lots and lots of marathons, and I always tell people that the ultra marathons, at least the ones that I do, and I shouldn't misrepresent myself."}, {"time": 15724, "text": "I mean, there are people who do 500 mile races."}, {"time": 15727, "text": "The ones that I do are 50K mountain trail runs, which is 32 miles."}, {"time": 15732, "text": "So I do the kind of the easier side of ultras, but it's actually much easier than a marathon because some of the mountain ones, sometimes it's so steep that you can't, you have to walk it because walking is faster than running."}, {"time": 15749, "text": "And every four or five miles in the supported races, you stop and eat blintzes and foiled potatoes."},

looked and that the weekend after my visit, there was a marathon."}, {"time": 15777, "text": "It was called the, every ultra marathon, it was called the Taiwan Beast."}, {"time": 15781, "text": "And I figured, oh, beasts, what are they talking about?"}, {"time": 15783, "text": "It's 50K mountain trail, and I've done a million of them."}, {"time": 15786, "text": "And then I went to register."},

river."}, {"time": 15837, "text": "There were some things where it was so steep that everyone was just climbing up and then you'd slide all the way down and climb up."}, {"time": 15843, "text": "And

16016, "text": "And then everybody got the cacao."}, {"time": 16019, "text": "And then they said, all right, as they talked a little bit about the process, and then they said, all right, everyone just stand and kind of, we're going to spin around in a circle for 45 minutes."}, {"time": 16029, "text": "And so I spun around in the circle for like 10 minutes, but then I had to leave because I had to go to something else."}, {"time": 16035, "text": "And so that, I thought that was that."}, {"time": 16038, "text": "But then I saw Viviana the next day, and I said, well, how did the cacao ceremony

was more sane because it was part of this thing."}, {"time": 16071, "text": "And at the end of that, I had this, I thought one, the greatest thing ever, a sacred cacao ceremony, like you drink chocolate milk and everybody's free."}, {"time": 16081, "text": "And I love that idea because I've never done drugs, I don't drink."}, {"time": 16087, "text": "But just part of it is because I think whatever, like I was saying with the ultra running, all of the possibilities are within us if we can get out of our own way."}, {"time": 16096, "text": "And then I thought, well, you know, I think I can do a better job than what I experienced in Berlin."}, {"time": 16102, "text": "So I came back and I thought, all right, I'm gonna get accredited as a cacao shaman."}, {"time": 16106, "text": "And this will shock you."}, {"time": 16107, "text": "Because I know if you're gonna be like a rabbi or a priest or something, there's some process."}, {"time": 16112, "text": "But shockingly, there's no official process to become a chocolate shaman."}, {"time": 16118, "text": "And so I thought, all right, well, you know, I'm just gonna train myself."}, {"time": 16122, "text": "And when I'm ready, I'm gonna declare my chocolate shamanism."}, {"time": 16125, "text": "So I started studying different things."}, {"time": 16127, "text": "And when I was ready, I just said, now I'm a chocolate shaman,

sacred cacao."}, {"time": 16158, "text": "And there's no sacred mountains and there's no sacred people and there's no sacred plants."}, {"time": 16162, "text": "Because nothing is sacred if we don't

is there?"}, {"time": 16204, "text": "I think the core is gratitude and just appreciation."}, {"time": 16209, "text": "All the experiences in life?"}, {"time": 16210, "text": "Yeah, just of being

from, but how did the beans get here and who painted the yellow line on the street so the truck didn't crash and who made the cup?"}, {"time": 16250, "text": "And he spent a year making a full

16263, "text": "Like, it's like, thank you for painting the yellow line on the road."}, {"time": 16266, "text": "And so for me with the cacao, part of when I do these ceremonies is just to say like, you're drinking this cacao, but there's a person who planted the seed, there's a person who watered the plant, there's a person, and I just think that level of awareness, and it's true with anything."}, {"time": 16284, "text": "Like you have in front of you a stuffed hedgehog, so."}, {"time": 16287, "text": "Somebody made that."}, {"time": 16288, "text": "I love it, it's great."},

we're speaking into a microphone, well, what are the hundreds of years of technology that make this possible?"}, {"time": 16316, "text": "But if just once in a while, we just focus on one thing and say, this thing is sacred."}, {"time": 16321, "text": "And because I'm recognizing that and I'm having an appreciation for the world around me, it just kind of makes my life feel more sacred."},

this world and moments and just am in awe of the full universe that brought that to be."}, {"time": 16353, "text": "In a similar way as you're saying, but I don't as often think about exactly what you're saying, which is the number of people behind every little thing we get to enjoy."}, {"time": 16363, "text": "I mean, yeah, this hedgehog, this microphone, like directly, like thousands of people involved."}, {"time": 16370, "text": "And then indirectly, it's millions."}, {"time": 16372, "text": "Like, and they're all like this microphone that there's like artists, essentially, like people who made it their life's work, all the costs, like from the factories to the manufacturer, there's families that the production of this microphone and this hedgehog are fed because of the skill of this human that helped contribute to that development."}, {"time": 16400, "text": "And like Isaac Newton and John von Neumann are in this microphone."}, {"time": 16404, "text": "They're standing on

him go."}, {"time": 16477, "text": "So background on One Shared World."}, {"time": 16479, "text": "I mentioned I'm on a faculty for Singularity University."}, {"time": 16483, "text": "In the earliest days of the pandemic, I was invited to give a talk on whether the tools of the genetics and biotech revolutions were a match for the outbreak."}, {"time": 16492, "text": "And my view was then as now

that we organize ourselves and we solve climate change."}, {"time": 16558, "text": "And then we have a nuclear war because everybody's, particularly China now, but US, the former Soviet Union are building all these nuclear weapons."}, {"time": 16567, "text": "Who cares that we solved climate change because we're all gone anyway."}, {"time": 16570, "text": "And the meta category, bringing all

what we now understand as the modern nation state was laid."}, {"time": 16615, "text": "And then through colonialism and other means that idea of a state is what it is today, spread throughout the world."}, {"time": 16625, "text": "Then through particularly the late 19th and early 20th century, we realized how unstable that system was because you always had these jockeying between sovereign states and some were rising and some were falling and you ended up in war."}, {"time": 16641, "text": "And that was the genius of the generations who came together in 1945 in San Francisco and the

number of problems that present themselves in the world that face all of human civilization and to be able to work together."}, {"time": 16798, "text": "Well, that is, but there's a macro, a meta problem, which is the global collective action problem."}, {"time": 16804, "text": "And so the idea is even if we just focus on the verticals, on the manifestations of the global collective action problem, there'll be an infinite number of those things."}, {"time": 16816, "text": "So while we work on those things, like climate change, pandemics, WMD and other things, we also have to ask the bigger questions of why can't we solve this category of problems."}, {"time": 16827, "text": "And the idea is, at least from my observation, is that whenever big decisions are being made, our national leaders and corporate leaders are doing exactly what we've hired them to do."}, {"time": 16840, "text": "They're maximizing for national interest, even, or corporate interests, even at the expense of everybody."}, {"time": 16848, "text": "And so it's not that we wanna get rid of states."}, {"time": 16850, "text": "States are essential in our world system."}, {"time": 16852, "text": "It's not we
