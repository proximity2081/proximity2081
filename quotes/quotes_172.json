changes, you also had changes at the top."}, {"time": 254, "text": "Between 1923 and 1953, when Stalin died, that is 30 years, they had eight heads of intelligence, and of those eight, six were executed when they were replaced."}, {"time": 269, "text": "So that's an indication that this was an organization that ate itself from the inside."}, {"time": 278, "text": "The Soviet Union was the only dictatorship in history that did not rest its powers on the military."}, {"time": 283, "text": "They rested its powers on the intelligence apparatus, and that thing was unstable."}, {"time": 289, "text": "So you know where that leads."}, {"time": 292, "text": "Eventually, if you rest your power on something that is made out of bricks that don't hold a lot of load, it will fall apart."}, {"time": 301, "text": "On sand."}, {"time": 303, "text": "Why was it unstable, would you say?"}, {"time": 304, "text": "What of human nature makes it unstable?"}, {"time": 307, "text": "It's the paranoia."}, {"time": 309, "text": "Stalin was always worried about the most powerful people coming after him."}, {"time": 317, "text": "So he proactively killed off heads of the KGB, and he had this great purge where he got rid of a lot of his generals, really capable generals, and that cost him dearly when World War II started, because he started off with a force that wasn't as capable as it could have been."}, {"time": 341, "text": "Was it paranoia at all levels?"}, {"time": 345, "text": "It comes from the top."}, {"time": 346, "text": "And so if the top doesn't trust you, you always have to worry about your peers snitching on you."}, {"time": 358, "text": "And I think we have a very similar situation in Russia today, and in this kind of atmosphere, the truth will never get to the top."}, {"time": 370, "text": "So no matter what moral rules the organization operates under, trust is fundamental to its competence."}, {"time": 379, "text": "And I want to extend this to my own existence, and this is kind of strange."}, {"time": 386, "text": "It's almost dichotomous, because I was running around lying to everybody, and I couldn't fundamentally be trusted."}, {"time": 395, "text": "But the relationship that I had with the KGB was based on trust."}, {"time": 400, "text": "If they don't trust me, they don't send me out."}, {"time": 403, "text": "And if I don't trust them, I'm not going."}, {"time": 405, "text": "And I eventually broke that trust, and they knew there was always that danger."}, {"time": 410, "text": "They knew that because something about you or just something about human beings that can be broken."}, {"time": 417, "text": "There were hints about how long my assignment would be, so 10 to 12 years."}, {"time": 425, "text": "And you see, it makes sense."}, {"time": 427, "text": "I was becoming an American, and over time, I would become more and more American, and there was always a chance that I liked it more here than there, that I was really successful in what I was supposed to do."}, {"time": 442, "text": "And it sort of happened, but in my case, it happened because I fathered a child who I didn't want to leave when they wanted me back."}, {"time": 450, "text": "Love always screws up your employment competence, yes."}, {"time": 460, "text": "But they thought that I had an anchor at home because I had a wife and a son at home, which you've got to worry about them if you defect."}, {"time": 473, "text": "Because in the past, the KGB would go after family ruthlessly."}, {"time": 481, "text": "Including perhaps violence?"}, {"time": 484, "text": "This is a hard question about the KGB because it's one of the most ruthless organizations, but in general, are there lines, KGB agents at every level of the hierarchy that they would not cross, political, legal, ethical, or does anything goes to achieve the goal?"}, {"time": 505, "text": "I was only in touch with two types of agents, the technical experts, the ones that taught me tradecraft, and they were like engineers and they were in charge of the secret writing and the Morse code, shortwave radio reception, decryption, encryption, and that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 533, "text": "Those were just doing their job."}, {"time": 536, "text": "And the others, the ones that trained me, that prepared me for life in the United States, they were nice people."}, {"time": 545, "text": "They were elegant people."}, {"time": 548, "text": "I don't think they would not fit into the stereotype of the ruthless gun carrying agent."}, {"time": 559, "text": "Is it possible that you would not be aware of the parts of the KGB, I mean, it's very modular."}, {"time": 568, "text": "It's possible that you're not aware of the parts of the KGB that are the quote unquote muscle."}, {"time": 571, "text": "Oh, I didn't know."}, {"time": 572, "text": "I would find out afterwards, after I retired and started doing some research, I had no clue."}, {"time": 580, "text": "So you're kind of operating in a bubble."}, {"time": 583, "text": "I mean, this is what the KGB did really, really well, compartmentalization, and that was based on the communist movement while it was still underground."}, {"time": 597, "text": "The cells were very small, so that maybe there were three, four members in one cell that knew one another, and then they had a liaison to another cell."}, {"time": 607, "text": "The bottom line is if you got one of those folks were caught, they could maybe betray four people or three, something like that, and the KGB continued with that tradition."}, {"time": 620, "text": "I have reason to believe that my handler, the person in Moscow that sort of directed me and made decisions what to do and where to go, never met me personally."}, {"time": 633, "text": "There's no reason to."}, {"time": 637, "text": "This actually was a big advantage over other intelligence services because you look at what the CIA does."}, {"time": 646, "text": "Everybody blabs."}, {"time": 647, "text": "There's a lot of leaks coming out of American intelligence."}, {"time": 650, "text": "I don't think there's as many leaks coming out of the Mossad."}, {"time": 654, "text": "Strong words from Jack Barsky, by the way."}, {"time": 657, "text": "That is a question I want to ask a little more systematically."}, {"time": 659, "text": "Is there something unique about the KGB compared to the other intelligence agencies?"}, {"time": 665, "text": "Let's talk British intelligence, MI6, Mossad, CIA."}, {"time": 671, "text": "Is there unique cultures, spirits, souls of the different organizations that maybe somehow connect to the structures of government, connect maybe the values of the people, those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 683, "text": "I believe we were all pretty much strong believers in communism and the future of the world being..."}, {"time": 691, "text": "In KGB?"}, {"time": 693, "text": "I think that unified us to a large degree, even the technicians."}, {"time": 698, "text": "It wasn't something like, yeah, yeah, the parents believe this thing, but we know the truth."}, {"time": 707, "text": "You really believe the story of communism."}, {"time": 709, "text": "Absolutely did."}, {"time": 710, "text": "And you need to look at the timeframe."}, {"time": 714, "text": "The Soviet Union after World War II made quite a bit of progress in influencing the Third World."}, {"time": 723, "text": "I still remember when I was in middle school, we had a map, the map of the world, and it was color coded."}, {"time": 731, "text": "So red was communism, that was the Soviet Union and the Eastern states, and then blue was capitalism."}, {"time": 738, "text": "And then we had green, which were the Third World countries, and the green slowly turned pink because a lot of Third World governments, like I'm looking at Angola, I'm looking at Vietnam, a lot of these countries were very sympathetic to the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 760, "text": "And so we sort of knew that this would go on like that, and eventually we would take over and pretty much overtake, that was the myth, overtake the United States, not only militarily but also in terms of industrial production and so forth."}, {"time": 782, "text": "That was a stupid pipe dream."}, {"time": 783, "text": "The military, it was a standoff, as we know."}, {"time": 788, "text": "A stupid pipe dream."}, {"time": 793, "text": "Hitler had a stupid pipe dream that he executed it exceptionally effectively and on, if not for a handful of military mistakes, the world could look very different today."}, {"time": 808, "text": "Well, the biggest one being invading the Soviet Union, particularly at the time that he did it because he ran into the same thing that Napoleon ran into General Winter."}, {"time": 820, "text": "Well within, so Operation Barbarossa, within that he could have made different decisions."}, {"time": 829, "text": "For example, attacking, skipping Kiev and attacking Moscow directly, overthrowing the government."}, {"time": 837, "text": "So marching, I guess that would be learning lessons from Napoleon as opposed to a different kind of distribution of forces and then getting bogged down in the winter."}, {"time": 847, "text": "But the point is these ambitions sometimes do, the ambitions of empires sometimes do materialize in the growth and the building and the establishment of those empires and those empires write the history books in such a way that we don't think of them as empires or we certainly don't think of them as the bad guys."}, {"time": 867, "text": "They write the history books, therefore they're the good guys."}, {"time": 870, "text": "And right now America has effectively written the book about the good guys."}, {"time": 875, "text": "I happen to believe that book, but it's, we should be humbled and open minded to realize that that is in fact what is happening is effective empires write the history books and tell us stories and tell us propaganda and tell us narratives that we believe because we are human beings and we love to get together and believe ideas."}, {"time": 895, "text": "We love to dream of a beautiful world and try to build that beautiful world together in the United States."}, {"time": 901, "text": "That's a beautiful world."}, {"time": 902, "text": "The freedom of respect of human rights of all men are created equal pursuit of happiness."}, {"time": 911, "text": "You know, it always sounds good."}, {"time": 913, "text": "If you look at what the dream of communism is, it sure as heck in its words on the surface sounds good."}, {"time": 921, "text": "Respect for the workers."}, {"time": 923, "text": "The working class, the lower classes that have been trodden on that have been stolen from by the powerful, they deserve to have the money, the power, the respect that they have earned through their hard work."}, {"time": 935, "text": "Sounds great."}, {"time": 936, "text": "And everybody gets along and we just have to, you know, uh, all men are wonderful people."}, {"time": 944, "text": "And if they, if they go bad, it has something to do with the fact that they have, they have been oppressed, right?"}, {"time": 951, "text": "And uh, that dream just never worked out."}, {"time": 954, "text": "And even, even it is when you think about it and I didn't think about it when you're young, you know, you just emotionally, you accept it."}, {"time": 962, "text": "But when you think about it, somehow, uh, that new wonderful organization has to organize itself even though Lenin predicted that the state eventually would go away."}, {"time": 974, "text": "Well, how does it, how does that work?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "Then you have like anarchy, right?"}, {"time": 977, "text": "You have to have an organization."}, {"time": 979, "text": "The only way to really organize a large number of people is with a hierarchy."}, {"time": 986, "text": "So and who gets to the top, the ones that are, that want to go to the top, the ones that believe in themselves, the ones, the ones that know better than everybody else."}, {"time": 997, "text": "And once you have that hierarchy established, uh, there is no guarantee that it doesn't that it won't go bad."}, {"time": 1003, "text": "And actually when you look at history, every such hierarchy has gone bad."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "You know, you look at Cuba, for instance, I believe Fidel Castro was a, an honest revolutionary."}, {"time": 1018, "text": "And so what did Cuba turn into?"}, {"time": 1021, "text": "There's something about, and you speak about Vladimir Putin in this way, but let's step away from that for a second."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "Is there something about being an honest revolutionary that wants to do good for their country and you start to believe that, you know, better than everyone else how to do good on the country and you very well might first, but then somehow that grows into a distortion field where, you know, you keep believing, you know, what's right."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "And all the people who disagree with you, you stop seeing them as having a point."}, {"time": 1058, "text": "You instead see them as like, um, um, evil manipulators of the truth that are actually trying to hurt people for their own greed, for their own power."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "And you will protect the people because you know, what's good in the case of Stalin."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "I, I mean, I don't know, but it seems like he really believed that communism would bring about a much better world."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "I mean, there was a sense the, you have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet, this idea that sacrifice is necessary to bring about a greater world."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "And then the other aspect is sort of ruling by terror, creating terrorism, justified political mechanism to achieve a better world."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "But it wasn't, I mean, perhaps he had to do that to be able to sleep at night with the atrocities he's committing."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "He's, I think he believed he will bring about a better world."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "And by the way, the terror didn't start with Stalin."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "It started right after the Bolsheviks took over when Lenin told Mr. Dzerzhinsky, Commodore Dzerzhinsky to build the Cheka and then execute the, this is what he called it, the red terror."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "So at the birth of the Soviet Union, there was already terror and it was deliberate."}, {"time": 1151, "text": "And it also was, it wasn't just focused on the enemies, it was focused on whoever you didn't like."}, {"time": 1159, "text": "There was no rule of law, there was no court cases, people were just pulled out of their apartments and shot on sight."}, {"time": 1171, "text": "And this was done by revolutionaries who were convinced that eventually, these sacrifices had to be made and eventually that would lead to a much better planet."}, {"time": 1184, "text": "And the populace believed this too, that those sacrifices in part."}, {"time": 1188, "text": "I mean, this is such a dark thing about dictatorships is you believe it, but you're also too afraid to question your beliefs."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "Like, you're not directly afraid, but almost like, I don't know what that is."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "That's almost like a subconscious fear."}, {"time": 1208, "text": "Like don't, there's a dark room with a locked door, don't look in that door."}, {"time": 1213, "text": "Don't check that door."}, {"time": 1214, "text": "And there's something about the United States that says, especially modern culture, it's like go to that door first and sort of question everything kind of, that's the power of the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, but you can get almost become too critical and too cynical of your own culture in that way."}, {"time": 1233, "text": "So there's a balance to strike, of course, but man, if communism is not a lesson of human nature, I don't know what is, but you believed, without thinking too much about it, you believed in the story of, what did you see, just, you know, I came from the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "What did you maybe feel that's right and good about communism, about the vision of communism?"}, {"time": 1262, "text": "I think the biggest impetus in me believing in communism was that the communists, just before Hitler took over, the communists were the only force in Germany that fought the Nazis in the streets, and that's a historic truth."}, {"time": 1286, "text": "And communists were hunted down by the Nazis, killed, put in concentration camps."}, {"time": 1294, "text": "And so what we knew, what we were taught, and I think that was a huge unforced error by the Western countries, particularly the United States, that there were ex Nazis in the government in West Germany."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "And the most famous one was Reinhard Galen, who was in charge, was the general in charge of the intelligence on the Eastern Front under Hitler."}, {"time": 1325, "text": "And when the Allied won the war, it was decided that Galen was too important, his knowledge and his organization was too important to not use."}, {"time": 1341, "text": "So he was coopted by the CIA and eventually wound up being the head of the Bundesnachrichtendienst, the CIA of West Germany."}, {"time": 1349, "text": "That gave us, us, when I say us, the East German party, a huge propaganda victory."}, {"time": 1356, "text": "I wanted to, because the emotional aspect of this was as follows."}, {"time": 1362, "text": "When we were in, juniors in high school, and in those days, you were only allowed to go to high school if you were in the top 10% of students, okay?"}, {"time": 1377, "text": "So this was going to be the next set of ruling elite in the country."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "We were sent, we were required to visit a concentration camp."}, {"time": 1389, "text": "And if you know what we as 17 year olds were made to look at, it was gut wrenching."}, {"time": 1398, "text": "How can men do something like that to men, piles of corpses, lampshades made out of human skin because that skin had tattoos on them, and shrunken heads like the size of my fist."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "I mean, the girls all cried, and it made a huge impression."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And that was the Nazis, and the Communists defeated the Nazis."}, {"time": 1428, "text": "They were the good guys."}, {"time": 1429, "text": "Of course, in hindsight, if the Communists had come to power, it would have been just the other way around, as we know, given the example of Stalin and Mao, right?"}, {"time": 1439, "text": "But we didn't know that."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "From the Russian and Soviet perspective, the Communist regime banded together to win the Great Patriotic War."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And that was the second one, the big brother, the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1458, "text": "I mean, when I was approached by the KGB, that was like, oh, I felt so honored."}, {"time": 1464, "text": "So we should say that we're talking about East Germany, that you're from East Germany."}, {"time": 1471, "text": "Can you describe, you were born four years and what is it?"}, {"time": 1476, "text": "Yeah, four years."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "10 days?"}, {"time": 1478, "text": "Yeah, sort of."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "After Germany's unconditional surrender in World War II."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "So what is East Germany?"}, {"time": 1487, "text": "What is West Germany?"}, {"time": 1488, "text": "What is East and West Germany?"}, {"time": 1493, "text": "What's the historical context here?"}, {"time": 1494, "text": "What is World War II again?"}, {"time": 1495, "text": "And then, let's do it for some... We don't have to go to World War I, the result of which actually seeded World War II in some respect."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "There's a long history, yes."}, {"time": 1509, "text": "But let's start with World War II."}, {"time": 1511, "text": "So when Hitler came to power, he and his leadership decided that the Germans needed more what they call Lebensraum, that means room to live."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "And they would start expanding and they went into France, they took Belgium, the Netherlands, they annexed Austria and got a piece of Czechoslovakia."}, {"time": 1544, "text": "And then they decided to march into the Soviet Union after they took Poland."}, {"time": 1553, "text": "Cut up Poland together with the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "They were friends."}, {"time": 1558, "text": "There was a nonaggression pact that was signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov, right?"}, {"time": 1563, "text": "I think both parties knew that eventually they would fall apart."}, {"time": 1566, "text": "But at the time, it gave the Soviet Union a little more piece of Poland and a little more time to prepare what they thought might happen down the road."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "And the Germans had the time and the ability to pretty much conquer all of Western Europe."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "Do you think Stalin really knew that it's gonna fall apart?"}, {"time": 1593, "text": "Why would somebody like Stalin trust somebody like Hitler?"}, {"time": 1596, "text": "But why did he blunder so bad not to read the intelligence that was coming his way?"}, {"time": 1602, "text": "Oh, he doesn't..."}, {"time": 1603, "text": "The troops are amassing on the border of the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "He didn't trust his own intelligence apparatus."}, {"time": 1609, "text": "Here's one example."}, {"time": 1612, "text": "There was a German communist who went underground when Hitler took over and he went to Japan as a journalist."}, {"time": 1620, "text": "His name is Richard Sorge."}, {"time": 1623, "text": "Richard Sorge had really, really good intel about what the Japanese would do and not do."}, {"time": 1631, "text": "I forgot exactly what it was, but it came to Moscow and Stalin totally ignored it."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "And when Sorge was captured by the Japanese, the Soviet Union denied that he was one of them there, so he was executed, the paranoia, again, does a lot of damage."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "When you don't believe your own intelligence apparatus, why bother having one?"}, {"time": 1661, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there..."}, {"time": 1664, "text": "But I'm sure there's contradictory information coming in from the intelligence apparatus, so it's difficult."}, {"time": 1670, "text": "I mean, first of all, nobody likes to be disagreed with, especially when you become more and more powerful, and then the intelligence apparatus is probably giving information you don't like."}, {"time": 1680, "text": "It's often negative information about, basically, information that says that the decisions you made in the past are not great decisions, and that's a difficult truth to deal with."}, {"time": 1695, "text": "So in the modern times, if we hop around briefly, Vladimir Putin has been not happy with the intelligence of the FSB, thereby, at least if you read the news, choosing to put more priority to the GRU for the intelligence in Ukraine."}, {"time": 1719, "text": "But I guess I suppose the same story happens there, as it does throughout history, is paranoia."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "I give you an example that comes from a very reliable source, and that my best German friend worked as a chemist in the Stasi, East German intelligence."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "And he eventually, he rose to the rank of major and was in charge of the forgery department."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "It's very likely that he made passports that I use to travel."}, {"time": 1760, "text": "He was aware that there was intelligence that was collected."}, {"time": 1764, "text": "The Stasi was really good."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "They had about a thousand people in West Germany, undercover agents, some of them in government, and the central committee of the party, the decision makers ignored it because it didn't quite fit in their worldview, it didn't quite fit into their plans."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "So and one delicious thing that I just want to add on to this, when Gorbachev wrote his book about Perestroika and Glasnost, the East German rulers did not like it."}, {"time": 1801, "text": "They were much, much more orthodox."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "So they had to print the books in translation, guess where they wound up."}, {"time": 1809, "text": "They were piled up in the hallways of the Stasi."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "They bought the entire print run."}, {"time": 1819, "text": "So but let's backtrack."}, {"time": 1820, "text": "So Operation Barbarossa, invasion of Hitler to the Soviet Union, and then hopefully that leads us all the way to East Germany, West Germany after the end of the war."}, {"time": 1830, "text": "So what happened was the Soviet Union rolled into the eastern part of Germany and the Western allies took a larger chunk, which was eventually, it was occupied by the three allies, the French, the English and the Americans, and the eastern part was occupied by Soviet troops."}, {"time": 1855, "text": "And the Soviet troops actually conquered Berlin."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "But in a contract, they decided that Berlin would be ruled by the four allies and they all had free access to that city."}, {"time": 1875, "text": "I was born in the East German part, which very quickly became ruled by communists, socialists, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party United, but the leaders of that new party were all communists."}, {"time": 1892, "text": "It's nevertheless called democratic."}, {"time": 1894, "text": "Yes, German Democratic Republic, which was formed a couple of months after I was born."}, {"time": 1902, "text": "I was born into a remote southeastern corner of East Germany."}, {"time": 1909, "text": "And interestingly enough, genetically, I'm only half German."}, {"time": 1914, "text": "The other half is Czech and Polish."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "Because where I grew up, I could walk to the Nysa River, which was the border with Poland, and it was only about an hour by bus to get to the Czech border."}, {"time": 1931, "text": "So that's why I'm a mix."}, {"time": 1934, "text": "So okay, so East Germany after the war was communist, socialist, and then the West Germany was representing the Western world with democracy."}, {"time": 1945, "text": "And what the United States did, this was really, really very forward looking, very strategic, the Marshall Plan to rebuild the economy in the West as compared to what the Soviet Union did."}, {"time": 1962, "text": "Whatever they hadn't destroyed on the way in, they took with them on the way out for reparations because they had every right to do that."}, {"time": 1972, "text": "But it was not a good idea because East Germany was always behind in economic development to their Western counterpart."}, {"time": 1981, "text": "So when you were young, as today, but when you were young, you were clearly an exceptional student."}, {"time": 1990, "text":

sorry to pause briefly, did you have a sense, did people know that there's a Stasi type of organization, that there is a large number of people doing this kind of work in East Germany in order for you to make that guess?"}, {"time": 2847, "text": "Yeah, we knew that the Stasi existed."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "We even had our James Bond, we had a series called the Invisible Visor where a Stasi employee in East German would go into West Germany and hunt down Nazis."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "So yes, the Stasi was known to be there."}, {"time": 2867, "text": "And admired in part or feared or both?"}, {"time": 2871, "text": "I thought they were necessary and I admired them."}, {"time": 2876, "text": "Yes, the reason I did so because I had no information to the contrary."}, {"time": 2881,

that they did a lot of damage and that they were doing a lot of surveillance of the East German population the same way the KGB did for the Soviet Union."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "So for me to be talking to somebody from the Stasi, it raised my interest."}, {"time": 2918, "text": "I was curious what comes next because I sort of knew something interesting would be coming at me and I had no other thoughts about that at that point."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So when he was finally, when he went for the kill by reversing himself, he said, you know, I got to tell you that I really, I really am not from Karl Stasi, you know, I'm from the government."}, {"time": 2942, "text": "Thank you for pointing that out."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "And then he asked this question, he says, can you imagine to one day work for the government?"}, {"time": 2951, "text": "And so I gave a pretty clever answer."}, {"time": 2954, "text": "I said, yes, but not as a chemist."}, {"time": 2957, "text": "So I answered the question that he didn't ask."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "I helped him out."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "So we made an arrangement to meet for lunch, which in Germany is the main meal at the number one restaurant in Vienna, you know, I still remember what I ate."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "Rump steak with butter on top and French fries, it was my favorite."}, {"time": 2983, "text": "Anyway, so when I get to the restaurant, I saw this fellow sitting in the back there at the table and there was another person at the table."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "So I was a little bit hesitant because in those days it was not unusual for perfect strangers to share a table because there wasn't enough tables and chairs and so forth."}, {"time": 3004, "text": "So I didn't know if I could approach him, but he got up and came to me and he took me to the table and he said, I want to introduce Herman."}, {"time": 3015, "text": "We work with our Soviet comrades."}, {"time": 3018, "text": "Aha, KGB."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "And then he disappeared."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "He says, I got something else to do."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "I never knew his name."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "He just handed me over to the KGB."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "What was the relationship between the KGB and Astazies as collaborators, close collaborators or just distant associates?"}, {"time": 3037, "text": "They were pretty close collaborators as I told you that they bought forged documents that the Germans made because the Germans were better at forgery."}, {"time": 3047, "text": "They also exchanged information, but they didn't trust each other 100% and I tell you why I know that."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "So they recruited me to send me to West Germany."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "As I already said, East Germany had a thousand agents over there."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "Why would they want to have their own?"}, {"time": 3069, "text": "This is a fascinating internal and external dynamic of distrust."}, {"time": 3075, "text": "So there you are welcomed by the KGB."}, {"time": 3079, "text": "When did the offer, the invite come?"}, {"time": 3081, "text": "Well, that took a while."}, {"time": 3082, "text": "So Herman and I had an unofficial relationship for about a year and a half."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "I would meet him once a week, once every two weeks, initially in his car, but then he took me to a conspirational flat that was an apartment that was occupied by a party member, a lady, single lady."}, {"time": 3110, "text": "When we came in, she would leave, she left us tea and cookies and then we could freely talk."}, {"time": 3116, "text": "He also at that time gave me some West German literature magazines to read, which was of course forbidden."}, {"time": 3124, "text": "So I'm starting to feel somewhat special and as we were talking about what they had in mind for me in general, I knew that I was going to be even more special because I would be above the law."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "I would operate outside the law of the countries I would go to as well as East Germany because the magazines and eventually when I joined up, they told me I had better watch West German television, which was also not explicitly prohibited, but it was something that could get you in trouble."}, {"time": 3164, "text": "So on many levels, you're super special, you're the James Bond."}, {"time": 3170, "text": "What was that recruitment testing process like?"}, {"time": 3175, "text": "Testing whether you have what it takes to be a KGB agent?"}, {"time": 3181, "text": "First of all, we had very in depth talks, Herman and I, about life and I still am very honest in sharing my feelings."}, {"time": 3199, "text": "Philosophical or personal?"}, {"time": 3201, "text": "Personal."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "I even told him that I was shy around the girls."}, {"time": 3206, "text": "He was giving you relationship advice or what?"}, {"time": 3209, "text": "How old was he?"}, {"time": 3210, "text": "So what was the dynamic?"}, {"time": 3211, "text": "Can you tell me, was it a father, son?"}, {"time": 3213, "text": "No, older brother."}, {"time": 3216, "text": "Yeah, he was maybe in his early to mid 30s and I was maybe 10 years younger."}, {"time": 3222, "text": "And what languages did he speak?"}, {"time": 3223, "text": "He spoke German pretty well."}, {"time": 3226, "text": "But he's originally from Russia?"}, {"time": 3228, "text": "Yeah, with a Russian accent."}, {"time": 3230, "text": "So I got in trouble one time with him when I asked him, is your real name German?"}, {"time": 3237, "text": "He didn't like that."}, {"time": 3239, "text": "Was he good with girls?"}, {"time": 3241, "text": "I remember what he told me, he says, you've got to understand one thing, they're looking for guys too."}, {"time": 3251, "text": "Oh, girls are looking for guys too?"}, {"time": 3255, "text": "It's a competitive game."}, {"time": 3258, "text": "So that little flame of love that we talked about and all the shapes that it takes in our life, did he talk to you about that, that that could be taken advantage of, that that could be used or was it implied?"}, {"time": 3272, "text": "Yeah, but not in, it was not very focused, not in great detail."}, {"time": 3276, "text": "So let's, so we talked about personal stuff and you know, like, dislikes, he gave me tasks."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "For instance, when my friend and I hitchhiked from East Germany all the way down to Bulgaria, he told me to write a report about it, what I saw."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "So fundamentally he wanted to see how well I can write and how well I can report, how well I observe."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "He also asked me to write some profiles about fellow students."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "I don't believe that was for them to give him to the Stasi, it was just like, how well do I characterize people?"}, {"time": 3314, "text": "That's important when you're talking about, when I was in the US, active in the US I operated as a spotter."}, {"time": 3322, "text": "So I did exactly that."}, {"time": 3323, "text": "I wrote profiles about people."}, {"time": 3326, "text": "He also gave me some tasks to do that were rather unpleasant."}, {"time": 3336, "text": "He would give me an address and a name of the people who lived at the address and he told me to go there, ring the doorbell and find out something about a relative who lived in West Germany."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "That is undercover exploration, right?"}, {"time": 3355, "text": "So you go, you make up a story and somehow win the confidence of your target to tell you something that you want to know."}, {"time": 3364, "text": "Was that, did that come naturally to you?"}, {"time": 3366, "text": "No, no, I hated it."}, {"time": 3367, "text": "The charisma involved, which part did you hate?"}, {"time": 3369, "text": "Charisma, I think, I

shine."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "So, but anyway, I hated doing that, but I did it well."}, {"time": 3399, "text": "So I, in those days, I had a beard and I rang the bell and..."}, {"time": 3406, "text": "Tall, handsome fella."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "And I looked the part, I said, I'm a sociology student and I'm doing a survey and I asked a whole bunch of questions, would you like to answer the questions?"}, {"time": 3420, "text": "And then I directed the conversation to the lady's private life and she actually gave me information."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "She volunteered information that I wanted to know."}, {"time": 3434, "text": "I did well."}, {"time": 3435, "text": "And the other one that I didn't like, but I also did well with, when Herman drove me around the city and showed me a building and he said, find out what organization is in there, what they do."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "We get to know some people and I did that pretty well also."}, {"time": 3453, "text": "You

a year later we moved into the suburbs and then I said, we should have another child and we had another child."}, {"time": 11464, "text": "So and I had a career where I did pretty well."}, {"time":

with a typewriter and then put the pieces of paper into some kind of a container and buried this in his stash."}, {"time": 11557, "text": "It was, I believe in 1992 when he showed up, that was already the Soviet Union was gone."}, {"time": 11565, "text": "So he showed up at the US embassy in Moscow and told him what he had and it was on a weekend and apparently there was a junior person in charge and he said, you know what, what you got, we are not interested and it's really old."}, {"time": 11580, "text": "It's a career limiting move, right, because Vasily Mitrokhin then made his way to one of the Baltic republics and contacted MI6 and they said, come on in, old fellow, have a cup of tea."}, {"time": 11599, "text": "And so they managed to get this stuff out of the Dacha and get it to

of Jack Barsky who is an illegal operating in the northeast of the United States."}, {"time": 11622, "text": "Now if it was Jim Miller, they wouldn't have found me, Jack Barsky was easy to find."},

wasn't illegal, that I was still living there, they didn't know whether I was active, inactive and the other thing that they knew that I was a really, really well trained agent because I was still there, right."}, {"time": 11655, "text": "So they took, I think, almost three years to investigate me, watch me from a distance because if I was still active, I would have found out that somebody is investigating me."}, {"time": 11670, "text": "So you started being less and less active in terms of... Oh, I stopped completely."}, {"time": 11674, "text": "What I mean is... Oh, surveillance detection."}, {"time": 11676, "text": "Yes, surveillance detection."}, {"time": 11677, "text": "After three months, I stopped altogether."}, {"time": 11681, "text": "Yeah, good point."}, {"time": 11682, "text": "And FBI is still very careful."}, {"time": 11684, "text": "They were very careful."}, {"time": 11685, "text": "They pretty much watched me and at one point, I had a house in the country with one neighbor, at one point that house was for sale, so the FBI bought it and they put a couple of agents there and just didn't keep a closer eye on me."}, {"time": 11701,

along very well."}, {"time": 11724, "text": "There was a lot of friction and she was constantly complaining about things and I got sick and tired of it and one day we had an argument in the kitchen

her."}, {"time": 11752, "text": "If something doesn't quite fit, it is not because I don't love the both of them, Chelsea and Penelope."}, {"time": 11759, "text": "So when I said that, the listening

that also made it clear to the FBI that I wasn't active anymore."}, {"time": 11786, "text": "They had both of that."}, {"time": 11787, "text": "So now they knew an attempt to turn me would have been useless because you turned somebody who was active, but they figured there was enough reason to treat me nicely because they figured I had a lot of information that was as aged as it was, but it was still important for the FBI to get to know."}, {"time": 11816, "text": "And so one day, it was a Friday evening, I'm driving back home from the office and I'm being stopped by a state police."},

right?"}, {"time": 11866, "text": "Routine traffic stop."}, {"time": 11867, "text": "Yeah, I did it, no problem."}, {"time": 11869, "text": "And then again, somebody came from the right, came into my

my last child."}, {"time": 11891, "text": "Anyway, he told me later that when I heard that phrase, all the blood left my face, I became totally white."}, {"time": 11904, "text": "But I recovered very quickly and he said it himself, so they took me to a vehicle and there was another agent in the vehicle and he had a gun strapped to his ankle, so it was pretty real."}, {"time": 11922, "text": "First question I had, so am I under arrest?"}, {"time": 11924, "text": "And the answer was no."}, {"time": 11927, "text": "And then my instinct kicked in and my ability to operate very well under high pressure situations."}, {"time": 11937, "text": "And I asked him, so what took you so long?"}, {"time": 11941, "text": "You know, the intent of that was to defuse any kind of tension."}, {"time": 11952, "text": "And I saw a smile."}, {"time": 11955, "text": "Instant friends."}, {"time": 11956, "text": "Yeah, I knew that I had to make them like me and I'm, I think by now I know I'm a pretty likable person."}, {"time": 11971, "text": "And I, when they took me to a motel, which they had rented, there was two wings at a right angle, they bought all the rooms in one wing and they had a guard at each end of that wing and they took me in the middle and there were some props there, some binders with labels and I immediately thought, this is pretty silly because what I noticed that the labels all referred back to my early years."}, {"time": 12007, "text": "I knew that they didn't know much else."}, {"time": 12010, "text": "So I told Joe that afterwards and that was not a great idea, but anyway."}, {"time": 12019, "text": "But I volunteered."}, {"time": 12020, "text": "I made the following statement before we even started the interview."}, {"time": 12024, "text": "I said, I know there's only one way for me to, and my family, to have a chance to get through here without much damages if I'm completely 100% cooperative and it's my intent to do exactly that."}, {"time": 12040,

already that they would let me go."}, {"time": 12051, "text": "And after two hours they let me go."}, {"time": 12055, "text": "But they had the area covered with a whole bunch of people."}, {"time": 12060, "text": "And the head of that team talked to me and he said, if you think of running, we got every intersection in this area covered."}, {"time": 12070, "text": "I didn't say anything, but you know, I had no thought of running."}, {"time": 12076, "text": "So and that was the beginning of another phase of my life where I was cooperating with the FBI for quite a while and living still

recently."}, {"time": 12099, "text": "Quite recent."}, {"time": 12100, "text": "The hypocrisy took a long time to figure out how to make me real and also not put me in these witness protection program, you know, to keep my name and then just, you know, make everything like official."}, {"time": 12117, "text": "So for instance, I had to change my birth year simply because if I, Jack Barsky was born in 1944, if I kept 1944, the FBI would have helped me commit a crime because I would have collected social security four years sooner."}, {"time": 12135, "text": "So anyway, yes, it took quite a while."}, {"time": 12140, "text": "And when I finally got the call from the office of Homeland Security, the lady says, this is agent so and so from Homeland Security, can you come into the office tomorrow?"}, {"time": 12157, "text": "And I said, let me look at my calendar."}, {"time": 12162, "text": "And then I said, wait a minute, what am I talking about?"}, {"time": 12165, "text":

with a relative, with a half brother of my wife who lives in Germany, was taken to Germany by his mother who came to visit somebody, not us, but that somebody that he came to visit lived 50 miles from
