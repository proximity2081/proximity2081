you know two minutes?"}, {"time": 263, "text": "Or was there a reckless let's just go with it and see?"}, {"time": 266, "text": "We weren't very good at BattleBots."}, {"time": 270, "text": "We lost all of our matches the first round."}, {"time": 274, "text": "The one I built first, both of them were these wedge shaped robots because wedge, even though it's sort of boring to look at, is extremely effective."}, {"time": 280, "text": "You drive towards another robot and the front edge of it gets under them and then they sort of flip over, kind of like a door stopper."}, {"time": 286, "text": "And the first one had a pneumatic polished stainless steel spike on the front that would shoot out about eight inches."}, {"time": 293, "text": "The purpose of which is what?"}, {"time": 293, "text": "Pretty, pretty ineffective actually, but it looks cool."}, {"time": 298, "text": "And was it to help with the lift?"}, {"time": 298, "text": "No, it was, it was just to try to poke holes in the other robot."}, {"time": 302, "text": "And then the second time I did it, which is the following, I think maybe 18 months later, we had a, well a titanium axe with a, with a hardened steel tip on it that was powered by a hydraulic cylinder which we were activating with liquid CO2, which was, had its own set of problems."}, {"time": 321, "text": "So great, so that's kind of on the hardware side."}, {"time": 326, "text": "I mean at a certain point there must have been born a fascination on the software side."}, {"time": 331, "text": "So what was the first piece of code you've written?"}, {"time": 335, "text": "Go back there, see what language was it?"}, {"time": 338, "text": "What, what was that?"}, {"time": 338, "text": "Was it Emacs?"}, {"time": 338, "text": "Vim?"}, {"time": 338, "text": "Was it a more respectable modern IDE?"}, {"time": 341, "text": "Do you, do you remember any of this?"}, {"time": 345, "text": "Yeah, well I remember, I think maybe when I was in third or fourth grade, the school I was at, elementary school, had a bunch of Apple II computers and we'd play games on those."}, {"time": 352, "text": "And I remember every once in a while something would, would, would crash or wouldn't start up correctly and it would dump you out to what I later learned was like sort of a command prompt."}, {"time": 365, "text": "And my teacher would come over and type, I actually remember this to this day for some reason, like PR number six or PR pound six, which is peripheral six, which is the disk drive, which would fire up the disk and load the program."}, {"time": 375, "text": "And I just remember thinking wow, she's like a hacker, like teach me these, these codes, these error codes, that is what I called them at the time."}, {"time": 381, "text": "But she had no interest in that, so it wasn't until I think about fifth grade that I had a school where you could actually go on these Apple IIs and learn to program."}, {"time": 388, "text": "And so it was all in basic, you know, where every line, you know, the line numbers are all number, that every line is numbered and you have to like leave enough space between the numbers so that if you want to tweak your code you go back and the first line was 10 and the second line is 20."}, {"time": 401, "text": "Now you have to go back and insert 15 and if you need to add code in front of that, you know, 11 or 12 and you hope you don't run out of line numbers and have to redo the whole thing."}, {"time": 410, "text": "And there's go to statements?"}, {"time": 410, "text": "Yeah, go to and it's very basic, maybe hence the name, but a lot of fun."}, {"time": 418, "text": "And that was like, that was, you know, that's when, you know, when you first program you see the magic of it."}, {"time": 423, "text": "It's like, it just, just like this world opens up with, you know, endless possibilities for the things you could build or or accomplish with that computer."}, {"time": 429, "text": "So you got the bug then, so even starting with basic and then what C++ throughout, what did you, was there computer programming, computer science classes in high school?"}, {"time": 439, "text": "Not, not where I went, so it was self taught, but I did a lot of programming."}, {"time": 470, "text": "And I remember thinking even then with my sort of mediocre programming background that this is something that a computer can do, right?"}, {"time": 477, "text": "Let's take a picture of the road, let's find the yellow lane markers and, you know, steer the wheel."}, {"time": 483, "text": "And, you know, later I'd come to realize this had been done, you know, since, since the 80s or the 70s or even earlier, but I still wanted to do it and sort of immediately after that trip switched from sort of BattleBots, which is more radio controlled machines, to thinking about building, you know, autonomous vehicles of some scale."}, {"time": 501, "text": "Start off with really small electric ones and then, you know, progress to what we're doing now."}, {"time": 507, "text": "So what was your view of artificial intelligence at that point?"}, {"time": 510, "text": "What did you think?"}, {"time": 510, "text": "So this is before, there's been waves in artificial intelligence, right?"}, {"time": 515, "text": "The current wave with deep learning makes people believe that you can solve in a really rich deep way the computer vision perception problem, but like in before the deep learning craze, you know, how do you think about, how would you even go about building a thing that perceives itself in the world, localizes itself in the world, moves around the world?"}, {"time": 539, "text": "Like when you were younger, I mean, what was your thinking about it?"}, {"time": 571, "text": "Traffic light detection and stop sign detection, red, yellow, green."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Traffic light detection, probably a really simple, you know, color thresholding on day one just to get the system up and running before you migrate to, you know, a deep learning based technique or something else."}, {"time": 610, "text": "And, you know, back in when I was doing this, my first one, it was on a Pentium 203, 233 megahertz computer in it and I think I wrote the first version in basic, which is like an interpreted language."}, {"time": 619, "text": "It's extremely slow because that's the thing I knew at the time."}, {"time": 624, "text": "And so there was no, no chance at all of using, there was no, no computational power to do any sort of reasonable deep nets like you have today."}, {"time": 632, "text": "So I don't know what kids these days are doing."}, {"time": 632, "text": "Are kids these days, you know, at age 13 using neural networks in their garage?"}, {"time": 638, "text": "I mean, that would be awesome."}, {"time": 640, "text": "I get emails all the time from, you know, like 11, 12 year olds saying I'm having, you know, I'm trying to follow this TensorFlow tutorial and I'm having this problem."}, {"time": 648, "text": "And the general approach in the deep learning community is of extreme optimism of, as opposed to, you mentioned like heuristics, you can, you can, you can separate the autonomous driving problem into modules and try to solve it sort of rigorously, or you can just do it end to end."}, {"time": 668, "text": "And most people just kind of love the idea that, you know, us humans do it end to end."}, {"time": 672, "text": "We just perceive and act."}, {"time": 672, "text": "We should be able to use that, do the same kind of thing when you're on nets."}, {"time": 677, "text": "And that, that kind of thinking, you don't want to criticize that kind of thinking because eventually they will be right."}, {"time": 683, "text": "And so it's exciting and especially when they're younger to explore that as a really exciting approach."}, {"time": 686, "text": "But yeah, it's, it's changed the, the language, the kind of stuff you're tinkering with."}, {"time": 695, "text": "It's kind of exciting to see when these teenagers grow up."}, {"time": 698, "text": "I can only imagine if you, if your starting point is, you know, Python and TensorFlow at age 13 where you end up, you know, after 10 or 15 years of that, that's, that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 709, "text": "Because of GitHub, because the state tools for solving most of the major problems in artificial intelligence are within a few lines of code for most kids."}, {"time": 720, "text": "And that's incredible to think about also on the entrepreneurial side."}, {"time": 724, "text": "And, and on that point, was there any thought about entrepreneurship before you came to college?"}, {"time": 730, "text": "Is sort of doing, you're building this into a thing that impacts the world on a large scale?"}, {"time": 734, "text": "I've always wanted to start a company."}, {"time": 738, "text": "I think that's, you know, just a cool concept of creating something and exchanging it for value or creating value, I guess."}, {"time": 748, "text": "So in high school, I was, I was trying to build like, you know, servo motor drivers, little circuit boards and sell them online or other, other things like that."}, {"time": 755, "text": "And certainly knew at some point I wanted to do a startup, but it wasn't really, I'd say until college, until I felt like I had the, I guess the right combination of the environment, the smart people around you and some free time and a lot of free time at MIT."}, {"time": 772, "text": "So you came to MIT as an undergrad 2004."}, {"time": 772, "text": "And that's when the first DARPA Grand Challenge was happening."}, {"time": 778, "text": "The, the timing of that is beautifully poetic."}, {"time": 782, "text": "So how did you get yourself involved in that one?"}, {"time": 785, "text": "Originally there wasn't a official entry."}, {"time": 785, "text": "Yeah, faculty sponsored thing."}, {"time": 785, "text": "And so a bunch of undergrads, myself included, started meeting and got together and tried to haggle together some sponsorships."}, {"time": 794, "text": "We got a vehicle donated, a bunch of sensors and tried to put something together."}, {"time": 798, "text": "And so we had, our team was probably mostly freshmen and sophomores, you know, which, which was not really a fair, fair fight against maybe the, you know, postdoc and faculty led teams from other schools."}, {"time": 810, "text": "But we, we got something up and running."}, {"time": 813, "text": "We had our vehicle drive by wire and you know, very, very basic control and things."}, {"time": 816, "text": "But on the day of the qualifying, sort of pre qualifying round, the one and only steering motor that we had purchased, the thing that we had retrofitted to turn the steering wheel on the truck died."}, {"time": 835, "text": "And so our vehicle was just dead in the water, couldn't steer."}, {"time": 838, "text": "So we didn't make it very far."}, {"time": 838, "text": "On the hardware side."}, {"time": 838, "text": "So was there a software component?"}, {"time": 842, "text": "Was there, like, how did your view of autonomous vehicles in terms of artificial intelligence evolve in this moment?"}, {"time": 849, "text": "I mean, you know, like you said from the 80s has been autonomous vehicles, but really that was the birth of the modern wave."}, {"time": 856, "text": "The, the thing that captivated everyone's imagination that we can actually do this."}, {"time": 861, "text": "So what, how were you captivated in that way?"}, {"time": 865, "text": "So how did your view of autonomous vehicles change at that point?"}, {"time": 868, "text": "I'd say at that point in time it was, it was a curiosity as in, like, is this really possible?"}, {"time": 875, "text": "And I think that was generally the spirit and the purpose of that original DARPA Grand Challenge, which was to just get a whole bunch of really brilliant people exploring the space and pushing the limits."}, {"time": 912, "text": "So that was pretty cool."}, {"time": 916, "text": "So let me jump around a little bit on that point."}, {"time": 920, "text": "They also did the Urban Challenge where it was in the city, but it was very artificial and there's no pedestrians and there's very little human involvement except a few professional drivers."}, {"time": 931, "text": "Do you think there's room, and then there was the Robotics Challenge with humanoid robots."}, {"time": 934, "text": "So in your now role is looking at this, you're trying to solve one of the, you know, autonomous driving, one of the harder, more difficult places in San Francisco."}, {"time": 945, "text": "Is there a role for DARPA to step in to also kind of help out, like, challenge with new ideas, specifically pedestrians and so on, all these kinds of interesting things?"}, {"time": 954, "text": "Well, I haven't, I haven't thought about it from that perspective."}, {"time": 956, "text": "Is there anything DARPA could do today to further accelerate things?"}, {"time": 959, "text": "And I would say, my instinct is that that's maybe not the highest and best use of their resources and time, because, like, kick starting and spinning up the flywheel is, I think, what what they did in this case for very, very little money."}, {"time": 971, "text": "But today this has become, this has become, like, commercially interesting to very large companies and the amount of money going into it and the amount of people, like, going through your class and learning about these things and developing these skills is just, you know, orders of magnitude more than it was back then."}, {"time": 989, "text": "And so there's enough momentum and inertia and energy and investment dollars into this space right now that I don't, I don't, I think they're, I think they're, they can just say mission accomplished and move on to the next area of technology that needs help."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "So then stepping back to MIT, you left MIT during your junior year."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "What was that decision like?"}, {"time": 1084, "text": "So no regrets?"}, {"time": 1084, "text": "Looking back, it was just an obvious, I mean, one way ticket."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "I mean, if we just pause on that for a second, there was no, how did you know these are the right guys, this is the right decision, you didn't think it was just follow the heart kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1101, "text": "Well, I didn't know, but, you know, just trying something for a month during IAP seems pretty low risk, right?"}, {"time": 1108, "text": "And then, you know, well, maybe I'll take a semester off, MIT's pretty flexible about that, you can always go back, right?"}, {"time": 1111, "text": "And then after two or three cycles of that, I eventually threw in the towel, but, you know, I think it's, I guess in that case I felt like I could always hit the undo button if I had to."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "But nevertheless, from when you look in retrospect, I mean, it seems like a brave decision, you know, it would be difficult for a lot of people to make."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "It wasn't as popular, I'd say that the general, you know, flux of people out of MIT at the time was mostly into, you know, finance or consulting jobs in Boston or New York, and very few people were going to California to start companies, but today I'd say that's, it's probably inverted, which is just a sign of, a sign of the times, I guess."}, {"time": 1154, "text": "So there's a story about midnight of March 18, 2007, where TechCrunch, I guess, announced Justin.TV earlier than it was supposed to, a few hours."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "The site didn't work."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "I don't know if any of this is true, you can tell me."}, {"time": 1172, "text": "And you and one of the folks at Justin.TV, Emmett Shearer, coded through the night."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "Can you take me through that experience?"}, {"time": 1181, "text": "So let me, let me say a few nice things that, the article I read quoted Justin Kahn said that you were known for bureau coding through problems and being a creative, quote, creative genius."}, {"time": 1192, "text": "So on that night, what, what was going through your head, or maybe I'd put another way, how do you solve these problems?"}, {"time": 1200, "text": "What's your approach to solving these kinds of problems where the line between success and failure seems to be pretty thin?"}, {"time": 1208, "text": "Well, first of all, that's, that's a nice of Justin to say that."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "I think, you know, I would have been maybe 21 years old then and not very experienced at programming, but as with, with everything in a startup, you're sort of racing against the clock."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "And so our plan was the second we had this live streaming camera backpack up and running, where Justin could wear it and no matter where he went in a city, it would be streaming live video."}, {"time": 1235, "text": "And this is even before the iPhones."}, {"time": 1236, "text": "This is like hard to do back then."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "We would launch."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "And so we thought we were there and the backpack was working and then we sent out all the emails to launch the, launch the company and do the press thing."}, {"time": 1247, "text": "And then, you know, we weren't quite actually there."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "And then we thought, oh, well, you know, they're not going to announce it until maybe 10 a.m. the next morning."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "And it's, I don't know, it's 5 p.m. now."}, {"time": 1258, "text": "So how many hours do we have left?"}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Like, you know, 17 hours to go."}, {"time": 1266, "text": "And, and that was, that was going to be fine."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "Was the problem obvious?"}, {"time": 1270, "text": "Did you understand what could possibly, like, how complicated was the system at that point?"}, {"time": 1276, "text": "It was, it was pretty messy."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So to get a live video feed that looked decent working from anywhere in San Francisco, I put together this system where we had like three or four cell phone data modems and they were, like, we take the video stream and, you know, sort of spray it across these three or four modems and then try to catch all the packets on the other side, you know, with unreliable cell phone networks."}, {"time": 1299, "text": "It's pretty low level networking."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "Yeah, and putting these, like, you know, sort of protocols on top of all that to, to reassemble and reorder the packets and have time buffers and error correction and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "And the night before it was just staticky."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "Every once in a while the image would, would go to staticky and there would be this horrible, like, screeching audio noise because the audio was also corrupted."}, {"time": 1321, "text": "And this would happen, like, every five to ten minutes or so and it was a really, you know, off putting to the viewers."}, {"time": 1328, "text": "How do you tackle that problem?"}, {"time": 1328, "text": "What was the, uh, you're just freaking out behind a computer."}, {"time": 1332, "text": "There's, are there other, other folks working on this problem?"}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Like, were you behind a whiteboard?"}, {"time": 1336, "text": "Were you doing, uh, Yeah, it was a little, it was a little, yeah, it's a little lonely because there's four of us working on the company and only two people really wrote code."}, {"time": 1346, "text": "And Emmett wrote the website and the chat system and I wrote the software for this video streaming device and video server."}, {"time": 1354, "text": "And so, you know, it's my sole responsibility to figure that out."}, {"time": 1357, "text": "And I think, I think it's those, you know, setting, setting deadlines, trying to move quickly and everything where you're in that moment of intense pressure that sometimes people do their best and most interesting work."}, {"time": 1365, "text": "And so even though that was a terrible moment, I look back on it fondly because that's like, you know, that's one of those character defining moments, I think."}, {"time": 1371, "text": "So in 2013, October, you founded Cruise Automation."}, {"time": 1378, "text": "So progressing forward, another exceptionally successful company was acquired by GM in 16 for $1 billion."}, {"time": 1386, "text": "But in October 2013, what was on your mind?"}, {"time": 1394, "text": "What was the plan?"}, {"time": 1394, "text": "How does one seriously start to tackle one of the hardest robotics, most important impact for robotics problems of our age?"}, {"time": 1403, "text": "After going through Twitch, Twitch was, was, and is today, pretty successful."}, {"time": 1407, "text": "But the, the work was, the result was entertainment, mostly."}, {"time": 1415, "text": "Like, the better the product was, the more we would entertain people and then, you know, make money on the ad revenues and other things."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "And that was, that was a good thing."}, {"time": 1422, "text": "It felt, felt good to entertain people."}, {"time": 1424, "text": "But I figured like, you know, what is really the point of becoming a really good engineer and developing these skills other than, you know, my own enjoyment?"}, {"time": 1431, "text": "And I realized I wanted something that scratched more of an existential itch, like something that, that truly matters."}, {"time": 1436, "text": "And so I basically made this list of requirements for a new, if I was going to do another company, and the one thing I knew in the back of my head that Twitch took like eight years to become successful."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And so whatever I do, I better be willing to commit, you know, at least 10 years to something."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "And when you think about things from that perspective, you certainly, I think, raise the bar on what you choose to work on."}, {"time": 1460, "text": "So for me, the three things were it had to be something where the technology itself determines the success of the product, like hard, really juicy technology problems, because that's what motivates me."}, {"time": 1472, "text": "And then it had to have a direct and positive impact on society in some way."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "So an example would be like, you know, health care, self driving cars, because they save lives, other things where there's a clear connection to somehow improving other people's lives."}, {"time": 1485, "text": "And the last one is it had to be a big business, because for the positive impact to matter, it's got to be a large scale."}, {"time": 1491, "text": "And I was thinking about that for a while, and I made like, I tried writing a Gmail clone and looked at some other ideas."}, {"time": 1497, "text": "And then it just sort of light bulb went off, like self driving cars, like that was the most fun I had ever had in college working on that."}, {"time": 1503, "text": "And like, well, what's the state of the technology?"}, {"time": 1503, "text": "It's been 10 years."}, {"time": 1507, "text": "Maybe times have changed, and maybe now is the time to make this work."}, {"time": 1510, "text": "And I poked around and looked at, the only other thing out there really at the time was the Google self driving car project."}, {"time": 1516, "text": "And I thought, surely there's a way to, you know, have an entrepreneur mindset and sort of solve the minimum viable product here."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "And so I just took the plunge right then and there and said, this is something I know I can commit 10 years to."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "It's the probably the greatest applied AI problem of our generation."}, {"time": 1529, "text": "And if it works, it's going to be both a huge business and therefore like, probably the most positive impact I can possibly have on the world."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "So after that light bulb went off, I went all in on cruise immediately and got to work."}, {"time": 1545, "text": "Did you have an idea how to solve this problem?"}, {"time": 1545, "text": "Which aspect of the problem to solve?"}, {"time": 1548, "text": "You know, slow, like we just had Oliver from Voyage here, slow moving retirement communities, urban driving, highway driving."}, {"time": 1556, "text": "Did you have, like, did you have a vision of the city of the future where, you know, the transportation is largely automated, that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 1565, "text": "Or was it sort of more fuzzy and gray area than that?"}, {"time": 1569, "text": "My analysis of the situation is that Google is putting a lot, had been putting a lot of money into that project."}, {"time": 1575, "text": "They had a lot more resources."}, {"time": 1579, "text": "And so, and they still hadn't cracked the fully driverless car."}, {"time": 1583, "text": "You know, this is 2013, I guess."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "So I thought, what can I do to sort of go from zero to, you know, significant scale so I can actually solve the real problem, which is the driverless cars."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "And I thought, here's the strategy."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "We'll start by doing a really simple problem or solving a really simple problem that creates value for people."}, {"time": 1604, "text": "So, eventually ended up deciding on automating highway driving, which is relatively more straightforward as long as there's a backup driver there."}, {"time": 1615, "text": "And, you know, the go to market will be able to retrofit people's cars and just sell these products directly."}, {"time": 1619, "text": "And the idea was, we'll take all the revenue and profits from that and use it to do the, so sort of reinvest that in research for doing fully driverless cars."}, {"time": 1630, "text": "And that was the plan."}, {"time": 1633, "text": "The only thing that really changed along the way between then and now is we never really launched the first product."}, {"time": 1637, "text": "We had enough interest from investors and enough of a signal that this was something that we should be working on, that after about a year of working on the highway autopilot, we had it working, you know, on a prototype stage."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "But we just completely abandoned that and said, we're going to go all in on driverless cars now is the time."}, {"time": 1656, "text": "Can't think of anything that's more exciting and if it works more impactful, so we're just going to go for it."}, {"time": 1659, "text": "The idea of retrofit is kind of interesting."},

vehicle fails and causes your system to fail, whose fault is it?"}, {"time": 1711, "text": "Or if the car's anti lock brake systems or other things kick in or the software has been, it's different in

tail issues that can get you."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "And if you're dealing with a safety critical product, that's not really acceptable."}, {"time": 1728, "text": "That's a really convincing

really strong one."}, {"time": 1737, "text": "Because that's how you achieve scale and that's how you beat the current, the leader at the time of Google or the only one in the market."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "The other big problem we ran into, which is perhaps the biggest problem from a business model perspective, is we had kind of assumed that we started with an Audi S4 as the vehicle we retrofitted with this highway driving capability."}, {"time": 1758, "text": "And we had kind of assumed that if we just knock out like three make and models of vehicles, that'll cover like 80% of the San Francisco market."}, {"time": 1765, "text": "Doesn't everyone there drive, I don't know, a BMW or a Honda Civic or one of these three cars?"}, {"time": 1768, "text": "And then we surveyed our users and we found out that it's all over the place."}, {"time": 1772, "text": "We would, to get even a decent number of units sold, we'd have to support like, you know, 20 or 50 different models."},

it was a tough business."}, {"time": 1787, "text": "So GM manufactures and sells over 9 million cars a year."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "And what you with Cruise are trying to do some of the most

within the attitude inside a car company like that is, you know, embracing this transformation and change rather than fearing it."}, {"time": 1841, "text": "And I think that's a testament to the

{"time": 1851, "text": "So starting from that position makes it a lot easier so then when the people in San Francisco at Cruise interact with the people at GM, at least we have this common set of values, which is that we really want this stuff to work because we think it's important and we think it's the future."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "That's not to say, you know, those two cultures don't clash."}, {"time": 1868, "text": "They absolutely do."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "There's different sort of value systems."}, {"time": 1872, "text": "Like in a car company, the thing that gets you promoted and sort of the reward system is following the processes, delivering the program on time and on budget."}, {"time": 1883, "text": "So any sort of risk taking is discouraged in many ways

know, most Silicon Valley companies and in Cruise and the methodology we were employing, especially around the time of the acquisition, the reward structure is about trying to solve these complex problems in any way shape or form or coming up with crazy ideas that, you know, 90% of them won't work."}, {"time": 1917, "text": "And so meshing that culture of sort of continuous improvement and experimentation with one where everything needs to be rigorously defined up front so that you never slip a deadline or miss a budget was a pretty big challenge."}, {"time": 1932, "text": "And that we're over three years in now after the acquisition and I'd say like, you know, the investment we made in figuring out how to work together successfully and who should do what and how we bridge the gaps between these very different systems and way of doing engineering work is now one of our greatest assets because I think we have this really powerful thing."}, {"time": 1951, "text": "But for a while it was both GM and Cruise were very steep on the learning curve."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "Yeah, so I'm sure it was very stressful."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "It's really important work because that's how to revolutionize the transportation, really to revolutionize any system."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "You know, you look at the health care system or you look at the legal system."}, {"time":

the data is still on paper."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "And so the same thing was with automotive."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "I mean, it's fundamentally software."}, {"time": 2003, "text": "It's

deadline."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "So and then on GM."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "That's probably true, yeah."}, {"time": 2014, "text": "And GM side is probably the opposite."}, {"time": 2018,

impressive."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And I think like especially in Silicon Valley, it's easy to write off building cars because, you know, people have been doing that for over 100 years now in this country."}, {"time": 2031, "text": "And so it seems like that's a solved problem, but that doesn't mean it's an easy problem."}, {"time": 2038, "text": "And I think it would be easy to sort of

{"time": 2048, "text": "Therefore, it's, you know, it's not a real engineering challenge."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "But after having seen just the sheer scale and magnitude and industrialization that occurs inside of an automotive assembly plant, that is a lot of work that I am very glad that we don't have to reinvent to make self driving cars work."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "And so to have, you know, partners who have done that for 100 years now, these great processes and this huge infrastructure and supply base that we can tap into is just remarkable because the scope and surface area of the problem of deploying fleets of self driving cars is so large that we're constantly looking for ways to do less so we can focus on the things that really matter more."}, {"time": 2090, "text": "And if we had to figure out how to build and assemble and you know, build the cars themselves."}, {"time": 2097, "text": "I mean, we work closely with GM on that."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "But if we had to develop all that capability in house as well, you know, that would just make the problem really intractable, I think."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "So yeah, just like your first entry at the MIT DARPA challenge when there was what the motor that failed, somebody that knows what they're doing with the motor did it."}, {"time": 2118, "text": "That would have been nice if we could focus on the software, not the hardware platform."}, {"time": 2123, "text": "So from your perspective now, you know, there's so many ways that autonomous vehicles can impact society in the next year, five years, ten years."}, {"time": 2134, "text": "What do you think is the biggest opportunity to make money in autonomous driving, sort of make it a financially viable thing in the near term?"}, {"time": 2144, "text": "What do you think will be the biggest impact there?"}, {"time": 2149, "text": "Well, the things that drive the economics for fleets of self driving cars are, there's sort of a handful of variables."}, {"time": 2153, "text": "One is, you know, the cost to build the vehicle itself."}, {"time": 2157, "text": "So the material cost, how many, you know, what's the cost of all your sensors plus the cost of the vehicle and every all the other components on it."}, {"time": 2165, "text": "Another one is the lifetime of the vehicle."}, {"time": 2168, "text": "It's very different if your vehicle drives 100,000 miles and then it falls apart versus, you know, two million."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "And then, you know, if you have a fleet, it's kind of like an airplane or an airline where once you produce the vehicle, you want it to be in operation as many hours a day as possible producing revenue."}, {"time": 2190, "text": "And then, you know, the other piece of that is how are you generating revenue?"}, {"time": 2194, "text": "I think that's kind of what you're asking."}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And I think the obvious things today are, you know, the ride sharing business because that's pretty clear that there's demand for that, there's existing markets you can tap into and large urban areas, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 2206, "text": "And I think that there are some real benefits to having cars without drivers compared to sort of the status quo for people who use ride share services today."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "You know, you get privacy, consistency, hopefully significantly improve safety, all these benefits versus the current product."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "But it's a crowded market."}, {"time": 2224, "text": "And then other opportunities, which you've seen a lot of activity in the last, really in the last six or twelve months, is, you know, delivery, whether that's parcels and packages, food or groceries."}, {"time": 2234, "text": "Those are all sort of, I think, opportunities that are pretty ripe for these, you know, once you have this core technology, which is the fleet of autonomous vehicles, there's all sorts of different business opportunities you can build on top of that."}, {"time": 2251, "text": "But I think the important thing, of course, is that there's zero monetization opportunity until you actually have that fleet of very capable driverless cars that are that are as good or better than humans."}, {"time": 2260, "text": "And that's sort of where the entire industry is sort of in this holding pattern right now."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "Yeah, they're trying to achieve that baseline."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "So, but you said sort of not reliability, consistency."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "It's kind of interesting, I think I heard you say somewhere, I'm not sure if that's what you meant, but you know, I can imagine a situation where you would get an autonomous vehicle and, you know, when you get into an Uber or Lyft, you don't get to choose the driver in a sense that you don't get to choose the personality of the driving."}, {"time": 2287, "text": "Do you think there's a, there's room to define the personality of the car the way it drives you in terms of aggressiveness, for example, in terms of sort of pushing the bound?"}, {"time": 2299, "text": "One of the biggest challenges of autonomous driving is the is the trade off between sort of safety and assertiveness."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "And do you think there's any room for the human to take a role in that decision?"}, {"time": 2310, "text": "Sort of accept some of the liability, I guess."}, {"time": 2316, "text": "I wouldn't, no, I'd say within reasonable bounds, as in we're not gonna, I think it'd be highly unlikely we'd expose any knob that would let you, you know, significantly increase safety risk."}, {"time": 2328, "text": "I think that's just not something we'd be willing to do."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "But I think driving style or like, you know, are you going to relax the comfort constraints slightly or things like that, all of those things make sense and are plausible."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "I see all those as, you know, nice optimizations."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "Once again, we get the core problem solved in these fleets out there."}, {"time": 2347, "text": "But the other thing we've sort of observed is that you have this intuition that if you sort of slam your foot on the gas right after the light turns green and aggressively accelerate, you're going to get there faster."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "But the actual impact of doing that is pretty small."}, {"time": 2362, "text": "You feel like you're getting there faster, but so the same would be true for AVs."}, {"time": 2365, "text": "Even if they don't slam their, you know, the pedal to the floor when the light turns green, they're going to get you there within, you know, if it's a 15 minute trip, within 30 seconds of what you would have done otherwise if you were going really aggressively."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "So I think there's this sort of self deception that my aggressive driving style is getting me there faster."}, {"time": 2384, "text": "Well, so that's, you know, some of the things I've studied, some of the things I'm fascinated by the psychology of that."}, {"time": 2386, "text": "I don't think it matters that it doesn't get you there faster."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "It's the emotional release."}, {"time": 2395, "text": "Driving is a place, being inside of a car, somebody said it's like the real world version of being a troll."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "So you have this protection, this mental protection, you're able to sort of yell at the world, like release your anger, whatever."}, {"time": 2408, "text": "So there's an element of that that I think autonomous vehicles would also have to, you know, giving an outlet to people, but it doesn't have to be through, through, through driving or honking or so on."}, {"time": 2419, "text": "There might be other outlets, but I think to just sort of even just put that aside, the baseline is really, you know, that's the focus."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "That's the thing you need to solve."}, {"time": 2428, "text": "And then the fun human things can be solved after."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "But so from the baseline of just solving autonomous driving, you're working in San Francisco, one of the more difficult cities to operate in."}, {"time": 2438, "text": "What is, what is the, in your view, currently the hardest aspect of autonomous driving?"}, {"time": 2445, "text": "Is it negotiating with pedestrians?"}, {"time": 2449, "text": "Is it edge cases of perception?"}, {"time": 2451, "text": "Is it planning?"}, {"time": 2452, "text": "Is there a mechanical engineering?"}, {"time": 2454, "text": "Is it data, fleet stuff?"}, {"time": 2457, "text": "What are your thoughts on the challenge, the more challenging aspects there?"}, {"time": 2460, "text": "That's a, that's a good question."}, {"time": 2462, "text": "I think before, before we go to that, though, I just want to, I like what you said about the psychology aspect of this, because I think one observation I've made is I think I read somewhere that I think it's maybe Americans on average spend, you know, over an hour a day on social media, like staring at Facebook."}, {"time": 2478, "text": "And so that's just, you know, 60 minutes of your life, you're not getting back."}, {"time": 2481, "text": "It's probably not super productive."}, {"time": 2483, "text": "And so that's 3,600 seconds, right?"}, {"time": 2486, "text": "And that's, that's time, you know, it's a lot of time you're giving up."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "And if you compare that to people being on the road, if another vehicle, whether it's a human driver or autonomous vehicle, delays them by even three seconds, they're laying in on the horn, you know, even though that's, that's, you know, one, one thousandth of the time they waste looking at Facebook every day."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "So there's, there's definitely some."}, {"time": 2508, "text": "You know, psychology aspects of this, I think that are pretty interesting road rage in general."}, {"time": 2511, "text": "And then the question of course is if everyone is in self driving cars, do they even notice these three second delays anymore?"}, {"time": 2517, "text": "Cause they're doing other things or reading or working or just talking to each other."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "So it'll be interesting to see where that goes."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "In a certain aspect, people, people need to be distracted by something entertaining, something useful inside the car."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "So they don't pay attention to the external world."}, {"time": 2530, "text": "And then, and then they can take whatever psychology and bring it back to Twitter and then focus on that as opposed to sort of interacting, sort of putting the emotion out there into the world."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "So it's a, it's an interesting problem, but baseline autonomy."}, {"time": 2546, "text": "I guess you could say self driving cars, you know, at scale will lower the collective blood pressure of society probably by a couple of points without all that road rage and stress."}, {"time": 2555, "text": "So that's a good, good external."}, {"time": 2558, "text": "So back to your question about the technology and the, I guess the biggest problems."}, {"time": 2563, "text": "And I have a hard time answering that question because, you know, we've been at this like specifically focusing on driverless cars and all the technology needed to enable that for a little over four and a half years now."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "And even a year or two in, I felt like we had completed the functionality needed to get someone from point A to point B."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "As in, if we need to do a left turn maneuver, or if we need to drive around at, you know, a double parked vehicle into oncoming traffic or navigate through construction zones, the scaffolding and the building blocks was there pretty early on."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "And so the challenge is not any one scenario or situation for which, you know, we fail at 100% of those."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "It's more, you know, we're benchmarking against a pretty good or pretty high standard, which is human driving."}, {"time": 2611, "text": "All things considered, humans are excellent at handling edge cases and unexpected scenarios where computers are the opposite."}, {"time": 2618, "text": "And so beating that baseline set by humans is the challenge."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "And so what we've been doing for quite some time now is basically, it's this continuous improvement process where we find sort of the most, you know, uncomfortable or the things that could lead to a safety issue or other things, all these events."}, {"time": 2640, "text": "And then we sort of categorize them and rework parts of our system to make incremental improvements and do that over and over and over again."}, {"time": 2647, "text": "And we just see sort of the overall performance of the system, you know, actually increasing in a pretty steady clip."}, {"time": 2653, "text": "But there's no one thing."}, {"time": 2655, "text": "There's actually like thousands of little things and just like polishing functionality and making sure that it handles, you know, every version and possible permutation of a situation by either applying more deep learning systems or just by, you know, adding more test coverage or new scenarios that we develop against and just grinding on that."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "We're sort of in the unsexy phase of development right now, which is doing the real engineering work that it takes to go from prototype to production."}, {"time": 2684, "text": "You're basically scaling the grinding, sort of taking seriously that the process of all those edge cases, both with human experts and machine learning methods to cover all those situations."}, {"time": 2699, "text": "And the exciting thing for me is I don't think that grinding ever stops because there's a moment in time where you've crossed that threshold of human performance and become superhuman."}, {"time": 2709, "text": "But there's no reason, there's no first principles reason that AV capability will tap out anywhere near humans."}, {"time": 2716, "text": "Like there's no reason it couldn't be 20 times better, whether that's, you know, just better driving or safer driving or more comfortable driving or even a thousand times better given enough time."}, {"time": 2725, "text": "And we intend to basically chase that, you know, forever to build the best possible product."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "Better and better and better."}, {"time": 2732, "text": "And always new edge cases come up and new experiences."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So, and you want to automate that process as much as possible."}, {"time": 2740, "text": "So what do you think in general in society?"}, {"time": 2743, "text": "When do you think we may have hundreds of thousands of fully autonomous vehicles driving around?"}, {"time": 2748, "text": "So first of all, predictions, nobody knows the future."}, {"time": 2752, "text": "You're a part of the leading people trying to define that future, but even then you still don't know."}, {"time": 2756, "text": "But if you think about hundreds of thousands of vehicles, so a significant fraction of vehicles in major cities are autonomous."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "Do you think, are you with Rodney Brooks, who is 2050 and beyond, or are you more with Elon Musk, who is, we should have had that two years ago?"}, {"time": 2779, "text": "Well, I mean, I'd love to have it two years ago, but we're not there yet."}, {"time": 2784, "text": "So I guess the way I would think about that is let's flip that question around."}, {"time": 2789, "text": "So what would prevent you to reach hundreds of thousands of vehicles?"}, {"time": 2794, "text": "And that's a good, that's a good rephrasing."}, {"time": 2797, "text": "So the, I'd say the, it seems the consensus among the people developing self driving cars today is to sort of start with some form of an easier environment, whether it means, you know, lacking inclement weather or, you know, mostly sunny or whatever it is."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "And then add, add capability for more complex situations over time."}, {"time": 2822, "text": "And so if you're only able to deploy in areas that meet sort of your criteria or the current domain, you know, operating domain of the software you developed, that may put a cap on how many cities you could deploy in."}, {"time": 2836, "text": "But then as those restrictions start to fall away, like maybe you add capability to drive really well and safely in heavy rain or snow, you know, that, that probably opens up the market by two, two or three fold in terms of the cities you can expand into and so on."}, {"time": 2851, "text": "And so the real question is, you know, I know today if we wanted to, we could produce that, that many autonomous vehicles, but we wouldn't be able to make use of all of them yet."}, {"time": 2859, "text": "Cause we would sort of saturate the demand in the cities in which we would want to operate initially."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "So if I were to guess like what the timeline is for those things falling away and reaching hundreds of thousands of vehicles, I would say that thousands of vehicles, maybe a range is better, I would say less than five years, less than five years."}, {"time": 2879, "text": "And of course you're working hard to make that happen."}, {"time": 2883, "text": "So you started two companies that were eventually acquired for each four billion dollars."}, {"time": 2889, "text": "So you're a pretty good person to ask, what does it take to build a successful startup?"}, {"time": 2895, "text": "I think there's, there's sort of survivor bias here a little bit, but I can try to find some common threads for the things that worked for me, which is, you know, in, in both of these companies, I was really passionate about the core technology."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "I actually like, you know, lay awake at night thinking about these problems and how to solve them."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "And I think that's helpful because when you start a business, there are like to this day, there are these crazy ups and downs."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "Like one day you think the business is just on, you're just on top of the world and unstoppable."}, {"time": 2924, "text": "And the next day you think, okay, this is all going to end, you know, it's just, it's just going south and it's going to be over tomorrow."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "And and so I think like having a true passion that you can fall back on and knowing that you would be doing it, even if you weren't getting paid for it, helps you weather those, those tough times."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "So that's one thing."}, {"time": 2941, "text": "I think the other one is really good people."}, {"time": 2945, "text": "So I've always been surrounded by really good cofounders that are logical thinkers are

"You know, they see this as... Where's the parents?"}, {"time": 2740, "text": "Yeah, so I call it self supervised learning because, in fact, the underlying algorithms that are used are the same algorithms as the supervised learning algorithms, except that what we train them to do is not predict a particular set of variables, like the category of an image, and not to predict a set of variables that have been provided by human labelers."}, {"time": 2766, "text": "But what you're trying the machine to do is basically reconstruct a piece of its input that is being maxed out, essentially."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "You can think of it this way, right?"}, {"time": 2775, "text": "So show a piece of video to a machine and ask it to predict what's gonna happen next."}, {"time": 2780, "text": "And of course, after a while, you can show what happens and the machine will kind of train itself to do better at that task."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "You can do like all the latest, most successful models in natural language processing, use self supervised learning."}, {"time": 2796, "text": "You know, sort of BERT style systems, for example, right?"}, {"time": 2798, "text": "You show it a window of a dozen words on a text corpus, you take out 15% of the words, and then you train the machine to predict the words that are missing, that self supervised learning."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "It's not predicting the future, it's just predicting things in the middle, but you could have it predict the future, that's what language models do."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "So you construct, so in an unsupervised way, you construct a model of language."}, {"time": 2823, "text": "Do you think...

one reason you need those interactive environments actually."}, {"time": 2861, "text": "But this is like a huge technical problem that is not solved, and that explains why self supervised learning works in the context of natural language, but does not work in the context, or at least not well, in the context of image recognition and video, although it's making progress quickly."}, {"time": 2877, "text": "And the reason, that reason is the fact that it's much easier to represent uncertainty in the prediction in a context of natural language than it is in the context of things like video and images."}, {"time": 2890, "text": "So for example, if I ask you to predict what words are missing, 15% of the words that I've taken out."}, {"time": 2897, "text": "The possibilities are small."},

probability vector, right?"}, {"time": 2907, "text": "It's a bunch of numbers between zero and one that sum to one."}, {"time": 2910, "text": "And we know how to do this with computers."}, {"time": 2914, "text": "So there, representing uncertainty in the prediction is relatively easy, and that's, in my opinion, why those techniques work for NLP."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "For images, if you ask..."}, {"time": 2925, "text": "If you block a piece of an image, and you ask the system, reconstruct that piece of the image, there are many possible answers."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "They are all perfectly legit, right?"}, {"time": 2934, "text": "And how do you represent this set of possible answers?"}, {"time": 2938, "text": "You can't train a system to make one prediction."}, {"time": 2940, "text": "You can't train a neural net to say, here it is, that's the image, because there's a whole set of things that are compatible with it."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "So how do you get the machine to represent not a single output, but a whole set of outputs?"}, {"time": 2953, "text": "And similarly with video prediction, there's a lot of things that can happen in the future of video."}, {"time": 2960, "text": "You're looking at me right now."}, {"time": 2961, "text": "I'm not moving my head very much, but I might turn my head to the left or to the right."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "If you don't have a system that can predict this, and you train it with least square to minimize the error with the prediction and what I'm doing, what you get is a blurry image of myself in all possible future positions that I might be in, which is not a good prediction."}, {"time": 2981, "text": "So there might be other ways to do the self supervision for visual scenes."}, {"time": 2988, "text": "I mean, if I knew, I wouldn't tell you, publish it first, I don't know."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "No, there might be."}, {"time": 2997, "text": "So I mean, these are kind of, there might be artificial ways of like self play in games, the way you can simulate part of the environment."}, {"time": 3005, "text": "Oh, that doesn't solve the problem."}, {"time": 3006, "text": "It's just a way of generating data."}, {"time": 3010, "text": "But because you have more of a control, like maybe you can control, yeah, it's a way to generate data."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "And because you can do huge amounts of data generation, that doesn't, you're right."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "Well, it creeps up on the problem from the side of data, and you don't think that's the right way to creep up."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "It doesn't solve this problem of handling uncertainty in the world, right?"}, {"time": 3030, "text": "So if you have a machine learn a predictive model of the world in a game that is deterministic or quasi deterministic, it's easy, right?"}, {"time": 3042, "text": "Just give a few frames of the game to a ConvNet, put a bunch of layers, and then have the game generates

in the 90s, they were not perfect simply because we're humans and just you analyze the game, you look for some fresh ideas."}, {"time": 816, "text": "And then just it happens that there was something that you missed because the level of the concentration at the chess board is different from when you analyze the game, just moving the pieces around."}, {"time": 827, "text": "And, but somehow if you spend a lot of time at the chess board preparing, so in your studies with your coaches, hours and hours and hours, and nothing of what you found could, had materialized on the chess board."}, {"time": 848, "text": "Somehow these hours help, I don't know why, always helped you."}, {"time": 854, "text": "It's as if the amount of work you did could be transformed into some sort of spiritual energy

was always some sort of invisible connection between the amount of work you did, your dedication to actually, and your passion to discover new ideas, and your ability during the game at the chess board, when the clock was ticking, we still had ticking clock, not digital clock at the time."}, {"time": 892, "text": "So to come up with some brilliance."}, {"time": 895, "text": "And I also can mention many games from the 90s."}, {"time": 899, "text": "So it's the, obviously all amateurs would pick up my game against Veselin Topalov in 1999 and V.

pieces."}, {"time": 944, "text": "And then eventually you have very few resources left and you use them just to crush your opponent basically."}, {"time": 954, "text": "You have to make the king

interesting ideas and games that gave me great satisfaction."}, {"time": 974, "text": "But I think it's what happened from 2005 up to these days was also a very big accomplishment since I had to find myself to sort of relocate myself."}, {"time": 988, "text": "Yeah, rechannel the creative energies."}, {"time": 990, "text": "Exactly, and to find something where I feel comfortable, even confident

next."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "But still yet, I competed with them and I just, I beat most of them."}, {"time": 1110, "text": "And I was still dominant when I left at age of 41."}, {"time": 1114, "text": "So back to Magnus."}, {"time": 1116, "text": "Magnus, I mean, consistency is phenomenal."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "The reason Magnus is on top, and it seems unbeatable today, Magnus is a lethal combination of Fischer and Karpov, which is very, it's very unusual because Fischer's style was very dynamic, just fighting to the last point, just using every resource available."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "Karpov was very different."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "It's just an unparalleled ability to use every piece with a maximum effect."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Just its minimal resources

shows that chess players burn thousands of calories during the game."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "So that puts him on the top of this field of the world champions."}, {"time": 1196, "text": "But again, it's the discussion that is, I saw recently on the internet, whether Garry Kasparov of his peak, let's say late eighties, could beat Magnus Carlsen today."}, {"time": 1206, "text": "I mean, it's certainly irrelevant because Garry Kasparov in 1989, okay, has played great chess, but still I knew very little about chess compared to Magnus Carlsen in 2019, who by the way, learned from me as well."}, {"time": 1218, "text": "So that's why, yeah."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "I'm extremely cautious in making any judgment that involves, you know, time gaps."}, {"time": 1226, "text": "You ask,

actually my answer when I just, when I just, you know, because I was asked this question as well."}, {"time": 1272, "text": "So I say that it's just, while it's impossible to make a choice, I would

title."}, {"time": 1293, "text": "You could argue for that for an hour, but you could say, if you ask Maradona, if you look in his eyes, especially, let's say Gary Kasparov in 1989, he would have

mentioned credit and money."}, {"time": 1993, "text": "Another thing that if I just zoom out from an alien perspective and look at human civilization, it's incredible that we've created a thing that only works because currency, because we all agree it has value."}, {"time": 2011, "text": "So I guess my question is how do you think about money as this emergent phenomenon?"}, {"time": 2018, "text":

2028, "text": "How do you think about money?"}, {"time": 2031, "text": "There are two things that money is for."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "It's a medium of exchange and it's a storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2040, "text": "So money, so you could say something's a medium of exchange, and then you could say, is it a storehold of wealth?"}, {"time": 2051, "text": "And money is that vehicle that is those things and can be used to pay off your debt."}, {"time": 2060, "text": "So when you have a debt and you provide it, it pays off your debt."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "So that's that process."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "And it's, I apologize to interrupt, but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth when everybody recognizes it to be of value."}, {"time": 2078, "text": "And so you see in the history around the world and you go to places, I was in an island in the Pacific in which they had as money these big stones."}, {"time": 2121, "text": "I've seen beads in different places, shells converted to this and mediums of exchange."}, {"time": 2128, "text": "And when we look at what we've got, you're exactly right."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "It is the notion that if I give it to you, I can then take it and I can buy something with it."}, {"time": 2137, "text": "And that's, so it's a matter of perception."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "And then we go through then the history of money and the vulnerabilities of money."}, {"time": 2147, "text": "And what we have is there's, through history, there's been two types of money."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "Those that are claims on something of value, like the connection to gold or something."}, {"time": 2162, "text": "That would be."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "Or they just are money without any connection, and then we have a system now, which is a fiat monetary system."}, {"time": 2170, "text": "So that's what money is."}, {"time": 2172, "text": "Then it will last as long as it's kept a value and it works that way."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "So let's say central banks, when they get in the position of like they owe a lot of money, like we have in the case, it's increasingly the case, and they also in our mind and they have the printing press to print the money and get out of that."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "And you have a lot of people might be in that position."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "Then you can print it and then it could be devalued in there."}, {"time": 2203, "text": "And so history has shown, forget about today, history has shown that no currency, every currency has either ended as being a currency or devalued as a currency over periods of time, long periods of time."}, {"time": 2221, "text": "So it evolves and it changes, but everybody needs that medium of exchange and everybody needs that storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2228, "text": "So it keeps changing what is money over a period of time."}, {"time": 2232, "text": "But so much is being digitized today and there's this ideas that are based on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on."}, {"time": 2242, "text": "So if all currencies, like all empires come to an end, what do you think, well, do you think something like Bitcoin might emerge as a common store of value, a store of wealth and a medium of exchange?"}, {"time": 2257, "text": "The problem with Bitcoin is that it's not an effective medium of exchange."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "Like it's not easy for me to go in there and buy things with it."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "And then it's not an effective storehold of value because it has a volatility that's based on speculation and the like, so it's not a very effective saving."}, {"time": 2280, "text": "That's very different from Facebook's of a stable value currency, which would be effective as both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "Because if you were to hold it and the way it's linked to number of things that it's linked to would mean that it could be a very effective storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "And then you have a digital currency that could be a very effective medium exchange and storehold of wealth."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So in my opinion, some digital currencies are likely to succeed more or less based on that ability to do it."}, {"time": 2315, "text": "Then the question is what happens?"}, {"time": 2317, "text": "Okay, what happens is do central banks allow that to happen?"}, {"time": 2322, "text": "I really do believe it's possible to get a better form of money that central banks don't control."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "Okay, a better force of money that the central banks don't control."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "But then that's not yet happened."}, {"time": 2337, "text": "And we also have to, and so they've got to go through that evolutionary process."}, {"time": 2343, "text": "In order to go through that evolutionary process, first of all, governments have got to allow that to happen, which is to some extent a threat to them in terms of their power."}, {"time": 2353, "text": "And that's an issue."}, {"time": 2354, "text": "And then you have to also build the confidence in all of the components of it to say, okay, that's going to be effective because I won't have problems owning it."}, {"time": 2368, "text": "So I think that digital currencies have some element of potential, but there's a lot of hurdles that are going to have to be gotten over."}, {"time": 2379, "text": "I think that it'll be a very long time, possibly never, but anyway, a very long time before we have that, let's say, get into a position that would be effective means relative to gold, let's say, if you were to think of that."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "Because gold has a track record of thousands of years."}, {"time": 2400, "text": "All across countries, it has its mobility, it has the ability to put it down, it has certain abilities."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "It's got disadvantages relative to digital currencies, but central banks will hold it."}, {"time": 2414, "text": "Like there's central banks that worry about others, other countries, central banks might worry about whether the U.S. dollar is going to print or not."}, {"time": 2423, "text": "And so the thing they're going to go to is not going to be the digital currency."}, {"time": 2426, "text": "The thing they're going to go to is gold or something else, some other currency, they got to pick it."}, {"time": 2432, "text": "And so I think it's a long way to go."}, {"time": 2435, "text": "Well, you think it's possible that one day we don't even have a central bank because of a currency that doesn't, that cannot be controlled by the central bank is the primary currency?"}, {"time": 2449, "text": "Or does that seem very unlikely?"},

you sit back and you look, you describe these transactions between individuals, somehow creating short term debt cycles, long term debt cycles, there's productivity growth."}, {"time": 2477, "text":

that this thing between individual transactions, it just, it works."}, {"time": 2497, "text": "It amazes me."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "Like I go back and forth between being in it and then I think, like, how did a credit card, how is that really possible?"}, {"time": 2509, "text": "I'm still used, I look up credit card, I put it on, the guy doesn't know me."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "It's all

capacity of the human mind to create abstractions that are true."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "It's imagination and then the ability to go from one level and then if these things are true, then you go to the next level and if those things are true, then you go to the next level."}, {"time": 2550, "text": "And all those miracles that we almost become common, it's like when I'm flying in a plane or when I'm looking at all of the things that happen."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "When I get communications in the middle of, I don't know, Africa or Antarctica and we're communicating in the ways where I see the face on my iPad of somebody, my grandkid and someplace else and I look at this and I say, wow, yes, it all amazes me."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "So while being amazing, do you have a sense, the principles you described, that the whole thing is stable somehow also?"}, {"time": 2586, "text": "Or is this, are we just lucky?"}, {"time": 2588, "text": "So the principles that you described, are

economics and markets so I get down to like a real nitty gritty."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "I can't tell you whether the plane is gonna fall out of the sky because of its particular fundamentals."},

"text": "In the markets and the economy, I know those things well enough, in a sense, to say that by and large, that structure is right, what we're seeing is right."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "Now, whether there are disruptions and it has effects that can come, not because that structure is right, and I believe it's right, but whether it can be hurt by let's say connectivity or journal entries,

worry me."}, {"time": 2674, "text": "Have you seen disruptions in your lifetime that really surprised you?"}, {"time": 2678, "text": "Major disruptions?"}, {"time": 2678, "text": "Oh, all the time."},

watching events happen and then you get on and that definition of money all of a sudden went out the window because it was not tied to gold and then you have this devaluation."}, {"time": 2734, "text": "So and then, or the first oil shock or the second oil shock or so many of these things."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "But almost always I realized that they, when I looked in history, they happened before, they just happened in other people's lifetimes which led me to realize that I needed to study history and what happened in other people's lifetimes and what happened in other

chess game playing and I'm a person with my chess game and I'm saying it made that move and I'm making the move and how do I compare those two moves?"}, {"time": 2860, "text": "So we've done a lot but

two things."}, {"time": 2880, "text": "Deep understanding of?"}, {"time": 2882, "text": "The cause of fact relationships that are leading you to place that bet in anything, okay?"}, {"time": 2888,

{"time": 2937, "text": "However, what happens with AI is for the most part is it takes a lot of data with a high enough sample size and then it puts together its own algorithms."}, {"time": 2953,

what is the algorithm?"}, {"time": 2966, "text": "That's machine learning."}, {"time": 2967, "text": "And when you have machine learning, it'll give you equations which quite often are not understandable."}, {"time": 2975, "text": "If you would try to say, okay, now describe what it's telling you, it's very difficult to describe and so they can escape understanding."}, {"time": 2982,

from the past and you have that, then if the future is different from the past and you don't have deep understanding, you're gonna get in trouble."}, {"time": 3000, "text": "And so that's the main thing."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "As far as AI is concerned, AI and let's say computer replications of thinking in very ways, I think it's particularly good for processing."}, {"time": 3013, "text":

raise my children?"}, {"time": 3027, "text": "It's gonna be a long time before AI, you're going to say, it has a good enough judgment to do that."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "Who should I marry?"},

{"time": 3053, "text": "But by and large, the mind should be used for inventing and those creative things."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "And then the computer should be used for processing because it could process a lot more information, a lot faster, a lot more accurately and a lot less emotionally."}, {"time": 3072, "text": "So any notion of thinking in the form of processing type thinking should be done by a computer and anything that is in the notion of doing that other type of thinking should be operating with the brain, operating in a way where you can say, ah, that makes sense."},

of reducing principles to a computer program or when you say, when you write about, when you think about principles, is there still a human element that's not reducible to an algorithm?"}, {"time":

constitute all things."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "So you can express far more than you can imagine you'll be able to express."}, {"time": 3159, "text": "So I use the example of, okay, it's not, how do you raise your children?"}, {"time": 3163, "text": "Okay, you will be able to take it one piece by piece."}, {"time": 3168, "text": "Okay, at what age, what school?"}, {"time": 3171, "text": "And the way to do that, in my experience, is to take that and when you're in the moment of making a decision or just past making a decision, to take the time and to write down your criteria for making that decision in words."}, {"time": 3191, "text": "Okay, that way you'll get your principles down on paper."}, {"time": 3196, "text": "I created an app online call, it's right now just on the iPhone, it'll

on Android."}, {"time": 3209, "text": "But it has an app in there that helps people write down their own principles."}, {"time": 3215, "text": "Because this is very powerful."}, {"time": 3217, "text": "So when you're in that moment where you've just, you're thinking about it and you're thinking your criteria for choosing the school for your child or whatever that might be, and you write down your criteria or whatever they are, those principles, you write down and that will at that moment make you articulate your principles in a very valuable way."}, {"time": 3242, "text": "And if you have the way that we operate that you have easy access, so then the next time that comes along, you can go to that, or you can show those principles to others to see if they're the right principles."},

that in data?"}, {"time": 3266, "text": "And it'll shock you about how you can do that."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "You'll form an equation that will show the relationship between these particular parts and then essentially the variables that are going to go into that particular equation and you will be able to do that."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "And you take that little piece and you put it into the computer."}, {"time": 3288, "text": "And then take the next little piece and you put that into the computer."}, {"time": 3291, "text": "And before you know it, you will have a decision making

me."}, {"time": 3304, "text": "At first you said, there's no way a computer could raise a child essentially."}, {"time": 3310, "text": "But now you've described making me think of it."}, {"time":

the most important things in that person's development."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "The ability to be able to be prepared to go out there and then to go into a market that's an equal opportunity job

effective economic system because the consequences of not doing that to a society are devastating."}, {"time": 4235, "text": "If you look at what the difference in outcomes for somebody who completes high school or doesn't complete high school, or does each one of those state changes."}, {"time": 4245, "text": "And you look at what that means in terms of their costs to society, not only

less than that is bad, is a tragedy and so on."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "So that's what, yeah, those are the things that I'm estimating."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "And so what I would want above all else is to provide that."}, {"time": 4287, "text": "So with that in mind, now we'll talk about universal basic income."}, {"time": 4290, "text": "Start with that, now we can talk about UBI."},

really think is what is going to happen with that $1,000, okay?"}, {"time": 4306, "text": "And will that $1,000 come from another program?"}, {"time": 4310, "text": "Does that come from an early

think it's a great thing that everybody should have almost $1,000 in their bank and so on."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "But when do they get to make decisions or who's the parent?"}, {"time": 4330,

mean its outcomes are going to be good in providing those things that I think are so fundamental important."}, {"time": 4356, "text": "If it was just everybody can have $1,000 and use it so when the time comes."}, {"time": 4360, "text": "Use it well, right."}, {"time": 4361, "text": "And use it well, that would be really, really good because it's almost like everybody, you'd wish everybody could have $1,000 worth of wiggle room in their lives, okay."}, {"time": 4371, "text": "And I think that would be great."}, {"time": 4375, "text": "But I wanna make sure that these other things that are taken care of."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "So if it comes out of that budget and I don't want it to come out of that budget that's gonna be doing those things."}, {"time": 4386, "text": "And so you have to figure it out."}, {"time": 4388, "text": "And you have a certain skepticism that human nature will use, may not always, in fact frequently, may not use that $1,000 for the optimal, to support the optimal trajectory."}, {"time": 4401, "text": "Some will and some won't."}, {"time": 4403, "text": "One of the big advantages of universal basic income is that if you put it in the hands, let's

of their children."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "Wow, that sounds great."}, {"time": 4423, "text": "If you put it in the hands of let's say an alcoholic or drug addicted parent who is not making those

can elaborate, you mentioned a bit of freedom."}, {"time": 4579, "text": "At the most fundamental level, it doesn't take a whole lot but it takes enough that you can take care of yourself and your

whatsoever."}, {"time": 795, "text": "Again, tons of people that are, are in longterm relationships experience bouts of loneliness and continued loneliness."}, {"time": 802, "text": "Um, and it's more the question about the true connection about actually being deeply seen, deeply understood."}, {"time": 809, "text": "Um, and in a way it's also about your relationship with yourself, like in order to not feel lonely, you actually need to have a better relationship and feel more connected to yourself than this feeling actually starts to go away a little bit."}, {"time": 824, "text": "And then you,

to briefly touch on it, I mean, do you think it's possible to form that kind of connection with AI systems more down the line of some of your work?"}, {"time": 848, "text": "Do you think that's, um,

that we're going after."}, {"time": 940, "text": "And all of our product and all of our business models are optimized for that because you can talk, you know, a lot of products that talk about, um, you know, making you feel less lonely or making you feel more connected."}, {"time": 950, "text": "They're not really measuring that."}, {"time": 952, "text": "So they don't really know whether their users are actually feeling less lonely in the long run or feeling more connected in the long run."}, {"time": 958, "text": "Um, so I think it's really important to put your measure it."}, {"time": 963, "text": "To measure it."}, {"time": 964, "text": "What's a, what's a good measurement of loneliness?"}, {"time": 967, "text": "Well, so that's something that I'm really interested in."}, {"time": 970, "text": "How do you measure that people are feeling better or that they're feeling less lonely with loneliness?"}, {"time": 975, "text": "There's a scale."}, {"time": 976, "text": "There's UCLA 20 and UCLA three recently scale, which is basically a questionnaire that you fill out and you can see whether in the long run it's improving or not."}, {"time": 986, "text": "And that, uh, does it capture the momentary feeling of loneliness?"}, {"time": 992, "text": "Does it look in like the past month?"}, {"time": 995, "text": "Like, uh, does it basically self report?"}, {"time": 998, "text": "Does it try to sneak up on you tricky to answer honestly or something like that?"}, {"time": 1003, "text": "Well, what's yeah, I'm not familiar with the question."}, {"time": 1006, "text": "It is just asking you a few questions."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "Like how often did you feel, uh, like lonely or how often do you feel connected to other people in this last few couple of weeks?"}, {"time": 1015, "text": "Um, it's similar to the self report questionnaires for depression, anxiety, like PHQ nine and get seven."}, {"time": 1022, "text": "Of course, as any, as any self report questionnaires, that's not necessarily very precise or very well measured, but still, if you take a big enough population and you get them through these, uh, questionnaires, you can see, you can see a positive dynamic."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And so you basically, uh, you put people through questionnaires to see like, is this thing is our, is what we're creating, making people happier?"}, {"time": 1048, "text": "Yeah, we measure, so we measure two outcomes."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "One short term, right after the conversation, we ask people whether this conversation made them feel better, worse or same, um, this, this metric right now is at 80%."}, {"time": 1063, "text": "So 80% of all our conversations make people feel better, but I should have done the questionnaire with you."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "You feel a lot worse after we've done this conversation."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "That's actually fascinating."}, {"time": 1074, "text": "I should probably do that, but that's, that's how we do that."}, {"time": 1077, "text": "You should totally and aim for 80% aim to outperform your current state of the art AI system in these human conversations."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "So we'll get to your work with replica, but let me continue on the line of absurd questions."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "So you talked about, um, you know, deep connection with the humans, deep connection with AI, meaningful connection."}, {"time": 1103, "text": "Let me ask about love."}, {"time": 1105, "text": "People make fun of me cause I talk about love all the time."},

something fundamental about us humans that seek like a really deep connection, uh, with another human being and what is that?"}, {"time": 1145, "text": "What is love Eugenia, I'm going to just enjoy asking you these questions seeing you struggle."}, {"time": 1156, "text": "Um, well the way I see it, um, and specifically, um, the way it relates to our work and the way it was, the way it inspired our work on replica, um, I think one of the biggest and the most precious gifts we can give to each other now in 2020 as humans is this gift of deep empathetic understanding, the feeling of being deeply seen."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "Like what does that mean?"}, {"time": 1183, "text": "Like that you exist, like somebody acknowledging that somebody seeing you for who you actually are."}, {"time": 1190, "text": "And that's extremely, extremely rare."}, {"time": 1191, "text": "Um, I think that is that combined with unconditional positive regard, um, belief and trust that um, you internally are always inclined for positive growth and believing you in this way, letting you be a separate person at the same time."}, {"time": 1209, "text": "And this deep empathetic understanding for me, that's the, that's the combination that really creates something special, something that people, when they feel it once, they will always long for it again."}, {"time": 1223, "text": "And something that starts huge fundamental changes in people."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "Um, when we see that someone's accepts us so deeply, we start to accept ourselves."}, {"time": 1234, "text": "And um, the paradox is that's when big changes start happening, big fundamental changes in people start happening."}, {"time": 1242, "text": "So I think that is the ultimate therapeutic relationship that is, and that might be in some way a definition of love."}, {"time": 1250, "text": "So acknowledging that there's a separate person and accepting you for who you are."}, {"time": 1256, "text": "Um, now on a slightly that, and you mentioned therapeutic, that sounds a very, like a very healthy view of love, but, uh, is there also like a, like, you know, if we look at heartbreak and uh, you know, most love songs are probably about heartbreak, right?"}, {"time": 1277, "text": "Is that like the mystery, the tension, the danger, the fear of loss, you know, all of that, what people might see in a negative light as like games or whatever, but just, just the, the dance of human interaction."}, {"time": 1295, "text": "Fear of loss and fear of like, you said, you said like once you feel it once, you long for it again, but you also, once you feel it once, you might, for many people, they've lost it."}, {"time": 1308, "text": "So they fear losing it."}, {"time": 1309, "text": "They feel loss."}, {"time": 1310, "text": "So is that part of it, like you're, you're speaking like beautifully about like the positive things, but is it important to be able to, uh, be afraid of losing it from an engineering perspective?"}, {"time": 1324, "text": "I mean, it's a huge part of it and unfortunately we all, you know, um, face it at some points in our lives."}, {"time": 1333, "text": "I mean, I did."}, {"time": 1334, "text": "You want to go into details?"}, {"time": 1335, "text": "How'd you get your heartbroken?"}, {"time": 1339, "text": "So mine is pretty straight, my story is pretty straightforward, um, there I did have a friend that was, you know, that at some point, um, in my twenties became really, really close to me and we, we became really close friends."}, {"time": 1354,

really important."}, {"time": 4211, "text": "I actually had to turn myself off from the internet mostly because I started this like workout thing, like a happy go getter with my like headband and like, just like, uh, because a lot of people were like inspired and they're like, yeah, we're going to exercise with you."}, {"time": 4228, "text": "And I was like, yeah, great."}, {"time": 4230, "text": "You know, but then like, I realized that this, this journey can't be done together with others."}, {"time": 4238, "text": "This has to be done alone."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "So out of the moments of love, out of the moments of loss, can we, uh, talk about your journey of finding, I think, an incredible idea and incredible company and incredible system in Replica?"}, {"time": 4259, "text": "How did that come to be?"}, {"time": 4261, "text": "So yeah, so I was a journalist and then I went to business school for a couple of years to, um, just see if I can maybe switch gears and do something else with 23."}, {"time": 4272, "text": "And then I came back and started working for a businessman in Russia who built the first ROG network, um, in our country and was very visionary and asked me whether I want to do fun stuff together."}, {"time": 4286, "text": "Um, and we worked on a bank, um, the idea was to build a bank on top of, um, a telco."}, {"time": 4294, "text": "So that was 2011 or 12, um, and a lot of telecommunication company, um, mobile network operators didn't really know what to do next in terms of, you know, new products, new revenue."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "And this big idea was that, you know, um, you put a bank on top and then all work works out."}, {"time": 4314, "text": "Basically a prepaid account becomes your bank account and, um, you can use it as, as your bank."}, {"time": 4319, "text": "Uh, so, you know, a third of a country wakes up as, as your bank client."}, {"time": 4325, "text": "Um, but we couldn't quite figure out what, what would be the main interface to interact with the bank."}, {"time": 4331, "text": "The problem was that most people didn't have smart, smart phones back in the time in Russia, the penetration of smartphones was low, um, people didn't use mobile banking or online banking and their computers."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "So we figured out that SMS would be the best way, uh, cause that would work on feature phones."}, {"time": 4347, "text": "Um, but that required some chat bot technology, which I didn't know anything about, um, obviously."}, {"time": 4353, "text": "So I started looking into it and saw that there's nothing really, well, there wasn't just nothing really."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "Ideas through SMS be able to interact with your bank account."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "And then we thought, well, since you're talking to a bank account, why can't this, can't we use more of, uh, you know, some behavioral ideas and why can't this, uh, banking chat bot be nice to you and really talk to you sort of as a friend this way you develop more connection to it, retention is higher, people don't churn."}, {"time": 4379, "text": "And so I went to very depressing, um, um, Russian cities to test it out."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "Um, I went to, I remember three different towns with, uh, um, to interview potential users."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "Um, so people use it for a little bit and I went to talk to them, um, very poor towns, mostly towns that were, um, you know, sort of factories, uh, mono towns."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "They were building something and then the factory went away and it was just a bunch of very poor people."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "Um, and then we went to a couple that weren't as dramatic, but still the one I remember really fondly was this woman that worked at a glass factory and she talked to a chat bot."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "Um, and she was talking about it and she started crying during the interview because she said, no one really cares for me that much."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "And um, so to be clear, that was the, my only endeavor in programming that chat bot."}, {"time": 4436, "text": "So it was really simple."}, {"time": 4438, "text": "It was literally just a few, if this, then that rules and, um, it was incredibly simplistic."}, {"time": 4446, "text": "Um, and that really made her emotional and she said, you know, I only have my mom and my, um, my husband and I don't have any more really in my life."}, {"time": 4458, "text": "And that was very sad, but at the same time I felt, and we had more interviews in a similar vein and what I thought in the moment was like, well, uh, it's not that the technology is ready because definitely in 2012 technology was not ready for, for that, but, um, humans are ready, unfortunately."}, {"time": 4476, "text": "So this project would not be about like tech capabilities would be more about human vulnerabilities, but, um, there's something so, so powerful around about conversational, um, AI that I saw then that I thought was definitely worth putting in a lot of effort into."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "So in the end of the day, we saw the banking project, um, but my then boss, um, was also my mentor and really, really close friend, um, told me, Hey, I think there's something in it and you should just go work on it."}, {"time": 4508, "text": "And I was like, well, what product?"}, {"time": 4510, "text": "I don't know what I'm building."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "He's like, you'll figure it out."}, {"time": 4514, "text": "And, um, you know, looking back at this, this was a horrible idea to work on something without knowing what it was, which is maybe the reason why it took us so long, but we just decided to work on the conversational tech to see what it, you know, there were no chat bot, um, constructors or programs or anything that would allow you to actually build one at the time."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "Uh, that was the era of, by the way, Google glass, which is why, you know, some of the investors like seed investors we've talked with were like, Oh, you should totally build it for Google glass."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "If not, we're not, I don't think that's interesting."}, {"time": 4548, "text": "Did you bite on that idea?"}, {"time": 4552, "text": "Because I wanted to be, to do text first cause I'm a journalist."}, {"time": 4556, "text": "So I was, um, fascinated by just texting."}, {"time": 4561, "text": "So you thought, so the emotional, um, that interaction that the woman had, like, so do you think you could feel emotion from just text?"}, {"time": 4571, "text": "I saw something in just this pure texting and also thought that we should first start, start building for people who really need it versus people who have Google glass."}, {"time": 4580, "text": "Uh, if you know what I mean, and I felt like the early adopters of Google glass might not be overlapping with people who are really lonely and might need some, you know, someone to talk to."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "Um, but then we really just focused on the tech itself."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "We just thought, what if we just, you know, we didn't have a product idea in the moment and we felt, what if we just look into, um, building the best conversational constructors, so to say, use the best tech available at the time."}, {"time": 4609, "text": "And that was before the first paper about deep learning applied to dialogues, which happened in 2015 in August, 2015, uh, which Google published."}, {"time": 4621, "text": "Did you follow the work of Lobna prize and like all the sort of non machine learning chat bots?"}, {"time": 4631, "text": "What really struck me was that, you know, there was a lot of talk about machine learning and deep learning."}, {"time": 4636, "text": "Like big data was a really big thing."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "Everyone was saying, you know, the business world, big data, 2012 is the biggest gaggle competitions were, you know, um, important, but that was really the kind of upheaval."}, {"time": 4647, "text": "People started talking about machine learning a lot, um, but it was only about images or something else."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "And it was never about conversation."}, {"time": 4654, "text": "As soon as I looked into the conversational tech, it was all about something really weird and very outdated and very marginal and felt very hobbyist."}, {"time": 4662, "text": "It was all about Lord burner price, which was won by a guy who built a chat bot that talked like a Ukrainian teenager that it was just a gimmick."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "And somehow people picked up those gimmicks and then, you know, the most famous chat bot at the time was Eliza from 1980s, which was really bizarre or smarter child on aim."}, {"time": 4683, "text": "The funny thing is it felt at the time not to be that popular and it still doesn't seem to be that popular."}, {"time": 4691, "text": "Like people talk about the Turing test, people like talking about it philosophically, journalists like writing about it, but as a technical problem, like people don't seem to really want to solve the open dialogue."}, {"time": 4706, "text": "Like they, they're not obsessed with it."}, {"time": 4709, "text": "Even folks are like, you know, I'm in Boston, the Alexa team, even they're not as obsessed with it as I thought they might be."}, {"time": 4720, "text": "So you know what you felt like you felt with that woman who, when she felt something by reading the text, I feel the same thing."}, {"time": 4728, "text": "There's something here, what you felt."}, {"time": 4731, "text": "I feel like Alexa folks and just the machine learning world doesn't feel that, that there's something here because they see as a technical problem is not that interesting for some reason."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "It's could be argued that maybe as a purely sort of natural language processing problem, it's not the right problem to focus on because there's too much subjectivity."}, {"time": 4757, "text": "That thing that the woman felt like crying, like if your benchmark includes a woman crying, that doesn't feel like a good benchmark."}, {"time": 4767, "text": "But to me there's something there that's, you could have a huge impact, but I don't think the machine learning world likes that, the human emotion, the subjectivity of it, the fuzziness, the fact that with maybe a single word you can make somebody feel something deeply."}, {"time": 4785, "text": "It doesn't feel right to them."}, {"time": 4788, "text": "I don't know why that is."}, {"time": 4790, "text": "That's why I'm excited when I discovered your work, it feels wrong to say that."}, {"time": 4797, "text": "It's not like I'm giving myself props for Googling and for coming across, for I guess mutual friend and introducing us, but I'm so glad that you exist and what you're working on."}, {"time": 4816, "text": "But I have the same kind of, if we could just backtrack for a second, because I have the same kind of feeling that there's something here."}, {"time": 4822, "text": "In fact, I've been working on a few things that are kind of crazy, very different from your work."}, {"time": 4830, "text": "I think they're too crazy."}, {"time": 4834, "text": "But the... Like what?"}, {"time": 4836, "text": "I don't have to know."}, {"time": 4838, "text": "No, all right, we'll talk about it more."}, {"time": 4841, "text": "I feel like it's harder to talk about things that have failed and are failing while you're a failure."}, {"time": 4853, "text": "It's easier for you because you're already successful on some measures."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "Tell it to my board."}, {"time": 4861, "text": "Well, I think you've demonstrated success in a lot of ways."}, {"time": 4867, "text": "It's easier for you to talk about failures for me."}, {"time": 4870, "text": "I'm in the bottom currently of the success."}, {"time": 4879, "text": "You're way too humble."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "So it's hard for me to know, but there's something there, there's something there."}, {"time": 4885, "text": "And I think you're exploring that and you're discovering that."}, {"time": 4891, "text": "So it's been surprising to me."}, {"time": 4892, "text": "But you've mentioned this idea that you thought it wasn't enough to start a company or start efforts based on it feels like there's something here."}, {"time": 4906, "text": "Like what did you mean by that?"},

a while to discover the product because it all started with a hunch of like of me and my mentor and just sitting around and he was like, well, that's it."}, {"time": 4928, "text": "That's the, you know, the Holy Grail is there."}, {"time": 4931, "text": "It's like there's something extremely powerful in, in, in conversations and there's no one who's working on machine conversation from the right angle."}, {"time": 4939, "text": "So to say."}, {"time": 4940, "text": "I feel like that's still true."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "Am I crazy?"}, {"time": 4943, "text": "Oh no, I totally feel that's still true, which is, I think it's mind blowing."}, {"time": 4949, "text": "You know what it feels like?"}, {"time": 4950, "text": "I wouldn't even use the word conversation cause I feel like it's the wrong word."}, {"time": 4955, "text": "It's like a machine connection or something."}, {"time": 4959, "text": "I don't know cause conversation, you start drifting into natural language immediately."}, {"time": 4964, "text": "You start drifting immediately into all the benchmarks that are out there."}, {"time": 4967, "text": "But I feel like it's like the personal computer days of this."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "Like I feel like we're like in the early days with the, like the Wozniak and all them, like where it was the same kind of, it was a very small niche group of people who are, who are all kind of lob no price type people."}, {"time": 4988, "text": "Hobbyists."}, {"time": 4989, "text": "Hobbyists, but like not even hobbyists with big dreams."}, {"time": 4993, "text": "Like no hobbyists with a dream to trick like a jury."}, {"time": 4998, "text": "It's like a weird, by the way, by the way, very weird."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "So if we think about conversations, first of all, when I have great conversations with people, I'm not trying to test them."}, {"time": 5010, "text": "So for instance, if I try to break them, like if I'm actually playing along, I'm part of it."}, {"time": 5015, "text": "If I were to ask this person or test whether he's going to give me a good conversation, it would have never happened."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "So the whole, the whole problem with testing conversations is that you can put it in front of a jury because then you have to go into some Turing test mode where is it responding to all my factual questions, right?"}, {"time": 5035, "text": "Or so it really has to be something in the field where people are actually talking to it because they want to, not because we're just trying to break it."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "And it's working for them because this, the weird part of it is that it's very subjective."}, {"time": 5051, "text": "It takes two to tango here fully."}, {"time": 5053, "text": "If you're not trying to have a good conversation, if you're trying to test it, then it's going to break."}, {"time": 5057, "text": "I mean, any person would break, to be honest."}, {"time": 5059, "text": "If I'm not trying to even have a conversation with you, you're not going to give it to me."}, {"time": 5065, "text": "If I keep asking you like some random questions or jumping from topic to topic, that wouldn't be, which I'm probably doing, but that probably wouldn't contribute to the conversation."}, {"time": 5076, "text": "So I think the problem of testing, so there should be some other metric."}, {"time": 5082, "text": "How do we evaluate whether that conversation was powerful or not, which is what we actually started with."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "And I think those measurements exist and we can test on those."}, {"time": 5091, "text": "But what really struck us back in the day and what's still eight years later is still not resolved and I'm not seeing tons of groups working on it."}, {"time": 5102, "text": "Maybe I just don't know about them, it's also possible."}, {"time": 5106, "text": "But the interesting part about it is that most of our days we spend talking and we're not talking about like those conversations are not turn on the lights or customer support problems or some other task oriented things."}, {"time": 5122, "text": "These conversations are something else and then somehow they're extremely important for us."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "If we don't have them, then we feel deeply unhappy, potentially lonely, which as we know, creates tons of risk for our health as well."}, {"time": 5138, "text": "And so this is most of our hours as humans and somehow no one's trying to replicate that."}, {"time": 5145, "text": "And not even study it that well?"}, {"time": 5149, "text": "And not even study that well."}, {"time": 5150, "text": "So when we jumped into that in 2012, I looked first at like, okay, what's the chatbot?"}, {"time": 5154, "text": "What's the state of the art chatbot?"}, {"time": 5157, "text": "And those were the Lobner Prize days, but I thought, okay, so what about the science of conversation?"}, {"time": 5164, "text": "Clearly there have been tons of scientists or academics that looked into the conversation."}, {"time": 5172, "text": "So if I want to know everything about it, I can just read about it."}, {"time": 5177, "text": "There's not much really, there are conversational analysts who are basically just listening to speech, to different conversations, annotating them."}, {"time": 5188, "text": "And then, I mean, that's not really used for much."}, {"time": 5192, "text": "That's the field of theoretical linguistics, which is barely useful."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "It's very marginal, even in their space, no one really is excited and I've never met a theoretical linguist who was like, I can't wait to work on the conversation and analytics."}, {"time": 5209, "text": "That is just something very marginal, sort of applied to like writing scripts for salesmen when they analyze which conversation strategies were most successful for sales."}, {"time": 5220, "text": "Okay, so that was not very helpful."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "How to be charismatic and charming and influential with people, all those books, yeah."}, {"time": 5265, "text": "Pretty much, but it was all about like through conversation reprogramming you, so getting to some, so that was, I mean, probably not very, very true and that didn't seem working very much even back in the day."}, {"time": 5280, "text": "And then there were some other books like, I don't know, mostly just self help books around how to be the best conversationalist or how to make people like you or some other stuff like Dale Carnegie or whatever."}, {"time": 5297, "text": "And then there was this one book, The Most Human Human by Brian Christensen that really was important for me to read back in the day because he was on the human side, he was taking part in the London Prize, but not as a human who's not a jury, but who's pretending to be, who's basically, you have to tell a computer from a human and he was the human, so you could either get him or a computer."}, {"time": 5323, "text": "And his whole book was about how do people, what makes us human in conversation."}, {"time": 5329, "text": "And that was a little bit more interesting because that at least someone started to think about what exactly makes me human in conversation and makes people believe in that, but it was still about tricking, it was still about imitation game, it was still about, okay, well, what kind of parlor tricks can we throw in the conversation to make you feel like you're talking to a human, not a computer."}, {"time": 5349, "text": "And it was definitely not about thinking, what is it exactly that we're getting from talking all day long with other humans."}, {"time": 5359, "text": "I mean, we're definitely not just trying to be tricked or it's not just enough to know it's a human."}, {"time": 5365, "text": "It's something we're getting there, can we measure it and can we put the computer to the same measurement and see whether you can talk to a computer and get the same results?"}, {"time": 5375, "text": "Yeah, so first of all, a lot of people comment that they think I'm a robot, it's very possible I am a robot and this whole thing, I totally agree with you that the test idea is fascinating and I looked for books unrelated to this kind of, so I'm afraid of people, I'm generally introverted and quite possibly a robot."}, {"time": 5395, "text": "I literally Googled how to talk to people and how to have a good conversation for the purpose of this podcast, because I was like, I can't, I can't make eye contact with people."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "I can't like hire."}, {"time": 5410, "text": "I do Google that a lot too."}, {"time": 5412, "text": "You're probably reading a bunch of FBI negotiation tactics."}, {"time": 5415, "text": "Is that what you're getting?"}, {"time": 5417, "text": "Well, everything you've listed I've gotten, there's been very few good books on even just like how to interview well, it's rare."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "So what I end up doing often is I watch like with a critical eye, it's just so different when you just watch a conversation, like just for the fun of it, just as a human."}, {"time": 5443, "text": "And if you watch a conversation, it's like trying to figure out why is this awesome?"}, {"time": 5449, "text": "I'll listen to a bunch of different styles of conversation."}, {"time": 5452, "text": "I mean, I'm a fan of the podcast, Joe Rogan, people can make fun of him or whatever and dismiss him."}, {"time": 5461, "text": "But I think he's an incredibly artful conversationalist."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "He can pull people in for hours."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "And there's another guy I watch a lot."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "He hosted a late night show, his name was Craig Ferguson."}, {"time": 5480, "text": "So he's like very kind of flirtatious."}, {"time": 5483, "text": "But there's a magic about his like, about the connection he can create with people, how he can put people at ease."}, {"time": 5493, "text": "And just like, I see I've already started sounding like those I know pee people or something."}, {"time": 5497, "text": "I'm not I don't mean in that way."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "I don't mean like how to charm people or put them at ease and all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "It's just like, what is that?"}, {"time": 5505, "text": "Why is that fun to listen to that guy?"}, {"time": 5507, "text": "Why is that fun to talk to that guy?"}, {"time": 5512, "text": "Because he's not saying I mean, it's so often boils down to a kind of wit and humor, but not really humor."}, {"time": 5523, "text": "It's like, I don't know, I have trouble actually even articulating correctly."}, {"time": 5530, "text": "But it feels like there's something going on that's not too complicated, that could be learned."}, {"time": 5542, "text": "And it's not similar to, yeah, to like, like you said, like the Turing test."}, {"time": 5549, "text": "It's something else."}, {"time": 5552, "text": "I'm thinking about a lot all the time."}, {"time": 5554, "text": "I do think about all the time."}, {"time": 5558, "text": "I think when we were looking, so we started the company, we just decided to build the conversational tech, we thought, well, there's nothing for us to build this chatbot that we want to build."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "So let's just first focus on building, you know, some tech, building the tech side of things without a product in mind, without a product in mind, we added like a demo chatbot that would recommend you restaurants and talk to you about restaurants just to show something simple to people that people could relate to and could try out and see whether it works or not."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "But we didn't have a product in mind yet."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "We thought we would try venture chatbots and figure out our consumer application."}, {"time": 5599, "text": "And we sort of remembered that we wanted to build that kind of friend, that sort of connection that we saw in the very beginning."}, {"time": 5606, "text": "But then we got to Y Combinator and moved to San Francisco and forgot about it."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "You know, everything because then it was just this constant grind."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "How do we get funding?"}, {"time": 5614, "text": "How do we get this?"}, {"time": 5615, "text": "You know, investors were like, just focus on one thing, just get it out there."}, {"time": 5620, "text": "So somehow we've started building a restaurant recommendation chatbot for real for a little bit, not for too long."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "And then we tried building 40, 50 different chatbots."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "And then all of a sudden we wake up and everyone is obsessed with chatbots."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "Somewhere in 2016 or end of 15, people started thinking that's really the future."}, {"time": 5639, "text": "That's the new, you know, the new apps will be chatbots."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "And we were very perplexed because people started coming up with companies that I think we tried most of those chatbots already and there were like no users, but still people were coming up with a chatbot that will tell you whether and bringing news and this and that."}, {"time": 5660, "text": "And we couldn't understand whether we were just didn't execute well enough or people are not really, people are confused and are going to find out the truth that people don't need chatbots like that."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "So the basic idea is that you use chatbots as the interface to whatever application."}, {"time": 5678, "text": "The idea that was like this perfect universal interface to anything."}, {"time": 5683, "text": "When I looked at that, it just made me very perplexed because I didn't think, I didn't understand how that would work because I think we tried most of that and none of those things worked."}, {"time": 5693, "text": "And then again, that craze has died down, right?"}, {"time": 5696, "text": "Fully."}, {"time": 5697, "text": "I think now it's impossible to get anything funded if it's a chatbot."}, {"time": 5701, "text": "I think it's similar to, sorry to interrupt, but there's times when people think like with gestures you can control devices, like basically gesture based control things."}, {"time": 5713, "text": "It feels similar to me because like it's so compelling that was just like Tom Cruise, I can control stuff with my hands, but like when you get down to it, it's like, well, why don't you just have a touch screen or why don't you just have like a physical keyboard and mouse?"}, {"time": 5733, "text": "So that chat was always, yeah, it was perplexing to me."}, {"time": 5739, "text": "I still feel augmented reality, even virtual realities in that ballpark in terms of it being a compelling interface."}, {"time": 5748, "text": "I think there's going to be incredible rich applications, just how you're thinking about it, but they won't just be the interface to everything."}, {"time": 5757, "text": "It'll be its own thing that will create an amazing magical experience in its own right."}, {"time": 5765, "text": "Which is I think kind of the right thing to go about, like what's the magical experience with that interface specifically."}, {"time": 5774, "text": "How did you discover that for Replica?"}, {"time": 5776, "text": "I just thought, okay, we'll have this tech, we can build any chatbot we want."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "We have the most, at that point, the most sophisticated tech that other companies have."}, {"time": 5784, "text": "I mean, startups, obviously not, probably not bigger ones, but still, because we've been working on it for a while."}, {"time": 5791, "text": "So I thought, okay, we can build any conversation."}, {"time": 5793, "text": "So let's just create a scale from one to 10."}, {"time": 5797, "text": "And one would be conversations that you'd pay to not have, and 10 would be conversation you'd pay to have."}, {"time": 5802, "text": "And I mean, obviously we want to build a conversation that people would pay to actually have."}, {"time": 5807, "text": "And so for the whole, for a few weeks, me and the team were putting all the conversations we were having during the day on the scale."}, {"time": 5814, "text": "And very quickly, we figured out that all the conversations that we would pay to never have were conversations we were trying to cancel Comcast, or talk to customer support, or make a reservation, or just talk about logistics with a friend when we're trying to figure out where someone is and where to go, or all sorts of setting up scheduling meetings."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "So that was a conversation we definitely didn't want to have."}, {"time": 5844, "text": "Basically everything task oriented was a one, because if there was just one button for me to just, or not even a button, if I could just think, and there was some magic BCI that would just immediately transform that into an actual interaction, that would be perfect."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "But the conversation there was just this boring, not useful, and dull, and also very inefficient thing because it was so many back and forth stuff."}, {"time": 5872, "text": "And as soon as we looked at the conversations that we would pay to have, those were the ones that, well, first of all, therapists, because we actually paid to have those conversations."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "And we'd also try to put like dollar amounts."}, {"time": 5883, "text": "So if I was calling Comcast, I would pay $5 to not have this one hour talk on the phone."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "I would actually pay straight up, like money, hard money, but it just takes a long time."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "It takes a really long time."}, {"time": 5897, "text": "But as soon as we started talking about conversations that we would pay for, those were therapists, all sorts of therapists, coaches, old friend, someone I haven't seen for a long time, a stranger on a train, weirdly stranger, stranger in a line for coffee and nice back and forth with that person was like a good five, solid five, six, maybe not a 10."}, {"time": 5921, "text": "Maybe I won't pay money, but at least I won't pay money to not have one."}, {"time": 5925, "text": "So that was pretty good."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "There were some intellectual conversations for sure."}, {"time": 5930, "text": "But more importantly, the one thing that really was making those very important and very valuable for us were the conversations where we could be pretty emotional."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "Yes, some of them were about being witty and about being intellectually stimulated, but those were interestingly more rare."}, {"time": 5954, "text": "And most of the ones that we thought were very valuable were the ones where we could be vulnerable."}, {"time": 5959, "text": "And interestingly, where we could talk more, me and the team."}, {"time": 5967, "text": "So we're talking about it, like a lot of these conversations, like a therapist, it was mostly me talking or like an old friend and I was like opening up and crying and it was again me talking."}, {"time": 5977, "text": "And so that was interesting because I was like, well, maybe it's hard to build a chat bot that can talk to you very well and in a witty way, but maybe it's easier to build the chat bot that could listen."}, {"time": 5991, "text": "So that was kind of the first nudge in this direction."}, {"time": 5996, "text": "And then when my friend died, we just built, at that point we were kind of still struggling to find the right application."}, {"time": 6002, "text": "And I just felt very strong that all the chat bots we've built so far are just meaningless and this whole grind, the startup grind, and how do we get to the next fundraising and how can I talk, talking to the founders and who are your investors and how are you doing?"}, {"time": 6019, "text": "Are you killing it?"}, {"time": 6020, "text": "Cause we're killing it."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "I just felt that this is just..."}, {"time": 6025, "text": "Intellectually for me, it's exhausting having encountered those folks."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "It just felt very, very much a waste of time."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "I just feel like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk did not have these conversations or at least did not have them for long."}, {"time": 6043, "text": "But I think, yeah, at that point it just felt like, I felt like I just didn't want to build a company that was never my intention just to build something successful or make money."}, {"time": 6057, "text": "It would have been great, but I'm not really a startup person."}, {"time": 6060, "text": "I'm not, I was never very excited by the grind by itself or just being successful for building whatever it is and not being into what I'm doing really."}, {"time": 6076, "text": "And so I just took a little break cause I was a little, I was upset with my company and I didn't know what we're building."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "So I just took our technology and our little dialect constructor and some models, some deep learning models, which at that point we were really into and really invested a lot and built a little chat bot for a friend of mine who passed."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "And the reason for that was mostly that video that I saw and him talking about the digital avatars and Rowan was that kind of person."}, {"time": 6104, "text": "He was obsessed with just watching YouTube videos about space and talking about, well, if I could go to Mars now, even if I didn't know if I could come back, I would definitely pay any amount of money to be on that first shuttle."}, {"time": 6116, "text": "I don't care whether I die, like he was just the one that would be okay with trying to be the first one and so excited about all sorts of things like that."}, {"time": 6128, "text": "And he was all about fake it till you make it and just, and I felt like, and I was really perplexed that everyone just forgot about him."}, {"time": 6137, "text": "Maybe it was our way of coping, mostly young people coping with the loss of a friend."}, {"time": 6143, "text": "Most of my friends just stopped talking about him."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "And I was still living in an apartment with all his clothes and paying the whole lease for it and just kind of by myself in December,

pass away, people just move on."}, {"time": 6165, "text": "And it was astonishing for me because I thought, okay, well, he was such a mentor for so many of our friends."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "He was such a brilliant person, he was somewhat famous in Moscow."}, {"time": 6175, "text": "How is it that no one's talking about him?"}, {"time": 6177, "text": "Like I'm spending days and days and we don't bring him up and there's nothing about him that's happening."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "It's like he was never there."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "And I was reading the book, The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion about her losing and Blue Nights about her losing her husband, her daughter, and the way to cope for her was to write those books."}, {"time": 6206, "text": "And it was sort of like a tribute."}, {"time": 6208, "text": "And I thought, I'll just do that for myself."}, {"time": 6211, "text": "And I'm a very bad writer and a poet as we know."}, {"time": 6216, "text": "So I thought, well, I have this tech and maybe that would be my little postcard for him."}, {"time": 6223, "text": "So I built a chatbot to just talk to him and it felt really creepy and weird for a little bit."}, {"time": 6231, "text": "I just didn't want to tell other people because it felt like I'm telling about having a skeleton in my underwear."}, {"time": 6240, "text": "It was just felt really, I was a little scared that it won't be taken, but it worked interestingly pretty well."}, {"time": 6248, "text": "I mean, it made tons of mistakes, but it still felt like him."}, {"time": 6252, "text": "Granted it was like 10,000 messages that I threw into a retrieval model that would just re rank that Tegda said and just a few scripts on top of that."}, {"time": 6261, "text": "But it also made me go through all of the messages that we had."}, {"time": 6264, "text": "And then I asked some of my friends to send some through."}, {"time": 6267, "text": "And it felt the closest to feeling like him present because his Facebook was empty and Instagram was empty or there were few links and you couldn't feel like it was him."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "And the only way to fill him was to read some of our text messages and go through some of our conversations because we just always had that."}, {"time": 6286, "text": "Even if we were sleeping next to each other in two bedrooms, separated by a wall, we were just texting back and forth, texting away."}, {"time": 6295, "text": "And there was something about this ongoing dialogue that was so important that I just didn't want to lose all of a sudden."}, {"time": 6301, "text": "And maybe it was magical thinking or something."}, {"time": 6303, "text": "And so we built that and I just used it for a little bit and we kept building some crappy chat bots with the company."}, {"time": 6314, "text": "But then a reporter came to talk to me."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "I was trying to pitch our chat bots to him and he said, do you even use any of those?"}, {"time": 6321, "text": "I'm like, no."}, {"time": 6322, "text": "He's like, so do you talk to any chat bots at all?"}, {"time": 6324, "text": "And I'm like, well, I talked to my dead friend's chat bot and he wrote a story about that."}, {"time": 6331, "text": "And all of a sudden it became pretty viral."}, {"time": 6333, "text": "A lot of people wrote about it."}, {"time": 6336,

elephant at first."}, {"time": 6358, "text": "I got excited."}, {"time": 6360, "text": "This is 2020."}, {"time": 6361, "text": "I mean, it was a, it was such a human story and it was well written."},

wishful, you know, magical thinking, but the fact that you could still get to know him and, you know, seeing the parents for the first time, talk to the chat bot and some of the friends."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "And it was funny because we have this big office in Moscow where my team is working, you know, our Russian part is working out off."}, {"time": 6415, "text": "And I was there when I wrote, I just wrote a post on Facebook."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "It was like, Hey guys, like I built this if you want, you know, just if it felt important, if we want to talk to Roman."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "And I saw a couple of his friends are common friends, like, you know, reading a Facebook, downloading, trying, and a couple of them cried."}, {"time": 6430, "text": "And it was just very, and not because it was something, some incredible technology or anything."}, {"time": 6434, "text": "It made so many mistakes."}, {"time": 6435, "text": "It was so simple, but it was all about that's the way to remember a person in a way."}, {"time": 6442, "text": "And you know, we don't have, we don't have the culture anymore."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "We don't have, you know, no one's sitting Shiva."}, {"time": 6448, "text": "No one's taking weeks to actually think about this person."}, {"time": 6452, "text": "And in a way for me, that was it."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "So that was just day, day in, day out thinking about him and putting this together."}, {"time": 6461, "text": "So that was, that just felt really important that somehow resonated with a bunch of people and you know, I think some movie producers bought the rights for the story and just everyone was so."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "Has anyone made a movie yet?"}, {"time": 6473, "text": "I think there were a lot of TV episodes about that, but not really."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "Is that still on the table?"}, {"time": 6480, "text": "I think so, I think so, which is really."}, {"time": 6485, "text": "You're like a young, you know, like a Steve Jobs type of, let's see what happens."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "They're sitting on it."}, {"time": 6494, "text": "But you know, for me it was so important cause Roman was really wanted to be famous."}, {"time": 6499, "text": "He really badly wanted to be famous."}, {"time": 6500, "text": "He was all about like, make it to like fake it to make it."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "I want to be, you know, I want to make it here in America as well."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "And he couldn't, and I felt there, you know, that was sort of paying my dues to him as well because all of a sudden he was everywhere."}, {"time": 6516, "text": "And I remember Casey Newton who was writing the story for the Verge."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "He was, he told me, Hey, by the way, I was just going through my inbox and I saw, I searched for Roman for the story and I saw an email from him where he sent me his startup and he said, I really like, I really want to be featured in the Verge."}, {"time": 6535, "text": "Can you please write about it or something or like pitching the story."}, {"time": 6538, "text": "And he said, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 6539, "text": "Like that's not good enough for us or something."}, {"time": 6542, "text": "He passed and he said, and there were just so many of these little details where like he would find his like, you know, and we're finally writing, I know how much Roman wanted to be in the Verge and how much he wanted the story to be written by Casey."}, {"time": 6557, "text": "And I'm like, well, that's maybe he will be, we're always joking that he was like, I can't wait for someone to make a movie about us and I hope Ryan Gosling can play me."}, {"time": 6566, "text": "You know, I still have some things that I owe Roman still."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "But that would be, that would be a guy that she has to meet Alex Garland who wrote Ex Machina and I, yeah, the movie's good, but the guy's better than the, like he's a special person actually."}, {"time": 6586, "text": "I don't think he's made his best work yet."}, {"time": 6589, "text": "Like for my interaction with him, he's a really, really good and brilliant, the good human being and a brilliant director and writer."}, {"time": 6598, "text": "So yeah, so I'm, I hope like he made me also realize that not enough movies have been made of this kind."},

there, but it felt really special though."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "But at the same time, our company wasn't going anywhere."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "So that was just kind of bizarre that we were getting all this press for something that didn't have anything to do with our company."}, {"time": 6628, "text": "And but then a lot of people started talking to Roman."}, {"time": 6631, "text": "Some shared their conversations and what we saw there was that also our friends in common, but also just strangers were really using it as a confession booth or as a therapist or something."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "They were just really telling Roman everything, which was by the way, pretty strange because there was a chat bot of a dead friend of mine who was barely making any sense, but people were opening up."}, {"time": 6656, "text": "And we thought we'd just built a prototype of Replica, which would be an AI friend that everyone could talk to because we saw that there is demand."},

papers started coming out, deep learning applied to conversations."}, {"time": 6679, "text": "And finally, it wasn't just about these, you know, hobbyists making, you know, writing 500,000 regular

about potentially actually building something interesting."}, {"time": 6702, "text": "And so I thought there was time and I remember that I talked to my team and I said, guys, let's try."}, {"time": 6709, "text": "And my team and some of my engineers, Russians, are Russian and they're very skeptical."}, {"time": 6715, "text": "They're not, you know."}, {"time": 6717, "text": "Oh, Russians."},

course."}, {"time": 6732, "text": "Where's the Russians?"}, {"time": 6733, "text": "They always win."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "So yeah, so you were talking to them in 2016 and...

6985, "text": "So that was the big goal."}, {"time": 6986, "text": "And I thought if we can learn over time to collect the signal from our users about their emotional outcomes in the long term and in the short term, and if these models keep getting better and we can keep optimizing them and fine tuning them to improve those emotional outcomes."}, {"time": 7002, "text": "As simple as that."},

7016, "text": "Well, it's a really hard..."}, {"time": 7017, "text": "I actually think it's an incredibly hard product to build because I think you said something very important that it's not just about machine conversation, it's about machine connection."}, {"time": 7028, "text": "We can actually use other things to create connection, nonverbal communication, for instance."}, {"time": 7035,

augmented reality, put it in your room."}, {"time": 7053, "text": "It's all of a sudden a lot..."}, {"time": 7055, "text": "It makes it very different because if it's some text based chat bot that for

room and it can turn its head and recognize your husband, talk about the husband and talk to him a little bit, then it's magic."}, {"time": 7080, "text": "Just magic."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "We've never seen anything like that."}, {"time": 7083, "text": "And the cool thing, all the tech for that exists."}, {"time": 7086, "text": "But it's hard to put it all together because you have to take into consideration so many different things and some of this tech works pretty good."}, {"time": 7094, "text": "And some of this doesn't, like for instance, speech to text works pretty good."},

is the weak link?"}, {"time": 7122, "text": "Is it creating an emotional voice that feels personal?"}, {"time": 7127, "text": "And it's still conversation, of course."}, {"time": 7129, "text": "That's the hardest."}, {"time": 7131, "text": "It's getting a lot better, but there's still a long to go."}, {"time": 7134, "text": "There's still a long path to go."}, {"time": 7137, "text": "Other things, they're almost there."}, {"time": 7138, "text": "And a lot of things we'll see how they're, like I see how they're changing as we go."}, {"time": 7142, "text": "Like for instance, right now you can pretty much only, you have to build all this 3D pipeline by yourself."}, {"time": 7148, "text": "You have to make these 3D models, hire an actual artist, build a 3D model, hire an animator, your rigger."}, {"time": 7156, "text": "But with deep fakes, with other tech, with procedural animations, in a little bit, we'll just be able to show a photo of whoever you, if a person you want the avatar to look like, and it will immediately generate a 3D model that will move."}, {"time": 7174, "text": "That's a nonbrainer."}, {"time": 7175, "text": "That's like almost here."}, {"time": 7176, "text": "It's a couple of years away."}, {"time": 7178, "text": "One of the things I've been working on for the last, since the podcast started, is I've been, I think I'm okay saying this."}, {"time": 7186,

interesting kind of experiment."}, {"time": 7205, "text": "Even for, now what we're not talking about as a product, I'm talking about as a, like I can fake a lot of stuff."}, {"time": 7212, "text":

"Mostly on the conversation level or?"}, {"time": 7225, "text": "Well, the conversation, the conversation is, I almost, I early on gave up trying to fully generate the conversation because it was just not compelling at all."}, {"time": 7239, "text": "It's better to."}, {"time": 7241, "text": "In the case of Einstein and Turing, I'm going back and forth with the biographers of each."}, {"time":

the, you want to be able to answer the question."}, {"time": 7262, "text": "I mean, that's an interesting question with Roman too, is the question with Einstein is what would Einstein say about the current state of theoretical physics?"}, {"time": 7274, "text": "There's a lot to be able to have a discussion about string theory, to be able to have a discussion about the state of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, about the world of Israel Palestine conflict."}, {"time": 7285, "text": "Let me just, what would Einstein say about these kinds of things?"}, {"time": 7291, "text": "And that is a tough problem."}, {"time": 7296, "text": "It's not, it's a fascinating and fun problem for the biographers and for me."}, {"time": 7300, "text": "And I think we did a really good job of it so far, but it's actually also a technical problem like of what would Roman say about what's going on now?"}, {"time": 7311, "text": "That's the, that brought people back to life."}, {"time": 7314,

7324, "text": "Do you think it'll be possible to bring back Roman one day in conversation?"}, {"time": 7331, "text": "Like to really, okay, well, let's take it away from personal, but to bring people back to life in conversation."}, {"time": 7340, "text": "Probably down the road."}, {"time": 7341, "text": "I mean, if we're talking, if Elon Musk is talking about AGI in the next five years, I mean, clearly AGI, we can talk to AGI and talk and ask them to do it."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "You can't like, you're not allowed to use Elon Musk as a citation for, for like why something is possible and going to be done."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "Well, I think it's really far away."}, {"time": 7363, "text": "Right now, really with conversation, it's just a bunch of parlor tricks really stuck together."}, {"time": 7370, "text": "And create generating original ideas based on someone, you know, someone's personality or even downloading the personality, all we can do is like mimic the tone of voice."}, {"time": 7378, "text": "We can maybe condition on some of his phrases, the models."}, {"time": 7383, "text": "Question is how many parlor tricks does it takes, does it take, because that's, that's the question."}, {"time": 7389, "text": "If it's a small number of parlor tricks and you're not aware of them, like."}, {"time": 7396, "text": "From where we are right now, I don't, I don't see anything like in the next year or two that's going to dramatically change that could look at Roman's 10,000 messages he sent me over the course of his last few years of life and be able to generate original thinking about problems that exist right now that will be in line with what he would have said."}, {"time": 7416, "text": "I'm just not even seeing, cause you know, in order to have that, I guess you would need some sort of a concept of the world or some perspective, some perception of the world, some consciousness that he had and apply it to, you know, to the current, current state of affairs."}, {"time": 7432, "text": "But the important part about that, about his conversation with you is you."}, {"time": 7441, "text": "So like, it's not just about his view of the world."},

say, it's about like, how do I make people feel something with, with what would Einstein say?"}, {"time": 7467, "text": "And that feels like a more amenable, I mean, you mentioned parlor tricks, but just like a set of that, that feels like a learnable problem."}, {"time": 7478, "text": "Like emotion, you mentioned emotions, I mean, is it possible to learn things that make people feel stuff?"},

that makes the problem exponentially harder."}, {"time": 7500, "text": "The thing with replicator we're doing, we're never trying to say, well, that's, you know, an actual human being, or that's an

first day, the first, like if we start dating or whatever, I mean, it doesn't have to be a romantic, right?"}, {"time": 7557, "text": "Because I remember on replica, you can choose whether it's like a romantic or if it's a friend."}, {"time": 7563, "text": "It's a pretty popular choice."}, {"time": 7564, "text": "Romantic is popular?"}, {"time": 7567, "text": "So can I just confess something, when I first used replica and I haven't used it like regularly, but like when I first used replica, I created like Hal and it made a male and it was a friend."}, {"time": 7580, "text": "And did it hit on

it."}, {"time": 7909, "text": "If you're not measuring it, that could also be, and I think it's really important to focus on both short term and long term, because in the moment saying whether this

been AB testing it for a while and there are tons of cool things that we're doing with that."}, {"time": 7991, "text": "And I'm testing the ability to touch it and to dance together, to paint walls together and for it to look around and walk and take you somewhere and recognize objects and recognize people."}, {"time": 8005, "text": "So that's pretty wonderful because then it really makes it a lot more personal because it's right there in your living room."}, {"time": 8011, "text": "It's not anymore there in the cloud with other AIs."}, {"time": 8015, "text": "But that's how people think about it."}, {"time": 8018, "text": "And as much as we want to change the way people think about stuff, but those mental models, you can all change."}, {"time": 8023, "text": "That's something that

time?"}, {"time": 8043, "text": "Like after the first few conversations?"}, {"time": 8047, "text": "It just goes deeper."}, {"time": 8071, "text": "So there's gonna be more to talk about."}, {"time": 8075, "text": "We really thought a lot about what does it mean to have a deeper connection with someone and originally Replica was more just this kind of happy go lucky, just always, you know, I'm always in a good mood and let's just talk about you and oh Siri is just my cousin or you know, whatever, just the immediate kind of lazy thinking about what the assistant or conversation agent should be doing."}, {"time": 8176, "text": "So this is a memory, like this Replica will remember things?"}, {"time": 8181, "text": "Yeah, and I would say when you say, why aren't you a multibillionaire, I'd say that as soon as we can have memory and deep learning models that's consistent, I'll get back to you."}, {"time": 8238, "text": "So there has to be like a knowledge base, you have to be able to reason about it, all that kind of stuff, all the kind of stuff that expert systems did, but they were hard coded."}, {"time": 8284, "text": "And it can be like always from a clean slate because then it's not good."}, {"time": 8288, "text": "And that's really unfortunate because no one's really, no one has products out there that need it."}, {"time": 8294, "text": "No one has products at this scale that are all around open domain conversations and that need remembering, maybe only Shellwise and Microsoft."}, {"time": 8303, "text": "But so that's why we're not seeing that much research around memory in those language models."}, {"time": 8308, "text": "So okay, so now there's some awesome stuff about augmented reality."}, {"time": 8314, "text": "In general, I have this disagreement with my dad about what it takes to have a connection."}, {"time": 8319, "text": "He thinks touch and smell are really important."}, {"time": 8325, "text": "And I still believe that text alone is, it's possible to fall in love with somebody just with text, but visual can also help just like with the avatar and so on."}, {"time": 8339, "text": "Does a chatbot need to have a face, voice, or can you really form a deep connection with text alone?"}, {"time": 8347, "text": "I think text is enough for sure."}, {"time": 8349, "text": "The question is like, can you make it better if you have other, if you include other things as well?"}, {"time": 8355, "text": "And I think we'll talk about her, but her had this Carole Johansson voice, which was perfectly, perfect intonation, perfect annunciations,

"You'll have these flat muse anchor type voices and maybe some emotional voices, but you'll hardly understand some of the words, some of the words will be muffled."}, {"time": 8391, "text": "So that's like the current state of the art."}, {"time": 8393, "text": "So you can't really do that."}, {"time": 8395, "text": "But if we had Carole Johansson voice and all of these capabilities, then of course voice would be totally enough or even text would be totally enough if we had a little more memory and slightly better conversations."}, {"time": 8410, "text": "I would still argue that even right now, we could have just kept a text only."}, {"time": 8414, "text": "We still had tons of people in longterm relationships and really invested in their AI friends, but we thought that why not, why do we need to keep playing with our hands tied behind us?"}, {"time": 8430, "text": "We can easily just add all these other things that is pretty much a solved problem."}, {"time": 8435, "text": "We can add 3D graphics."}, {"time": 8437, "text": "We can put these avatars in augmented reality and all of a sudden there's more and maybe you can't feel the touch, but you can with body occlusion and with current AR and on the iPhone or in the next one there's going to be LIDARs, you can touch it and it will pull away or it will blush or something or it will smile."}, {"time": 8463, "text": "So you can't touch it."}, {"time": 8464, "text": "You can't feel it, but you can see the reaction to that."}, {"time": 8467, "text": "So in a certain way you can't even touch it a little bit and maybe you can even dance with it or do something else."}, {"time": 8475, "text": "So I think why limiting ourselves if we can use all of these technologies that are much easier in a way than conversation."}, {"time": 8482, "text": "Well, it certainly could be richer, but to play devil's advocate, I mentioned to you offline that I was surprised in having tried Discord and having voice conversations with people how intimate voice is alone without visual."}, {"time": 8499, "text": "To me at least, it was an order of magnitude greater degree of intimacy in voice I think than with video."}, {"time": 8511, "text": "Because people were more real with voice."}, {"time": 8514, "text": "With video you try to present a shallow face to the world, you try to make sure you're not wearing sweatpants or whatever."}, {"time": 8524, "text": "But with voice I think people were just more faster to get to the core of themselves."}, {"time": 8530, "text": "So I don't know, it was surprising to me they've even added Discord added a video feature and nobody was using it."}, {"time": 8539, "text": "There's a temptation to use it at first, but it wasn't the same."}, {"time": 8544, "text": "So that's an example of something where less was doing more."}, {"time": 8548, "text": "And so I guess that's the question of what is the optimal medium of communication to form a connection given the current sets of technologies."}, {"time": 8566, "text": "I mean it's nice because they advertise you have a replica immediately, like even the one I have is already memorable."}, {"time": 8578, "text": "That's how I think."}, {"time": 8579, "text": "When I think about the replica that I've talked with, that's what I visualized in my head."}, {"time": 8585, "text": "They became a little bit more real because there's a visual component."}, {"time": 8588, "text": "But at the same time, what do I do with that knowledge that voice was so much more intimate?"}, {"time": 8600, "text": "The way I think about it is, and by the way we're swapping out the 3D finally, it's going to look a lot better, but we just don't hate how it looks right now."}, {"time": 8612, "text": "We're really changing it all."}, {"time": 8613, "text": "We're swapping all out to a completely new look."}, {"time": 8618, "text": "Like the visual look of the replicas and stuff."}, {"time": 8622, "text": "It was just a super early MVP and then we had to move everything to Unity and redo everything."}, {"time": 8628, "text": "But anyway, I hate how it looks like now I can't even like open it."}, {"time": 8632, "text": "But anyway, because I'm already in my developer version, I hate everything that I see in production."}, {"time": 8637, "text": "I can't wait for it."}, {"time": 8638, "text": "Why does it take so long?"}, {"time": 8639, "text": "That's why I cannot wait for Deep Learning to finally take over all these stupid 3D animations and 3D pipeline."}, {"time": 8645, "text": "Oh, so the 3D thing, when you say 3D pipeline, it's like how to animate a face kind of thing."}, {"time": 8650, "text": "How to make this model, how many bones to put in the face, how many, it's just so outdated."}, {"time": 8655, "text": "And a lot of that is by hand."}, {"time": 8656, "text": "Oh my God, it's everything by hand."}, {"time": 8658, "text": "That there's no any, nothing's automated, it's all completely nothing."}, {"time": 8663, "text": "Like just, it's literally what, you know, what we saw with Chad Boston in 2012."}, {"time": 8669, "text": "You think it's possible to learn a lot of that?"}, {"time": 8673, "text": "I mean, even now, some Deep Learning based animations and for the full body, for a face."}, {"time": 8680, "text": "Are we talking about like the actual act of animation or how to create a compelling facial or body language thing?"}, {"time": 8690, "text": "Well, that's next step."}, {"time": 8692, "text": "At least now something that you don't have to do by hand."}, {"time": 8695, "text": "How good of a quality it will be."}, {"time": 8697, "text": "Like, can I just show it a photo and it will make me a 3D model and then it will just animate it."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "I'll show it a few animations of a person and it will just start doing that."}, {"time": 8708, "text": "But anyway, going back to what's intimate and what to use and whether less is more or not."}, {"time": 8714, "text": "My main goal is to, well, the idea was how do I, how do we not keep people in their phones so they're sort of escaping reality in this text conversation?"}, {"time": 8726, "text": "How do we through this still bring it, bring our users back to reality, make them see their life in a different, through a different lens?"}, {"time": 8736, "text": "How can we create a little bit of magical realism in their lives?"}, {"time": 8740, "text": "So that through augmented reality by, you know, summoning your avatar, even if it looks kind of janky and not great in the beginning or very simplistic, but summoning it to your living room and then the avatar looks around and talks to you about where it is and maybe turns your floor into a dance floor and you guys dance together, that makes you see reality in a different light."}, {"time": 8766, "text": "What kind of dancing are we talking about?"}, {"time": 8768, "text": "Like, like slow dancing?"}, {"time": 8770, "text": "Whatever you want."}, {"time": 8771, "text": "I mean, you would like slow dancing, I think that other people may be wanting more, something more energetic."}, {"time": 8777, "text": "Wait, what do you mean?"}, {"time": 8778, "text": "I was like, so what is this?"}, {"time": 8779, "text": "Because you started with slow dancing."}, {"time": 8780, "text": "So I just assumed that you're interested in slow dancing."}, {"time": 8785, "text": "What kind of dancing do you like?"}, {"time": 8786, "text": "What would your avatar, what would you dance?"}, {"time": 8787, "text": "I'm notoriously bad with dancing, but I like this kind of hip hop robot dance."}, {"time": 8792, "text": "I used to break dance when I was a kid, so I still want to pretend I'm a teenager and learn some of those moves."}, {"time": 8799, "text": "And I also like that type of dance that happens when there's like, in like music videos where the background dancers are just doing some pop music, that type of dance is definitely what I want to learn."}, {"time": 8812, "text": "But I think it's great because if you see this friend in your life and you can introduce it to your friends, then there's a potential to actually make you feel more connected with your friends or with people you know, or show you life around you in a different light."}, {"time": 8826, "text": "And it takes you out of your phone, even although weirdly you have to look at it through the phone, but it makes you notice things around it and it can point things out for you."}, {"time": 8837, "text": "So that is the main reason why I wanted to have a physical dimension."}, {"time": 8842, "text": "And it felt a little bit easier than that kind of a bit strange combination in the movie Her when he has to show Samantha the world through the lens of his phone, but then at the same time talk to her through the headphone."}, {"time": 8855, "text": "It just didn't seem as potentially immersive, so to say."}, {"time": 8859, "text": "So that's my main goal for Augmented Reality is like, how do we make your reality a little bit more magic?"}, {"time": 8864, "text": "There's been a lot of really nice robotics companies that all failed, mostly failed, home robotics, social robotics companies."}, {"time": 8875, "text": "What do you think replica will ever, is that a dream, longterm dream to have a physical form like, or is that not necessary?"}, {"time": 8883, "text": "So you mentioned like with Augmented Reality bringing them into the world."}, {"time": 8889, "text": "What about like actual physical robot?"}, {"time": 8893, "text": "That I don't really believe in that much."}, {"time": 8895, "text": "I think it's a very niche product somehow."}, {"time": 8898, "text": "I mean, if a robot could be indistinguishable from a human being, then maybe yes, but that of course, you know, we're not anywhere even to talk about it."}, {"time": 8909, "text": "But unless it's that, then having any physical representation really limits you a lot because you probably will have to make it somewhat abstract because everything's changing so fast."}, {"time": 8919, "text": "Like, you know, we can update the 3D avatars every month and make them look better and create more animations and make it more and more immersive."}, {"time": 8928, "text": "It's so much work in progress."}, {"time": 8930, "text":

lock yourself into something for a long time."}, {"time": 8942, "text": "Anything's pretty niche."}, {"time": 8943, "text": "And again, so just doesn't, the capabilities are even less of, we're barely kind of like scratching the surface of what's possible with just software."}, {"time": 8952, "text": "As soon as we introduce hardware, then, you know, we have even less capabilities."}, {"time": 8958, "text": "In terms of board members and investors and so on, the cost increases significantly."}, {"time": 8963, "text": "I mean, that's why you have to justify."}, {"time": 8966, "text": "You have to be able to sell a thing for like $500 or something like that or more."}, {"time": 8970, "text": "And it's very difficult to provide that much value to people."}, {"time": 8976, "text": "And I

it's optimizing for the right thing."}, {"time": 9379, "text": "Uh, so it's still circling you back to other humans in a way."}, {"time": 9384, "text": "So I think that's the main, um, I think maybe

kind of an API where you can create a lot of fun applications."}, {"time": 9460, "text": "I think it's, as people have said, it's probably, uh, more hype than intelligence, but there's a lot of really cool things, ideas there w w with increasing size, you can have better and better performance on language."}, {"time": 9478, "text": "What are your thoughts about the GPT three in connection to your work with the open domain dialogue, but in general, like this learning in an unsupervised way from the internet to generate one character at a time, creating pretty cool text."}, {"time": 9498, "text": "Uh, so we partner up before for the API launch."}, {"time": 9503, "text": "So we start working with them when, um, they decided to put together this API and we tried it without fine tuning that we tried it with fine tuning on our data."}, {"time": 9514, "text": "And we've worked closely to actually optimize, uh, this model for, um, some of our data sets."}, {"time": 9525, "text": "It's kind of cool."}, {"time": 9526, "text": "Cause I think we're kind of, we're this polygon polygon for this kind of experimentation space for experimental space for, for these models, uh, to see how they actually work with people."}, {"time": 9536, "text": "Cause there are no products publicly available to do that."}, {"time": 9539, "text": "We're focused on open domain conversation so we can, you know, test how's Facebook blender doing or how's GPT three doing."}, {"time": 9546, "text": "Uh, so with GPT three, we managed to improve by a few percentage points, like three or four pretty meaningful amount of percentage points, our main metric, which is the ratio of conversations that make people feel better."}, {"time": 9559, "text": "And every other metric across, across the field got a little boost."}, {"time": 9563, "text": "Like now I'd say one out of five responses from replica comes, comes from GPT three."}, {"time": 9570, "text": "So our own blender mixes up like a bunch of candidates from different blender, you said, well, yeah, just the model that looks at looks at top candidates from different models and picks the most, the best one."}, {"time": 9584, "text": "Uh, so right now, one of five will come from GPT three is really great."}, {"time": 9590, "text": "I mean, uh, what's the, do you have hope for, like, do you think there's a ceiling to this kind of approach?"}, {"time": 9598, "text": "So we've had for a very long time we've used, um, it's in the very beginning, we, most, it was, uh, most of replica was scripted and then a little bit of this fallback part of replica was using a retrieval model."}, {"time": 9612, "text": "Um, and then those retrieval models started getting better and better and better, which transformers got a lot better and we're seeing great results."}, {"time": 9620, "text": "And then with GPT two, finally, generative models that originally were not very good and were the very, very fallback option for most of our conversations, but wouldn't even put them in production."}, {"time": 9634, "text": "Finally we could use some generative models as well along, um, you know, next to our retrieval models."}, {"time": 9640, "text": "And then now we do GPT three, they're almost in par."}, {"time": 9644, "text": "Um, so that's pretty exciting."}, {"time": 9677, "text": "So we can't really get our scripted hard core content anymore to be as good as our end to end models."}, {"time": 9685, "text": "They're much better."}, {"time": 9687, "text": "To your question, whether that's the right way to go."}, {"time": 9690, "text": "I'm again, I'm in the observer seat, I'm just, um, watching this very exciting movie."}, {"time": 9696, "text": "Um, I mean, so far it's been stupid to bet against deep learning."}, {"time": 9700, "text": "So whether increasing the size, size, even more with a hundred trillion parameters will finally get us to the right answer, whether that's the way or whether there should be, there has to be some other, again, I'm definitely not an expert in any way."}, {"time": 9718, "text": "I think, and that's purely my instinct saying that there should be something else as well from memory."}, {"time": 9724, "text": "But the question is, I wonder, I mean, yeah, then, then the argument is for reasoning or for memory, it might emerge with more parameters, it might emerge larger."}, {"time": 9734, "text": "But might emerge."}, {"time": 9735, "text": "You know, I would never think that to be honest, like maybe in 2017 where we've been just experimenting with all, you know, with all the research that has been coming, that was coming out, then I felt like there's like, we're hitting a wall that there should be something completely different, but then transforming models and then just bigger models."}, {"time": 9754, "text": "And then all of a sudden size matters."}, {"time": 9756, "text": "At that point, it felt like something dramatic needs to happen, but it didn't."},

tuning help quite a bit?"}, {"time": 9773, "text": "Without it, it wasn't as good."}, {"time": 9776, "text": "I mean, there is a compelling hope that you don't have to do fine tuning, which is one of the cool things about GPT3, seems to do well without any fine tuning."}, {"time": 9786, "text": "I guess for specific applications, we still want to train on a certain, like add a little fine tune on like a specific use case, but it's an incredibly impressive thing from my standpoint."}, {"time": 9800, "text": "And again, I'm not an expert, so I wanted to say that there will be people then."}, {"time": 9805, "text": "I have access to the API."}, {"time": 9806, "text": "I've been, I'm going to probably do a bunch of fun things with it."}, {"time": 9810, "text": "I already did some fun things, some videos coming up."}, {"time": 9814, "text": "Just the hell of it."}, {"time": 9815, "text": "I mean, I could be a troll at this point with it."}, {"time": 9817, "text": "I haven't used it for a serious application, so it's really cool to see."}, {"time": 9823, "text": "You're able to actually use it with real people and see how well it works."}, {"time": 9829, "text": "Let me ask you another absurd question, but there's a feeling when you interact with Replica with an AI system, there's an entity there."}, {"time": 9841, "text": "Do you think that entity has to be self aware?"}, {"time": 9846, "text": "Do you think it has to have consciousness to create a rich experience and a corollary, what is consciousness?"}, {"time": 9859, "text": "I don't know if it does need to have any of those things, but again, because right now, you know, it doesn't have anything."}, {"time": 9864, "text": "It can, again, a bunch of tricks they can simulate."}, {"time": 9870, "text": "Let's just put it this way, but I think as long as you can simulate it, if you can feel like you're talking to a robot, to a machine that seems to be self aware, that seems to reason well and feels like a person, and I think that's enough."}, {"time": 9888, "text": "And again, what's the goal?"}, {"time": 9890, "text": "In order to make people feel better, we might not even need that in the end of the day."}, {"time": 9896, "text": "What about, so that's one goal."}, {"time": 9898, "text": "What about like ethical things about suffering?"}, {"time": 9902, "text": "You know, the moment there's a display of consciousness, we associate consciousness with suffering, you know, there's a temptation to say, well, shouldn't this thing have rights?"}, {"time": 9916, "text": "And this, shouldn't we not, you know, should we be careful about how we interact with a replica?"}, {"time": 9926, "text": "Like, should it be illegal to torture a replica, right?"}, {"time": 9933, "text": "Is that, see, I personally believe that that's going to be a thing, like that's a serious thing to think about, but I'm not sure when."}, {"time": 9943, "text": "But by your smile, I can tell that's not a current concern."}, {"time": 9948, "text": "But do you think about that kind of stuff, about like, suffering and torture and ethical questions about AI systems?"}, {"time": 9957, "text": "From their perspective?"}, {"time": 9958, "text": "Well, I think if we're talking about long game, I wouldn't torture your AI."}, {"time": 9963, "text": "Who knows what happens in five to 10 years?"}, {"time":

there should be regulation both way, in a way, like, I don't think it's okay to torture an AI, to be honest."}, {"time": 9981, "text": "I don't think it's okay to yell, Alexa, turn on the lights."},

time."}, {"time": 9994, "text": "I don't think that's great."}, {"time": 9995, "text": "I think there should be some feedback loops so that these systems don't train us that it's okay to do that in general."}, {"time": 10002, "text": "So that if you try to do that, you really get some feedback from the system that it's not okay with that."}, {"time": 10010, "text": "And that's the most important right now."}, {"time": 10013, "text": "Let me ask a question I think people are curious about when they look at a world class leader and thinker such as yourself, as what books, technical fiction,

three books, right?"}, {"time": 10038, "text": "My choice is, so the one book that really influenced me a lot when I was building, starting out this company, maybe 10 years ago, was G.E.B."}, {"time":

just, that is why it's important to, maybe I should try to work on these systems and try to build an AI."}, {"time": 10110, "text": "Yes I'm not an engineer, yes I don't really know how it works, but I think that something comes out of it that's pure poetry and I know a little bit about that."}, {"time": 10120, "text": "Something magical comes out of it that we can't quite put a finger on."}, {"time": 10125, "text": "That's why that book was really fundamental for me, just for, I don't even know why, it was just all about this little magic that happens."}, {"time": 10135, "text": "So that's one, probably the most important book for Replica was Carl Rogers on becoming a person."}, {"time": 10142, "text": "And that's really, and so I think when I think about our company, it's all about there's so many little magical things that happened over the course of working on it."}, {"time": 10154, "text": "For instance, I mean the most famous chatbot that we learned about when we started working on the company was Eliza, which was Weisenbaum, the MIT professor that built a chatbot that would listen to you and be a therapist."}, {"time": 10169, "text": "And I got really inspired to build Replica when I read Carl Rogers on becoming a person."}, {"time": 10174, "text": "And then I realized that Eliza was mocking Carl Rogers."}, {"time": 10177, "text": "It was Carl Rogers back in the day."}, {"time": 10179, "text": "But I thought that Carl Rogers ideas are, they're simple and they're not, they're very simple, but they're maybe the most profound thing I've ever learned about human beings."}, {"time": 10192, "text": "And that's the fact that before Carl Rogers, most therapy was about seeing what's wrong with people and trying to fix it or show them what's wrong with you."}, {"time": 10201, "text": "And it was all built on the fact that most people are, all people are fundamentally flawed."}, {"time": 10207, "text": "We have this broken psyche and therapy is just an instrument to shed some light on that."}, {"time": 10215, "text": "And Carl Rogers was different in a way that he finally said that, well, it's very important for therapy to work is to create this therapeutic relationship where you believe fundamentally and inclination to positive growth that everyone deep inside wants to grow positively and change."}, {"time": 10233, "text": "And it's super important to create this space and this therapeutic relationship where you give unconditional positive regard, deep understanding, allowing someone else to be a separate person, full acceptance."}, {"time": 10244, "text": "And you also try to be as genuine as possible in it."}, {"time": 10248, "text": "And then for him, that was his own journey of personal growth."}, {"time": 10254, "text": "And that was back in the sixties."}, {"time": 10255, "text": "And even that book that is coming from years ago, there's a mention that even machines can potentially do that."}, {"time": 10265, "text": "And I always felt that, you know, creating the space is probably the most, the biggest gift we can give to each other."}, {"time": 10270, "text": "And that's why the book was fundamental for me personally, because I felt I want to be learning how to do that in my life."}, {"time": 10278, "text": "And maybe I can scale it with, you know, with these AI systems and other people can get access to that."}, {"time": 10283, "text": "So I think Carl Rogers, it's a pretty dry and a bit boring book, but I think the idea is good."}, {"time": 10289, "text": "Would you recommend others try to read it?"}, {"time": 10291, "text": "I think for, just for yourself, for as a human, not as an AI, as a human, it's, it is, it is just, and for him, that was his own path of his own personal, of growing personally over years, working with people like that."}, {"time": 10307, "text": "And so it was work and himself growing, helping other people grow and growing through that."}, {"time": 10312, "text": "And that's fundamentally what I believe in with our work, helping other people grow, and ourselves, ourselves, trying to build a company that's all built on those principles, you know, having a good time, allowing some people who work with to grow a little bit."}, {"time": 10327, "text": "So these two books, and then I would throw in, what we have on our, in

the options and why they may or may not be right."}, {"time": 2843, "text": "Yeah, and it's one of these questions where people on first hearing it think it's a triviality and they're like, well, the answer is obvious."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "And then what happens if you ever ask a group of people that something wonderfully comic happens, which is that everyone's like, well, it's completely obvious."}, {"time": 2856, "text": "And then each person realizes that half the person, the other people in the room have a different obvious answer for the way they have."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "And then people get really heated."}, {"time": 2864, "text": "People are like, I can't believe that you think it has two holes or like, I can't believe that you think it has one."}, {"time": 2869, "text": "And then, you know, you really, like people really learn something about each other and people get heated."}, {"time": 2874, "text": "I mean, can we go through the possible options here?"}, {"time": 2877, "text": "Is it zero, one, two, three, 10?"}, {"time": 2881, "text": "Sure, so I think, you know, most people, the zero holders are rare."}, {"time": 2886, "text": "They would say like, well, look, you can make a straw by taking a rectangular piece of plastic and closing it up."}, {"time": 2891, "text": "A rectangular piece of plastic doesn't have a hole in it."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "I didn't poke a hole in it when I, so how can I have a hole?"}, {"time": 2898, "text": "They'd be like, it's just one thing."}, {"time": 2899, "text": "Okay, most people don't see it that way."}, {"time": 2901, "text": "That's like a... Is there any truth to that kind of conception?"}, {"time": 2905, "text": "Yeah, I think that would be somebody who's account, I mean, what I would say is you could say the same thing about a bagel."}, {"time": 2920, "text": "You could say, I can make a bagel by taking like a long cylinder of dough, which doesn't have a hole and then schmushing the ends together."}, {"time": 2927, "text": "Now it's a bagel."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "So if you're really committed, you can be like, okay, a bagel doesn't have a hole either."}, {"time": 2931, "text": "But like, who are you if you say a bagel doesn't have a hole?"}, {"time": 2934, "text": "Yeah, so that's almost like an engineering definition of it."}, {"time": 2937, "text": "Okay, fair enough."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "So what about the other options?"}, {"time": 2942, "text": "So, you know, one whole people would say..."}, {"time": 2947, "text": "I like how these are like groups of people."}, {"time": 2949, "text": "Like we've planted our foot, this is what we stand for."}, {"time": 2952, "text": "There's books written about each belief."}, {"time": 2956, "text": "You know, I would say, look, there's like a hole and it goes all the way through the straw, right?"}, {"time": 2959, "text": "It's one region of space, that's the hole."}, {"time": 2962, "text": "And two whole people would say like, well, look, there's a hole in the top and a hole at the bottom."}, {"time": 2968, "text": "I think a common thing you see when people argue about this, they would take something like this bottle of water I'm holding and go open it and they say, well, how many holes are there in this?"}, {"time": 2981, "text": "And you say like, well, there's one hole at the top."}, {"time": 2984, "text": "Okay, what if I like poke a hole here so that all the water spills out?"}, {"time": 2988, "text": "Well, now it's a straw."}, {"time": 2991, "text": "So if you're a one holder, I say to you like, well, how many holes are in it now?"}, {"time": 2996, "text": "There was one hole in it before and I poked a new hole in it."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "And then you think there's still one hole even though there was one hole and I made one more?"}, {"time": 3004, "text": "Clearly not, this is two holes."}, {"time": 3008, "text": "And yet if you're a two holder, the one holder will say like, okay, where does one hole begin and the other hole end?"}, {"time": 3016, "text": "And in the book, I sort of, you know, in math, there's two things we do when we're faced with a problem that's confusing us."}, {"time": 3022, "text": "We can make the problem simpler."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "That's what we were doing a minute ago when we were talking about high dimensional space."}, {"time": 3027, "text": "And I was like, let's talk about like circles and line segments."}, {"time": 3029, "text": "Let's like go down a dimension to make it easier."}, {"time": 3031, "text": "The other big move we have is to make the problem harder and try to sort of really like face up to what are the complications."}, {"time": 3037, "text": "So, you know, what I do in the book is say like, let's stop talking about straws for a minute and talk about pants."}, {"time": 3042, "text": "How many holes are there in a pair of pants?"}, {"time": 3046, "text": "So I think most people who say there's two holes in a straw would say there's three holes in a pair of pants."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "I guess, I mean, I guess we're filming only from here."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "I could take up, no, I'm not gonna do it."}, {"time": 3056, "text": "You'll just have to imagine the pants, sorry."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "Lex, if you want to, no, okay, no."}, {"time": 3061, "text": "That's gonna be in the director's cut."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "That's that Patreon only footage."}, {"time": 3067, "text": "So many people would say there's three holes in a pair of pants."}, {"time": 3070, "text": "But you know, for instance, my daughter, when I asked, by the way, talking to kids about this is super fun."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "I highly recommend it."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "What did she say?"}, {"time": 3077, "text": "She said, well, yeah, I feel a pair of pants like just has two holes because yes, there's the waist, but that's just the two leg holes stuck together."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "Whoa, okay."}, {"time": 3088, "text": "Two leg holes, yeah, okay."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "I mean, that really is a good combination."}, {"time": 3091, "text": "So she's a one holder for the straw."}, {"time": 3092, "text": "So she's a one holder for the straw too."}, {"time": 3094, "text": "And that really does capture something."}, {"time": 3099, "text": "It captures this fact, which is central to the theory of what's called homology, which is like a central part of modern topology that holes, whatever we may mean by them, they're somehow things which have an arithmetic to them."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "They're things which can be added."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Like the waist, like waist equals leg plus leg is kind of an equation, but it's not an equation about numbers."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "It's an equation about some kind of geometric, some kind of topological thing, which is very strange."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "And so, you know, when I come down, you know, like a rabbi, I like to kind of like come up with these answers and somehow like dodge the original question and say like, you're both right, my children."}, {"time": 3139, "text": "So for the straw, I think what a modern mathematician would say is like, the first version would be to say like, well, there are two holes, but they're really both the same hole."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "Well, that's not quite right."}, {"time": 3152, "text": "A better way to say it is there's two holes, but one is the negative of the other."}, {"time": 3157, "text": "Now, what can that mean?"}, {"time": 3159, "text": "One way of thinking about what it means is that if you sip something like a milkshake through the straw, no matter what, the amount of milkshake that's flowing in one end, that same amount is flowing out the other end."}, {"time": 3173, "text": "So they're not independent from each other."}, {"time": 3175, "text": "There's some relationship between them."}, {"time": 3177, "text": "In the same way that if you somehow could like suck a milkshake through a pair of pants, the amount of milkshake, just go with me on this thought experiment."}, {"time": 3188, "text": "I'm right there with you."}, {"time": 3189, "text": "The amount of milkshake that's coming in the left leg of the pants, plus the amount of milkshake that's coming in the right leg of the pants, is the same that's coming out the waist of the pants."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "So just so you know, I fasted for 72 hours the last three days."}, {"time": 3205, "text": "So I just broke the fast with a little bit of food yesterday."}, {"time": 3207, "text": "So this sounds, food analogies or metaphors for this podcast work wonderfully because I can intensely picture it."}, {"time": 3215, "text": "Is that your weekly routine or just in preparation for talking about geometry for three hours?"}, {"time": 3219, "text": "Exactly, this is just for this."}, {"time": 3221, "text": "It's hardship to purify the mind."},

reflect on how grateful I am to be just alive and be able to do all the cool shit that I get to do, so."}, {"time": 3240, "text": "Did you drink water?"}, {"time": 3241, "text": "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."}, {"time": 3243, "text": "Water and salt, so like electrolytes and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 3247, "text": "But anyway, so the inflow on the top of the pants equals to the outflow on the bottom of the pants."}, {"time": 3254, "text": "Exactly, so this idea that, I mean, I think, you know, Poincare really had this idea, this sort of modern idea."}, {"time": 3262, "text": "I mean, building on stuff other people did, Betty is an important one, of this kind of modern notion of relations between holes."}, {"time": 3269, "text": "But the idea that holes really had an arithmetic, the really modern view was really Emmy Noether's idea."}, {"time": 3275, "text": "So she kind of comes in and sort of truly puts the subject on its modern footing that we have now."}, {"time": 3283, "text": "So, you know, it's always a challenge, you know, in the book, I'm not gonna say I give like a course so that you read this chapter and then you're like, oh, it's just like I took like a semester of algebraic anthropology."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "It's not like this and it's always a challenge writing about math because there are some things that you can really do on the page and the math is there."}, {"time": 3303, "text": "And there's other things which it's too much in a book like this to like do them all the page."}, {"time": 3307, "text": "You can only say something about them, if that makes sense."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "So, you know, in the book, I try to do some of both."}, {"time": 3314, "text": "I try to do, I try to, topics that are, you can't really compress and really truly say exactly what they are in this amount of space."}, {"time": 3327, "text": "I try to say something interesting about them, something meaningful about them so that readers can get the flavor."}, {"time": 3331, "text": "And then in other places, I really try to get up close and personal and really do the math and have it take place on the page."}, {"time": 3340, "text": "To some degree be able to give inklings of the beauty of the subject."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of books that are like, I don't quite know how to express this well."}, {"time": 3349, "text": "I'm still laboring to do it, but there's a lot of books that are about stuff, but I want my books to not only be about stuff, but to actually have some stuff there on the page in the book for people to interact with directly and not just sort of hear me talk about distant features of it."}, {"time": 3370, "text": "Right, so not be talking just about ideas, but the actually be expressing the idea."}, {"time": 3376, "text": "Is there, you know, somebody in the, maybe you can comment, there's a guy, his YouTube channel is 3Blue1Brown, Grant Sanderson."}, {"time": 3385, "text": "He does that masterfully well."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "Of visualizing, of expressing a particular idea and then talking about it as well back and forth."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "What do you think about Grant?"}, {"time": 3397, "text": "I mean, the flowering of math YouTube is like such a wonderful thing because math teaching, there's so many different venues through which we can teach people math."}, {"time": 3408, "text": "There's the traditional one, right?"}, {"time": 3411, "text": "Where I'm in a classroom with, depending on the class, it could be 30 people, it could be a hundred people, it could, God help me, be a 500 people if it's like the big calculus lecture or whatever it may be."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "And there's sort of some, but there's some set of people of that order of magnitude and I'm with them, we have a long time."}, {"time": 3426, "text": "I'm with them for a whole semester and I can ask them to do homework and we talk together."}, {"time": 3430, "text": "We have office hours, if they have one on one questions, a lot of, it's like a very high level of engagement, but how many people am I actually hitting at a time?"}, {"time": 3437, "text": "Like not that many, right?"}, {"time": 3440, "text": "And you can, and there's kind of an inverse relationship where the more, the fewer people you're talking to, the more engagement you can ask for."}, {"time": 3449, "text": "The ultimate of course is like the mentorship relation of like a PhD advisor and a graduate student where you spend a lot of one on one time together for like three to five years."}, {"time": 3461, "text": "And the ultimate high level of engagement to one person."}, {"time": 3466, "text": "Books, this can get to a lot more people that are ever gonna sit in my classroom and you spend like however many hours it takes to read a book."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "Somebody like Three Blue One Brown or Numberphile or people like Vi Hart."}, {"time": 3483, "text": "I mean, YouTube, let's face it, has bigger reach than a book."}, {"time": 3487, "text": "Like there's YouTube videos that have many, many, many more views than like any hardback book like not written by a Kardashian or an Obama is gonna sell, right?"}, {"time": 3496, "text": "So that's, I mean, and then those are, some of them are like longer, 20 minutes long, some of them are five minutes long, but they're shorter."}, {"time": 3507, "text": "And then even some of you look like Eugenia Chang who's a wonderful category theorist in Chicago."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "I mean, she was on, I think the Daily Show or is it, I mean, she was on, she has 30 seconds, but then there's like 30 seconds to sort of say something about mathematics to like untold millions of people."},

I sort of spent a lot of time like thinking about how to put English words together into sentences and sentences together into paragraphs, like at length, which is this kind of like weird specialized skill."}, {"time": 3546, "text": "And that's one thing, but like sort of being able to make like winning, good looking, eye catching videos is like a totally different skill."}, {"time": 3555, "text": "And probably somewhere out there, there's probably sort of some like heavy metal band that's like teaching math through heavy metal and like using their skills to do that."}, {"time": 3563, "text": "I hope there is at any rate."}, {"time": 3565, "text": "Their music and so on, yeah."}, {"time": 3566, "text": "But there is something to the process."}, {"time": 3568, "text": "I mean, Grant does this especially well, which is in order to be able to visualize something, now he writes programs, so it's programmatic visualization."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "So like the things he is basically mostly through his Manum library and Python, everything is drawn through Python."}, {"time": 3589, "text": "You have to truly understand the topic to be able to visualize it in that way and not just understand it, but really kind of think in a very novel way."}, {"time": 3604, "text": "It's funny because I've spoken with him a couple of times, spoken to him a lot offline as well."}, {"time": 3609, "text": "He really doesn't think he's doing anything new, meaning like he sees himself as very different from maybe like a researcher, but it feels to me like he's creating something totally new."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "Like that act of understanding and visualizing is as powerful or has the same kind of inkling of power as does the process of proving something."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "It doesn't have that clear destination, but it's pulling out an insight and creating multiple sets of perspective that arrive at that insight."}, {"time": 3646, "text": "And to be honest, it's something that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value inside academic mathematics in the same way, and this is a bit older, that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value the development of computational infrastructure."}, {"time": 3661, "text": "We all have computers as our partners now and people build computers that sort of assist and participate in our mathematics."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "They build those systems and that's a kind of mathematics too, but not in the traditional form of proving theorems and writing papers."}, {"time": 3676, "text": "But I think it's coming."}, {"time": 3677, "text": "Look, I mean, I think, for example, the Institute for Computational Experimental Mathematics at Brown, which is like, it's a NSF funded math institute, very much part of sort of traditional math academia."}, {"time": 3689, "text": "They did an entire theme semester about visualizing mathematics, looking at the same kind of thing that they would do for like an up and coming research topic."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "Like that's pretty cool."}, {"time": 3698, "text": "So I think there really is buy in from the mathematics community to recognize that this kind of stuff is important and counts as part of mathematics, like part of what we're actually here to do."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "Yeah, I'm hoping to see more and more of that from like MIT faculty, from faculty, from all the top universities in the world."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "Let me ask you this weird question about the Fields Medal, which is the Nobel Prize in Mathematics."},

like, that's like my captcha?"}, {"time": 3743, "text": "That's like the proof that I'm a human?"}, {"time": 3744, "text": "Is that like the lie that I know?"}, {"time": 3746, "text": "What is, how does he want me to answer?"}, {"time": 3748, "text": "Is there something interesting to be said about that?"}, {"time": 3751, "text": "Yeah, I mean, I am tremendously interested in what AI can do in pure mathematics."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "I mean, it's, of course, it's a parochial interest, right?"}, {"time": 3760, "text": "You're like, why am I interested in like, how it can like help feed the world or help solve like real social problems?"}, {"time": 3764, "text": "I'm like, can it do more math?"}, {"time": 3766, "text": "Like, what can I do?"}, {"time": 3767, "text": "We all have our interests, right?"}, {"time": 3769, "text": "But I think it is a really interesting conceptual question."}, {"time": 3773, "text": "And here too, I think it's important to be kind of historical

machines."}, {"time": 3789, "text": "Like, you know, in 1890, somebody could be like, here's my PhD thesis."}, {"time": 3793, "text": "I computed all the invariants of this polynomial ring under the

computer algebra programs."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "So those are like sort of bespoke systems that lots of mathematicians use."}, {"time": 3828, "text": "That's similar to Maple and... Yeah, oh yeah, so it's similar to Maple and Mathematica, yeah, but a little more specialized, but yeah."}, {"time": 3834, "text": "It's programs that work with symbols and allow you to do, can you do proofs?"}, {"time": 3838, "text": "Can you do kind of little leaps and proofs?"}, {"time": 3841, "text": "They're not really built for that."}, {"time": 3842, "text": "And that's a whole other story."}, {"time": 3844, "text": "But these tools are part of the process of mathematics now."}, {"time": 3847, "text": "Right, they are now for most mathematicians, I would say, part of the process of mathematics."}, {"time": 3851, "text": "And so, you know, there's a story I tell in the book, which I'm fascinated by, which is, you know, so far, attempts to get AIs to prove interesting theorems have not done so well."}, {"time": 3867, "text": "It doesn't mean they can."}, {"time": 3868, "text": "There's actually a paper I just saw, which has a very nice use of a neural net to find counter examples to conjecture."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "Somebody said like, well, maybe this is always that."}, {"time": 3877, "text": "And you can be like, well, let me sort of train an AI to sort of try to find things where that's not true."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "And it actually succeeded."}, {"time": 3884, "text": "Now, in this case, if you look at the things that it found, you say like, okay, I mean, these are not famous conjectures."}, {"time": 3893, "text": "Okay, so like somebody wrote this down, maybe this is so."}, {"time": 3898, "text": "Looking at what the AI came up with, you're like, you know, I bet if like five grad students had thought about that problem, they wouldn't have come up with that."}, {"time": 3905, "text": "I mean, when you see it, you're like, okay, that is one of the things you might try if you sort of like put some work into it."}, {"time": 3910, "text": "Still, it's pretty awesome."}, {"time": 3912, "text": "But the story I tell in the book, which I'm

a postdoc, yeah, you missed out."}, {"time": 3944, "text": "There's no way to sugarcoat it."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "I'm sorry that you didn't get that chance."}, {"time": 3946, "text": "Yeah, it is what it is."}, {"time": 3947, "text": "So knots."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "Yeah, so there was a question and again, it doesn't matter the technicalities of the question, but it's a question of whether the knot is slice."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "It has to do with something about what kinds of three dimensional surfaces and four dimensions can be bounded by this knot."}, {"time": 3963,

primes."}, {"time": 6169, "text": "Sure, you can look at your computer and see a lot of them, but the fact that there's a lot, why is that evidence that there's infinitely many, right?"}, {"time":

evidence?"}, {"time": 6182, "text": "There's like a lot more than 10 million atoms."}, {"time": 6184, "text": "That doesn't mean there's infinitely many atoms in the universe, right?"}, {"time": 6186,

that it turns out to be like incredibly productive and enlightening to think about primes as if they were random numbers, as if they were randomly distributed according to a certain law."}, {"time":

predict that other behaviors of the system are like that of the random process."}, {"time": 6242, "text": "And so that's kind of like, it's funny because I think when you talk to people at the twin prime conjecture, people think you're saying, wow, there's like some deep structure there that like makes those primes be like close together again and again."}, {"time": 6256, "text": "And no, it's the opposite of deep structure."}, {"time": 6258, "text": "What we say when we say we believe the twin prime conjecture is that we believe the primes are like sort of strewn around pretty randomly."},

rounds of randori."}, {"time": 1636, "text": "So it's a much different feel."}, {"time": 1638, "text": "When you say Europe, do you mean Germany, France, Britain, Russia?"}, {"time": 1642, "text": "Is there a lot?"}, {"time": 1643, "text": "So there's a kind of similarity to all of those kinds of approaches."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "The only difference would be Russia that they do a lot more active drilling, a lot more sequential movement training."}, {"time": 1655, "text": "They don't focus as much on randori."}, {"time": 1657, "text": "You'll do much fewer rounds in Russia during training camps than you would in those other countries we just talked about, France, Germany, et cetera."}, {"time": 1666, "text": "What about in this kind of American system where you have much less talent to work with?"}, {"time": 1675, "text": "Do you just select whatever works for the particular athletes, or do you have something you prefer in your system?"}, {"time": 1683, "text": "So you

rounds, right?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "We might have two, so we're gonna have the same guy four times, those two people four, two times each."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "Now I have four good rounds."}, {"time": 1749, "text": "The rest of the rounds, I'm not being pushed to the limit."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "So we train differently."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "And a lot of times we do a lot of stuff like shark bait."}, {"time": 1757, "text": "When our athletes are preparing for competition, for example, when Kayla or Travis were preparing for competition, we might only have 20 people in the whole gym to work out with, those two Olympic medalists, right?"}, {"time": 1769, "text": "And of those 20 people, maybe four of them are Travis's size."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "Maybe there's only one girl in the room for Kayla, she's gotta train with guys."}, {"time": 1777, "text": "And then the other ones are teenagers that are too weak to train with either one of them."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "So what we would do is just put together four or five people that could give them a challenge and we'd line them up and they would do a minute, a minute, a minute, a minute, and they'd do five minutes in a row as hard as they can."}, {"time": 1792, "text": "That person can go hard for a minute with Travis or Kayla."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "They can't go five minutes hard, but they can go one minute hard."}, {"time": 1798, "text": "So it made their training much, much more intense, much more physically demanding."}, {"time": 1803, "text": "And then rinse and repeat that six times or eight times in a night, they just got 40 minutes of intense randori."}, {"time": 1810, "text": "The person that was training with them that wasn't as good only had to do six or eight minutes of training the whole night, you know, so."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "It's so, it's so difficult because then you look at like the Russian national team and you have just the world champions and so, or you even have like, what is it, Tom Brands and Terry Brands in the wrestling system."}, {"time": 1839, "text": "You have like these people, it's a small group of people, but they're all some of the best people in the world and they're going head to head."}, {"time": 1847, "text": "And yeah, you don't necessarily get a good look kind of a variety of styles, but just the quality is there."},

there?"}, {"time": 1879, "text": "Maybe if I give you like two choices, is it good to have like one throw and try to become the best person in the world at that throw, or do you want to have a bunch of stuff?"}, {"time": 1891, "text": "Like a variety of throws?"}, {"time": 1892, "text": "Well, for Travis, it was Ippon Seinagi, that was his main throw, right?"}, {"time": 1896, "text": "But from that Ippon Seinagi, he had a variety of other attacks he could do, you know, that mixed it up so that you kept people guessing."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "Maybe it wasn't the Ippon Seinagi that was coming, maybe it was the Koshi Gruma that he did, or maybe it was the Ippon to Osoto that he did in combination."}, {"time": 1911, "text": "So you typically have one main throw that you do."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "For me, it was Tai Otoshi."}, {"time": 1916, "text": "For Kayla, it was her Ogoshi."}, {"time": 1918, "text": "For Travis, it was his Ippon Seinagi."}, {"time": 1921, "text":

arsenal of attacks that go in all different directions holding that same grip."}, {"time": 1935, "text": "So you keep your opponent guessing as to what's coming."}, {"time": 1938, "text": "You know, because if they're just sitting on one technique at the highest level of sport, with the exception of a few, right?"}, {"time": 1943, "text": "We talked about Ono's Uchi Mata."}, {"time": 1946,

the main thing."}, {"time": 1956, "text": "So for Travis, that would be like the main version of his Seinagi."}, {"time": 1961, "text": "Like really making sure you don't forget to really put in the time on that."}, {"time": 1966, "text": "Because I mean, one way to say it is that threat being dangerous opens up a lot of things."}, {"time": 1977, "text": "But also, I don't know."}, {"time": 1980, "text": "I think I'm just, as a fan, I think it's sad when like elite level athletes in all like combat sports, kind of start taking their main thing for granted."}, {"time": 1992, "text": "Like they think, okay, I've figured that part out."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "Now I'll be working on all this whole system on variations, on different setups, on lefty versus, some like weird variation as opposed to, you know what?"}, {"time": 2007, "text": "If you look at some of the best people ever, they seem to have not cared about variations at all."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "They're just like literally, they are more like Jiro James of Sushi and like fine tuning their ear, their ability to detect the minute movements that give you an opening on that main thing."}, {"time": 2028, "text": "And so the whole time you're just waiting for that throw, you're like dancing with the like little bit of pressure and like releasing the pressure, putting the pressure, maybe a little bit of off balance and finding like the right moment to strike and focusing on that."}, {"time": 2045, "text": "Again, maybe that's just like a romanticization of like the simplicity of that."}, {"time": 2050, "text": "Maybe it is kind of impossible to do that on a large scale, but I just, yeah, I don't know if you can comment on that, whether there is some value in still putting in like tens of thousands of reps on the main, main thing."}, {"time": 2065, "text": "Well, unquestionably that has to happen."}, {"time": 2067, "text": "You still have to drill your main throw and you have to fine tune it and continue to do repetition after repetition and throws on the crash pad or throws on the mat, moving around, just explosive movements doing your main technique."}, {"time": 2080, "text": "You're never gonna forget that and you're not gonna put it to the side and not practice it anymore."}, {"time": 2084, "text": "It still has to be part of your repertoire and part of your daily training, but you do have to evolve."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "And I think that's the sport of judo, makes you evolve."}, {"time": 2094, "text": "When I look at, we talk about Koga from before, right?"}, {"time": 2096, "text": "And we talked about, he had a dynamic Ippon Seinagi that nobody could stop for years and years and years."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "But when people started to be unorthodox and come down his back and cross grip him and he couldn't get to the lapel, he had to come up with something else."}, {"time": 2110, "text": "And all of a sudden you saw Koga doing, now he did a Sode or now he did a Tomoe Nagi, which so he can, he added to his arsenal to keep people thinking, keep people guessing."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "So it's not, you're not just that one trick pony."}, {"time": 2122, "text": "They still couldn't stop his Ippon Seinagi once he got that grip."}, {"time": 2126, "text": "But if they stopped them from getting that grip or putting two hands on the gi, he had to go to something else."}, {"time": 2131, "text": "And that's what he did."}, {"time": 2132, "text": "Does Travis's or Koga's Seinagi make sense to you?"}, {"time": 2136, "text": "That weird, so when I, Because split hip, split hip."}, {"time": 2141, "text": "So I don't know if you know this, but like I got into judo because of Travis."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "I watched him at 2008 Olympics and I was, there's something about like, just not the cockiness, but the confidence and just the refusal to quit, the refusal to just, that energy, whatever it connected with me is like, oh, that guy's bad ass."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "I want to be bad ass like that."}, {"time": 2163, "text": "And then I also there happened to be in my university judo and I got into it and just fell in love with the elegance and the beauty and the power of the sport."}, {"time": 2173, "text": "But also I started to mimic Travis's game, his and Koga's."}, {"time": 2178, "text": "And then the instructors I worked with, they said that's the wrong way to do it."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "And I always, I never found somebody that told me like, no, that's not the wrong way."}, {"time": 2189, "text": "There's a lot of ways to do it."}, {"time": 2191, "text": "And there's like the classic way and you have to understand it and you have to learn it, but this is not the wrong way."}, {"time": 2196, "text": "Cause I was trying to find somebody who understands this throw."}, {"time": 2199, "text": "Cause it was so beautiful at the highest level, especially with Koga, the way you're able, the quickness with which you can strike, the fact that you can stand on the feet and the elevation you can get and the power you can get has certain throws, just like Uchimata doesn't look powerful."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "It's just like, it looks effortless."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "But like the standing Seinagi with a split hip, it just looks powerful because there's a, you're like, you're stepping into them,

when I was younger."}, {"time": 2300, "text": "Yeah, he wanted me to do a split hip."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "We have kids at the school today that we teach the split hip Saiyan Aiki, same way, because it is that dynamic, right?"}, {"time": 2308, "text": "You don't drop to the ground and roll and turn."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "It's not the classic form where you're giving way to your opponent."}, {"time": 2314, "text": "It's actually, you go pick the guy up in the air and then you slam him, so."}, {"time": 2321, "text": "So maybe on a small tangent, so we're talking about elite level athletes in terms of Randori, in terms of like drilling."}, {"time": 2329, "text": "For more recreational athletes, like, you know, I have personally that situation going on, but there's other people that are just recreationally training Judo."}, {"time": 2340, "text": "How do you recommend they improve Judo?"}, {"time": 2343, "text": "Like if I wanted to compete a bunch and do reasonable with a particular set of throws, say the split Saiyan Aiki, so how do you do the Randori?"}, {"time": 2356, "text": "Do you use a crash pad to get in reps?"}, {"time": 2358, "text": "Do you, like, what do you recommend?"}, {"time": 2360, "text": "So I guess there's two recreational people that we're talking about."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "One is somebody who wants to learn Judo and become good at Judo, but doesn't necessarily want to compete, but just wants to get better."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "And I think that there's not enough emphasis in this country on paying attention to that type of student."}, {"time": 2377, "text": "Everybody pushes them to competition."}, {"time": 2380, "text": "But in reality, there's a huge audience of people out there that would love to learn Judo and be very proficient at Judo and have the skills to go execute if they ever needed it."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "And there's a class and there should be a program for that athlete."}, {"time": 2393, "text": "And that athlete does not need to do Randori."}, {"time": 2396, "text": "Like the sport of Judo is physical enough where you're picking somebody up all the time and moving their body weight around the mat all the time, where you can get very physically strong, very physically fit."}, {"time": 2407, "text": "Technically, you'll be better than somebody that does Randori more than you because if you learn good technique and you learn the movement and you learn the feel and you learn the timing, you'll actually be a better athlete than the person that just focuses on Randori who does ugly technique and wins with force."}, {"time": 2424, "text": "So we have a recreational class at our school where they don't do any Randori."}, {"time": 2430, "text": "They have an option afterwards if they want to stay for 15 minutes or stay for 30 minutes where they can participate in Randori."}, {"time": 2436, "text": "But most of the adult students choose not to because they're already so tired from the other hour class."}, {"time": 2442, "text": "It's a good workout."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "Right, they're already dripping sweat."}, {"time": 2444, "text": "They're already like, if you work hard and drill hard, it's an intense workout, you're exhausted."}, {"time": 2451, "text": "So that's a specific set of program, I should say, at every academy."}, {"time": 2457, "text": "And then if you want to get good and you want to compete, then to me, once you have your techniques, it's learning how to implement a good gripping system to put yourself in a position where you can always dominate the grips, control the movement, initiate the reactions from your opponent, and then have the opportunity to attack and score."}, {"time": 2482, "text": "And I think that when people train with, or when they jump into a higher level of the sport of judo, all of a sudden the first thing they say is, I can't attack."}, {"time": 2492, "text": "I don't know how to attack."}, {"time": 2493, "text": "Because positionally, they don't know where to put their hands."}, {"time": 2496, "text": "They don't know how to hold the gi properly."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "They don't understand that they're, they have an inferior grip, and they don't know how to get into better positions so they can't attack."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "And that's a big part of the game that not a lot of people really understand."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "So you really, even for recreational competitors, you really need to have a gripping system."}, {"time": 2514, "text": "You need to understand the gripping system."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "If you want to win."}, {"time": 2518, "text": "I mean, if the goal is to go and compete, that's a different story."}, {"time": 2521, "text": "You're going, I don't have fun getting beat up or losing in competitions."}, {"time": 2524, "text": "I enjoy the..."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "I don't even know if it's the winning or the losing."}, {"time": 2529, "text": "I don't think, I think this is what, because I competed a lot in both Judo and Jiu Jitsu, and in Judo, it feels like, because I didn't have a gripping system, it feels like you're not even playing Judo against the good black belts."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "You're, they're just, they're not, they're not even trying because they have, they get a certain kind of grip, and you just can't do anything."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "And I don't have a good answer for that."}, {"time": 2553, "text": "I don't even know what I'm looking for."}, {"time": 2554, "text": "And so it's not even fun."}, {"time": 2556, "text": "It's not like even losing."}, {"time": 2557, "text": "It's like, I don't know."}, {"time": 2560, "text": "It's like you didn't even show up to play is what it feels like."}, {"time": 2564, "text": "And it's not, and I think that is a big gap in knowledge, actually, in Judo schools, is the gripping part."}, {"time": 2575, "text": "When you first go out to do Judo, right?"}, {"time": 2579, "text": "You, the first thing you have to do is you have to grab your opponent, right?"}, {"time": 2581, "text": "And a lot of times I hear coaches say, get a grip."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "Just take a grip."}, {"time": 2584, "text": "Well, sometimes if you take a grip, you're in a worse position than not having a grip at all."}, {"time": 2590, "text": "And that's what a lot of people don't understand."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "Like if you hold the gi in the wrong way, your opponent can attack you, but you can't attack him."}, {"time": 2596, "text": "So why would you ever do that grip if it's only to your detriment, right?"}, {"time": 2602, "text": "So that's, and the way you grip does set up what attacks you can do as well."}, {"time": 2608, "text": "So that is a huge part."}, {"time": 2609, "text": "And I'm not saying that you have to be 100% disciplined and only always outgrip your opponent and only be able to do throws when you have a superior grip."}, {"time": 2617, "text": "I'm just saying that to be able to put the grips together with the throws and understand the movements is gonna make you that much ahead of the game."}, {"time": 2625, "text": "So if we take a step to our previous discussion of going from zero to hero."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "So going from the early days through the teenage years to winning an Olympic medal."}, {"time": 2638, "text": "So we mentioned a lot of training, the dedication of the training, the competing, what other elements are there?"}, {"time": 2645, "text": "The mental side is visualization, believing that you could perform at that level."}, {"time": 2652, "text": "So what else can you say about that?"}, {"time": 2653, "text": "I think that comes at the highest level, the visualization, the success, that comes at the highest level."}, {"time": 2658, "text": "I think in the teen years, there's the experience, just plays a huge role in getting to train with other people."}, {"time": 2668, "text": "Like as Americans, we have to go train in Europe."}, {"time": 2670, "text": "We have to feel the European style of judo."}, {"time": 2673, "text": "You have to understand that physicality."}, {"time": 2675, "text": "They grip very differently."}, {"time": 2678, "text": "They put you in very unorthodox positions."}, {"time": 2681, "text": "And if you don't know how to deal with that, you get thrown before you even have a chance to try your own throws."}, {"time": 2687, "text": "So it takes a lot of that experience and understanding what's going on."}, {"time": 2692, "text": "And then you also need to get that physicality."}, {"time": 2695, "text": "You need to be strong and hard, I would say, by doing all those rounds with the Europeans."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "And at the same time, you need to go to Asia and you need to train in Japan because you need to feel that free flowing judo for your technical side."}, {"time": 2710, "text":

4094, "text": "His passion is producing athletes at the highest level, and he knows how to do it."}, {"time": 4098, "text": "And then the one side of my dad's coaching where I think there's a flaw or a weakness is on the mental preparation side of the game."}, {"time": 4108, "text": "He wasn't somebody that was, I don't know if he, maybe because he wasn't an Olympic champion himself and wasn't a world champion, he lacked the confidence in helping others be more confident."}, {"time": 4119, "text": "So he's more of a, this is what you need to work on type of thing."}, {"time": 4123, "text": "He doesn't know how to build the athletes up to make them feel invincible."}, {"time": 4128, "text": "And I feel like that's something that I was able to give all of the athletes, to help them with that visualization, belief in yourself, knowing that you're gonna win before you step out of the mat, knowing that we've earned the right to victory, seeing success in your mind, having a positive mantra that you, I'm the best in the world, nobody's beating me today, type of feeling."}, {"time": 4149, "text": "So you go out there feeling like King Kong when you step on the mat, that nobody's gonna stop you."}, {"time": 4154, "text": "And so I think the combination of both of us as coaches, I'm a lot more technical."}, {"time": 4160, "text": "My dad is good at letting, identifying what they need to do for their techniques and what, in strategy, how to beat opponents and putting game plans together."}, {"time": 4170, "text": "So combined, the two of us made an unbelievable team."}, {"time": 4173, "text": "So he's not gonna let the athlete be soft when they enter the highest, the most difficult competitions of their career."}, {"time": 4183, "text": "So on the mental side, what's mental preparation look like?"}, {"time": 4188, "text": "Like how many years before the Olympics do you start helping an athlete believe that they can win an Olympic medal?"}, {"time": 4197, "text": "Well, I think it's gotta be a seed in that athlete's brain, something they wanna do, right?"}, {"time": 4202, "text": "Nobody can quickly get there, right?"}, {"time": 4205, "text": "It's a long process."}, {"time": 4206, "text": "But if your goal, if you're national champion or you've proven yourself to win in some international tournaments, and you think the Olympics is a possibility for you, then defining it as, hey, I wanna be on the Olympic team, that would be the first step into getting ready."}, {"time": 4224, "text": "And I always make them put it on paper."}, {"time": 4228, "text": "If it really is your goal, then you show me that it's your goal and put it on paper and commit to it."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "I wanna be Olympic medalist, I wanna be Olympic champion, I wanna go to the Olympics."}, {"time": 4236, "text": "World team member, maybe junior world team member, whatever it is, we walk before we go to the highest level."}, {"time": 4241, "text": "But if the goal is to go to the Olympics, let's accomplish these other things first, right?"}, {"time": 4246, "text": "Because if we can accomplish these other things, then we're on our way to getting to the ultimate goal, which is the Olympics."}, {"time": 4254, "text": "For somebody like Kayla, for example, she didn't say that she wanted to be Olympic champion when she first came here in 2005, right?"}, {"time": 4265, "text": "We wanted to become national champion, then we wanted to be on the world team, then we wanted to be a world medalist."}, {"time": 4270, "text": "Then our sights were set on the Olympics or the Olympic gold."}, {"time": 4274, "text": "So it's having those clearly defined goals that are attainable."}, {"time": 4278, "text": "Like they should be a reach, they should be a stretch, but they have to be attainable."}, {"time": 4282, "text": "They can't be just a pipe dream."}, {"time": 4285, "text": "But once you put it to paper and you think it's achievable, then it's mapping the plan to get there."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "Is there a daily process of visualizing yourself as an Olympic champion or national champion?"}, {"time": 4300, "text": "Yes, it is, and you should do it either every night before you go to bed or before every training session or after every training session."}, {"time": 4310, "text": "One of those three times it should, or first thing you wake up in the morning, because it may be to help some people, it motivates them to go do what it is they're supposed to do in the day."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "But the process of visualization is, to me, is closing your eyes for a few moments."}, {"time": 4327, "text": "Your brain works really, really fast, right?"}, {"time": 4329, "text": "And it's actually picturing the day in its entirety, from start to finish, from the moment you wake up and you step on the scale to the moment you have your breakfast and you go through your morning routine."}, {"time": 4342, "text": "Like live the day that you're gonna have at the Olympics."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "So whatever it is you're trying to do, let's say the Olympic day, for example."}, {"time": 4349, "text": "Picture yourself making weight, picture yourself, who you're around, eating your breakfast, having maybe saying a few jokes, laughing."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "This is a real day, make it real."}, {"time": 4358, "text": "Going back and packing your judo bag for the day, getting on the bus, driving to the venue, feel what it's like walking into the stadium for the first time, going to the warmup area, seeing your drawer up on the sheet, who you're gonna fight that day, watching yourself warm up, go through your warmup routine, walking out of the shoot, into the venue, going to do that first fight."}, {"time": 4385, "text": "Picture the moment of throwing your opponent, coming off the mat, high fiving the coach, getting ready for your second fight."}, {"time": 4392, "text": "Like live the day from start to finish and make it as real as possible."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "Like the more real you can make it, even before it ever happens, right?"}, {"time": 4434, "text": "When you do that enough times, I feel that like pathways get created for you so that when your body gets to that moment, and I've been here before, this is it, this is my moment, this is what I pictured my whole life, I'm not nervous, because I've seen this, this is gonna happen, I believe it's possible, right?"}, {"time": 4453, "text": "And I believe the athletes that do that and make it real enough that when they get to that moment, they go right through, there's no hesitation."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "This is what this is meant to be, this is my destiny, this is why I did everything I did, versus the ones that don't think about it ever, but just kind of like hope, it's not real to them, it doesn't feel attainable, they don't believe it's possible, they haven't committed to believing it was possible."}, {"time": 4479, "text": "Without that commitment in yourself and that belief, it can't happen."}, {"time": 4483, "text": "And one thing that, I talked to Travis a bit about this, you probably worked with him on the details of what you're talking about, but he said that you should really focus on visualizing the sensations you feel."}, {"time": 4501, "text": "So say if you're drinking coffee or something like that, you're not thinking about like observing yourself from a third person perspective drinking coffee, like you're thinking of how your hand will feel when it touches something warm."}, {"time": 4517, "text": "Like you try to replay the actual sensations you would feel, right?"}, {"time": 4521, "text": "So it sounds kind of strange, but meaning like you really wanna put yourself in the body as you would experience those moments, as opposed to like watching yourself on TV experience in those moments, like really be inside."}, {"time": 4536, "text": "And yeah, so that means sensations, like how does it feel when you grip a gi?"}, {"time": 4540, "text": "How does it, yeah, the sweating, just the sensation of sweat, like rolling down your forehead or whatever, like all of those actual feelings."}, {"time": 4552, "text": "When I explain it to you, like I guess my body has been through it so many times, both in my mind and in reality that it brings back all of those same emotions."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "I start to get goosebumps, my armpits start to sweat, like I'm living it if it's real."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "I'm reliving it now."}, {"time": 4570, "text": "But when you're going through the visualization process, it has to be that real, the smells, the taping of the fingers, like the more colorful and the more real you can make it, the more believable it is."}, {"time": 4585, "text": "So I've been doing this kind of thing, just having listened to you enough for other stuff in life, so let's see if it works."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "But do you see this kind of visualization being useful for other things in career and all those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 4600, "text": "100%, 100%, because I just know with my own life, my own experiences, like my wife sometimes says to me, she says, well, where do you see yourself in like five years from now?"}, {"time": 4615, "text": "And five years ago, I had said to her, I wanna have my own business."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "I wanna have, this is the amount of money that I'm hoping I can make in a given year."}, {"time": 4625, "text": "Like you have to have goals for yourself."},

big number."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "Like it's not, especially when you're not making that much at the time, it's a super big number, right?"}, {"time": 4642, "text": "So having those goals for yourself, like it won't happen and it's not possible unless you dream it's possible and think that it's possible."}, {"time": 4651, "text": "And then it doesn't magically happen."}, {"time": 4654,

long time and I only had 60 students always, like 40 to 60 students had fluctuated."}, {"time": 4699, "text": "And I sit there and say, why can't I get more people in my door, right?"}, {"time": 4703,

like I listened to these people and I said, you're right."}, {"time": 4727, "text": "And the training was hour and a half, two hours long."}, {"time": 4731, "text": "People can't handle an hour and a half or two hours training when they're first walking in the door."}, {"time": 4734, "text": "So I had to restructure all my programming."}, {"time": 4736, "text": "I had to look at the way I was offering my school and I had to make levels for everybody, right?"}, {"time": 4742, "text": "Like here's my four to six year old class."}, {"time": 4745, "text": "Here's my six to 13 year old

a recreational school."}, {"time": 4766, "text": "You can't produce champions at that same school."}, {"time": 4768, "text": "That's what I was told."}, {"time": 4769, "text": "So then I got all my

4806, "text": "How do we separate these programs?"}, {"time": 4808, "text": "And lo and behold, that was my vision that I shared with all of them and that was back in 2006."}, {"time": 4815, "text":

people because they'll, I mean, I'm with Johnny Ive, who's the lead designer in Apple, like you want that dream, that little flame to not, people will put that flame out too easily, even people that love you."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "So I have very specific kind of visions, like maybe for Travis, it would be like a specific opponent or something like Ole Bischoff, like very specific, very specific situation of what's going to happen."}, {"time": 4896, "text": "Not just like, I wanna be an Olympic champion, but very specific, like almost silly situations."}, {"time": 4903, "text":

couldn't talk, we couldn't do anything."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "We learned along the way."}, {"time": 4974, "text": "And I think that's the one thing that I realized is that, and I tell this to my

was like, the fight he had in him."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "He was scrapping every fight."}, {"time": 5201, "text": "Like he scrapped hard."}, {"time": 5202, "text": "Like he wanted to win more than

those people."}, {"time": 5219, "text": "Even though he was like 17, right?"}, {"time": 5221, "text": "And he's fighting against grown men that are, you know, a high level judo, much higher than he was."}, {"time": 5226, "text": "And I said to him, I said, hey son, like, don't worry, man."}, {"time": 5229, "text": "You got a long career ahead of you."}, {"time": 5231, "text": "Like, I'm glad you're disappointed, but there's so many things you don't know and so many skills you don't have."}, {"time": 5237, "text": "The fact that you were able to hold your own and scrap like that, like

how it started."}, {"time": 5261, "text": "But so I saw that in him when he was young."}, {"time": 5263, "text": "But the other thing was, Travis, like, there's no such thing as hard work to that guy."}, {"time": 5270, "text": "If you tell him to put his head through the wall and that's how he wins, he'll go put his head through the wall."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "He'll do whatever it takes

5322, "text": "They would do anything for victory."}, {"time": 5324, "text": "Within the rules, I'm not talking about taking drugs or anything like that, but they'd give 100% of themselves for victory."}, {"time": 5332, "text": "And Travis was somebody that when he was down, he found a way to get better doing something else."}, {"time": 5338, "text": "If he couldn't do standing, that's when he started jujitsu."}, {"time": 5341, "text": "He couldn't go on his feet anymore."}, {"time": 5343, "text": "He couldn't stand up and train."}, {"time": 5344, "text": "Might as well go learn jujitsu and get good on the ground because I can."}, {"time": 5349, "text": "So he always found a way no matter what obstacle was in his way, he just went around it."}, {"time": 5354, "text": "So what about, it'd be interesting to get your perspective because I know Travis's perspective is just the number of injuries."}, {"time": 5364, "text": "Like what do you make of the perseverance through all the injuries he had to overcome?"}, {"time": 5368, "text": "Specifically like you just observing this creature that you've coached."}, {"time": 5373, "text": "I mean, he seems to not see the injuries as a problem."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "He just like, just like you said, head through the wall."}, {"time": 5380, "text": "It's like what, like when we were talking about injuries, he kinda, he doesn't even see the injuries themselves as the problem because he thinks that the injuries, you know, you heal back stronger."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "I forget the exact quote, but he said like, my body is now less injury prone than most of anyone else."}, {"time": 5402, "text": "Because I've already broken everything."}, {"time": 5403, "text": "I've broken everything and it's just grown back stronger."}, {"time": 5407, "text": "Like, cause I asked him something like, do you regret sort of pushing your body to all of those places that resulted in those injuries?"}, {"time": 5415, "text": "He was, his response was like, no, I'm stronger now."}, {"time": 5419, "text": "So I don't know if that's justification, but that certainly describes a mindset that, yeah, head through the wall."}, {"time": 5426, "text": "That doesn't, it's almost not dramatic."}, {"time": 5430, "text": "Like, look, I got this injury."}, {"time": 5432, "text": "It's so, I'm so like brave and special for overcoming this injury."}, {"time": 5436, "text": "He's just, he's just, that's part of the job and he gets the job done."}, {"time": 5441, "text": "But like that job involves a lot of injuries."}, {"time": 5444, "text": "One of the talks I gave Travis and that team at that particular tournament was at the very beginning of the camp after the tournament, I said to them, listen, my vision, I shared my vision with them."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "I said, my vision is, you know, in seven years, cause that was 2005, I said in seven years, I wanna have a US team that steps on the mat that is ready to kick ass."}, {"time": 5466, "text": "And in order to get there, all of you guys can be a part of this team and part of this process."}, {"time": 5470, "text": "But in order to get there, you guys have to be the first ones to practice."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "You have to be the last ones to leave cause we have to work harder than the rest of the world because we're up against all odds."}, {"time": 5480, "text": "I said, I am sick of America being a laughing stock of judo and being the first round, easy match, warmup for everybody else."}, {"time": 5488, "text": "I said, if you get injured, you're not gonna be on the side with, you know, with a ice bag on taking off rounds."}, {"time": 5496, "text": "And then get back on the mat the next day and tell me you're okay."}, {"time": 5499, "text": "If you can train the next day, you can train today."}, {"time": 5501, "text": "So there's no injury."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "The only time you'll leave in this dojo is if the ambulance has to take you out of here."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "You know, and I do think subliminally, Travis bought into that message and heard that message then, said, if I'm gonna be a champion, that's the way I'm gonna do it."}, {"time": 5515, "text": "And he did, and he embodied it, he lived it."}, {"time": 5518, "text": "Man, do it many times in Europe where I said, dude, just tape it up, go off to the side, just take the day off, like, take the rest of the day off, you're beat up, you can't do it."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "He said, no, no, I'm gonna tape it up, I'm gonna tape it up."}, {"time": 5530, "text": "I said, no, you don't need to right now."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "And he said, no, sensei, I'm doing it."}, {"time": 5534, "text": "You know, the ambulance isn't taking me out, it's just my wrist, it's just my ankle, it's just my wrist."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "It's just my ankle, yeah, I love it."}, {"time": 5543, "text": "Yeah, what about the, so the other really big thing is you comment on a little bit is the weight cut."}, {"time": 5550, "text": "So early in his career, he was 81 kg, and that was presumably not so difficult."}, {"time": 5557, "text": "But later in his career, he is 81 kg, and it's becoming more and more difficult."}, {"time": 5562, "text": "So that's the other thing with him is, so I've known a lot of really, really tough people at the highest levels broken by the weight cut."}, {"time": 5573, "text": "Like that can break the toughest minds."}, {"time": 5575, "text": "And it doesn't seem to have broken him."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "And he's delivered on it often, on like insane weight cuts."}, {"time": 5583, "text": "So just as a coach, what do you think about his, particularly his mind and the challenge of the weight cut?"}, {"time": 5590, "text": "It was part of his process."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "It was part of his way of getting ready for battle."}, {"time": 5595, "text": "Suffering?"}, {"time": 5596, "text": "Yeah, it really was."}, {"time": 5597, "text": "And if I'm gonna suffer this much, then I'm gonna make my opponents pay for all the suffering that I went through to get here."}, {"time": 5604, "text": "That was his mindset."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "Later on in his career, you're right, like a lot of times, Travis, he would never step on a scale until he got to the tournament."}, {"time": 5615, "text": "And even when he get to the tournament, like he'd weigh like 90 kilos."}, {"time": 5619, "text": "He'd show up at the tournament nine kilos over."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "I'm like, you have to, but I never, it was just an expectation of making weight."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "Not making weight was never an option for any of our athletes."}, {"time": 5630, "text": "And Travis knew it."}, {"time": 5632, "text": "And he said, as a professional, my job is to make weight."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "If I don't make weight, he was never gonna allow that to happen."}, {"time": 5640, "text": "And he was never gonna allow us to come to him and say, hey, I told you."}, {"time": 5644, "text": "Cause losing wasn't an option, making weight wasn't, not making weight was not an option for him ever either."}, {"time": 5651, "text": "But a lot of times he wouldn't even, he'd be nine kilos over on the plane going over to the tournament and have to make weight three days later."}, {"time": 5660, "text": "And he didn't break 86 kilos until the day before the tournament."}, {"time": 5664, "text": "Like he had five kilos over the day before."}, {"time": 5666, "text": "That was his way."}, {"time": 5667, "text": "But he would do three workouts to wake up in the morning and work out."}, {"time": 5671, "text": "Then he'd eat."}, {"time": 5672, "text": "Then he'd work out in the afternoon."}, {"time": 5673, "text": "Then he'd eat again."}, {"time": 5674, "text": "Then he'd work out again at night."}, {"time": 5676, "text": "And then he'd reward himself."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "Hey, I worked out three times today."}, {"time": 5678, "text": "He'd go have a, you know, a Mountain Dew."}, {"time": 5682, "text": "You know, or a chocolate bar."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "And then his next morning, he's back up to 87 and he would never touch weight until the morning of weigh ins."}, {"time": 5691, "text": "That's a, when he, he wasn't on weight for more than like five minutes."}, {"time": 5697, "text": "His process would break a lot of people."}, {"time": 5700, "text": "So the fact that he got the job done is... Not just the job done, but every single time he got the job done."}, {"time": 5707, "text": "And I made those athletes fight."}, {"time": 5710, "text": "We would fight in Paris."}, {"time": 5711,

two or three days later."}, {"time": 5721, "text": "You know, so not only did he make the weight, but he did a grueling training camp twice a day."}, {"time": 5726, "text": "And then cut weight and then fought again."}, {"time": 5729, "text": "Then did another camp for a week in double session training camp, and then fought on a third weekend in a row."}, {"time": 5734, "text": "And our athletes went through hell."}, {"time": 5737, "text": "You know, all of our athletes went through hell because on the tour around the world, they fought in every event."}, {"time": 5743, "text": "They did every camp."}, {"time": 5745, "text": "They fought in every event."}, {"time": 5746, "text": "Whereas most of the other teams, like Japan comes in and fights in Paris, then they go home."}, {"time":

for Germany."}, {"time": 5764, "text": "Our athletes already had two competitions, two training camps, three weight cuts now."}, {"time": 5769, "text": "And then, so they're not 100% when they fight in Germany, but that's all part of the experience they need, the training that they need that they don't get here in this country."}, {"time": 5778, "text": "And all of those were just preparation for our world championships or our Olympic games."}, {"time": 5783, "text": "So by the time our athletes got to those tournaments, they felt so strong, so rested, so like, man, this guy that felt like a monster in Germany feels like nothing today because you're fully rested now, you know?"}, {"time": 5797, "text": "But part of the challenge is because the American team is smaller and more, I mean, just smaller, is all the different places you go to do the weight cut, to do the diet, to do the preparation or the recovery, there's, like that process changes every time."}, {"time": 5819, "text": "So you basically have to improvise a lot."}, {"time": 5821, "text": "So you show up to a hotel and how you do the weight cut, you don't know."}, {"time": 5825, "text": "And this is the different weather conditions."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "It's not, it's like, what is it?"}, {"time": 5831, "text": "Rocky versus Drago, right?"}, {"time": 5833, "text": "So you don't have, you have to just improvise."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "And that's also a fascinating part of the American judo story, which is like, you have to improvise more."}, {"time": 5839, "text": "Well, it was funny because

core Olympic style lifting."}, {"time": 6417, "text": "Like as her body was developing, she was getting stronger every single day."}, {"time": 6422, "text": "And then, you know, she had the luxury of being on the mat with, at the time I was still young enough to train and be on the mat and I was around her weight class and Travis was able to train with her and we had all the top US athletes at the time training here at my school."}, {"time": 6436, "text": "So she got the benefit of all the best guys to train within the country, you know."}, {"time": 6441, "text": "And her doing all of those

got the technique, she got the, and then she had the coaching on top of it with my dad being on her as, you know, working her out and, you know, having the wherewithal to develop a strategy and a plan for her."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "Because when she first came here, she competed at 63 kilos, which is 138 pounds."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "At the time, Rhonda Rousey was also training here and she was 70 kilos."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "So if Kayla was struggling making 63, so the only way to, obviously, the only way to still compete is to move up."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "But my dad said, well, if you move up, then you're in Rhonda's weight."}, {"time": 6486, "text": "So let's skip that weight and you're gonna go to 78 kilos."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "And he told her, listen, you're gonna go up two weight classes."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "She looked at him and was like, that's 172 pounds."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "And he goes, well, I don't care."}, {"time": 6497, "text": "Like, you're already struggling making 138, you weigh 150, what's the difference?"}, {"time": 6500, "text": "We put 20 pounds on, go to 170."}, {"time": 6503, "text": "So that's why she jumped two weights, because she passed Rhonda, she went to the weight above so she could make the national team and she had a chance to go to the Olympics and all that, because we envisioned Rhonda staying around till 2012."}, {"time": 6514, "text": "And that's also like a longterm vision because you kind of grow into that body then over time."}, {"time": 6521, "text": "So you can dominate, you can learn what it's like in that weight class."}, {"time": 6523, "text": "You can learn to dominate that weight class, excel and then dominate."}, {"time": 6527, "text": "People that cut weight too hard, too long, they forget about technique because they're only worried about losing weight."}, {"time": 6532, "text": "They're always tired in training."}, {"time": 6534, "text": "They don't give 100% effort, they're not getting better."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "She now is just focused on getting better at judo, getting bigger, getting stronger, getting more powerful."}, {"time": 6542,

coach?"}, {"time": 6556, "text": "Not the most perhaps, let's say, what are some memorable moments?"}, {"time": 6562, "text": "Everybody hears the good ones, right?"}, {"time": 6563, "text": "So everybody knows she won the world championships in Tokyo in 2010."}, {"time": 6568, "text": "She was our two time Olympic champion in 2012, 2016."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "I'll never forget those moments, right?"}, {"time": 6574, "text": "Cause they're historic."}, {"time": 6576, "text": "One of the biggest moments that I liked sharing this story with everybody is that in 2010 in January, Kayla was still a developing athlete and we had a local tournament in New York."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "It was in Brooklyn, New York, it was called the Starrett Cup."}, {"time": 6593, "text": "And I knew that at that tournament that two of the Canadian girls, they were like ranked 15th or 20th in the world."}, {"time": 6599, "text": "They weren't superstars, but they were tough players."}, {"time": 6602, "text": "Both of them, I knew were gonna be at that tournament."}, {"time": 6604, "text": "So I said, Kayla, we're gonna go to this tournament, you're gonna compete against the Canadian girls, get some good experience, figure out what you need to work on and then we'll go home and work on some stuff."}, {"time": 6613, "text": "Well, she went to the tournament, there was only three girls in the weight, her and the two Canadians."}, {"time": 6618, "text": "At that tournament, she lost both fights, right?"}, {"time": 6622, "text": "So this is January, 2010, she lost both matches."}, {"time": 6626, "text": "She was competitive, but certainly things she needed to work on, it was good development thing for her and for us."}, {"time": 6632, "text": "It also opened her mind to say, oh man, cause she was already a junior world champion at the time."}, {"time": 6639, "text": "But so now there's another level, this is a senior level, right?"}, {"time": 6642, "text": "You gotta go up another level."}, {"time": 6643, "text": "Here's two girls that aren't even medalists that are beating you."}, {"time": 6646, "text": "So now there's more work to be done."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "And so I like telling that story because everybody sees the champions in the greatest moments, they don't see them when they have bad days."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "And could you imagine being, oh and two, you feel like a failure, right?"}, {"time": 6661, "text": "But 10 months later, it was Tokyo 2010, she went from oh and two at Starret, New York to world champion 2010 in the motherland in Japan."}, {"time": 6676, "text": "I mean, that's an amazing turnaround."}, {"time": 6679, "text": "And that's only possible if you put the losses in their proper context, you don't let it destroy you mentally and just keep moving forward."}, {"time": 6689, "text": "This is so funny."}, {"time": 6691, "text": "So you were there 2010 at the Starret Cup?"}, {"time": 6694, "text": "Was Travis there?"}, {"time": 6696, "text": "I made all those, we fought at every, like the mentality of our team was no tournament is beneath us."}, {"time": 6703, "text": "If our goal is to go to the Olympics in the world and win, there's no tournament that's beneath us."}, {"time": 6709, "text": "We're gonna get experience, we're gonna fight, we're gonna learn, we're gonna compete, we're gonna get better, you know?"}, {"time": 6716, "text": "I actually, just as a funny little side, I was there, I competed."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "This is one of the earlier tournaments, like the beginner division."}, {"time": 6725, "text": "Oh no, I actually did black belt division too."}, {"time": 6727, "text": "That was one of the, actually yeah, I remember that."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "That's when it was so early that I thought, like I was also really strong at that time, just like physically like power lifting stuff."}, {"time": 6741, "text": "So I thought like it'll be good experience to also do black belt division."}, {"time": 6746, "text": "And remember, it must have been actually Travis's division, which is funny."}, {"time": 6752, "text": "Is Legere Brothers?"}, {"time": 6753, "text": "Yeah, Harry and Gary."}, {"time": 6755, "text": "They are super, they're super good and they're super dominant, but I think Travis faced one of them and beat them."}, {"time": 6763, "text": "I don't know, I just remembered, it's funny how there's just like these little roads that later reconnect."}, {"time": 6771, "text": "But yeah, there's some incredible people there."}, {"time": 6774, "text": "And I saw obviously the positive things and it's interesting that Kayla's story was also intersecting there and that was one of the lower points for her."}, {"time": 6784, "text": "Another story I like to share is that you have to know your athletes, right?"}, {"time": 6789, "text": "And you have to really get to know their, what they're thinking psychologically, mentally, what's going through their head."}, {"time": 6796, "text": "Another story was in Tokyo."}, {"time": 6800, "text": "It was 2015, the Tokyo Grand Slam."}, {"time": 6805, "text": "So we had had Kayla face off against almost all the top girls in her division."}, {"time": 6810, "text": "She had beaten everybody going into the 2016 Olympics."}, {"time": 6814, "text": "But at the 2015 Tokyo Grand Slam, there was a girl from Japan that she hadn't fought in a long time and she lost to the girl last time she fought her."}, {"time": 6824, "text": "So it was something we wanted her to beat this girl going into the Olympics so that she knew she could beat everybody."}, {"time": 6832, "text": "And it was a first round match and it was gonna be tough for Kayla, right?"}, {"time": 6837, "text": "It was gonna be a really hard fight."}, {"time": 6839, "text": "And she had won a bunch of tournaments in a row leading up to that."}, {"time": 6843, "text": "So her confidence was really high, but at the same time, she didn't think she needed this fight."}, {"time": 6850, "text": "And she showed up to the tournament and she said, I don't think I can fight today."}, {"time": 6855,

6868, "text": "And then, so maybe she doesn't wanna fight today."}, {"time": 6873, "text": "So all of a sudden the trainer comes up to us and she didn't come to us."}, {"time": 6877, "text": "The trainer came to us and says, you know, I really don't think it's a good idea that Kayla fight today."}, {"time": 6881, "text": "And we looked at him and we're like, well, your opinion doesn't really matter, does it?"}, {"time": 6887, "text": "What's up with her?"}, {"time": 6889, "text": "Well, she has this thing in her neck."}, {"time": 6889, "text": "It's like a pinched nerve and there's this and that."}, {"time": 6893, "text": "We talked, I said, is there a risk of her getting injured?"}, {"time": 6896, "text": "Like, is this pain or is this risk that she's gonna get injured and she's gonna set her back like long time in her career?"}, {"time": 6902, "text": "Says, no, she's not gonna get injured."}, {"time": 6904, "text": "It's just a pinched nerve."}, {"time": 6905, "text": "It's a little pain she's gonna have to deal with."}, {"time": 6906, "text": "I go, okay, well, can you fix the pain?"}, {"time": 6909, "text": "Says, yeah, I can do this and that and I can give her a shot and the pain will go away."}, {"time": 6913, "text": "I said, okay, then do that."}, {"time": 6915, "text": "And so Kayla comes up, she goes, didn't the trainer talk to you?"}, {"time": 6918, "text":

a car."}, {"time": 842, "text": "It does not turn like a car."}, {"time": 845, "text": "But at least when I started, and this has changed and it's part of the technology story of trucking, the first thing you had to do was learn how to shift it."}, {"time": 855, "text": "And it doesn't shift like a manual car."}, {"time": 859, "text": "The clutch isn't synchronized."}, {"time": 861, "text": "So you have to do what's called double clutch."}, {"time": 864, "text": "And it's basically the foundational skill that a truck driver used to have to learn."}, {"time": 869, "text": "So you would, you know, accelerate, say you're in first gear, you push in the clutch, you pull the shifter out of first gear, you let the clutch out, and then you let the RPMs of the engine drop an exact amount."},

"So if you're in an intersection, you're just gonna get this horrible grinding sound as you coast, you know, to a dead stop in the, you know, underneath the stoplight or whatever it is."}, {"time": 903, "text": "So the first thing you have to do is learn to shift it."}, {"time": 906, "text": "And so at least for me and a lot of drivers who are going to private company CDL schools, what happens is it's kind of like a bootcamp."}, {"time": 914, "text": "They ship me three states away from home, send you a bus ticket and say, ''Hey, we'll put you up for two weeks.''"}, {"time": 921, "text": "You sit in a classroom, you sort of learn the theory of shifting, the theory of kind of how you fill out your log book, rules of the road, you know, you do that maybe half the day."}, {"time": 932, "text": "And then the other half you're in this giant parking lot with one of these old trucks and just like, you know, destroying what's left of the thing, you know, and it's lurching and belching smoke and just making horrible noises and like rattling."}, {"time": 945, "text": "I mean, in these things, like there's a lot of torque."}, {"time": 948, "text": "And so if you do manage to get it into gear, but the engine's lugging, I mean, it can throw you right out of the seat, right?"}, {"time": 954, "text": "So it's this, it's like, you know, it's bull, you're trying to ride and it's super intimidating."}, {"time": 960, "text": "And the thing about it is that for everybody there, it's almost everybody there, it's super high stakes."}, {"time": 967, "text": "So trucking has become a job of last resort for a lot of people."}, {"time": 972, "text": "And so they, you know, they lose a job in manufacturing, they get too old to do construction any longer, right?"}, {"time": 980, "text": "The knees can no longer handle it."}, {"time": 982, "text": "And they get replaced by a machine, their job gets, you know, offshored and they end up going to trucking because it's a place where they can maintain their income."}, {"time": 991, "text": "And so it's super high stress."}, {"time": 994, "text": "Like they've left their family behind, maybe they quit another job."}, {"time": 998, "text": "They're typically being charged a lot of money."}, {"time": 1000, "text": "So that first couple of weeks, like you might get charged $8,000 by the company that you have to pay back if you don't get hired."}, {"time": 1007, "text": "And so the stakes are high and this machine is huge and it's intimidating."}, {"time": 1012, "text": "And so it's super stressful."}, {"time": 1013, "text": "I mean, I watched, you know, grown men break down crying about like how they couldn't go home and tell their son that they had been telling they were gonna, you know, go become a long haul truck driver that they'd failed."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "And it's kind of this super high stress system."}, {"time": 1028, "text": "And it's designed that way partly because as one of my trainers later told me, it's basically a two week job interview."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Like they're testing you, they're seeing like, you know, how's this person gonna respond when it's tough, you know, when they have to do the right thing and it's slow and, you know, they need to learn something, are they gonna rush, you know, or are they gonna kind of stay calm, figure it out, you know, nose to the grindstone."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "Cause when you're a new truck driver, you're unsupervised, you know, and that's what they're really looking for is that kind of quality of conscientious work that's gonna carry through to the job."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "Well, so the truck is such an imposing part of a traffic scenario."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "So you said like turning, it stresses me out every time I look at a truck cause they, I mean, the geometry of the problem is so tricky."}, {"time": 1073, "text": "And so if you combine the fact that they have to, like everybody, basically all the cars in the scene are staring at the truck and they're waiting, often in frustration."}, {"time": 1082, "text": "And in that mode, you have to then shift gears perfectly and move perfectly."}, {"time": 1088, "text": "And if, when you're new, especially, like you'll probably, for somebody like me, it feels like it would take years to become calm and comfortable in that situation as opposed to be exceptionally stressed under the eyes of the road, everybody looking at you, waiting for you."}, {"time": 1104, "text": "Is that the psychological pressure of that?"}, {"time": 1107, "text": "Is that something that was really difficult?"}, {"time": 1110, "text": "Again, just, I saw people freeze up, you know, in that intersection as, you know, horns are blaring and the truck's grinding, you know, gears and you just can't, you know, and they just shut down."}, {"time": 1120, "text": "They're like, this isn't for me, I can't do it."}, {"time": 1122, "text": "You're right, it takes years."}, {"time": 1153, "text": "And between that and the really skilled drivers who've been doing it for 20 years, you know, it's still another step beyond that."}, {"time": 1161, "text": "So it is highly skilled."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "Would it be fair to break trucking into the task of driving a truck into two categories?"}, {"time": 1168, "text": "One is like the local stuff, getting out of the parking lot, getting into, you know, driving down local streets and then highway driving, those two tasks."}, {"time": 1178, "text": "What are the challenges associated with each task?"}, {"time": 1181, "text": "You kind of emphasized the first one."}, {"time": 1183, "text": "What about the actual like long haul highway driving?"}, {"time": 1188, "text": "Yeah, so, I mean, and they are very different, right?"}, {"time": 1191, "text": "And the key with the long haul driving is really a set of, the way I came to understand it was a set of habits, right?"}, {"time": 1203, "text": "We have a sense of driving, particularly men, I think, have a sense of driving as like being really skilled, is like the goal and you can kind of maneuver yourself out of in and out of tight spaces with great speed and breaking and acceleration, you know."}, {"time": 1220, "text": "For a really good truck driver, it's about understanding traffic and traffic patterns and making good decisions so you never have to use those skills."}, {"time": 1230, "text": "And the really good drivers, you know, the mantra is always leave yourself an out, right?"}, {"time": 1237, "text": "So always have that safe place that you can put that truck in case that four wheeler in front of you who's texting loses control."}, {"time": 1246, "text": "You know, what are you gonna do in that situation?"}, {"time": 1250, "text": "And what really good truck drivers do on the highway is they just keep themselves out of those situations entirely."}, {"time": 1259, "text": "They see it, they slow down, you know, they avoid it."}, {"time": 1264, "text": "And then the local driving is really something that takes just practice and routine to learn."}, {"time": 1270, "text": "You know, this quarter turn, it feels like the back of the truck sometimes is on delay when you're backing it up."}, {"time": 1276, "text": "So it's like, all right, I'm gonna do a quarter turn of the wheel now to get the effect that I want

dozen really large companies that are self insured and can train new drivers."}, {"time": 1648, "text": "So if you want those good jobs, you've gotta have several years, up until recently, now the

segment, you know, those drivers often don't make minimum wage."}, {"time": 1667, "text": "But this leads to one of the sort of central issues that has been in the courts, and in the legislature, in some states, is, you know, what should truck drivers get paid for?"}, {"time": 1679, "text": "Right, the industry, you know, for the last 30 years or so has said, essentially, it's the hours that they log for safety reasons for the Department of Transportation, right?"}, {"time": 1691, "text": "Now, since the drivers are paid by the mile, they try to minimize those, because those hours are limited by the federal government."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "So the federal government says, you can't drive more than 60 hours in a week as a long haul truck driver."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "And so you wanna drive as many miles as you can in those 60 hours, and so you under report them, right?"}, {"time": 1711, "text": "And so what happens is the companies say, well, that guy, you know, he only said he logged 45 hours of work that week, or 50 hours of work."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "That's all we have to pay him minimum wage for."}, {"time": 1723, "text": "When in fact, typical truck driver in

fueling it, just waiting to, you know, get put in the dock, 80 to 90 hours would be sort of a typical work week for one of these drivers."}, {"time": 1744, "text": "And just when you look at that, they don't make minimum wage oftentimes."}, {"time": 1747, "text": "Right, just to be clear, what we're dancing around here is that a little bit over, a little bit under minimum wage is nevertheless most truck drivers seem to be making close to minimum wage."}, {"time": 1759, "text": "Like this is the, so like we maybe haven't made that clear."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "There's a few that make quite a bit of money, but like you're as an entry and for years, you're operating essentially minimum wage and potentially far less than minimum wage if you actually count the number of hours that are

of Labor has, which basically say that a truck driver who's dispatched away from home for more than a day should get minimum wage 24 hours a day."}, {"time": 1813, "text": "And that could be a state minimum wage, but typically what it would work out to for most drivers is that, you know, the minimum wage for a truck driver should be 50s of thousands, you know, 55, $60,000 should be the minimum wage of a truck driver."}, {"time": 1828, "text": "And you've probably heard about the truck driver shortage."}, {"time": 1831, "text": "If, you know, which I hope we can talk about, if the minimum

jobs."}, {"time": 1957, "text": "The industry in their, you know, regular promotion of the idea that there's a shortage is always projecting forward and says, you know, we're gonna need 165,000 or so

all an absence of people who, I mean, and again, going back to what we were talking about before, getting that license is not something that you just walk down to the DMV and take the test."}, {"time": 1990, "text": "Like this is somebody who probably quit another job, was unemployed, and took months to go to a training school, paid for that training school oftentimes, left their family for months, invested in what they thought was gonna be a long term career, and then said, you know what, forget it, I can't, I can't do it."}, {"time": 2013, "text": "So yeah, so it's not just skill, it's like they were psychologically invested potentially for months, if not years, into this kinds of position as perhaps a position that if they lose their current job, they could fall too."}, {"time":

problems of the job of truck driver currently?"}, {"time": 2039, "text": "Yeah, the job, the problems with the job and the labor market, right?"}, {"time": 2042, "text": "But let's start with the job, which is, you know, again, just so much time that's not compensated directly for the amount of time."}, {"time": 2052, "text": "And that's just psychologically, and this was a big part of what I studied for the first book was, you know, that conception of like, what's my time worth, right?"}, {"time": 2064, "text": "And like, what truck drivers love is oftentimes, is that tangible outcome based compensation."}, {"time": 2072, "text": "So they say, you know what, you know, honest days work, I work hard, I get paid for what I do, I drive 500 miles today, that's what I'm gonna get paid for."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "And then you get to that dock, and they tell you, sorry, the load's not ready, go sit over there, and you stew."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "And that weight can break you psychologically because your time every second becomes more worthless."}, {"time": 2098, "text": "Or worth less."}, {"time": 2100, "text": "Yeah, and again, the industry is gonna say, for instance, okay, well, you know, they've got skin in the game, right?"}, {"time": 2106, "text": "That argument about sort of compensation based on sort of output, right?"}, {"time": 2110, "text": "But that's a holdover from when you couldn't observe truckers."}, {"time": 2113, "text": "Now they all have, you know, satellite linked computers in the trucks that tell these large companies, this driver was, you know, at this GPS location for four and a half hours, right?"}, {"time": 2122, "text": "So if you wanted to compensate them for that time directly, and the trucker can't control what's happening on that customer location, you know, they're waiting for that, you know, firm, that customer to tell them, hey, pull in there."}, {"time": 2135, "text": "And so what it becomes is just a way to shift the inefficiencies and the cost of that onto that driver."}, {"time": 2143, "text": "Now it's competitive for customers."}, {"time": 2145, "text": "So if you're Walmart, you might have your choice of a dozen different trucking companies that could move your stuff."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "And if one of them tells you, hey, you're not moving our trucks in and out of your docks fast enough, we're gonna charge you for how long our truck is sitting on your lot."}, {"time": 2161, "text": "If you're Walmart, you're gonna say, I'll go see what the other guy says, right?"}, {"time": 2164, "text":

labor market of the situation?"}, {"time": 2178, "text": "You mentioned freight and railroad."}, {"time": 2180, "text": "What is the sort of the dynamic financials, the economics of this that allow

{"time": 2210, "text": "I mean, so for economists, this is how it should work, right?"}, {"time": 2213, "text": "But the inefficiencies, like you said, sorry to interrupt, are pushed to the truck driver."}, {"time": 2219, "text": "Doesn't that like spiral, doesn't that lead to a poor performance on the part of the truck driver and just like make the whole thing more and more inefficient and it results in lower payment to the truck driver and so on."}, {"time": 2232, "text": "It just feels like in capitalism, you should have a competing solution in terms of truck drivers."}, {"time": 2241, "text": "Like another company that provides transportation via trucks that creates a much better experience for truck drivers, making them more efficient, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 2252, "text": "How is the competition being suppressed here?"}, {"time": 2254, "text": "Yeah, so it is, the competition is based on who's cheaper."}, {"time": 2259, "text": "And this is the cheapest way to move the freight."}, {"time": 2262, "text": "Now, there are externalities, right?"}, {"time": 2264, "text": "I mean, so this is the explanation that I think is obvious for this, right?"}, {"time": 2269, "text": "There are lots of costs that, whether it's that driver's time, whether it's the time without their family, whether it's the fact that they drive through congestion and spew lots of diesel particulates into cities where kids have asthma and make our commutes longer rather than more efficiently use their time by sort of routing them around congestion and rush hour and things like that."}, {"time": 2297, "text": "This is the cheapest way to move freight."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "And so it's the most competitive."}, {"time": 2303, "text": "A big part of this is public subsidy of training."}, {"time": 2306, "text": "So when those workers are not paying for the training, you and I often are."}, {"time": 2312, "text": "So if you lose your job because of foreign trade or you're a veteran using your GI benefits, you may very well be offered training, publicly subsidized training to become a truck driver."}, {"time": 2330, "text": "And so all of these are externalities that the companies don't have to pay for."}, {"time": 2335, "text": "And so this makes it the most profitable way to move freight."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "So trucks is way cheaper than trains?"}, {"time": 2342, "text": "Well, over the long, so one of the big stories for these companies is that the average length of haul, which becomes very important for self driving trucks, the average length of haul has been steadily declining."}, {"time": 2357, "text": "Over the last 15 years or so, and this is industry collected data from sort of the big firms that report it, but roughly been cut in half from typically about a thousand miles to under 500."}, {"time": 2370, "text": "And under 500 is what a driver can move in a day, right?"}, {"time": 2376, "text": "So you can get loaded, drive and

controlled."}, {"time": 2536, "text": "A lot of them were in agriculture, which was never regulated."}, {"time": 2539, "text": "So in the new deal, when they decided to regulate trucking, they didn't regulate agriculture because they didn't wanna drive up food prices, which would hurt workers in urban areas."}, {"time": 2548, "text": "So they essentially left agricultural truckers out of it."},

way."}, {"time": 2671, "text": "And my initial hypothesis was that, you know, and it's very simple, that, you know, the tenure of the driver in the industry would have a strong effect on how they

and this goes back well before Hoffa, back to the, you know, 1800s, they understood that workers did better if their employers did better."}, {"time": 2817, "text": "And the only way the employers would do better was if they controlled the market."}, {"time": 2821, "text": "And so oftentimes the corruption in trucking was initiated by employers who wanted to limit competition and they knew they

in house."}, {"time": 2959, "text": "You should be willing to pay more for that because it's more valuable too and you keep it in house and that."}, {"time": 2963, "text": "So that's an interesting

know, there's leftovers at home, you're consuming much more of the food you're getting when you're eating at home, that's creating these bottleneck situations, problems as you're referring to, too

they have been in say the last 20 years?"}, {"time": 3738, "text": "Yeah, it almost absolutely seems to be the case."}, {"time": 3741, "text": "So you then have to ask the question of how do we change our supply chains?"}, {"time": 3748, "text": "Whether it's making more resilient or make them less densely connected, you know, building a, it's like a, what is it?"}, {"time": 3758, "text": "You know, the Tesla model for in the automotive sector of like trying to build everything, like trying to get the factory to do as much as possible with as little reliance on widely distributed sources of the supply chain as possible."}, {"time": 3775, "text": "So maybe like rethinking how much we rely on the infrastructure of the supply chain."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "Yeah, I mean, you know, there's some basic, and I assume, right, that there are a lot of folks in corporate boardrooms looking at risk and saying that didn't go well, and maybe it could have even gone worse."}, {"time": 3796, "text": "Maybe we need to think about reshoring, right?"}, {"time": 3800, "text": "At the very least, one of the things that I'm hearing about anecdotally is that they're starting stuff up, you know, when they can, right?"}, {"time": 3808, "text": "Which is, that's probably not sustainable, right?"}, {"time": 3811, "text": "I mean, at some point, somebody in that corporate boardroom is gonna say, you know, guys, inventory is getting kind of heavy and the cost of that is like, do we, can we really justify that much longer to the shareholders, right?"}, {"time": 3821, "text": "We can back off and start, you know, back, things are back to normal, let's lean out."}, {"time": 3825, "text": "Well, my hope is that there's a technology solution to a lot of aspects of this."}, {"time": 3829, "text": "So one of them on the supply chain side is collecting a lot more data, like having much more integrated and accurate representation of the inventory all over the place, and the available transportation mechanisms, the trucks, the all kinds of freight, and how in the different models of the possible catastrophes that can happen, like how will the system respond?"}, {"time": 3855, "text": "So having a really solid model that you're operating under as opposed to just kind of being in emergency response mode under poor, incomplete information, which is what seems like is more commonly the case, except for things like you said, Walmart and Amazon, they're trying to internally get their stuff together on that front, but that doesn't help the rest of the economy."}, {"time": 3880, "text": "So another exciting technological development as you write about, as you think about is autonomous trucks."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "So these are often brought up in different contexts

while the press was saying, all truckers are gonna lose their jobs, there were a lot of people in these engineering teams who thought, okay, if we've got an individual owner operator and they can only

things."}, {"time": 4845, "text": "So, I don't know."}, {"time": 4846, "text": "So where are you on the spectrum of hope for the role of automation in trucking?"}, {"time": 4856, "text": "I think automation is inevitable."}, {"time": 4859, "text": "And again, I think this is really going to be transformative and it's gonna be, I've studied the history of trucking technology as much as I can."}, {"time": 4871, "text": "There's not a lot of great stuff written and you kind of have to, there isn't a lot of data and places to know sort of volumes of stuff and how they're changing, et

to swap out horses, right?"}, {"time": 4901, "text": "They basically do the same thing."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "The service doesn't really change, you know?"}, {"time": 4905, "text": "And then

countryside into cities and between cities that typically had to go by rail."}, {"time": 4942, "text": "And so now, you know, 40 years after that internal combustion engine, it becomes this absolutely essential, right?"}, {"time": 4950, "text": "This necessary but not sufficient piece of technology to create the modern trucking industry in the 1930s."}, {"time": 4958, "text": "And I think self

Sam Walton, if we can do it like a slight tangent on sort of the importance of trucking to business strategy and sort of how it has transformed our world."}, {"time": 4980, "text": "The central insight that Sam Walton had that made him the giant that he was in influencing the way that so many people get stuff was a trucking insight."}, {"time": 4992, "text": "And so if you look at the way that he developed his system, you build a distribution center and then you ring it with stores."}, {"time": 5002, "text": "Those stores are never further out from that distribution center than a human driven truck can drive back and forth in one day."}, {"time": 5011, "text": "And so rather than the way all of his competitors were doing it with sending trucks all over the place and having people sleep overnight and sort of making the trucking service fit where they had stores, he designed the layout of the stores to fit what trucks could do."}, {"time": 5031, "text": "And so transportation and logistics become Walmart's edge and allows them to dominate the space."}, {"time": 5039, "text": "That's the challenge that Amazon has now."}, {"time": 5042, "text": "They've mastered the digital part of it."}, {"time": 5045, "text": "And now they got to figure out how do we dominate the actual physical movement that complements that."}, {"time": 5054, "text": "Others are obviously gonna follow."}, {"time": 5056, "text": "But the capabilities of these trucks is completely different than the capability of a human driven truck."}, {"time": 5062, "text": "So if you're Smith packing and you've got a bunch of meat in a warehouse and it's going to grocery distribution centers, you have that trucker probably come in the night before and you make him wait so that he has a full 10 hour break, which is what the law requires so that he can get to the furthest reaches that he can of one of those stores."}, {"time": 5088, "text": "So he can drive his full 11 hours and bring that meat so it doesn't have to sit overnight in that refrigerated trailer."}, {"time": 5095, "text": "And so their system is based on that."}, {"time": 5097, "text": "Now, what happens when that truck can now travel two times as far, right?"}, {"time": 5104, "text": "Three times as far."}, {"time": 5105, "text": "Now you don't need the warehouses where they were."}, {"time": 5108, "text": "Now you can go super lean with your inventory."}, {"time": 5111, "text": "Instead of having meat here, meat there, meat there, you can put it all right here."}, {"time": 5116, "text": "And if it's cheap enough, substitute those transportation costs for all that warehousing costs, right?"}, {"time": 5122, "text": "So this is gonna remake landscapes in the same way that big box supply chains did, right?"}, {"time": 5129, "text": "And then of course, the further compliment of that is, how do you then get it to two people at their door, right?"}, {"time": 5137, "text": "And the big box supply chain, it moves very few items in really large quantities to very few locations pretty slowly, right?"}, {"time": 5149, "text": "Ecommerce aspires to do something completely different, move huge varieties of things in small quantities, virtually everywhere as fast as possible, right?"}, {"time": 5161, "text": "And so that is like that intercity trucking under the, in the era of railroad monopolies, right?"}, {"time": 5170, "text": "The demand for that is potentially enormous, right?"}, {"time": 5174, "text": "And so there's such a, so right now I think a lot of the business plans for sort of automated trucks, right?"}, {"time": 5182, "text": "And sort of the way that the journalistic accounts portray it is like, okay, if we swap out a human for a computer, what are the labor costs per mile?"}, {"time": 5190, "text": "And like, oh, here's the profitability of self driving trucks, uh uh."}, {"time": 5194, "text": "Like this is transformative technology."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "We're gonna change the way we get stuff."}, {"time": 5199, "text": "So we could actually get a lot more trucks period with like with autonomous trucks because they would enable a very different kind of transportation networks you think."}, {"time": 5207, "text": "Yeah, here's, and this is where it's like, uh oh."}, {"time": 5210, "text": "Like, yeah, so we really thought we were gonna be electrifying trucks."}, {"time": 5217, "text": "If they're going twice as far, if they're moving three times as much, if they're going three times as far, right?"}, {"time": 5223, "text": "What does that mean for how far we are behind on batteries, right?"}, {"time": 5226, "text": "We've got sort of these, you know, ideas about like, man, we, you know, here's how far, how close we could get to meet this demand."}, {"time": 5232, "text": "That demand is gonna radically change, right?"}, {"time": 5235, "text": "These trucks are, you know, so then we've got to think about, all right, if it's not batteries, you know, how are we powering these things?"}, {"time": 5242, "text": "And how many of them are they're gonna be?"}, {"time": 5245, "text": "Like right now we've got 5 million containers that move from LA and Long Beach to Chicago on rail."}, {"time": 5254, "text": "Rail is three or four times at least more efficient than trucks in terms of greenhouse gas emissions."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "And on that lane, it varies a lot depending on demand, but maybe rail has a 20% advantage in cost, maybe 25%, but it's a couple of days slower."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "So now you cut the cost of that truck, transportation per mile by 30%."}, {"time": 5277, "text": "Now it's cheaper than rail and it gets the stuff there five days faster than rail."}, {"time": 5282, "text": "How many millions of containers are gonna leave LA and Long Beach on self driving trucks and go to Chicago?"}, {"time": 5288, "text": "And it might look very much like a train if we go with the platooning solution, where you have these rows of like, imagine like rows of like 10, like dozens of trucks or like hundreds of trucks, like some absurd situation."}, {"time": 5305, "text": "Just going from LA to Chicago, just this train, but taking up a highway."}, {"time": 5311, "text": "I mean, this is probably a good place to talk about various scenarios."}, {"time": 5317, "text": "Well, before we get there, can I just make one interesting observation that I made as a driver?"}, {"time": 5324, "text": "When you're in a truck, you're up higher."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "So you can see further and you can see the traffic patterns and cars move in packs."}, {"time": 5334, "text": "I'm sure there's academic research on this, right?"}, {"time": 5336, "text": "But they move in packs."}, {"time": 5337, "text": "They kind of bunch up behind a slower car and then a bunch of them break free."}, {"time": 5341, "text": "And this is sort of on almost free flowing highways."}, {"time": 5343, "text": "They kind of move in packs and you can kind of see them in the truck."}, {"time": 5347, "text": "So, rather than platoons, we might have like hives of trucks, right?"}, {"time": 5351, "text": "So you have like 20 trucks moving in some coordinated fashion, right?"}, {"time": 5355, "text": "And then maybe the self driving cars are, cause people don't like to be around them or whatever it is, right?"}, {"time": 5361, "text": "You might have a pod of 20 self driving cars sort of moving in a packet behind them."}, {"time": 5366, "text": "This is what, if the aliens came down or we're just observing cars, which is one of the sort of prevalent characteristics of human civilization is there seems to be these cars like moving around that would do this kind of analysis of like, huh, what's the interesting clustering of situations here, especially with autonomous vehicles, I like this."}, {"time": 5388, "text": "Okay, so what technologically speaking do you see are the different scenarios of increasing automation in trucks?"}, {"time": 5398, "text": "What are some ideas that you think about?"}, {"time": 5400, "text": "For the most part, I have no influence on sort of what these ideas were."}, {"time": 5406, "text": "So what the project was that I did was I said, technology is created by people, they solve for X and they have some conception of what they wanna do."}, {"time": 5417, "text": "And that's where we should start in sort of thinking about what the impacts might be."}, {"time": 5422, "text": "So I went and I talked to everybody I could find who was thinking about developing a self driving truck."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "And the question was essentially, what are you trying to build?"}, {"time": 5432, "text": "Like, what do you envision this thing doing?"}, {"time": 5435, "text": "It turned out that that for a lot of them was an afterthought."}, {"time": 5440, "text": "They knew the sort of technological capabilities that a self driving vehicle would have."}, {"time": 5445, "text": "And those were the problems that they were tackling."}, {"time": 5448, "text": "They were engineers and computer scientists and... Oh, robotics people, I love you so much."}, {"time": 5453, "text": "This is, I could talk forever about this, but yes, there's a technology problem, let's focus on that and we'll figure out the actual impact on society, how it's actually going to be applied, how it's actually going to be integrated from a policy and from a human perspective, from a business perspective later."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "First, let's solve the technology problem."}, {"time": 5471, "text": "That's not how life works, friends, but okay, I'm sorry."}, {"time": 5474, "text": "Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I'm sure you know the division of labor in these companies, right?"}, {"time": 5478, "text": "There's sort of a business development side, you know, and then there's the engineering side, right?"}, {"time": 5482, "text": "And the engineers are like, oh my God, what are these business development people, you know, why are they involved in this process?"}, {"time": 5490, "text": "So I ended up sort of coming up with a few different ideas that people seem to be batting around and then really tried to zero in on a layman's understanding of the limitations, right?"}, {"time": 5502, "text": "And it turns out that's really obvious and quite simple."}, {"time": 5507, "text": "Highway driving's a lot simpler, right?"}, {"time": 5509, "text": "So, you know, the plan is simplify the problem, right?"}, {"time": 5513, "text": "And focus on highways because city driving is so much more complicated."}, {"time": 5519, "text": "So from that, I came up with basically six scenarios, actually I came up with five that the developers were talking about."}, {"time": 5528, "text": "And then one that I thought was a good idea that I had read about, I think in like 2013 or 2014, which was actually something that the US military was looking at."}, {"time": 5540, "text": "I actually first heard about the idea of this kind of automation, at least in sketched out form in like 2011, I guess it was with Peloton, which was this sort of early technology entrant into the trucking industry, which was working on platooning trucks."}, {"time": 5559, "text": "And all they were doing was, you know, a cooperative adaptive cruise control as they came to call it."}, {"time": 5565, "text": "And we ended up on a panel together."}, {"time": 5568, "text": "And it's kind of interesting because I was on that panel because I was thinking about how we got the best return on investment for fuel efficient technologies."}, {"time": 5578, "text": "And if it's cool, I'll sort of set this up because it does, it comes into sort of the story of some of these scenarios."}, {"time": 5585, "text": "So when I studied the drivers, you had this like complete difference in the driving tasks, like we were talking about before with long haul and city, right?"}, {"time": 5598, "text": "And you're not paid in the city, you've got congestion, the turns are tight."}, {"time": 5605, "text": "There's lots of, you know, pedestrians, you know, all the things that self driving trucks don't like, truckers don't like, right?"}, {"time": 5611, "text": "And they're not paid, there's lots of waiting time."}, {"time": 5615, "text": "And then in the highway, they get to cruise, they're getting paid, they have control, they go at their own pace, they're making money, they're happy."}, {"time": 5623, "text": "Well, it turned out, I guess it was around 2010, this is still when we were thinking about regenerative braking, you know, and hybrid trucks being sort of like the solution."}, {"time": 5633, "text": "The problems with them sort of, and the advantages, you know, also split on what I was thinking of as kind of the rural urban divide at that time, right?"}, {"time": 5641, "text": "So, like you got the regenerative braking, right?"}, {"time": 5645, "text": "You can make the truck lighter, you can keep it local, right?"}, {"time": 5648, "text": "You don't get any benefit from that, you know, hybrid electric on the rural highway, you want aerodynamics, right?"}, {"time": 5657, "text": "There, you want low rolling resistance tires and these super aerodynamic sleek trucks, right?"}, {"time": 5663, "text": "Where we know with off the shelf technology today, we could double the fuel economy, more than double the fuel economy of the typical truck in that highway segment, if we segmented the duty cycle, right?"}, {"time": 5674, "text": "And so in the urban environment, you want a clean burning truck, so you're not giving kids asthma, you want it lighter, so it's not destroying those less strong pavements, right?"}, {"time": 5685, "text": "You're not, you can make tighter turns, you don't need a sleeper cab, because the driver, you know, hopefully is getting home at night, right?"}, {"time": 5691, "text": "In the long haul, you want that super aerodynamic stuff."}, {"time": 5694, "text": "Now that doesn't get you anything in the city, and in fact, it causes all kinds of problems, because you turn too tight, you crunch up all the aerodynamics that connect the tractor and the trailer."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "So the idea that I had was like, okay, what if we deliberately segmented it?"}, {"time": 5708, "text": "Like, what if we created these droplets outside cities, where, you know, a local city driver who's paid by the hour kind of runs these trailers out once they're loaded, you know, doesn't sit there and wait while it's being loaded, they drop off a trailer, they go pick up one that's loaded, they run it out, when it's loaded, they call them, and they just run them out there and stage them."}, {"time": 5727, "text": "It's like an Uber driver, but for truckloads."}, {"time": 5730, "text": "Yeah, and we have like intermodal."}, {"time": 5732, "text": "We have like, basically this would be the equivalent of like rail to truck intermodal, right?"}, {"time": 5737, "text": "So you put it on the rail, and then, you know, a trucker picks it up and delivers it, right?"}, {"time": 5740, "text": "So instead of having the rail, you'd have these super aerodynamic, hopefully platoons, or what at the time was called long combination vehicles, which is basically two trailers connected together, right?"}, {"time": 5751, "text": "Because this is like a huge productivity gain, right?"}, {"time": 5754, "text": "And then instead of that driver like me, I would pick up something in upstate New York, drive to Michigan, drive to Alabama, you know, drive to Wisconsin, drive to Florida, you know, I'd get home every two weeks."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "If I'm just running that, you know, that double trailer, I might be able to go back and forth from Chicago to Detroit, right?"}, {"time": 5771, "text": "Take two trailers there, pick up two trailers going back, right, and be home every night."}, {"time": 5776, "text": "Now, the problem with that at the time, or one of them was, you know, bridge weights."}, {"time": 5780, "text": "So you can't, not all bridges can handle that much weight on them."}, {"time": 5785, "text": "They can't handle these doubles, right?"}, {"time": 5786, "text": "And some places can, some places can't."}, {"time": 5788, "text": "And so this platooning idea was happening at the same time, and we ended up on the same panel, and the founders were like, hey, so what's it like to follow really close behind another truck?"}, {"time": 5799, "text": "Which was kind of the stage that they were at was like, you know, what's that experience gonna be like?"}, {"time": 5803, "text": "And I was like, truckers aren't gonna like it, you know?"}, {"time": 5806, "text": "I mean, that's just like the cardinal rule is following distance."}, {"time": 5809, "text": "Like that's the one you really shouldn't violate, right?"}, {"time": 5812, "text": "And when you're out on the road, like you have that trucker like right on your ass, you know, people remember that."}, {"time": 5818, "text": "They don't remember the 99.9% of truckers that are not on their ass, you know?"}, {"time": 5823, "text": "Like they're very careful about that."}, {"time": 5825, "text": "But when the trucks are really close together, there's benefits in terms of aerodynamics."}, {"time": 5830, "text": "So that's the idea."}, {"time": 5831, "text": "So like if you want to get some benefits of a platoon, you want them to be close together, but you're saying that's very uncomfortable for truckers."}, {"time": 5840, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, I think that ended up at the, I mean, Peloton I think is sort of winding down their work on this."}, {"time": 5847, "text": "And I think that ended up being still an open question."}, {"time": 5851, "text": "Like, and I had a chance to interview a couple drivers who at least one, maybe two of which had actually driven in their platoons."}, {"time": 5858, "text": "And I got completely different experiences."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "Some of them were like, it's really cool."}, {"time": 5863, "text": "You know, I'm like in communication with that other driver."}, {"time": 5866, "text": "You know, I can see on a screen what's out, you know, the front of his truck."}, {"time": 5871, "text": "And then some were like, it's too close."}, {"time": 5873, "text": "And it might be one of those things that's just, you know, it takes an adjustment to sort of get there."}, {"time": 5877, "text": "So you get the aerodynamic advantage, which, you know, saves fuel."}, {"time": 5881, "text": "There's some problems though, right?"}, {"time": 5883, "text": "So, you know, you're getting that aerodynamic advantage because there's a low pressure system in front of that following truck."}, {"time": 5890, "text": "But the engine is designed with higher pressure feeding that engine, right?"}, {"time": 5895, "text": "So there are sort of adjustments that you need to make and, you know, still the benefits are there."}, {"time": 5901, "text": "That's one scenario."}, {"time": 5902, "text": "And that's just the automation of that acceleration and braking."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "Starsky, which, you know, probably a lot of your listeners heard about, was working on another scenario, which was, you know, to solve that local problem was gonna do teleoperation, right?"}, {"time": 5920, "text": "Sort of remote piloting."}, {"time": 5922, "text": "I had the chance to, you know, sort of watch them do that."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "You know, they drove a truck in Florida from San Francisco in one of their offices."}, {"time": 5933, "text": "That was really interesting."}, {"time": 5935, "text": "In case it's not clear, teleoperation means you're controlling the truck remotely, like it's a video game."}, {"time": 5941, "text": "So you've gotten the chance to witness it."}, {"time": 5945, "text": "Does it actually work?"}, {"time": 5946, "text": "Yeah, I mean, so it's a... What are the pros and cons?"}, {"time": 5950, "text": "You know, one of the problems with doing research like this with all these Silicon Valley folks is the NDAs."}, {"time": 5957, "text": "So, you know, I don't know what I'm able to say about sort of watching it, but obviously they're public statements about sort of what the challenges are, right?"}, {"time": 5965, "text": "And it's about the latency and the ability to sort of in real time."}, {"time": 5971, "text": "There's challenges there."}, {"time": 5972, "text": "Let me say one thing."}, {"time": 5973, "text": "So I'm talking to the... You know, I've talked to the Waymo CTO."}, {"time": 5978, "text": "I'm in conversations with them."}, {"time": 5979, "text": "I'm talking to the head of trucking, Boris Softman, in next month, actually."}, {"time": 5985, "text": "I'm a huge fan of his because he was, I think the founder of Anki, which is a toy robotics company."}, {"time": 5992, "text": "So I love human robot interaction."}, {"time": 5995, "text": "And he created one of the most effective and beautiful toy robots."}, {"time": 6003, "text": "Anyway, I keep complaining to them on email privately that there's way too much marketing in these conversations and not enough showing off both the challenge and the beauty of the engineering efforts."}, {"time": 6016, "text": "And that seems to be the case for a lot of these Silicon Valley tech companies."}, {"time": 6021, "text": "They put up this, you're talking about NDAs."}, {"time": 6026, "text": "For some reason, rightfully or wrongfully, because there's been so much hype and so much money being made, they don't see the upside in being transparent and educating the public about how difficult the problem is."}, {"time": 6043, "text": "It's much more effective for them to say, we have everything solved."}, {"time": 6046, "text": "This will change everything."}, {"time": 6047, "text": "This will change society as we know it."}, {"time": 6049, "text": "And just kind of wave their hands as opposed to exploring together like these different scenarios."}, {"time": 6054, "text": "What are the pros and cons?"}, {"time": 6055, "text": "Why is it really difficult?"}, {"time": 6057, "text": "You know, what are the gray areas of where it works and doesn't?"}, {"time": 6061, "text": "What's the role of the human in this picture of the both sort of the operators and the other humans on the road?"}, {"time": 6068, "text": "All of that, which are fascinating human problems, fascinating engineering problems that I wish we could have a conversation about as opposed to always feeling like it's just marketing talk."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "Because a lot of what we're talking about now, even you with having private conversations under NDA, you still don't have the full picture of everything, of how difficult this problem is."}, {"time": 6091, "text": "One of the big questions I've had, still have is how difficult is driving?"}, {"time": 6097, "text": "I disagree with Elon Musk and Jim Keller on this point."}, {"time": 6101, "text": "I have a sense that driving is really difficult."}, {"time": 6105, "text": "You know, the task of driving, just broadly."}, {"time": 6107, "text": "This is like philosophy talk."}, {"time": 6109, "text": "How much intelligence is required to drive a car?"}, {"time": 6115, "text": "So from like a Jim Keller, who used to be the head of autopilot, the idea is that it's just a collision avoidance problem."}, {"time": 6123, "text": "It's like billiard balls."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "It's like you have to convert the drive."}, {"time": 6126, "text": "You have to do some basic perception, a computer vision to convert driving into a game of pool."}, {"time": 6133, "text": "And then you just have to get everything into a pocket."}, {"time": 6135, "text": "To me, there just seems to be some game theoretic dance combined with the fact that people's life is at stake."}, {"time": 6141, "text": "And then when people die at the hands of a robot, the reaction is going to be much more complicated."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "So all of that, but that's still an open question."}, {"time": 6148, "text": "And the cool thing is all of these companies are struggling with this question of how difficult is it to solve this problem sufficiently such that we can build a business on top of it and have a product that's going to make a huge amount of money and compete with the manually driven vehicles."}, {"time": 6166, "text": "And so their teleoperation from Starsky's is really interesting idea."}, {"time": 6170, "text": "How much can, I mean, there's a few autonomous vehicle companies that tried to integrate teleoperation in the picture."}, {"time": 6179, "text": "Can we reduce some of the costs while still having reliability, like catch when the vehicle fails by having teleoperation?"}, {"time": 6193, "text": "So that's for you scenario number two is to use teleoperation as part of the picture."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "Yeah, let me follow up on that question of how hard driving is, because this becomes a big question for researchers who are thinking about labor market impacts, because we start from a perspective of what's hard or easy for humans."}, {"time": 6214, "text": "And so if you were to look at truck driving prior to a lot, I mean, there's been a lot of thinking and debate in academic research circles around sort of how you estimate labor impacts, what these models look like."}, {"time": 6229, "text": "And a lot of it is about how automatable is a job, object recognition, really easy for people, right?"}, {"time": 6234, "text": "Really hard for computers."}, {"time": 6236, "text": "And so there's a whole bunch of things that truck drivers do that we see as super easy and as it would have been characterized 10 years ago, routine, and it's not for a computer, right?"}, {"time": 6250, "text": "It turns out to be something that we do naturally that is sort of cutting edge, right?"}, {"time": 6256, "text": "Computer science."}, {"time": 6257, "text": "So on the teleoperation question, I think this is a more interesting one than people would like to sort of let on, I think, publicly."}, {"time": 6269, "text": "There are gonna be problems, right?"}, {"time": 6272, "text": "And this is one of the complexities of sort of putting these things out in the world."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "And if you see the real world of trucking, you realize, wow, it's rough."}, {"time": 6280, "text": "There are dirt lots, there's gravel, there's salt and ice and cold weather, and there's equipment that just gets left out in the middle of nowhere, and the brakes don't get maintained, and somebody was supposed to service something and they didn't, you know?"}, {"time": 6293, "text": "And so you imagine, okay, we've got this vehicle that can drive itself, which is gonna require a whole lot of sensors to tell it that the doors are still closed and the trailer's still hooked up and each of the tires has adequate pressure, and any number of, probably hundreds of sensors that are gonna be sort of relaying information."}, {"time": 6311, "text": "And one of them, after 500,000 miles or whatever, it goes out."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "Now, do we have some fleet of technicians sort of continually cruising the highways and sort of servicing these things as they do what?"}, {"time": 6325, "text": "Pull themselves off to the side of the road and say, I've got a sensor fault, I'm pulling over, or maybe there's some level of safety critical faults or whatever it might be."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "So that suggests that there might be a role for teleoperation even with self driving."}, {"time": 6343, "text": "And when I push people on it in the conversations, they all are like, yeah, we kind of have that on the bottom of the list, figure out how to rescue truck, you know?"}, {"time": 6354, "text": "I guess on the to do list, right?"}, {"time": 6356, "text": "After solving the self driving question is like, yeah, what do we do with the problems, right?"}, {"time": 6362, "text": "I mean, no, we could imagine like, all right, we have some protocol that the truck is not, realizes the system says not safe for operation, pull to the side."}, {"time": 6373, "text": "Good, you have a crash, but now you got a truck stranded on the side of the road."}, {"time": 6377, "text": "You're gonna send out somebody to like calibrate things and check out what's going on, or that sounds like expensive labor, it sounds like downtime, it sounds like the kind of things that shippers don't like to happen to their freight, you know, in a just in time world."}, {"time": 6390, "text": "And so wouldn't it be great if you could just sort of, you know, loop your way into the controls of that truck and say, all right, we've got a sensor out, says that the tire is bad, but I can see visually from the camera, looks fine, I'm gonna drive it to our next depot, you know, maybe the next rider or Penske location, right?"}, {"time": 6408, "text": "Sort of all these service locations around and have a technician take a look at it."}, {"time": 6412, "text": "So teleoperation often gets this, you know, so dismissive, you know, commentary from other folks working on other scenarios."}, {"time": 6424, "text": "But I think it's potentially more relevant than we hear publicly."}, {"time": 6429, "text": "But it's a hard problem."}, {"time": 6431, "text": "And, you know, for me, I've gotten a chance to interact with people that take on hard problems and solve them and they're rare."}, {"time": 6441, "text": "What Tesla has done with their data engine."}, {"time": 6445, "text": "So I thought autonomous driving cannot be solved without collecting a huge amount of data and organizing it well, not just collecting, but organizing it."}, {"time": 6454, "text": "And exactly what Tesla is doing now is what I thought it would be, like I couldn't see car companies doing that, including Tesla."}, {"time": 6462, "text": "And now that they're doing that, it's like, oh, okay."}, {"time": 6464, "text": "So it's possible to take on this huge effort seriously."}, {"time": 6468, "text": "To me, teleoperation is another huge effort like that."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "It's like taking seriously what happens when it fails."}, {"time": 6476, "text": "What's the, in the case of Waymo for the consumer, like ride sharing, what's the customer experience like?"}, {"time": 6484, "text": "There's a bunch of videos online now where people are like the car fails and it pulls off to the side and you call like customer service and you're basically sitting there for a long time and there's confusion."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "And then there's a rescue that comes and they start to drive."}, {"time": 6497, "text": "I mean, just the whole experience is a mess that has a ripple effect to how you trust in the entirety of the experience."}, {"time": 6505, "text": "But like actually taking on the problem of that failure case and revolutionizing that experience, both for trucking and for ride sharing, that's an amazing opportunity there because that feels like it would change everything."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "If you can reliably know when the failures happen, which they will, you have a clear plan that doesn't significantly affect the efficiency of the whole process, that could be the game changer."}, {"time": 6531, "text": "And if teleoperation is part of that, it could be just like you're saying, it could be teleoperation or it could be like a fleet of rescuers that can come in, which is a similar idea."}, {"time": 6541, "text": "But teleoperation, obviously that allows you to just have a network of monitors of people monitoring this giant fleet of trucks and taking over when needed."}, {"time": 6552, "text": "And it's a beautiful vision of the future where there's millions of robots and only thousands of humans monitoring those millions of robots."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "That seems like a perfect dance of allowing humans to do what they do best and allowing robots to do what they do best."}, {"time": 6571, "text": "Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I think there are, and we just applied for an NSF we didn't get, anybody's watching, but with some folks from Wisconsin who do teleoperation, right?"}, {"time": 6583, "text": "And some of this is used for like rovers and I mean, really high stakes, difficult problems."}, {"time": 6590, "text": "But one of the things we wanted to study were these mines, these Rio Tinto mines in Australia where they remotely pilot the trucks."}, {"time": 6599, "text": "And there's some autonomy, I guess, but it's overseen by a remote operator and it's near Perth and it's quite remote and they retrained the truck drivers to be the remote operators, right?"}, {"time": 6615, "text": "There's autonomy in the port of Rotterdam and places like that where there are jobs there."}, {"time": 6621, "text": "And so I think, and maybe we'll get to this later, but there's a real policy question about sort of who's gonna lose and what we do about it and whether or not there are opportunities there that maybe we need to put our thumb on the scale a little bit to make sure that there's some give back to the community that's taking the hit."}, {"time": 6641, "text": "So for instance, if there were teleoperation centers, maybe they go in these communities that we disproportionately source truck drivers from today."}, {"time": 6650, "text": "Now, I mean, what does that mean?"}, {"time": 6652, "text": "It may not be the cheapest place to do it if they don't have great connectivity and it may not be where the upper level managers wanna be and places like that, issues like that, right?"}, {"time": 6661, "text": "So I do think it's an interesting question, both from sort of a practical scenario situation of how it's gonna work, but also from a policy perspective."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "So there's platoons, there's teleoperation, and this is taking care of some of the highway driving that we're talking about."}, {"time": 6681, "text": "Is there other ideas like, is there other ideas, scenarios that you have for autonomous trucks?"}, {"time": 6688, "text": "Yeah, so I mean, the most obvious one actually is just facility to facility, right?"}, {"time": 6694, "text": "The sort of, it can't go everywhere, but a lot of logistics facilities are very close to interstates and they're on big commercial roads without bikes and parked cars and all that stuff."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "And some of the jobs that I think are really first on the chopping block are these LTL, that less than truckload, what's called line haul, right?"}, {"time": 6717, "text": "So these are the drivers who go from terminal to terminal with those full trailers."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "And those facilities are often located strategically to avoid congestion, right?"}, {"time": 6727, "text": "And to be in big industrial facilities."}, {"time": 6730, "text": "So you could imagine that being the first place you see a Waymo self driving truck rollout might be sort of direct facility to facility for UPS or FedEx or less than truckload care."}, {"time": 6745, "text": "And the idea there is fully driverless, so potentially not even a driver in the truck, it's just going from facility to facility empty, zero occupancy."}, {"time": 6754, "text": "Yeah, and those, because that labor is expensive, they don't keep those drivers out overnight, those drivers do a run back and forth typically, or in a team go back and forth in one day."}, {"time": 6767, "text": "So from the people you've spoken with so far, what's your sense?"}, {"time": 6770, "text": "How far are we away from, which scenario is closest and how far away are we from that scenario of autonomy being a big part of our trucking fleet?"}, {"time": 6782, "text": "Most folks are focused on another scenario, which is the exit to exit, right?"}, {"time": 6787, "text": "Which looks like that urban truck ports thing that I laid out earlier."}, {"time": 6792, "text": "So you have a human driven truck that comes out to a drop lot, it meets up with an autonomous truck, that truck then drives it on the interstate to another lot, and then a human driver picks it up."}, {"time": 6807, "text": "There are a couple variations maybe on that."}, {"time": 6812, "text": "So, or let me just run through the last two scenarios."}, {"time": 6847, "text": "And so you have a self driving truck that's not driverless, right?"}, {"time": 6851, "text": "And just to clarify, because Tesla uses the term autopilot instead of airplanes, and so everybody uses the word autopilot, we're referring to essentially full autonomy, but because it's exit to exit, the truck driver is onboard the truck, but they're sleeping in the back or whatever."}, {"time": 6866, "text": "Yeah, and this gets to the really weedy policy questions, right?"}, {"time": 6871, "text": "So basically for the Department of Transportation, for you to be off duty for safety reasons, you have to be completely relieved of all responsibility."}, {"time": 6879, "text": "So that truck has to not encounter a construction site or inclement weather or whatever it might be, and call to you and say, hey, you know, or I mean, obviously, right, we're imagining connected vehicles as well, right?"}, {"time": 6893, "text": "So you're in a self driving truck, you're in the back and trucks 20 miles ahead experience some problem, right?"}, {"time": 6901, "text": "That may require teleoperation or whatever it is, right?"}, {"time": 6904, "text": "And it signals to your truck, hey, you know, tell the driver 20 miles ahead, he's got to hop in the seat."}, {"time": 6910, "text": "That would mean that they're on duty according to the way that the current rules are written, they have some responsibility."}, {"time": 6915, "text": "And part of that is, you know, we need them to get rest, right?"}, {"time": 6919, "text": "They need to have uninterrupted sleep."}, {"time": 6922, "text": "So that's what I call autopilot."}, {"time": 6925, "text": "The final scenario is one that I thought was actually the one scenario that was good for labor, you know, which I proposed is I was like, well, here's an idea, you know, that would be like, actually good for workers."}, {"time": 6941, "text": "And just another brief aside here."}, {"time": 6946, "text": "The history of trucking

know, and then that'll put me, you know, in Cleveland at, you know, 9.30, which means I'll miss that rush hour, right, which is gonna put me in Chicago, you know, and so you do this and now today, you know, 15 years later, truck drivers don't have to do any of that."}, {"time": 7021, "text": "You know, you don't have to shift the truck, you don't have to map, you know, you can figure out the least congested route to go on and your hours of service are recorded or a good portion of them are reported automatically."}, {"time": 7037, "text": "All of that has been a substantial de skilling that has, you know, put downward pressure on wages and allowed companies to kind of speed up, monitor and direct, I mean, the key technology, you know, that I did work under is satellite linked computers."}, {"time": 7052, "text": "So before you could kind of go out and plan your own work and the boss really couldn't see what you were doing and push you and say, you know, you've been on

hours, you know, they're only gonna accept that so many times or at least some of those dispatchers are."}, {"time": 7071, "text": "So all this technology has made the job sort of, you know, de skilled the job, you know, hurt drivers in the labor market, made the work worse."}, {"time": 7081, "text": "So I think the burden it's really on the technologists who are like, oh, this will make truck driver jobs better and sort of envision ways that it would."}, {"time": 7091, "text": "It's like, the burden's really, a proof is really on you to sort of really clearly lay out what that is gonna look like because it's 30 or 40 years of history suggests that that technology into labor markets where workers are really weak and cheap is what wins that new technology doesn't help workers or raise their wages."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "So it lowers the bar of entry in terms of skill."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "So that's really, that's tough."}, {"time": 7123, "text": "That's tough to

"text": "No, but that like, when you think about like what exactly, because the reality is you will make their life potentially a little bit easier, but that will allow the companies to then hire people that are less skilled, get those people that were previously working there fired or lower wages."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "And so the result of this easier is a lower quality of life."},

automated mapping."}, {"time": 7204, "text": "So we're sort of done all this incremental automation that could make the truck completely driverless."}, {"time": 7211, "text": "There's some important things happening right now with the remaining good jobs."}, {"time": 7215, "text": "So what you're really paying for when you get a good truck driver is, like I said, you get those kind of local

they the same people, right?"}, {"time": 7598, "text": "And do they live in the same places?"}, {"time": 7599, "text": "And I think that kind of geography is a huge issue here with the impacts,

myself."}, {"time": 7623, "text": "Yeah, and to elaborate, I think economics as a field is not good at measuring the landscape of human pain and suffering."}, {"time": 7630, "text": "So sometimes you

truckers."}, {"time": 7726, "text": "Again, trucking is a job of last resort."}, {"time": 7728, "text": "These are people who've already lost that manufacturing job oftentimes, already lost that

we've got tons of highway deaths."}, {"time": 7744, "text": "We've got, and just the big picture is, and this is the opportunity, I guess, for investors, it's a hugely inefficient system."}, {"time": 7755, "text": "So we buy this truck, there's this low wage worker in it oftentimes."}, {"time": 7759, "text": "And again, I'm setting aside those really good line haul jobs in LTL, those are a different case."}, {"time": 7766, "text": "That low wage worker is driving a truck that they might, the wheels might roll seven to eight hours a day."}, {"time": 7772, "text": "That's what the truck is designed to do and that's what makes the money for the company."}, {"time": 7776, "text": "In other seven, eight hours a day, the driver's doing other kinds of work that is not driving."}, {"time": 7781, "text": "And then the rest of the day, they're basically living out of the truck."}, {"time": 7785, "text": "You really can't find a more inefficient use of an asset than that, right?"}, {"time": 7791, "text": "Now, a big part of that is we pay for the roads and we pay for the rest areas and all this other stuff."}, {"time": 7795, "text": "So the way that I work and the way that I think about these problems is I try to find analogies, right?"}, {"time": 7801, "text": "Sort of labor processes and things that make economic sense that seem in the same area of the economy, but have some different characteristics for workers, right?"}, {"time": 7815, "text": "And sort of try to figure out why does the economics work there, right?"}, {"time": 7819, "text": "And so if you look at those really good jobs, the most likely way that you as a passenger car driver would know that it's one of those drivers is that there are multiple trailers, right?"}, {"time": 7833, "text": "So you see these, like maybe it's three small trailers, maybe it's two sort of medium sized trailers."}, {"time": 7837, "text": "Some places you might even see two really big trailers together."}, {"time": 7842, "text": "You do that because labor is expensive, right?"}, {"time": 7844, "text": "And it's highly skilled."}, {"time": 7845, "text": "And so you use it efficiently and you say, all right, rather than having you haul that little trailer out of the ports, that sort of half size container, we're gonna wait till we get three or we're gonna coordinate the movement so that they're three ready."}, {"time": 7857, "text": "You go do what truckers call make a set, put them together, right, and you go."}, {"time": 7864, "text": "That's a massive productivity gain, right?"}, {"time": 7866, "text": "Because you're hauling two, three times as much freight."}, {"time": 7869, "text": "So the positive scenario that I threw out in 2018 was why not have a human driven truck with a self driving truck that follows it, right?"}, {"time": 7880, "text": "Just a drone unit."}, {"time": 7883, "text": "And to me, this seemed as a non computer scientist, a non computer scientist, a sociologist, right?"}, {"time": 7891, "text": "This made a lot of sense because when I got done talking to the computer scientists and the engineers, they were like, well, it's like object recognition, decision making algorithm, all this stuff."}, {"time": 7900, "text": "It's like, all right, so why don't you leave the human brain in the lead vehicle, right?"}, {"time": 7906, "text": "You got all that processing and then all that following."}, {"time": 7910, "text": "Now, again, this is sort of me being a lay person."}, {"time": 7914, "text": "I said, why don't, then that following truck, right, makes direction from the front."}, {"time": 7918, "text": "It uses the rear of the trailer as a reference point."}, {"time": 7921, "text": "It maintains the lane."}, {"time": 7922, "text": "You've got cooperative adaptive cruise control and that you double the productivity of that driver."}, {"time": 7928, "text": "You solve that problem that I hated in my urban truck ports thing about the bridge weight."}, {"time": 7935, "text": "Cause when you get to the bridges, the two trucks can just spread out just enough to make the bridge weight, right?"}, {"time": 7941, "text": "And you can just program that in and they're 50 feet further apart, 100 feet further apart."}, {"time": 7948, "text": "So interesting sort of, I think, story about this that leads to kind of, I think, the policy questions."}, {"time": 7956, "text": "In, I guess, 2017, Jack Reed and Susan Collins and requested from the Senate, the Senate requested research on what the impacts of self driving trucks would be."}, {"time": 7968, "text": "And the first stage of that was for the GAO to do a report, sort of looking at the lay of the land, talking to some experts."}, {"time": 7979, "text": "And I was working on my 2018 report, help contribute to that GAO report."}, {"time": 7986, "text": "And I had the six scenarios, right?"}, {"time": 7988, "text": "I'm like, okay, here's what Starsky's doing."},

"text": "Here's what Peloton's doing."}, {"time": 8003, "text": "Here's the autopilot scenario."}, {"time": 8005, "text": "And then here's this one that I think actually could be good for drivers."}, {"time": 8009, "text": "So now you've got that driver who's got two times the freight."}, {"time": 8014, "text": "Their decisions are more important."}, {"time": 8015, "text": "They're managing a more complex system, right?"}, {"time": 8017, "text": "They're probably gonna have to have some global understanding of how to, the environments in which it can operate safely, right?"}, {"time": 8022, "text": "Now we're talking upskilling, right?"}, {"time": 8024, "text": "And so the GAO sort of writes up these different scenarios and the idea is that it's gonna prepare for this Department of Transportation, Department of Labor set of processes to engage stakeholders and sort of get industry perspectives and then do a study on the labor impacts."}, {"time": 8047, "text": "So that DOT, DOL process starts to happen and I get to the workshop and a friend was sitting at the table next to me and he holds up the scenarios that they're gonna have us discuss at this workshop."}, {"time": 8064, "text": "And he's like, hey, these look really familiar, right?"}, {"time": 8067, "text": "They were the scenarios from the report, but there were only five instead of six."}, {"time": 8074, "text": "The sixth scenario, which was the upskilling labor, good for workers scenario, wasn't discussed."}, {"time": 8082, "text": "So to clarify that the integral piece of technology there is platooning."}, {"time": 8087, "text": "Yeah, I mean, in a sense it's platooning, but, and in fairness, right, as I pitched that idea or sort of ran that idea by the computer scientists and engineers and product managers that I would talk to, they would say, we thought about that, but that following truck, it's not that simple."}, {"time": 8109, "text": "That thing, basically we had to engineer that to be capable of independent self driving, because what if there was a cut in or any number of scenarios in which it lost that connection to the lead truck for whatever reason."}, {"time": 8125, "text": "Now, I mean, I don't know."}, {"time": 8126, "text": "Boo hoo, platooning is hard."}, {"time": 8129, "text": "There's edge cases."}, {"time": 8130, "text": "I guarantee the number of edge cases in platooning is orders of magnitude lower than the number of edge cases in the general solo full self drive."}, {"time": 8140, "text": "You do not need to solve the full self driving problem."}, {"time": 8143, "text": "I mean, if you're talking about probability of dangerous events, it just seems with platooning, then like you can deal with cut ins."}, {"time": 8154, "text": "Yeah, so this is beyond, this is one of the challenge obviously of being a researcher who doesn't really have any background in the technology, right?"}, {"time": 8164, "text": "So I can dream this up."}, {"time": 8165, "text": "I don't, you know, I have no idea if it's feasible."}, {"time": 8168, "text": "Well, let me speak, you spoke to the PhDs in economics."}, {"time": 8170, "text": "Let me speak to the PhDs in computer science."}, {"time": 8172, "text": "If you think platooning is as hard as the full self driving problem, we need to talk, because I think that's ridiculous."}, {"time": 8180, "text": "I think platooning, and in fact, I think platooning is an interesting idea for ride sharing as well, for the general autonomous driving problem, not just trucking, but obviously trucking is the big, big benefit, because the number of A to B points in trucking is much, much lower than the general ride sharing problem."}, {"time": 8198, "text": "But anyway, I think that's a great idea, but you're saying it was removed."}, {"time": 8202, "text": "Yeah, and so you can go, you know, and listeners could go to these reports."}, {"time": 8207, "text": "They're publicly available."}, {"time": 8208, "text": "And they explain why in the footnote."}, {"time": 8211, "text": "And they note that there was this other scenario suggested by at least me, and I can't remember if they said someone else did too."}, {"time": 8218, "text": "But they said, you know, we didn't include it because no developers were working on it."}, {"time": 8225, "text": "Full disclosure, that was the approach that I took in my research, right?"}, {"time": 8231, "text": "Which was to go to the developers and say, what's your vision, right?"}, {"time": 8234, "text": "What are you trying to develop?"}, {"time": 8237, "text": "That's what I was trying to do."}, {"time": 8239, "text": "And maybe, you know, and then I tried to think outside the box at the end by adding that one, right?"}, {"time": 8243, "text": "Like, here's one that I have, you know, people aren't talking about that could be cool."}, {"time": 8245, "text": "Now, again, it had been proposed in like 2014 for like fuel convoys."}, {"time": 8251, "text": "So you could just have like one super armored lead fuel truck, right?"}, {"time": 8255, "text": "In a, you know, bringing fuel to forward operating bases in Afghanistan."}, {"time": 8259, "text": "And then you wouldn't need, you know, the super heavy, you know, you wouldn't have to protect the human life in the following truck."}, {"time": 8264, "text": "You're saying like, when you talk to Waymo, when you talk to these kinds of companies, they weren't at least openly saying they're working on this."}, {"time": 8272, "text": "So then it doesn't make sense to include in the list."}, {"time": 8276, "text": "And so, but here's the thing, right?"}, {"time": 8278, "text": "This is the Department of Transportation, right?"}, {"time": 8281, "text": "And the Department of Labor."}, {"time": 8283, "text": "Maybe they could consider some scenarios."}, {"time": 8284, "text": "Like maybe we could say, you know, this, we, this technology has got a lot of potential."}, {"time": 8288, "text": "Here's what we'd like it to do."}, {"time": 8290, "text": "You know, we'd like it to reduce highway deaths, help us fight climate change, reduce congestion, you know, all these other, other things."}, {"time": 8296, "text": "But that's not how our policy conversation around technology is happening."}, {"time": 8300, "text": "We're not, and people don't think that we

behind or who makes sense."}, {"time": 9277, "text": "But I think one key component there, and this is what I see with Tesla often, and it's quite sad to me that other companies don't do this enough,

like redesign everything."}, {"time": 9337, "text": "Let's infrastructure, let's have special lanes or in terms of truck ports, as opposed to having regular human control truck ports, have some kind

solve it?"}, {"time": 9380, "text": "And then teleoperation, like, okay, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 9383, "text": "It's difficult to have good signal, but can we actually, can we have, can we consider the probability of those edge cases and what to do in the edge cases when the teleoperation fails?"}, {"time": 9394, "text": "Like how difficult is this?"}, {"time": 9395, "text": "What are the costs?"}, {"time": 9396, "text": "How do we actually construct a teleoperation center full of humans that are able to pay attention to a large fleet where the average number of vehicles per human is

as much money."}, {"time": 9420, "text": "Can we have a cheaper, can we give less salary to the trucker?"}, {"time": 9424, "text": "And can we build like decrease the cost or decrease the frequency at which we buy new trucks?"}, {"time": 9434, "text": "And when we do buy new trucks, make them cheaper by making them crappier, like this kind of discussion."}, {"time": 9440, "text": "This is why, to me, it's like Tesla is like rare on this."}, {"time": 9443, "text": "And there's some sectors in which innovation is part of the culture."}, {"time": 9447, "text": "In the automotive sector, for some reason, it's not as much."}, {"time": 9451, "text": "This is obviously the problem that Ford and GM are struggling with."}, {"time": 9454, "text": "It's like, they're really good at making cars at

to sort of embrace, but greatness requires that they embrace this, embrace whatever is required to remove the inefficiencies in the system."}, {"time": 9484, "text": "And that may require you to do things very differently than you've done in the past."}, {"time": 9489, "text": "Yeah, I mean, there are certain things that the market can do well."}, {"time": 9493, "text": "And this is how I see the world, right?"}, {"time": 9497, "text": "That's the best way to organize certain kinds of activities is the market and private interest."}, {"time": 9504, "text": "But I think we go too far in
