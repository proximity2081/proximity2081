some reason, for me, that was a motivation to see, can we discover, can we incentivize them to find like a better path in life?"}, {"time": 409, "text": "Like I wasn't like all like, I don't know, Gandhi about it."}, {"time": 413, "text": "Of course I was pissed and all those kinds of things, but I don't know, it seemed like just the kind of thing you might do when you're younger."}, {"time":

then you're beyond saving at some point, but it's like, there's always, there's always an opportunity to make a better life for yourself, to become a better version of yourself."}, {"time": 442, "text": "Yeah, and I remember coming home crying with no bike and my mom, my parents are like liberal to a fault."}, {"time": 449, "text": "You know, where they were like, oh, well they need it."}, {"time": 451, "text": "They're poor kids in the neighborhood."}, {"time": 453, "text": "And you're like, all right, but I also like have a bicycle that I ride around, you know, and I also like to live in an area that's not just, you know, riddled with theft and vandalism, but they were just like, oh, they need it."}, {"time": 465, "text": "And then it was a moot point, we just moved on."}, {"time": 468, "text": "So I remember very young being like, all right, I gotta figure my shit out."}, {"time": 473, "text": "Okay, so you said you were beat up quite a bit, like bullying and stuff."}, {"time": 477, "text": "Pushed around, I was never hospitalized or anything, but you know, you get a black guy here and there and a bloody nose, stuff like that."}, {"time": 484, "text": "And it was just the outnumbered thing."}, {"time": 485, "text": "The violence didn't really bother me because you're just kids, you're boys."}, {"time": 490, "text": "But it was the predatory, let's get him."}, {"time": 494, "text": "You know, we can take him down."}, {"time": 495, "text": "He's, you know, he's an easy target."}, {"time": 497, "text": "That's what kills you, the mental part."}, {"time": 502, "text": "Yeah, you know, until you actually said I didn't realize, I've been in, what do you call them, scuffles."}, {"time": 508, "text": "And there was just one that stands out to me where, yeah."}, {"time": 512, "text": "Let's hear it, Faddy, bring it on."}, {"time": 514, "text": "And you do jujitsu and all that stuff, right?"}, {"time": 516, "text": "Yeah, I can see the guns through the suit, you're like John Wick."}, {"time": 520, "text": "All right, well, I used to have, now you're gonna start making fun of me, I used to have long hair for like a couple of years."}, {"time": 526, "text": "I was in a band playing music and stuff like that."}, {"time": 528, "text": "And there was, like most of the fights I've been in were basically one on one, maybe a little bit like, a little extra stuff, but not outnumbered."}, {"time": 538, "text": "And this one particular time, I've learned a lot of lessons, but one of them was, there was a fight started between me and this other person."}, {"time": 548, "text": "And then his buddies, I guess, were there."}, {"time": 552, "text": "And they, as opposed to like breaking it up or letting it happen, one of them grabbed my hair."}, {"time": 559, "text": "It's the first time anybody grabbed, like used my hair in a fight, which I haven't since then realized that that's actually a really powerful grip and a powerful weapon."}, {"time": 567, "text": "Oh, very vulnerable of you."}, {"time": 569, "text": "And then my head got pulled back and they pulled me down to the ground."}, {"time": 572, "text": "Like I couldn't do anything, it was so, I remember being exceptionally frustrated."}, {"time": 577, "text": "That was the feeling like, I can't do anything here."}, {"time": 580, "text": "I'm like trapped."}, {"time": 582, "text": "And then they were just like kicking me and hitting me and stuff like that."}, {"time": 585, "text": "And the outnumbered part of it, because I always kind of remember the trapped part because I just hated from a fighting grappling perspective, how like, the feeling was this isn't fair."}, {"time": 598, "text": "Yes, that's what it is."}, {"time": 599, "text": "It's a deep, deep unfairness that you just can't win."}, {"time": 604, "text": "The mob wins."}, {"time": 605, "text": "Yeah, the mob wins."}, {"time": 606, "text": "Scary stuff."}, {"time": 607, "text": "But it makes a man out of you in a weird way that builds character, you realize life isn't fair early and you go on from there."}, {"time": 615, "text": "And look at you today."}, {"time": 616, "text": "They're probably eating out of a dumpster at a Krispy Kreme and you're here, got eight podcasts, you're doing great, talking to giant titans of the industry."}, {"time": 626, "text": "No, I do remember returning home that night."}, {"time": 629, "text": "I mean that you said you were crying."}, {"time": 631, "text": "That's really formative."}, {"time": 633, "text": "Like that's the point in which you get to decide what do I make of this moment?"}, {"time": 637, "text": "I mean, especially when you're younger, maybe it's not presented to you that way, but like some of the greatest people in history were bullied in these kinds of ways."}, {"time": 647, "text": "And they made something of themselves in this moment, like bullied by life in some kind of way."}, {"time": 651, "text": "It's like an opportunity for growth."}, {"time": 653, "text": "It's weird, but like hardship even in small doses is like an opportunity for growth."}, {"time": 660, "text": "Totally, I mean, look at Richard Pryor."}, {"time": 661, "text": "They say he's labeled as the best comedian of all time."}, {"time": 663, "text": "Grew up in a whorehouse, watch his mom get plowed by these guys in the middle of Indiana, I wanna say."}, {"time": 670, "text": "And just who had a harder life?"}, {"time": 672, "text": "He would suck dick for drugs, all this stuff growing up, beat up."}, {"time": 677, "text": "And then the weird thing is, oops, sorry, that's my birth control alarm."}, {"time": 682, "text": "And then the whole world is like trying to get rid of bullying, but we still do bullying, but now it's accepted bullying."}, {"time": 688, "text": "It's very strange."}, {"time": 689, "text": "So you're a proponent of beating kids up, is that what you're saying?"}, {"time": 693, "text": "Yes, and sex with them."}, {"time": 696, "text": "But no, I just think it's part of life and it's horrible, it's like rain, you gotta have it."}, {"time": 703, "text": "Look, a rainy day is a bummer, but you need it."}, {"time": 705, "text": "And I think it's similar to that."}, {"time": 709, "text": "What was your relationship like with your mom, your dad?"}, {"time": 713, "text": "What are some memorable moments with them?"}, {"time": 716, "text": "Good parents, they're giving, thoughtful."}, {"time": 721, "text": "A little out to lunch, they were workaholics, so it was hard to get a lot out of them."}, {"time": 728, "text": "And my dad was kind of an angry dad."}, {"time": 730, "text": "I think he just had like a weird childhood and he's just trying to make it and he's trying to provide, but it's hard."}, {"time": 736, "text": "And we live in this horrible neighborhood and we're getting robbed all the time."}, {"time": 742, "text": "So life was kind of coming down on him all the time."}, {"time": 744, "text": "So then he'll take it out on you or whoever, he would snap."}, {"time": 747, "text": "But great parents, they cared, they put us first, but there wasn't a lot of, you ever go to a friend's house as a kid and there's like a picture of a ski trip and you're like, ski trip?"}, {"time": 762, "text": "It wasn't a lot of that and smart, very smart people, but I don't know how well they were at socializing."}, {"time": 769, "text": "So you never like bonded with them like on a deep human level?"}, {"time": 773, "text": "Some bonding, but rarely deep."}, {"time": 774, "text": "Yeah, it was just almost coworker."}, {"time": 777, "text": "Hey, cold out, huh?"}, {"time": 780, "text": "It's cold out, huh?"}, {"time": 781, "text": "Oh yeah, like that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 783, "text": "Yeah, yeah, I got you."}, {"time": 783, "text": "Get there a little bit, but my parents are done."}, {"time": 786, "text": "I hope they never saw this, but they would do a thing where my dad especially would do a thing where he would, he knew how to cut you down right to the bone and so after a while you're like, I'm not even gonna interact with this guy because he can get you so well."}, {"time": 799, "text": "One time we were at like a Thanksgiving, some kind of family event and all the cousins are there and I remember I was holding court."}, {"time": 806, "text": "I was a young boy finding my comedic legs in this weird tumultuous sea we call a family and I was killing and my dad comes out and he goes, what are you holding court?"}, {"time": 819, "text": "And I was like, ah, and I felt like I was this big."}, {"time": 822, "text": "I just whoo, shrunk down."}, {"time": 824, "text": "He just nailed it because in my head I'm like, I'm holding court, look at me, I got the whole room and he goes, what are you, what are you holding court here?"}, {"time": 829, "text": "And I'm like, who the hell do you think you are?"}, {"time": 831, "text": "And I was like, he's right, I shouldn't be holding court, who the fuck am I, I'm nobody."}, {"time": 835, "text": "So stuff like that."}, {"time": 837, "text": "Was he aware of that you think?"}, {"time": 838, "text": "He wasn't, he wasn't, I don't think he was, but."}, {"time": 841, "text": "Do you give parents a pass when they're unaware of the destructive, like is it better when they're unaware?"}, {"time": 849, "text": "Because it seems like that's the way."}, {"time": 852, "text": "That's the way parents often fail is they're not intentionally malevolent, they're just like clueless."}, {"time": 860, "text": "Yeah, it's a bittersweet thing because you're like, well, okay, he's not malicious, he's not trying to hurt me, but also he doesn't know he hurt me."}, {"time": 869, "text": "I don't know, it's tough because if he was trying to hurt you, I guess that would be worse."}, {"time": 875, "text": "So you're the fully baked Mark Norman cake at this point Yeah, it's a shitty cake."}, {"time": 883, "text": "Fruit salad."}, {"time": 885, "text": "You know, the sense of self worth you mentioned."}, {"time": 889, "text": "I think in your comedy, there's a sense like you hate yourself."}, {"time": 892, "text": "You think?"}, {"time": 894, "text": "I didn't know if that came through."}, {"time": 895, "text": "Shit, I was trying to hide that part."}, {"time": 898, "text": "I mean, when you like in the privacy of your own mind, are you able to love yourself or is it mostly self hate?"}, {"time": 907, "text": "Jeez, what happened to this podcast?"}, {"time": 909, "text": "I didn't know I was on Dr. Phil."}, {"time": 911, "text": "Dr. Phil."}, {"time": 911, "text": "I thought we were gonna talk about engineering and climate change and rockets."}, {"time": 918, "text": "Starts with love, goes to rockets."}, {"time": 920, "text": "All right, I like that."}, {"time": 921, "text": "I like that's a t shirt."}, {"time": 925, "text": "What's the question?"}, {"time": 927, "text": "Do I feel love?"}, {"time": 929, "text": "No, no, like."}, {"time": 929, "text": "Do I love myself?"}, {"time": 931, "text": "Yeah, yeah, so are you like this engine of being self critical of just being constantly anxious about how the world perceives you, these kinds of things?"}, {"time": 943, "text": "Is this something that you just go to for comedy or is this who you are as a human being?"}, {"time": 950, "text": "I think I don't wanna explore it."}, {"time": 952, "text": "I think I get around it."}, {"time": 954, "text": "You know, I tap dance around it, but I get it out a little with my act maybe, because I can't do it."}, {"time": 959, "text": "I'm not doing it in real life."}, {"time": 960, "text": "So I'll get out this no love, not loving myself."}, {"time": 964, "text": "I don't know who wants to love themself."}, {"time": 966, "text": "Everybody always like you gotta love yourself."}, {"time": 967, "text": "And then when you meet somebody who does love yourself, you're like, I fucking hate this guy."}, {"time": 971, "text": "Don't you hate the guy who's upset?"}, {"time": 972, "text": "I'm great, I'm awesome."}, {"time": 974, "text": "Life is good."}, {"time": 975, "text": "You're like, ah, this guy sucks."}, {"time": 977, "text": "I'd rather an insecure guy."}, {"time": 978, "text": "So maybe I wanna stay insecure."}, {"time": 980, "text": "Maybe I don't wanna find this love for myself."}, {"time": 983, "text": "So self love, like just appreciating who you are, or like appreciating the moment of being grateful doesn't have to express itself by the guy saying I'm awesome."}, {"time": 995, "text": "It's more just like humility."}, {"time": 996, "text": "It's just like walking calmly through the world and just being grateful to be alive, that kind of thing."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "And like, oh, being appreciative of all the accomplishments you've made so far."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "I say all this because mostly I'm extremely self critical in everything I do."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "And so, and I kind of enjoy it."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "I think it's a nice little engine that it makes it fun."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "It makes life fun, because it's like if you hate everything you do, like you've done in the past, that gives you like, all right, we can do better."}, {"time": 1026, "text": "Yes, but that's the key is making yourself critical."}, {"time": 1029, "text": "Always trying to get better."}, {"time": 1030, "text": "I could change this, I could tweak this, I could improve this."}, {"time": 1033, "text": "When you just go, I hate that I do this, I suck, you just shut down."}, {"time": 1036, "text": "So that's the key is always being productive with the criticism."}, {"time": 1041, "text": "Yeah, and the basics of life, I'm just like grateful for it, to be alive."}, {"time": 1044, "text": "That's nice to be coupled that with self criticism."}, {"time": 1047, "text": "Two legs, again, the hairline, the hog, the muscles, the world."}, {"time": 1052, "text": "You got a good brain on you."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "I mean, you're lucky."}, {"time": 1055, "text": "You're in the top, most people are fat as shit at Burger King right now, hitting their kids."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "You're in a Ramada hotel, sitting with a low level comedian."}, {"time": 1067, "text": "For the record, I ate McDonald's last night."}, {"time": 1069, "text": "Oh, all right, well, you're human."}, {"time": 1072, "text": "Well, just so you know, this is not me defending, I'm not sponsored by McDonald's, but I mostly eat meat, and there's nothing wrong with the beef they have."}, {"time": 1081, "text": "It's actually one of the easiest ways late at night."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "I think it's worse."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "I don't know if it's actually cow."}, {"time": 1087, "text": "It's actually rats."}, {"time": 1089, "text": "But hey, it's just meat."}, {"time": 1090, "text": "I'm a meat guy myself."}, {"time": 1092, "text": "They say in 20 years, we're gonna look back and go, can you believe people ate meat?"}, {"time": 1096, "text": "It's gonna look like somebody like slavery."}, {"time": 1098, "text": "Yeah, there's some ethical, difficult things with factory farming."}, {"time": 1102, "text": "Yeah, so let's ride it out now while we still got it."}, {"time": 1106, "text": "And now it's on record."}, {"time": 1108, "text": "Tom Waits says something about New York."}, {"time": 1111, "text": "You like Tom Waits?"}, {"time": 1112, "text": "I think he's underrated."}, {"time": 1113, "text": "I think he's got great, he's got a great, he's great at quips and quotes."}, {"time": 1118, "text": "Check him out on YouTube."}, {"time": 1119, "text": "He's got some montages and super cuts of him being hilarious."}, {"time": 1123, "text": "What does he say about, I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy."}, {"time": 1130, "text": "That was the one."}, {"time": 1131, "text": "That was the one that sold me."}, {"time": 1132, "text": "I was like, this guy's awesome."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "Yeah, but his music, cause he's just a genius musician."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "Anyway, he was talking about New York."}, {"time": 1139, "text": "I was walking around, I'm in New York right now."}, {"time": 1141, "text": "We're in New York right now."}, {"time": 1143, "text": "It's still a magical city to me."}, {"time": 1144, "text": "A lot of people are quite cynical about it, about the state of things, but."}, {"time": 1148, "text": "Go again."}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Not like Michael Malice, like a lot of friends of mine, they're just a lot of folks in San Francisco and New York, there's something about the pandemic where people have become quite cynical about the place they are and they try to escape."}, {"time": 1162, "text": "I mean, they're asking some difficult questions about

yourself in front of others for prolonged periods of time."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "Yeah, so I've done that without actually developing the funny."}, {"time": 2723, "text": "But maybe the funny just is not that difficult to develop."}, {"time": 2728, "text": "No, it's super difficult, of course, but I mean, maybe the essential work of a standup comedian is just the embarrassment of like finding who you are."}, {"time": 2736, "text": "Yeah, that's a part of it for sure."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "You know, in the beginning you're like, water bottle, what's funny about water bottle?"},
