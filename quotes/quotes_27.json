That's interesting, just to pause on that for a second."}, {"time": 369, "text": "It's interesting that you're connecting programming languages to the ease of management of data."}, {"time": 378, "text": "So in your use of programming languages, you always had a love and a connection with data."}, {"time": 384, "text": "I've always been interested in doing useful things for myself and for others, which generally means getting some data and doing something with it and putting it out there again."}, {"time": 394, "text": "So that's been my interest throughout."}, {"time": 398, "text": "So I also did a lot of stuff with AppleScript back in the early days."}, {"time": 403, "text": "So it's kind of nice being able to get the computer and computers to talk to each other and to do things for you."}, {"time": 412, "text": "And then I think that one, the programming language I most loved then would have been Delphi, which was Object Pascal, created by Anders Heilsberg, who previously did Turbo Pascal and then went on to create.NET and then went on to create TypeScript."}, {"time": 431, "text": "Delphi was amazing because it was like a compiled, fast language that was as easy to use as Visual Basic."}, {"time": 440, "text": "Delphi, what is it similar to in more modern languages?"}, {"time": 447, "text": "Visual Basic."}, {"time": 449, "text": "Yeah, but a compiled, fast version."}, {"time": 452, "text": "So I'm not sure there's anything quite like it anymore."}, {"time": 457, "text": "If you took like C Sharp or Java and got rid of the virtual machine and replaced it with something, you could compile a small type binary."}, {"time": 466, "text": "I feel like it's where Swift could get to with the new Swift UI and the cross platform development going on."}, {"time": 476, "text": "Like that's one of my dreams is that we'll hopefully get back to where Delphi was."}, {"time": 482, "text": "There is actually a free Pascal project nowadays called Lazarus, which is also attempting to kind of recreate Delphi."}, {"time": 493, "text": "So they're making good progress."}, {"time": 496, "text": "So, okay, Delphi, that's one of your favorite programming languages."}, {"time": 500, "text": "Well, it's programming environments."}, {"time": 502, "text": "Again, I'd say Pascal's not a nice language."}, {"time": 506, "text": "If you wanted to know specifically about what languages I like, I would definitely pick J as being an amazingly wonderful language."}, {"time": 515, "text": "What's J?"}, {"time": 517, "text": "J, are you aware of APL?"}, {"time": 519, "text": "I am not, except from doing a little research on the work you've done."}, {"time": 524, "text": "Okay, so not at all surprising you're not familiar with it because it's not well known, but it's actually one of the main families of programming languages going back to the late 50s, early 60s."}, {"time": 537, "text": "So there was a couple of major directions."}, {"time": 541, "text": "One was the kind of Lambda Calculus Alonzo Church direction, which I guess kind of lisp and scheme and whatever, which has a history going back to the early days of computing."}, {"time": 553, "text": "The second was the kind of imperative slash OO, algo similar going on to C, C++ and so forth."}, {"time": 563, "text": "There was a third, which are called array oriented languages, which started with a paper by a guy called Ken Iverson, which was actually a math theory paper, not a programming paper."}, {"time": 577, "text": "It was called Notation as a Tool for Thought."}, {"time": 581, "text": "And it was the development of a new way, a new type of math notation."}, {"time": 585, "text": "And the idea is that this math notation was much more flexible, expressive, and also well defined than traditional math notation, which is none of those things."}, {"time": 596, "text": "Math notation is awful."}, {"time": 599, "text": "And so he actually turned that into a programming language and cause this was the early 50s or the sorry, late 50s, all the names were available."}, {"time": 606, "text": "So he called his language a programming language or APL."}, {"time": 610, "text": "APL."}, {"time": 611, "text": "So APL is a implementation of notation as a tool for thought by which he means math notation."}, {"time": 618, "text": "And Ken and his son went on to do many things, but eventually they actually produced a new language that was built on top of all the learnings of APL."}, {"time": 628, "text": "And that was called J."}, {"time": 630, "text": "And J is the most expressive, composable language of beautifully designed language I've ever seen."}, {"time": 642, "text": "Does it have object oriented components?"}, {"time": 644, "text": "Does it have that kind of thing?"}, {"time": 645, "text": "Not really, it's an array oriented language."}, {"time": 647, "text": "It's the third path."}, {"time": 651, "text": "Are you saying array?"}, {"time": 652, "text": "Array oriented, yeah."}, {"time": 653, "text": "What does it mean to be array oriented?"}, {"time": 655, "text": "So array oriented means that you generally don't use any loops, but the whole thing is done with kind of a extreme version of broadcasting, if you're familiar with that NumPy slash Python concept."}, {"time": 669, "text": "So you do a lot with one line of code."}, {"time": 674, "text": "It looks a lot like math notation, highly compact."}, {"time": 679, "text": "And the idea is that you can kind of, because you can do so much with one line of code, a single screen of code is very unlikely to, you very rarely need more than that to express your program."}, {"time": 691, "text": "And so you can kind of keep it all in your head and you can kind of clearly communicate it."}, {"time": 696, "text": "It's interesting that APL created two main branches, K and J. J is this kind of like open source, niche community of crazy enthusiasts like me."}, {"time": 709, "text": "And then the other path, K, was fascinating."}, {"time": 712, "text": "It's an astonishingly expensive programming language, which many of the world's most ludicrously rich hedge funds use."}, {"time": 722, "text": "So the entire K machine is so small it sits inside level three cache on your CPU."}, {"time": 729, "text": "And it easily wins every benchmark I've ever seen in terms of data processing speed."}, {"time": 736, "text": "But you don't come across it very much because it's like $100,000 per CPU to run it."}, {"time": 742, "text": "It's like this path of programming languages is just so much, I don't know, so much more powerful in every way than the ones that almost anybody uses every day."}, {"time": 753, "text": "So it's all about computation."}, {"time": 757, "text": "It's really focused on computation."}, {"time": 758, "text": "It's pretty heavily focused on computation."}, {"time": 760, "text": "I mean, so much of programming is data processing by definition."}, {"time": 765, "text": "So there's a lot of things you can do with it."}, {"time": 768, "text": "But yeah, there's not much work being done on making like user interface toolkits or whatever."}, {"time": 777, "text": "I mean, there's some, but they're not great."}, {"time": 779, "text": "At the same time, you've done a lot of stuff with Perl and Python."}, {"time": 783, "text": "So where does that fit into the picture of J and K and APL?"}, {"time": 788, "text": "Well, it's just much more pragmatic."}, {"time": 791, "text": "Like in the end, you kind of have to end up where the libraries are, you know?"}, {"time": 797, "text": "Like, cause to me, my focus is on productivity."}, {"time": 801, "text": "I just want to get stuff done and solve problems."}, {"time": 803, "text": "So Perl was great."}, {"time": 807, "text": "I created an email company called FastMail and Perl was great cause back in the late nineties, early two thousands, it just had a lot of stuff it could do."}, {"time": 818, "text": "I still had to write my own monitoring system and my own web framework, my own whatever, cause like none of that stuff existed."}, {"time": 825, "text": "But it was a super flexible language to do that in."}, {"time": 830, "text": "And you used Perl for FastMail, you used it as a backend?"}, {"time": 834, "text": "Like so everything was written in Perl?"}, {"time": 835, "text": "Yeah, yeah, everything, everything was Perl."}, {"time": 838, "text": "Why do you think Perl hasn't succeeded or hasn't dominated the market where Python really takes over a lot of the tasks?"}, {"time": 847, "text": "Well, I mean, Perl did dominate."}, {"time": 849, "text": "It was everything, everywhere, but then the guy that ran Perl, Larry Wohl, kind of just didn't put the time in anymore."}, {"time": 862, "text": "And no project can be successful if there isn't, you know, particularly one that started with a strong leader that loses that strong leadership."}, {"time": 875, "text": "So then Python has kind of replaced it."}, {"time": 877, "text": "You know, Python is a lot less elegant language in nearly every way, but it has the data science libraries and a lot of them are pretty great."}, {"time": 891, "text": "So I kind of use it cause it's the best we have, but it's definitely not good enough."}, {"time": 901, "text": "But what do you think the future of programming looks like?"}, {"time": 904, "text": "What do you hope the future of programming looks like if we zoom in on the computational fields, on data science, on machine learning?"}, {"time": 911, "text": "I hope Swift is successful because the goal of Swift, the way Chris Latner describes it, is to be infinitely hackable."}, {"time": 922, "text": "And that's what I want."}, {"time": 923, "text": "I want something where me and the people I do research with and my students can look at and change everything from top to bottom."}, {"time": 932, "text": "There's nothing mysterious and magical and inaccessible."}, {"time": 936, "text": "Unfortunately with Python, it's the opposite of that because Python is so slow."}, {"time": 940, "text": "It's extremely unhackable."}, {"time": 942, "text": "You get to a point where it's like, okay, from here on down at C. So your debugger doesn't work in the same way."}, {"time": 947, "text": "Your profiler doesn't work in the same way."}, {"time": 948, "text": "Your build system doesn't work in the same way."}, {"time": 950, "text": "It's really not very hackable at all."}, {"time": 953, "text": "What's the part you like to be hackable?"}, {"time": 955, "text": "Is it for the objective of optimizing training of neural networks, inference of neural networks?"}, {"time": 962, "text": "Is it performance of the system or is there some non performance related, just?"}, {"time": 969, "text": "I mean, in the end, I want to be productive as a practitioner."}, {"time": 973, "text": "So that means that, so like at the moment, our understanding of deep learning is incredibly primitive."}, {"time": 980, "text": "There's very little we understand."}, {"time": 981, "text": "Most things don't work very well, even though it works better than anything else out there."}, {"time": 986, "text": "There's so many opportunities to make it better."}, {"time": 988, "text": "So you look at any domain area, like, I don't know, speech recognition with deep learning or natural language processing classification with deep learning or whatever."}, {"time": 999, "text": "Every time I look at an area with deep learning, I always see like, oh, it's terrible."}, {"time": 1004, "text": "There's lots and lots of obviously stupid ways to do things that need to be fixed."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "So then I want to be able to jump in there and quickly experiment and make them better."}, {"time": 1014, "text": "You think the programming language has a role in that?"}, {"time": 1019, "text": "Huge role, yeah."}, {"time": 1020, "text": "So currently, Python has a big gap in terms of our ability to innovate, particularly around recurrent neural networks and natural language processing."}, {"time": 1034, "text": "Because it's so slow, the actual loop where we actually loop through words, we have to do that whole thing in CUDA C. So we actually can't innovate with the kernel, the heart of that most important algorithm."}, {"time": 1051, "text": "And it's just a huge problem."}, {"time": 1053, "text": "And this happens all over the place."}, {"time": 1056, "text": "So we hit research limitations."}, {"time": 1060, "text": "Another example, convolutional neural networks, which are actually the most popular architecture for lots of things, maybe most things in deep learning."}, {"time": 1068, "text": "We almost certainly should be using sparse convolutional neural networks, but only like two people are, because to do it, you have to rewrite all of that CUDA C level stuff."}, {"time": 1079, "text": "And yeah, just researchers and practitioners don't."}, {"time": 1084, "text": "So there's just big gaps in what people actually research on, what people actually implement because of the programming language problem."}, {"time": 1093, "text": "So you think it's just too difficult to write in CUDA C that a higher level programming language like Swift should enable the easier, fooling around creative stuff with RNNs or with sparse convolutional neural networks?"}, {"time": 1115, "text": "Who's at fault?"}, {"time": 1117, "text": "Who's at charge of making it easy for a researcher to play around?"}, {"time": 1122, "text": "I mean, no one's at fault, just nobody's got around to it yet, or it's just, it's hard, right?"}, {"time": 1126, "text": "And I mean, part of the fault is that we ignored that whole APL kind of direction."}, {"time": 1133, "text": "Nearly everybody did for 60 years, 50 years."}, {"time": 1137, "text": "But recently people have been starting to reinvent pieces of that and kind of create some interesting new directions in the compiler technology."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "So the place where that's particularly happening right now is something called MLIR, which is something that, again, Chris Latina, the Swift guy, is leading."}, {"time": 1158, "text": "And yeah, because it's actually not gonna be Swift on its own that solves this problem, because the problem is that currently writing a acceptably fast, you know, GPU program is too complicated regardless of what language you use."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "And that's just because if you have to deal with the fact that I've got, you know, 10,000 threads and I have to synchronize between them all and I have to put my thing into grid blocks and think about warps and all this stuff, it's just so much boilerplate that to do that well, you have to be a specialist at that and it's gonna be a year's work to, you know, optimize that algorithm in that way."}, {"time": 1199, "text": "But with things like tensor comprehensions and TILE and MLIR and TVM, there's all these various projects which are all about saying, let's let people create like domain specific languages for tensor computations."}, {"time": 1216, "text": "These are the kinds of things we do generally on the GPU for deep learning and then have a compiler which can optimize that tensor computation."}, {"time": 1228, "text": "A lot of this work is actually sitting on top of a project called Halide, which is a mind blowing project where they came up with such a domain specific language."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "In fact, two, one domain specific language for expressing this is what my tensor computation is and another domain specific language for expressing this is the kind of the way I want you to structure the compilation of that and like do it block by block and do these bits in parallel."}, {"time": 1254, "text": "And they were able to show how you can compress the amount of code by 10X compared to optimized GPU code and get the same performance."}, {"time": 1265, "text": "So that's like, so these other things are kind of sitting on top of that kind of research and MLIR is pulling a lot of those best practices together."}, {"time": 1275, "text": "And now we're starting to see work done on making all of that directly accessible through Swift so that I could use Swift to kind of write those domain specific languages and hopefully we'll get then Swift CUDA kernels written in a very expressive and concise way that looks a bit like J and APL and then Swift layers on top of that and then a Swift UI on top of that."}, {"time": 1298, "text": "And it'll be so nice if we can get to that point."}, {"time": 1302, "text": "Now does it all eventually boil down to CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs?"}, {"time": 1308, "text": "Unfortunately at the moment it does, but one of the nice things about MLIR if AMD ever gets their act together which they probably won't is that they or others could write MLIR backends for other GPUs or rather tensor computation devices of which today there are increasing number like Graph Core or Vertex AI or whatever."}, {"time": 1338, "text": "So yeah, being able to target lots of backends would be another benefit of this and the market really needs competition because at the moment NVIDIA is massively overcharging for their kind of enterprise class cards because there is no serious competition because nobody else is doing the software properly."}, {"time": 1359, "text": "In the cloud there is some competition, right?"}, {"time": 1361, "text": "But... Not really, other than TPUs perhaps, but TPUs are almost unprogrammable at the moment."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "So TPUs have the same problem that you can't?"}, {"time": 1371, "text": "It's even worse."}, {"time": 1372, "text": "So TPUs, Google actually made an explicit decision to make them almost entirely unprogrammable because they felt that there was too much IP in there and if they gave people direct access to program them, people would learn their secrets."}, {"time": 1384, "text": "So you can't actually directly program the memory in a TPU."}, {"time": 1391, "text": "You can't even directly create code that runs on and that you look at on the machine that has the TPU, it all goes through a virtual machine."}, {"time": 1399, "text": "So all you can really do is this kind of cookie cutter thing of like plug in high level stuff together, which is just super tedious and annoying and totally unnecessary."}, {"time": 1412, "text": "So what was the, tell me if you could, the origin story of fast AI."}, {"time": 1418, "text": "What is the motivation, its mission, its dream?"}, {"time": 1423, "text": "So I guess the founding story is heavily tied to my previous startup, which is a company called Analytic, which was the first company to focus on deep learning for medicine and I created that because I saw that was a huge opportunity to, there's about a 10X shortage of the number of doctors in the world, in the developing world that we need."}, {"time": 1448, "text": "I expected it would take about 300 years to train enough doctors to meet that gap."}, {"time": 1453, "text": "But I guess that maybe if we used deep learning for some of the analytics, we could maybe make it so you don't need as highly trained doctors."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "For diagnosis."}, {"time": 1466, "text": "For diagnosis and treatment planning."}, {"time": 1467, "text": "Where's the biggest benefit just before we get to fast AI, where's the biggest benefit of AI and medicine that you see today?"}, {"time": 1476, "text": "And maybe next time."}, {"time": 1477, "text": "Not much happening today in terms of like stuff that's actually out there, it's very early."}, {"time": 1525, "text": "So for example, in Africa, outside of South Africa, there's only five pediatric radiologists for the entire continent."}, {"time": 1532, "text": "So most countries don't have any."}, {"time": 1534, "text": "So if your kid is sick and they need something diagnosed through medical imaging, the person, even if you're able to get medical imaging done, the person that looks at it will be a nurse at best."}, {"time": 1546, "text": "But actually in India, for example, and China, almost no x rays are read by anybody, by any trained professional because they don't have enough."}, {"time": 1557, "text": "So if instead we had a algorithm that could take the most likely high risk 5% and say triage, basically say, okay, someone needs to look at this, it would massively change the kind of way that what's possible with medicine in the developing world."}, {"time": 1578, "text": "And remember, they have, increasingly they have money."}, {"time": 1581, "text": "They're the developing world, they're not the poor world, they're the developing world."}, {"time": 1584, "text": "So they have the money."}, {"time": 1585, "text": "So they're building the hospitals, they're getting the diagnostic equipment, but there's no way for a very long time will they be able to have the expertise."}, {"time": 1597, "text": "Shortage of expertise, okay."}, {"time": 1598, "text": "And that's where the deep learning systems can step in and magnify the expertise they do have."}, {"time": 1606, "text": "So you do see, just to linger a little bit longer, the interaction, do you still see the human experts still at the core of these systems?"}, {"time": 1618, "text": "Is there something in medicine that could be automated almost completely?"}, {"time": 1621, "text": "I don't see the point of even thinking about that because we have such a shortage of people."}, {"time": 1626, "text": "Why would we want to find a way not to use them?"}, {"time": 1629, "text": "We have people, so the idea of like, even from an economic point of view, if you can make them 10X more productive, getting rid of the person, doesn't impact your unit economics at all."}, {"time": 1641, "text": "And it totally ignores the fact that there are things people do better than machines."}, {"time": 1646, "text": "So it's just to me, that's not a useful way of framing the problem."}, {"time": 1652, "text": "I guess, just to clarify, I guess I meant there may be some problems where you can avoid even going to the expert ever, sort of maybe preventative care or some basic stuff, allowing food, allowing the expert to focus on the things that are really that, you know."}, {"time": 1669, "text": "Well, that's what the triage would do, right?"}, {"time": 1670, "text": "So the triage would say, okay, there's 99% sure there's nothing here."}, {"time": 1678, "text": "So that can be done on device and they can just say, okay, go home."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "So the experts are being used to look at the stuff which has some chance it's worth looking at, which most things it's not, it's fine."}, {"time": 1694, "text": "Why do you think that is?"}, {"time": 1695, "text": "You know, it's fine."}, {"time": 1696, "text": "Why do you think we haven't quite made progress on that yet in terms of the scale of how much AI is applied in the medical field?"}, {"time": 1707, "text": "Oh, there's a lot of reasons."}, {"time": 1708, "text": "I mean, one is it's pretty new."}, {"time": 1709, "text": "I only started in Liddick in like 2014."}, {"time": 1712, "text": "And before that, it's hard to express to what degree the medical world was not aware of the opportunities here."}, {"time": 1720, "text": "So I went to RSNA, which is the world's largest radiology conference."}, {"time": 1726, "text": "And I told everybody I could, you know, like I'm doing this thing with deep learning, please come and check it out."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And no one had any idea what I was talking about and no one had any interest in it."}, {"time": 1739, "text": "So like we've come from absolute zero, which is hard."}, {"time": 1745, "text": "And then the whole regulatory framework, education system, everything is just set up to think of doctoring in a very different way."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "So today there is a small number of people who are deep learning practitioners and doctors at the same time."}, {"time": 1763, "text": "And we're starting to see the first ones come out of their PhD programs."}, {"time": 1766, "text": "So Zach Kahane over in Boston, Cambridge has a number of students now who are data science experts, deep learning experts, and actual medical doctors."}, {"time": 1783, "text": "Quite a few doctors have completed our fast AI course now and are publishing papers and creating journal reading groups in the American Council of Radiology."}, {"time": 1795, "text": "And like, it's just starting to happen, but it's gonna be a long time coming."}, {"time": 1799, "text": "It's gonna happen, but it's gonna be a long process."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "The regulators have to learn how to regulate this."}, {"time": 1804, "text": "They have to build guidelines."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "And then the lawyers at hospitals have to develop a new way of understanding that sometimes it makes sense for data to be looked at in raw form in large quantities in order to create well changing results."}, {"time": 1827, "text": "Yeah, so the regulation around data, all that, it sounds probably the hardest problem, but sounds reminiscent of autonomous vehicles as well."}, {"time": 1836, "text": "Many of the same regulatory challenges, many of the same data challenges."}, {"time": 1840, "text": "Yeah, I mean, funnily enough, the problem is less the regulation and more the interpretation of that regulation by lawyers in hospitals."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "So HIPAA is actually, was designed to pay, and HIPAA does not stand for privacy."}, {"time": 1856, "text": "It stands for portability."}, {"time": 1857, "text": "It's actually meant to be a way that data can be used."}, {"time": 1861, "text": "And it was created with lots of gray areas because the idea is that would be more practical and it would help people to use this legislation to actually share data in a more thoughtful way."}, {"time": 1873, "text": "Unfortunately, it's done the opposite because when a lawyer sees a gray area, they say, oh, if we don't know, we won't get sued, then we can't do it."}, {"time": 1882, "text": "So HIPAA is not exactly the problem."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "The problem is more that there's, hospital lawyers are not incented to make bold decisions about data portability."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "Or even to embrace technology that saves lives."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "They more want to not get in trouble for embracing that technology."}, {"time": 1904, "text": "It also saves lives in a very abstract way, which is like, oh, we've been able to release these 100,000 anonymized records."}, {"time": 1912, "text": "I can't point to the specific person whose life that saved."}, {"time": 1915, "text": "I can say like, oh, we ended up with this paper which found this result, which diagnosed a thousand more people than we would have otherwise, but it's like, which ones were helped?"},

1945, "text": "Just a fascinating topic."}, {"time": 1947, "text": "We're jumping around."}, {"time": 1948, "text": "We'll get back to fast AI, but on the question of privacy, data is the fuel for so much innovation in deep learning."}, {"time": 1958, "text": "What's your sense on privacy?"}, {"time": 1959, "text": "Whether we're talking about Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, just the technologies like in the medical field that rely on people's data in order to create impact."}, {"time": 1973, "text": "How do we get that right, respecting people's privacy and yet creating technology that is learning from data?"}, {"time": 1983, "text": "One of my areas of focus is on doing more with less data."}, {"time": 1988, "text": "More with less data, which, so most vendors, unfortunately, are strongly incented to find ways to require more data and more computation."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "So, Google and IBM being the most obvious."}, {"time": 2004, "text": "IBM."}, {"time": 2005, "text": "Yeah, so Watson."}, {"time": 2007, "text": "So, Google and IBM both strongly push the idea that you have to be, that they have more data and more computation and more intelligent people than anybody else."}, {"time": 2017, "text": "And so you have to trust them to do things because nobody else can do it."}, {"time": 2022, "text": "And Google's very upfront about this, like Jeff Dean has gone out there and given talks and said, our goal is to require a thousand times more computation, but less people."}, {"time": 2035, "text": "Our goal is to use the people that you have better and the data you have better and the computation you have better."}, {"time": 2043, "text": "So, one of the things that we've discovered is, or at least highlighted, is that you very, very, very often don't need much data at all."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And so the data you already have in your organization will be enough to get state of the art results."}, {"time": 2059, "text": "So, like my starting point would be to kind of say around privacy is a lot of people are looking for ways to share data and aggregate data, but I think often that's unnecessary."}, {"time": 2069, "text": "They assume that they need more data than they do because they're not familiar with the basics of transfer learning, which is this critical technique for needing orders of magnitude less data."}, {"time": 2082, "text": "Is your sense, one reason you might wanna collect data from everyone is like in the recommender system context, where your individual, Jeremy Howard's individual data is the most useful for providing a product that's impactful for you."}, {"time": 2099, "text": "So, for giving you advertisements, for recommending to you movies, for doing medical diagnosis, is your sense we can build with a small amount of data, general models that will have a huge impact for most people that we don't need to have data from each individual?"}, {"time": 2119, "text": "On the whole, I'd say yes."}, {"time": 2120, "text": "I mean, there are things like, you know, recommender systems have this cold start problem where, you know, Jeremy is a new customer, we haven't seen him before, so we can't recommend him things based on what else he's bought and liked with us."}, {"time": 2136, "text": "And there's various workarounds to that."}, {"time": 2138, "text": "Like in a lot of music programs, we'll start out by saying, which of these artists do you like?"}, {"time": 2144, "text": "Which of these albums do you like?"}, {"time": 2146, "text": "Which of these songs do you like?"}, {"time": 2149, "text":

you could work around that by having some kind of data sharing where you get my marketing record from Axiom or whatever, and try to guess from that."}, {"time": 2166, "text": "To me, the benefit to me and to society of saving me five minutes on answering some questions versus the negative externalities of the privacy issue doesn't add up."}, {"time": 2184, "text": "So, I think like a lot of the time, the places where people are invading our privacy in order to provide convenience is really about just trying to make them more money and they move these negative externalities to places that they don't have to pay for them."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "So, when you actually see regulations appear that actually cause the companies that create these negative externalities to have to pay for it themselves, they say, well, we can't do it anymore."}, {"time": 2216, "text": "So, the cost is actually too high."}, {"time": 2218, "text": "But for something like medicine, yeah, I mean, the hospital has my medical imaging, my pathology studies, my medical records, and also I own my medical data."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "So, you can, so I help a startup called Doc.ai."}, {"time": 2236, "text": "One of the things Doc.ai does is that it has an app."}, {"time": 2239, "text": "You can connect to, you know, Sutter Health and LabCorp and Walgreens and download your medical data to your phone and then upload it again at your discretion to share it as you wish."}, {"time": 2255, "text": "So, with that kind of approach, we can share our medical information with the people we want to."}, {"time": 2264, "text": "Yeah, so control."}, {"time": 2265, "text": "I mean, really being able to control who you share it with and so on."}, {"time": 2269, "text": "So, that has a beautiful, interesting tangent to return back to the origin story of Fast.ai."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "Right, so before I started Fast.ai, I spent a year researching where are the biggest opportunities for deep learning?"}, {"time": 2290, "text": "Because I knew from my time at Kaggle in particular that deep learning had kind of hit this threshold point where it was rapidly becoming the state of the art approach in every area that looked at it."}, {"time": 2301, "text": "And I'd been working with neural nets for over 20 years."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "I knew that from a theoretical point of view, once it hit that point, it would do that in kind of just about every domain."}, {"time": 2311, "text": "And so I kind of spent a year researching what are the domains that's gonna have the biggest low hanging fruit in the shortest time period."}, {"time": 2319, "text": "I picked medicine, but there were so many I could have picked."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "And so there was a kind of level of frustration for me of like, okay, I'm really glad we've opened up the medical deep learning world."}, {"time": 2331, "text": "And today it's huge, as you know, but we can't do, I can't do everything."}, {"time": 2338, "text": "I don't even know, like in medicine, it took me a really long time to even get a sense of like what kind of problems do medical practitioners solve?"}, {"time": 2345, "text": "What kind of data do they have?"}, {"time": 2346, "text": "Who has that data?"}, {"time": 2348, "text": "So I kind of felt like I need to approach this differently if I wanna maximize the positive impact of deep learning."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "Rather than me picking an area and trying to become good at it and building something, I should let people who are already domain experts in those areas and who already have the data do it themselves."}, {"time": 2369, "text": "So that was the reason for Fast.ai is to basically try and figure out how to get deep learning into the hands of people who could benefit from it and help them to do so in as quick and easy and effective a way as possible."}, {"time": 2387, "text": "Got it, so sort of empower the domain experts."}, {"time": 2390, "text": "Yeah, and like partly it's because like, unlike most people in this field, my background is very applied and industrial."}, {"time": 2399, "text": "Like my first job was at McKinsey & Company."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "I spent 10 years in management consulting."}, {"time": 2404, "text": "I spend a lot of time with domain experts."}, {"time": 2410, "text": "So I kind of respect them and appreciate them."}, {"time": 2412, "text": "And I know that's where the value generation in society is."}, {"time": 2416, "text": "And so I also know how most of them can't code and most of them don't have the time to invest three years in a graduate degree or whatever."}, {"time": 2429, "text": "So I was like, how do I upskill those domain experts?"}, {"time": 2433, "text": "I think that would be a super powerful thing, the biggest societal impact I could have."}, {"time": 2440, "text": "So yeah, that was the thinking."}, {"time": 2441, "text": "So much of Fast.ai students and researchers and the things you teach are pragmatically minded, practically minded, figuring out ways how to solve real problems and fast."}, {"time": 2455, "text": "So from your experience, what's the difference between theory and practice of deep learning?"}, {"time": 2463, "text": "Well, most of the research in the deep learning world is a total waste of time."}, {"time": 2469, "text": "Right, that's what I was getting at."}, {"time": 2472, "text": "It's a problem in science in general."}, {"time": 2476, "text": "Scientists need to be published, which means they need to work on things that their peers are extremely familiar with and can recognize in advance in that area."}, {"time": 2486, "text": "So that means that they all need to work on the same thing."}, {"time": 2490, "text": "And so it really, and the thing they work on, there's nothing to encourage them to work on things that are practically useful."}, {"time": 2498, "text": "So you get just a whole lot of research, which is minor advances and stuff that's been very highly studied and has no significant practical impact."}, {"time": 2509, "text": "Whereas the things that really make a difference, like I mentioned transfer learning, like if we can do better at transfer learning, then it's this like world changing thing where suddenly like lots more people can do world class work with less resources and less data."}, {"time": 2526, "text": "But almost nobody works on that."}, {"time": 2528, "text": "Or another example, active learning, which is the study of like, how do we get more out of the human beings in the loop?"}, {"time": 2535, "text": "That's my favorite topic."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "Yeah, so active learning is great, but it's almost nobody working on it because it's just not a trendy thing right now."}, {"time": 2543, "text": "You know what somebody, sorry to interrupt, you're saying that nobody is publishing on active learning, but there's people inside companies, anybody who actually has to solve a problem, they're going to innovate on active learning."}, {"time": 2559, "text": "Yeah, everybody kind of reinvents active learning when they actually have to work in practice because they start labeling things and they think, gosh, this is taking a long time and it's very expensive."}, {"time": 2569, "text": "And then they start thinking, well, why am I labeling everything?"}, {"time": 2572, "text": "I'm only, the machine's only making mistakes on those two classes."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "They're the hard ones."}, {"time": 2576, "text": "Maybe I'll just start labeling those two classes."}, {"time": 2578, "text": "And then you start thinking, well, why did I do that manually?"}, {"time": 2581, "text": "Why can't I just get the system to tell me which things are going to be hardest?"}, {"time": 2585, "text": "It's an obvious thing to do, but yeah, it's just like transfer learning."}, {"time": 2591, "text": "It's understudied and the academic world just has no reason to care about practical results."}, {"time": 2597, "text": "The funny thing is, like I've only really ever written one paper."}, {"time": 2599, "text": "I hate writing papers."}, {"time": 2601, "text": "And I didn't even write it."}, {"time": 2602, "text": "It was my colleague, Sebastian Ruder, who actually wrote it."}, {"time": 2605, "text": "I just did the research for it, but it was basically introducing transfer learning, successful transfer learning to NLP for the first time."}, {"time": 2614, "text": "The algorithm is called ULM fit."}, {"time": 2616, "text": "And it actually, I actually wrote it for the course, for the Fast AI course."}, {"time": 2623, "text": "I wanted to teach people NLP and I thought, I only want to teach people practical stuff."}, {"time": 2627, "text": "And I think the only practical stuff is transfer learning."}, {"time": 2630, "text": "And I couldn't find any examples of transfer learning in NLP."}, {"time": 2633, "text": "So I just did it."}, {"time": 2634, "text": "And I was shocked to find that as soon as I did it, which, you know, the basic prototype took a couple of days, smashed the state of the art on one of the most important data sets in a field that I knew nothing about."}, {"time": 2646, "text": "And I just thought, well, this is ridiculous."}, {"time": 2650, "text": "And so I spoke to Sebastian about it and he kindly offered to write it up, the results."}, {"time": 2657, "text": "And so it ended up being published in ACL, which is the top computational linguistics conference."}, {"time": 2665, "text": "So like people do actually care once you do it, but I guess it's difficult for maybe like junior researchers or like, I don't care whether I get citations or papers or whatever."}, {"time": 2677, "text": "There's nothing in my life that makes that important, which is why I've never actually bothered to write a paper myself."}, {"time": 2683, "text": "But for people who do, I guess they have to pick the kind of safe option, which is like, yeah, make a slight improvement on something that everybody's already working on."}, {"time": 2694, "text": "Yeah, nobody does anything interesting or succeeds in life with the safe option."}, {"time": 2701, "text": "Although, I mean, the nice thing is, nowadays everybody is now working on NLP transfer learning because since that time we've had GPT and GPT2 and BERT, and, you know, it's like, it's, so yeah, once you show that something's possible, everybody jumps in, I guess, so."}, {"time": 2717, "text": "I hope to be a part of, and I hope to see more innovation and active learning in the same way."}, {"time": 2722, "text": "I think transfer learning and active learning are fascinating, public, open work."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "I actually helped start a startup called Platform AI, which is really all about active learning."}, {"time": 2731, "text": "And yeah, it's been interesting trying to kind of see what research is out there and make the most of it."}, {"time": 2737, "text": "And there's basically none."}, {"time": 2739, "text": "So we've had to do all our own research."}, {"time": 2741, "text": "Once again, and just as you described."}, {"time": 2744, "text": "Can you tell the story of the Stanford competition, Dawn Bench, and FastAI's achievement on it?"}, {"time": 2751, "text": "Sure, so something which I really enjoy is that I basically teach two courses a year, the Practical Deep Learning for Coders, which is kind of the introductory course, and then Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders, which is the kind of research level course."}, {"time": 2768, "text": "And while I teach those courses, I basically have a big office at the University of San Francisco, big enough for like 30 people."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "And I invite anybody, any student who wants to come and hang out with me while I build the course."}, {"time": 2785, "text": "And so generally it's full."}, {"time": 2786, "text": "And so we have 20 or 30 people in a big office with nothing to do but study deep learning."}, {"time": 2793, "text": "So it was during one of these times that somebody in the group said, oh, there's a thing called Dawn Bench that looks interesting."}, {"time": 2801, "text": "And I was like, what the hell is that?"}, {"time": 2802, "text": "And they set out some competition to see how quickly you can train a model."}, {"time": 2806, "text": "Seems kind of, not exactly relevant to what we're doing, but it sounds like the kind of thing which you might be interested in."}, {"time": 2812, "text": "And I checked it out and I was like, oh crap, there's only 10 days till it's over."}, {"time": 2815, "text": "It's too late."}, {"time": 2818, "text": "And we're kind of busy trying to teach this course."}, {"time": 2820, "text": "But we're like, oh, it would make an interesting case study for the course."}, {"time": 2826, "text": "It's like, it's all the stuff we're already doing."}, {"time": 2828, "text": "Why don't we just put together our current best practices and ideas?"}, {"time": 2832, "text": "So me and I guess about four students just decided to give it a go."}, {"time": 2837, "text": "And we focused on this small one called Cifar 10, which is little 32 by 32 pixel images."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "Can you say what Dawn Bench is?"}, {"time": 2846, "text": "Yeah, so it's a competition to train a model as fast as possible."}, {"time": 2849, "text": "It was run by Stanford."}, {"time": 2850, "text": "And it's cheap as possible too."}, {"time": 2852, "text": "That's also another one for as cheap as possible."}, {"time": 2854, "text": "And there was a couple of categories, ImageNet and Cifar 10."}, {"time": 2858, "text": "So ImageNet is this big 1.3 million image thing that took a couple of days to train."}, {"time": 2865, "text": "Remember a friend of mine, Pete Warden, who's now at Google."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "I remember he told me how he trained ImageNet a few years ago when he basically like had this little granny flat out the back that he turned into his ImageNet training center."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "And he figured, you know, after like a year of work, he figured out how to train it in like 10 days or something."}, {"time": 2887, "text": "It's like, that was a big job."}, {"time": 2888, "text": "Whereas Cifar 10, at that time, you could train in a few hours."}, {"time": 2892, "text": "You know, it's much smaller and easier."}, {"time": 2894, "text": "So we thought we'd try Cifar 10."}, {"time": 2898, "text": "And yeah, I've really never done that before."}, {"time": 2903, "text": "Like I'd never really, like things like using more than one GPU at a time was something I tried to avoid."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "Cause to me, it's like very against the whole idea of accessibility is should better do things with one GPU."}, {"time": 2915, "text": "I mean, have you asked in the past before, after having accomplished something, how do I do this faster, much faster?"}, {"time": 2922, "text": "Oh, always, but it's always, for me, it's always how do I make it much faster on a single GPU that a normal person could afford in their day to day life."}, {"time": 2930, "text": "It's not how could I do it faster by, you know, having a huge data center."}, {"time": 2935, "text": "Cause to me, it's all about like, as many people should better use something as possible without fussing around with infrastructure."}, {"time": 2944, "text": "So anyways, in this case it's like, well, we can use eight GPUs just by renting a AWS machine."}, {"time": 2950, "text": "So we thought we'd try that."}, {"time": 2951, "text": "And yeah, basically using the stuff we were already doing, we were able to get, you know, the speed, you know, within a few days we had the speed down to, I don't know, a very small number of minutes."}, {"time": 2966, "text": "I can't remember exactly how many minutes it was, but it might've been like 10 minutes or something."}, {"time": 2971, "text": "And so, yeah, we found ourselves at the top of the leaderboard easily for both time and money, which really shocked me cause the other people competing in this were like Google and Intel and stuff who I like know a lot more about this stuff than I think we do."}, {"time": 2985, "text": "So then we were emboldened."}, {"time": 2986, "text": "We thought let's try the ImageNet one too."}, {"time": 2990, "text": "I mean, it seemed way out of our league, but our goal was to get under 12 hours."}, {"time": 2995, "text": "And we did, which was really exciting."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "But we didn't put anything up on the leaderboard, but we were down to like 10 hours."}, {"time": 3003, "text": "But then Google put in like five hours or something and we're just like, oh, we're so screwed."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "But we kind of thought, we'll keep trying."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "You know, if Google can do it in five, I mean, Google did on five hours on something on like a TPU pod or something, like a lot of hardware."}, {"time": 3023, "text": "But we kind of like had a bunch of ideas to try."}, {"time": 3026, "text": "Like a really simple thing was why are we using these big images?"}, {"time": 3030, "text": "They're like 224 or 256 by 256 pixels."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "You know, why don't we try smaller ones?"}, {"time": 3037, "text": "And just to elaborate, there's a constraint on the accuracy that your trained model is supposed to achieve, right?"}, {"time": 3043, "text": "Yeah, you gotta achieve 93%, I think it was, for ImageNet, exactly."}, {"time": 3049, "text": "Which is very tough, so you have to."}, {"time": 3051, "text": "Yeah, 93%, like they picked a good threshold."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "It was a little bit higher than what the most commonly used ResNet 50 model could achieve at that time."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "So yeah, so it's quite a difficult problem to solve."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "But yeah, we realized if we actually just use 64 by 64 images, it trained a pretty good model."}, {"time": 3076, "text": "And then we could take that same model and just give it a couple of epochs to learn 224 by 224 images."}, {"time": 3081, "text": "And it was basically already trained."}, {"time": 3084, "text": "It makes a lot of sense."}, {"time": 3085, "text": "Like if you teach somebody, like here's what a dog looks like and you show them low res versions, and then you say, here's a really clear picture of a dog, they already know what a dog looks like."}, {"time": 3095, "text": "So that like just, we jumped to the front and we ended up winning parts of that competition."}, {"time": 3103, "text": "We actually ended up doing a distributed version over multiple machines a couple of months later and ended up at the top of the leaderboard."}, {"time": 3111, "text": "We had 18 minutes."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "ImageNet."}, {"time": 3113, "text": "Yeah, and it was, and people have just kept on blasting through again and again since then, so."}, {"time": 3120, "text": "So what's your view on multi GPU or multiple machine training in general as a way to speed code up?"}, {"time": 3129, "text": "I think it's largely a waste of time."}, {"time": 3131, "text": "Both of them."}, {"time": 3133, "text": "Both multi GPU on a single machine and."}, {"time": 3135, "text": "Yeah, particularly multi machines, cause it's just clunky."}, {"time": 3141, "text": "Multi GPUs is less clunky than it used to be, but to me anything that slows down your iteration speed is a waste of time."}, {"time": 3151, "text": "So you could maybe do your very last, you know, perfecting of the model on multi GPUs if you need to, but."},

of us don't use 1.3 million images."}, {"time": 3171, "text": "And we've also done research that shows that doing things on a smaller subset of images gives you the same relative answers anyway."},

called ImageNet, the French ImageNet, which is a small subset of ImageNet, which is designed to be easy to classify."}, {"time": 3195, "text": "What's, how do you spell ImageNet?"}, {"time": 3197, "text": "It's got an extra T and E at the end, cause it's very French."}, {"time": 3200, "text": "And then another one called ImageWolf, which is a subset of ImageNet that only contains dog breeds."},

starting to see some researchers start to use these much smaller data sets."}, {"time": 3228, "text": "I so deeply love the way you think, because I think you might've written a blog post saying that sort of going these big data sets is encouraging people to not think creatively."}, {"time": 3244, "text": "So you're too, it sort of constrains you to train on large resources."}, {"time": 3249, "text": "And because you have these resources, you think more research will be better."}, {"time": 3253, "text": "And then you start, so like somehow you kill the creativity."}, {"time": 3257, "text": "Yeah, and even worse than that, Lex, I keep hearing from people who say, I decided not to get into deep learning because I don't believe it's accessible to people outside of Google to do useful work."}, {"time": 3268, "text": "So like I see a lot of people make an explicit decision to not learn this incredibly valuable tool because they've drunk the Google Koolaid, which is that only Google's big enough and smart enough to do it."}, {"time": 3282, "text": "And I just find that so disappointing and it's so wrong."}, {"time": 3285, "text": "And I think all of the major breakthroughs in AI in the next 20 years will be doable on a single GPU."}, {"time": 3293, "text": "Like I would say, my sense is all the big sort of."}, {"time": 3297, "text": "Well, let's put it this way."}, {"time": 3298, "text": "None of the big breakthroughs of the last 20 years have required multiple GPUs."}, {"time": 3301, "text": "So like batch norm, ReLU, Dropout."}, {"time": 3305, "text": "To demonstrate that there's something to them."}, {"time": 3308, "text": "Every one of them, none of them has required multiple GPUs."}, {"time": 3311, "text": "GANs, the original GANs didn't require multiple GPUs."}, {"time": 3315, "text": "Well, and we've actually recently shown that you don't even need GANs."}, {"time": 3319, "text": "So we've developed GAN level outcomes without needing GANs."}, {"time": 3324, "text": "And we can now do it with, again, by using transfer learning, we can do it in a couple of hours on a single GPU."}, {"time": 3330, "text": "You're just using a generator model without the adversarial part?"}, {"time": 3332, "text": "Yeah, so we've found loss functions that work super well without the adversarial part."}, {"time": 3338, "text": "And then one of our students, a guy called Jason Antich, has created a system called dealtify, which uses this technique to colorize old black and white movies."}, {"time": 3348, "text": "You can do it on a single GPU, colorize a whole movie in a couple of hours."}, {"time": 3352, "text": "And one of the things that Jason and I did together was we figured out how to add a little bit of GAN at the very end, which it turns out for colorization makes it just a bit brighter and nicer."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "And then Jason did masses of experiments to figure out exactly how much to do, but it's still all done on his home machine on a single GPU in his lounge room."}, {"time": 3375, "text": "And if you think about colorizing Hollywood movies, that sounds like something a huge studio would have to do,

"It's such a pain in the ass to have these microphones to get good quality audio."}, {"time": 3394, "text": "And I tried to see if it's possible to plop down a bunch of cheap sensors and reconstruct higher quality audio from multiple sources."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "Because right now I haven't seen the work from, okay, we can say even expensive mics automatically combining audio from multiple sources to improve the combined audio."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "People haven't done that."}, {"time": 3413, "text": "And that feels like a learning problem."}, {"time": 3415, "text": "So hopefully somebody can."}, {"time": 3416, "text": "Well, I mean, it's evidently doable and it should have been done by now."}, {"time": 3421, "text": "I felt the same way about computational photography four years ago."}, {"time": 3425, "text": "Why are we investing in big lenses when three cheap lenses plus actually a little bit of intentional movement, so like take a few frames, gives you enough information to get excellent subpixel resolution, which particularly with deep learning, you would know exactly what you meant to be looking at."}, {"time": 3445, "text": "We can totally do the same thing with audio."}, {"time": 3448, "text": "I think it's madness that it hasn't been done yet."}, {"time": 3450, "text": "Is there progress on the photography company?"}, {"time": 3453, "text": "Yeah, photography is basically standard now."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "So the Google Pixel Night Light, I don't know if you've ever tried it, but it's astonishing."}, {"time": 3463, "text": "You take a picture in almost pitch black and you get back a very high quality image."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "And it's not because of the lens."}, {"time": 3471, "text": "Same stuff with like adding the bokeh to the background blurring, it's done computationally."}, {"time": 3477, "text": "This is the pixel right here."}, {"time": 3478, "text": "Yeah, basically everybody now is doing most of the fanciest stuff on their phones with computational photography and also increasingly people are putting more than one lens on the back of the camera."}, {"time": 3491, "text": "So the same will happen for audio for sure."}, {"time": 3494, "text": "And there's applications in the audio side."}, {"time": 3496, "text": "If you look at an Alexa type device, most people I've seen, especially I worked at Google before, when you look at noise background removal, you don't think of multiple sources of audio."}, {"time": 3509, "text": "You don't play with that as much as I would hope people would."}, {"time": 3511, "text": "But I mean, you can still do it even with one."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "Like again, not much work's been done in this area."}, {"time": 3516, "text": "So we're actually gonna be releasing an audio library soon, which hopefully will encourage development of this because it's so underused."}, {"time": 3523, "text": "The basic approach we used for our super resolution and which Jason uses for dealtify of generating high quality images, the exact same approach would work for audio."}, {"time": 3533, "text": "No one's done it yet, but it would be a couple of months work."}, {"time": 3537, "text": "Okay, also learning rate in terms of Dawn Bench."}, {"time": 3541, "text": "There's some magic on learning rate that you played around with that's kind of interesting."}, {"time": 3545, "text": "Yeah, so this is all work that came from a guy called Leslie Smith."}, {"time": 3549, "text": "Leslie's a researcher who, like us, cares a lot about just the practicalities of training neural networks quickly and accurately, which I think is what everybody should care about, but almost nobody does."}, {"time": 3564, "text": "And he discovered something very interesting, which he calls super convergence, which is there are certain networks that with certain settings of high parameters could suddenly be trained 10 times faster by using a 10 times higher learning rate."}, {"time": 3579, "text": "Now, no one published that paper because it's not an area of kind of active research in the academic world."}, {"time": 3590, "text": "No academics recognize that this is important."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "And also deep learning in academia is not considered a experimental science."}, {"time": 3599, "text": "So unlike in physics where you could say like, I just saw a subatomic particle do something which the theory doesn't explain, you could publish that without an explanation."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "And then in the next 60 years, people can try to work out how to explain it."}, {"time": 3614, "text": "We don't allow this in the deep learning world."}, {"time": 3616, "text": "So it's literally impossible for Leslie to publish a paper that says, I've just seen something amazing happen."}, {"time": 3623, "text": "This thing trained 10 times faster than it should have."}, {"time": 3625, "text": "I don't know why."}, {"time": 3627, "text": "And so the reviewers were like, well, you can't publish that because you don't know why."}, {"time": 3631, "text": "That's important to pause on because there's so many discoveries that would need to start like that."}, {"time": 3636, "text": "Every other scientific field I know of works that way."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "I don't know why ours is uniquely disinterested in publishing unexplained experimental results, but there it is."}, {"time": 3648, "text": "So it wasn't published."}, {"time": 3651, "text": "Having said that, I read a lot more unpublished papers than published papers because that's where you find the interesting insights."}, {"time": 3660, "text": "So I absolutely read this paper."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "And I was just like, this is astonishingly mind blowing and weird and awesome."}, {"time": 3669, "text": "And like, why isn't everybody only talking about this?"}, {"time": 3672, "text": "Because like, if you can train these things 10 times faster, they also generalize better because you're doing less epochs, which means you look at the data less, you get better accuracy."}, {"time": 3682, "text": "So I've been kind of studying that ever since."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "And eventually Leslie kind of figured out a lot of how to get this done."}, {"time": 3690, "text": "And we added minor tweaks."}, {"time": 3692, "text": "And a big part of the trick is starting at a very low learning rate, very gradually increasing it."}, {"time": 3697, "text": "So as you're training your model, you would take very small steps at the start and you gradually make them bigger and bigger until eventually you're taking much bigger steps than anybody thought was possible."}, {"time": 3709, "text": "There's a few other little tricks to make it work, but basically we can reliably get super convergence."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "And so for the Dawn Bench thing, we were using just much higher learning rates than people expected to work."}, {"time": 3722, "text": "What do you think the future of, I mean, it makes so much sense for that to be a critical hyperparameter learning rate that you vary."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "What do you think the future of learning rate magic looks like?"}, {"time": 3733, "text": "Well, there's been a lot of great work in the last 12 months in this area."}, {"time": 3737, "text": "And people are increasingly realizing that optimize, like we just have no idea really how optimizers work."}, {"time": 3743, "text": "And the combination of weight decay, which is how we regularize optimizers, and the learning rate, and then other things like the epsilon we use in the Adam optimizer, they all work together in weird ways."}, {"time": 3756, "text": "And different parts of the model, this is another thing we've done a lot of work on is research into how different parts of the model should be trained at different rates in different ways."}, {"time": 3766, "text": "So we do something we call discriminative learning rates, which is really important, particularly for transfer learning."}, {"time": 3773, "text": "So really, I think in the last 12 months, a lot of people have realized that all this stuff is important."}, {"time": 3777, "text": "There's been a lot of great work coming out and we're starting to see algorithms appear, which have very, very few dials, if any, that you have to touch."}, {"time": 3787, "text": "So I think what's gonna happen is the idea of a learning rate, well, it almost already has disappeared in the latest research."}, {"time": 3794, "text": "And instead, it's just like we know enough about how to interpret the gradients and the change of gradients we see to know how to set every parameter in an optimal way."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "So you see the future of deep learning where really, where's the input of a human expert needed?"}, {"time": 3814, "text": "Well, hopefully the input of a human expert will be almost entirely unneeded from the deep learning point of view."}, {"time": 3820, "text": "So again, like Google's approach to this is to try and use thousands of times more compute to run lots and lots of models at the same time and hope that one of them is good."}, {"time": 3831, "text": "AutoML kind of thing?"}, {"time": 3831, "text": "Yeah, AutoML kind of stuff, which I think is insane."}, {"time": 3836, "text": "When you better understand the mechanics of how models learn, you don't have to try a thousand different models to find which one happens to work the best."}, {"time": 3871, "text": "Yeah, the data side."}, {"time": 3872, "text": "How often do you work with data these days in terms of the cleaning, looking at it?"}, {"time": 3877, "text": "Like Darwin looked at different species while traveling about."}, {"time": 3882, "text": "Do you look at data?"}, {"time": 3885, "text": "Have you in your roots in Kaggle?"}, {"time": 3888, "text": "Always, yeah."}, {"time": 3888, "text": "Look at data."}, {"time": 3889, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it's a key part of our course."}, {"time": 3891, "text": "It's like before we train a model in the course, we see how to look at the data."}, {"time": 3895, "text": "And then the first thing we do after we train our first model, which we fine tune an ImageNet model for five minutes."}, {"time": 3900, "text": "And then the thing we immediately do after that is we learn how to analyze the results of the model by looking at examples of misclassified images and looking at a classification matrix, and then doing research on Google to learn about the kinds of things that it's misclassifying."}, {"time": 3918, "text": "So to me, one of the really cool things about machine learning models in general is that when you interpret them, they tell you about things like what are the most important features, which groups are you misclassifying, and they help you become a domain expert more quickly because you can focus your time on the bits that the model is telling you is important."}, {"time": 3938, "text": "So it lets you deal with things like data leakage, for example, if it says, oh, the main feature I'm looking at is customer ID."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "And you're like, oh, customer ID should be predictive."}, {"time": 3947, "text": "And then you can talk to the people that manage customer IDs and they'll tell you like, oh yes, as soon as a customer's application is accepted, we add a one on the end of their customer ID or something."}, {"time": 3961, "text": "So yeah, looking at data, particularly from the lens of which parts of the data the model says is important is super important."}, {"time": 3969, "text": "Yeah, and using the model to almost debug the data to learn more about the data."}, {"time": 3976, "text": "What are the different cloud options for training your own networks?"}, {"time": 3980, "text": "Last question related to DawnBench."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "Well, it's part of a lot of the work you do, but from a perspective of performance, I think you've written this in a blog post."}, {"time": 3989, "text": "There's AWS, there's TPU from Google."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "What the future holds?"}, {"time": 3994, "text": "What would you recommend now in terms of training?"}, {"time": 3997, "text": "So from a hardware point of view, Google's TPUs and the best Nvidia GPUs are similar."}, {"time": 4005, "text": "I mean, maybe the TPUs are like 30% faster, but they're also much harder to program."}, {"time": 4009, "text": "There isn't a clear leader in terms of hardware right now, although much more importantly, the Nvidia GPUs are much more programmable."}, {"time": 4019, "text": "They've got much more written for all of them."}, {"time": 4020, "text": "So like that's the clear leader for me and where I would spend my time as a researcher and practitioner."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "But then in terms of the platform, I mean, we're super lucky now with stuff like Google GCP, Google Cloud, and AWS that you can access a GPU pretty quickly and easily."}, {"time": 4045, "text": "But I mean, for AWS, it's still too hard."}, {"time": 4048, "text": "Like you have to find an AMI and get the instance running and then install the software you want and blah, blah, blah."}, {"time": 4057, "text": "GCP is currently the best way to get started on a full server environment because they have a fantastic fast AI in PyTorch ready to go instance, which has all the courses preinstalled."}, {"time": 4071, "text": "It has Jupyter Notebook pre running."}, {"time": 4073, "text": "Jupyter Notebook is this wonderful interactive computing system, which everybody basically should be using for any kind of data driven research."}, {"time": 4082, "text": "But then even better than that, there are platforms like Salamander, which we own and Paperspace, where literally you click a single button and it pops up a Jupyter Notebook straight away without any kind of installation or anything."}, {"time": 4102, "text": "And all the course notebooks are all preinstalled."}, {"time": 4105, "text": "So like for me, this is one of the things we spent a lot of time kind of curating and working on."}, {"time": 4114, "text": "Because when we first started our courses, the biggest problem was people dropped out of lesson one because they couldn't get an AWS instance running."}, {"time": 4122, "text": "So things are so much better now."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "And like we actually have, if you go to course.fast.ai, the first thing it says is here's how to get started with your GPU."}, {"time": 4130, "text": "And there's like, you just click on the link and you click start and you're going."}, {"time": 4135, "text": "You'll go GCP."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "I have to confess, I've never used the Google GCP."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "Yeah, GCP gives you $300 of compute for free, which is really nice."}, {"time": 4143, "text": "But as I say, Salamander and Paperspace are even easier still."}, {"time": 4150, "text": "So from the perspective of deep learning frameworks, you work with fast.ai, if you go to this framework, and PyTorch and TensorFlow."}, {"time": 4161, "text": "What are the strengths of each platform in your perspective?"}, {"time": 4165, "text": "So in terms of what we've done our research on and taught in our course, we started with Theano and Keras, and then we switched to TensorFlow and Keras, and then we switched to PyTorch, and then we switched to PyTorch and fast.ai."}, {"time": 4182, "text": "And that kind of reflects a growth and development of the ecosystem of deep learning libraries."}, {"time": 4192, "text": "Theano and TensorFlow were great, but were much harder to teach and to do research and development on because they define what's called a computational graph upfront, a static graph, where you basically have to say, here are all the things that I'm gonna eventually do in my model, and then later on you say, okay, do those things with this data."}, {"time": 4215, "text": "And you can't like debug them, you can't do them step by step, you can't program them interactively in a Jupyter notebook and so forth."}, {"time": 4222, "text": "PyTorch was not the first, but PyTorch was certainly the strongest entrant to come along and say, let's not do it that way, let's just use normal Python."}, {"time": 4231, "text": "And everything you know about in Python is just gonna work, and we'll figure out how to make that run on the GPU as and when necessary."}, {"time": 4240, "text": "That turned out to be a huge leap in terms of what we could do with our research and what we could do with our teaching."}, {"time": 4249, "text": "Because it wasn't limiting."}, {"time": 4251, "text": "Yeah, I mean, it was critical for us for something like DawnBench to be able to rapidly try things."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "It's just so much harder to be a researcher and practitioner when you have to do everything upfront and you can't inspect it."}, {"time": 4263, "text": "Problem with PyTorch is it's not at all accessible to newcomers because you have to like write your own training loop and manage the gradients and all this stuff."}, {"time": 4275, "text": "And it's also like not great for researchers because you're spending your time dealing with all this boilerplate and overhead rather than thinking about your algorithm."}, {"time": 4283, "text": "So we ended up writing this very multi layered API that at the top level, you can train a state of the art neural network in three lines of code."}, {"time": 4293, "text": "And which kind of talks to an API, which talks to an API, which talks to an API, which like you can dive into at any level and get progressively closer to the machine kind of levels of control."}, {"time": 4305, "text": "And this is the fast AI library."}, {"time": 4307, "text": "That's been critical for us and for our students and for lots of people that have won deep learning competitions with it and written academic papers with it."}, {"time": 4318, "text": "It's made a big difference."}, {"time": 4320, "text": "We're still limited though by Python."}, {"time": 4323, "text": "And particularly this problem with things like recurrent neural nets say where you just can't change things unless you accept it going so slowly that it's impractical."}, {"time": 4335, "text": "So in the latest incarnation of the course and with some of the research we're now starting to do, we're starting to do stuff, some stuff in Swift."}, {"time": 4344, "text": "I think we're three years away from that being super practical, but I'm in no hurry."}, {"time": 4351, "text": "I'm very happy to invest the time to get there."}, {"time": 4355, "text": "But with that, we actually already have a nascent version of the fast AI library for vision running on Swift and TensorFlow."}, {"time": 4364, "text": "Cause a Python for TensorFlow is not gonna cut it."}, {"time": 4368, "text": "It's just a disaster."}, {"time": 4369, "text": "What they did was they tried to replicate the bits that people were saying they like about PyTorch, this kind of interactive computation, but they didn't actually change their foundational runtime components."}, {"time": 4383, "text": "So they kind of added this like syntax sugar they call TF Eager, TensorFlow Eager, which makes it look a lot like PyTorch, but it's 10 times slower than PyTorch to actually do a step."}, {"time": 4396, "text": "So because they didn't invest the time in like retooling the foundations, cause their code base is so horribly complex."}, {"time": 4404, "text": "Yeah, I think it's probably very difficult to do that kind of retooling."}, {"time": 4406, "text": "Yeah, well, particularly the way TensorFlow was written, it was written by a lot of people very quickly in a very disorganized way."}, {"time": 4413, "text": "So like when you actually look in the code, as I do often, I'm always just like, Oh God, what were they thinking?"}, {"time": 4418, "text": "It's just, it's pretty awful."}, {"time": 4421, "text": "So I'm really extremely negative about the potential future for Python for TensorFlow."}, {"time": 4430, "text": "But Swift for TensorFlow can be a different beast altogether."}, {"time": 4433, "text": "It can be like, it can basically be a layer on top of MLIR that takes advantage of, you know, all the great compiler stuff that Swift builds on with LLVM and yeah, I think it will be absolutely fantastic."}, {"time": 4450, "text": "Well, you're inspiring me to try."}, {"time": 4451, "text": "I haven't truly felt the pain of TensorFlow 2.0 Python."}, {"time": 4457, "text": "It's fine by me, but of... Yeah, I mean, it does the job if you're using like predefined things that somebody has already written."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "But if you actually compare, you know, like I've had to do, cause I've been having to do a lot of stuff with TensorFlow recently, you actually compare like, okay, I want to write something from scratch and you're like, I just keep finding it's like, Oh, it's running 10 times slower than PyTorch."}, {"time": 4481, "text": "So is the biggest cost, let's throw running time out the window."}, {"time": 4487, "text": "How long it takes you to program?"}, {"time": 4489, "text": "That's not too different now, thanks to TensorFlow Eager, that's not too different."}, {"time": 4494, "text": "But because so many things take so long to run, you wouldn't run it at 10 times slower."}, {"time": 4500, "text": "Like you just go like, Oh, this is taking too long."}, {"time": 4503, "text": "And also there's a lot of things which are just less programmable, like tf.data, which is the way data processing works in TensorFlow is just this big mess."}, {"time": 4511, "text": "It's incredibly inefficient."}, {"time": 4513, "text": "And they kind of had to write it that way because of the TPU problems I described earlier."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "So I just, you know, I just feel like they've got this huge technical debt, which they're not going to solve without starting from scratch."}, {"time": 4527, "text": "So here's an interesting question then, if there's a new student starting today, what would you recommend they use?"}, {"time": 4537, "text": "Well, I mean, we obviously recommend Fastai and PyTorch because we teach new students and that's what we teach with."}, {"time": 4543, "text": "So we would very strongly recommend that because it will let you get on top of the concepts much more quickly."}, {"time": 4551, "text": "So then you'll become an actual, and you'll also learn the actual state of the art techniques, you know, so you actually get world class results."}, {"time": 4559, "text": "Honestly, it doesn't much matter what library you learn because switching from the trainer to MXNet to TensorFlow to PyTorch is gonna be a couple of days work as long as you understand the foundation as well."}, {"time": 4575, "text": "But you think will Swift creep in there as a thing that people start using?"}, {"time": 4582, "text": "Not for a few years, particularly because like Swift has no data science community, libraries, schooling."}, {"time": 4593, "text": "And the Swift community has a total lack of appreciation and understanding of numeric computing."}, {"time": 4600, "text": "So like they keep on making stupid decisions, you know, for years, they've just done dumb things around performance and prioritization."}, {"time": 4610, "text": "That's clearly changing now because the developer of Swift, Chris Latner, is working at Google on Swift for TensorFlow."}, {"time": 4620, "text": "So like that's a priority."}, {"time": 4624, "text": "It'll be interesting to see what happens with Apple because like Apple hasn't shown any sign of caring about numeric programming in Swift."}, {"time": 4633, "text": "So I mean, hopefully

stuff like CoreML, they're really pretty rubbish."}, {"time": 4650, "text": "So yeah, so there's a long way to go."}, {"time": 4653, "text": "But at least one nice thing is that Swift for TensorFlow can actually directly use Python code and Python libraries in a literally the entire lesson one notebook of fast AI runs in Swift right now in Python mode."}, {"time": 4668, "text": "So that's a nice intermediate thing."}, {"time": 4671, "text": "How long does it take?"}, {"time": 4673, "text": "If you look at the two fast AI courses, how long does it take to get from point zero to completing both

on average?"}, {"time": 4696, "text": "So like somebody who is a very competent coder can do 70 hours per course and pick up 70."}, {"time": 4707, "text": "70, seven zero, that's it, okay."}, {"time": 4741, "text": "So part of it's just like doing a lot more writing."}, {"time": 4744, "text": "What do you find is the bottleneck for people usually except getting started and setting stuff up?"},

bottleneck is people who have a lot of experience of classic statistics can really struggle because the intuition is so the opposite of what they're used to."}, {"time": 4770, "text": "They're very used to like trying to reduce the number of parameters in their model and looking at individual coefficients and stuff like that."}, {"time": 4779, "text": "So I find people who have a lot of coding

really familiar with deep learning."}, {"time": 4818, "text": "I mean, to see so many domain experts from so many different backgrounds, it's definitely, I wouldn't say taught me, but convinced me

world."}, {"time": 4919, "text": "So I'd say come to our course, course.fast.ai."}, {"time": 4922, "text": "And the thing I keep on hopping on in my lessons is train models, print out the inputs to the models, print out to the outputs to the models, like study, change the inputs a bit, look at how the outputs vary, just run lots of experiments to get an intuitive understanding of what's going on."}, {"time": 4945, "text": "To get hooked, do you think, you mentioned training, do you think just running the models inference, like if we talk about getting started?"}, {"time": 4955, "text":

there's no point running somebody else's model because it's not your model."}, {"time": 4968, "text": "So it only takes five minutes to fine tune a model for the data you care about."}, {"time": 4972, "text": "And in lesson two of the course, we teach you how to create your own data set from scratch by scripting Google image search."}, {"time": 4978, "text": "So, and we show you how to actually create a web application running online."}, {"time": 4982, "text": "So I create one in the course that differentiates between a teddy bear, a grizzly bear and a brown bear."}, {"time": 4988, "text":

the notebook that help you clean up the data set."}, {"time": 5001, "text": "There's other widgets that help you study the results to see where the errors are happening."}, {"time": 5006, "text": "And so now we've got over a thousand replies in our share your work here thread of students saying, here's the thing I built."}, {"time": 5014, "text": "And so there's people who like, and a lot of them are state of the art."}, {"time": 5017, "text": "Like somebody said, oh, I tried looking at Devangari characters and I couldn't believe it."}, {"time": 5021, "text": "The thing that came out was more

hummingbirds."}, {"time": 5033, "text": "She said that's kind of their national bird and she's got something that can now classify Trinidad and Tobago hummingbirds."}, {"time": 5038, "text": "So yeah,

a saint."}, {"time": 5056, "text": "Okay, once a person understands the basics, trains a bunch of models, if we look at the scale of years, what advice do you have for someone wanting to eventually

more expert, like create slightly evolutionary research in areas that everybody's studying."}, {"time": 5086, "text": "We need experts at using deep learning to diagnose malaria."}, {"time": 5092,

about anything and you'll be able to do that thing better than other people, particularly by combining it with your passion and domain expertise."}, {"time": 5127, "text": "So that's really interesting."}, {"time": 5128, "text": "Even if you do wanna innovate on transfer learning or active learning, your thought is, I mean, it's one I certainly share, is you also need to find a domain or

research is, not the only, but the vast majority of interesting research is like, try and solve an actual problem and solve it really well."}, {"time": 5166, "text": "So both understanding sufficient tools on the deep learning side and becoming a domain expert in a particular domain are really things within reach for anybody."}, {"time": 5178, "text": "Yeah, I mean, to me, I would compare it to like studying self driving cars, having never looked at a car or been in a car or turned a car on, which is like the way it is for a lot of people, they'll study some academic data set where they literally have no idea about that."}, {"time": 5196, "text": "By the way, I'm not sure how familiar with autonomous vehicles, but that is literally, you describe a large percentage of robotics folks

driven."}, {"time": 5211, "text": "And it's a problem because you know, when you've actually driven, you know, like these are the things that happened to me when I was driving."}, {"time": 5217,

to create a successful startup?"}, {"time": 5228, "text": "Same thing as becoming a successful deep learning practitioner, which is not giving up."}, {"time": 5235, "text": "So you can run out of money or run out of time or run out of something, you know, but if you keep costs super low and try and save up some money beforehand so you can afford to have some time, then just sticking with it is one important thing."}, {"time": 5258, "text": "Doing something you understand and care about is important."}, {"time": 5262, "text": "By something, I don't mean, the biggest problem I see with deep learning people is they do a PhD in deep learning and then they try and commercialize their PhD."}, {"time": 5272, "text": "It is a waste of time because that doesn't solve an actual problem."}, {"time": 5275, "text": "You picked your PhD topic because it was an interesting kind of engineering or math or research exercise."}, {"time": 5307, "text": "And then I think just, yeah, being, just be pragmatic and try and stay away from venture capital money as long as possible, preferably forever."}, {"time": 5319, "text": "So yeah, on that point, do you venture capital?"}, {"time": 5323, "text": "So did you, were you able to successfully run startups with self funded for quite a while?"}, {"time": 5328, "text": "Yeah, so my first two were self funded and that was the right way to do it."}, {"time": 5332, "text": "Is that scary?"}, {"time": 5334, "text": "No, VC startups are much more scary because you have these people on your back who do this all the time and who have done it for years

that's scary."}, {"time": 5350, "text": "Whereas doing the ones myself, well, with partners who were friends was nice because like we just went along at a pace that made sense and we were able to build it to something which was big enough that we never had to work again but was not big enough that any VC would think it was impressive."}, {"time": 5371, "text": "And that was enough for us to be excited, you know?"}, {"time": 5375, "text": "So I thought that's a much better way to do things than most people."}, {"time": 5380, "text": "In generally speaking, not for yourself but how do you make money during that process?"}, {"time": 5384, "text": "Do you cut into savings?"}, {"time": 5387, "text": "So yeah, so for, so I started Fast Mail and Optimal Decisions at the same time in 1999 with two different friends."}, {"time": 5394, "text": "And for Fast Mail, I guess I spent $70 a month on the server."}, {"time": 5404, "text": "And when the server ran out of space I put a payments

I kept my costs down."}, {"time": 5419, "text": "And once, you know, once I needed to spend more money I asked people to spend the money for me."}, {"time": 5425, "text": "And that, that was that."}, {"time": 5428, "text": "Basically from then on, we were making money and I was profitable from then."}, {"time": 5435, "text": "For Optimal Decisions, it was a bit harder because we were trying to sell something that was more like a $1 million sale."}, {"time": 5442, "text": "But what we did was we would sell scoping projects."}, {"time": 5446, "text": "So kind of like prototypy projects but rather than doing it for free we would sell them 50 to $100,000."}, {"time": 5454, "text": "So again, we were covering our costs and also making the client feel like we were doing something

scary."}, {"time": 5480, "text": "Kind of much more in somebody else's hands, will they fund you or not?"}, {"time": 5486, "text": "And what do they think of what you're doing?"}, {"time": 5487,

happy."}, {"time": 5498, "text": "And VCs always tell you not to do the thing that makes them happy."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "But then if you don't do the thing that makes them happy they get sad, so."}, {"time": 5506, "text": "And do you think optimizing for the, whatever they call it, the exit is a good thing to optimize for?"}, {"time": 5513, "text": "I mean, it can be, but not at the VC level because the VC exit needs to be, you know, a thousand X."}, {"time": 5519, "text": "So where else the lifestyle exit, if you can sell something for $10 million, then you've made it, right?"},

want to build something you want to sell in three years time, that's fine too."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "I mean, they're both perfectly good outcomes."}, {"time": 5541, "text": "So you're learning Swift now, in a way."}, {"time": 5544, "text": "I mean, you've already."}, {"time": 5545, "text": "I'm trying to."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "And I read that you use, at least in some cases, space

"text": "Don't know how many people do it, but it works incredibly well for me."}, {"time": 5566, "text": "Can you talk to your experience?"}, {"time": 5567, "text": "Like how did you, what do you?"}, {"time": 5571, "text": "First of all, okay, let's back it up."}, {"time": 5573, "text": "What is space repetition?"}, {"time": 5575, "text": "So space repetition is an idea created by a psychologist named Ebbinghaus."}, {"time": 5584, "text": "I don't know, must be a couple of hundred years ago or something, 150 years ago."}, {"time": 5588, "text": "He did something which sounds pretty damn tedious."}, {"time": 5590, "text": "He wrote down random sequences of letters on cards and tested how well he would remember those random sequences a day later, a week later, whatever."}, {"time": 5603, "text": "He discovered that there was this kind of a curve where his probability of remembering one of them would be dramatically smaller the next day and then a little bit smaller the next day and a little bit smaller the next day."}, {"time": 5613, "text": "What he discovered is that if he revised those cards after a day, the probabilities would decrease at a smaller rate."}, {"time": 5622, "text": "And then if you revise them again a week later, they would decrease at a smaller rate again."}, {"time": 5627, "text": "And so he basically figured out a roughly optimal equation for when you should revise something you wanna remember."}, {"time": 5636, "text": "So space repetition learning is using this simple algorithm, just something like revise something after a day and then three days and then a week and then three weeks and so forth."}, {"time": 5647, "text": "And so if you use a program like Anki, as you know, it will just do that for you."}, {"time": 5652, "text": "And it will say, did you remember this?"}, {"time": 5654, "text": "And if you say no, it will reschedule it back to appear again like 10 times faster than it otherwise would have."}, {"time": 5663, "text": "It's a kind of a way of being guaranteed to learn something because by definition, if you're not learning it, it will be rescheduled to be revised more quickly."}, {"time": 5673, "text": "Unfortunately though, it's also like, it doesn't let you fool yourself."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "If you're not learning something, you know like your revisions will just get more and more."}, {"time": 5684, "text": "So you have to find ways to learn things productively and effectively like treat your brain well."}, {"time": 5690, "text": "So using like mnemonics and stories and context and stuff like that."}, {"time": 5697, "text": "So yeah, it's a super great technique."}, {"time": 5699, "text": "It's like learning how to learn is something which everybody should learn before they actually learn anything."}, {"time": 5705, "text": "But almost nobody does."}, {"time": 5707, "text": "So what have you, so it certainly works well for learning new languages for, I mean, for learning like small projects almost."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "But do you, you know, I started using it for, I forget who wrote a blog post about this inspired me."}, {"time": 5722, "text": "It might've been you, I'm not sure."}, {"time": 5726, "text": "I started when I read papers, I'll concepts and ideas, I'll put them."}, {"time": 5731, "text": "Was it Michael Nielsen?"}, {"time": 5732, "text": "It was Michael Nielsen."}, {"time": 5733, "text": "So Michael started doing this recently and has been writing about it."}, {"time": 5741, "text": "So the kind of today's Ebbinghaus is a guy called Peter Wozniak who developed a system called SuperMemo."}, {"time": 5747, "text": "And he's been basically trying to become like the world's greatest Renaissance man over the last few decades."}, {"time": 5755, "text": "He's basically lived his life with space repetition learning for everything."}, {"time": 5763, "text": "I, and sort of like, Michael's only very recently got into this, but he started really getting excited about doing it for a lot of different things."}, {"time": 5771, "text": "For me personally, I actually don't use it for anything except Chinese."}, {"time": 5776, "text": "And the reason for that is that Chinese is specifically a thing I made a conscious decision that I want to continue to remember, even if I don't get much of a chance to exercise it, cause like I'm not often in China, so I don't."}, {"time": 5793, "text": "Or else something like programming languages or papers."}, {"time": 5798, "text": "I have a very different approach, which is I try not to learn anything from them, but instead I try to identify the important concepts and like actually ingest them."}, {"time": 5808, "text": "So like really understand that concept deeply and study it carefully."}, {"time": 5814, "text": "I will decide if it really is important, if it is like incorporated into our library, you know, incorporated into how I do things or decide it's not worth it, say."}, {"time": 5827, "text": "So I find, I find I then remember the things that I care about because I'm using it all the time."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "So I've, for the last 25 years, I've committed to spending at least half of every day learning or practicing something new, which is all my colleagues have always hated because it always looks like I'm not working on what I'm meant to be working on, but it always means I do everything faster because I've been practicing a lot of stuff."}, {"time": 5856, "text": "So I kind of give myself a lot of opportunity to practice new things."}, {"time": 5861, "text": "And so I find now I don't, yeah, I don't often kind of find myself wishing I could remember something because if it's something that's useful, then I've been using it a lot."},

{"time": 5881, "text": "So if you, what have you learned as a process as a, I mean, it all starts with just making the hours and the day available."}, {"time": 5888, "text": "Yeah, you got to stick with it, which is again, the number one thing that 99% of people don't do."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "So the people I started learning Chinese with, none of them were still doing it 12 months later."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "I'm still doing it 10 years later."}, {"time": 5900, "text": "I tried to stay in touch with them, but they just, no one did it."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "For something like Chinese, like study how human learning works."}, {"time": 5908, "text": "So every one of my Chinese flashcards is associated with a story."}, {"time": 5913, "text": "And that story is specifically designed to be memorable."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "And we find things memorable, which are like funny or disgusting or sexy or related to people that we know or care about."}, {"time": 5924, "text": "So I try to make sure all of the stories that are in my head have those characteristics."}, {"time": 5931, "text": "Yeah, so you have to, you know, you won't remember things well if they don't have some context."}, {"time": 5936, "text": "And yeah, you won't remember them well if you don't regularly practice them, whether it be just part of your day to day life or the Chinese and me flashcards."}, {"time": 5946, "text": "I mean, the other thing is, I'll let yourself fail sometimes."}, {"time": 5949, "text": "So like I've had various medical problems over the last few years."},

have five genes that contribute to human height, and there aren't five, there's a thousand."}, {"time": 436, "text": "If there's only five genes and you inherit some combination of them, and every one makes you two inches taller or two inches shorter, it'll look like a continuous trait."}, {"time": 448, "text": "But instead of five, there are thousands."}, {"time": 450, "text": "And every one of them contributes to less than one millimeter."}, {"time": 453, "text": "We change in height more during the day than each of these genetic variants contributes."}, {"time": 460, "text": "So by the

so much possibility to be different?"}, {"time": 472, "text": "Yeah, so there are selective advantages to being medium."}, {"time": 477, "text": "If you're extremely tall or extremely short, you run into selective disadvantages."}, {"time": 482, "text": "So you have trouble breathing, you have trouble running, you have trouble sitting if you're too tall."}, {"time": 486, "text": "If you're too short, you might, I don't know, have other selective pressures are acting against that."}, {"time": 491, "text": "If you look at natural history of human population, there's actually selection for height in Northern Europe and selection against height in Southern Europe."}, {"time": 499, "text": "So there might actually be advantages to actually being not super tall."}, {"time": 505, "text": "And if you look across the entire human population, for many, many traits, there's a lot of push towards the middle."}, {"time": 512, "text": "Balancing selection is the usual term for selection that

"text": "Let me ask, you kind of took a step back to the genome outside of just humans, but is there something that you find beautiful about the human genome specifically?"}, {"time": 558, "text": "So I think the genome, if more people understood the beauty of the human genome, there would be so many fewer wars, so much less anger in the world."}, {"time": 568, "text": "I mean, what's really beautiful about the human genome is really the variation that teaches us both about individuality and about similarity."}, {"time": 578, "text": "So any two people on the planet are 99.9%

thousands of parameters scattered across our genome."}, {"time": 638, "text": "So the other thing that makes humans unique, the other things that makes inheritance unique in humans is that most species inherit things vertically."}, {"time": 650, "text": "Basically instinct is a huge part of their behavior."}, {"time": 654, "text": "The way that, I mean, with my kids, we've been watching this

690, "text": "What's really beautiful about the human genome is that if you take a person from today and you place them back in ancient Egypt, or if you take a person from ancient Egypt and you place them here today, they will grow up to be completely normal."}, {"time": 704, "text": "That is not genetics."}, {"time": 707, "text": "This is the other type of inheritance in humans."}, {"time": 711,

the horizontal, is it in the realm of ideas?"}, {"time": 762, "text": "Okay, so it's the actual social interactions."}, {"time": 767, "text": "So basically the concept of neoteny is that you spend acquiring characteristics from your environment in an extremely malleable state of your brain and the wiring of your brain for a long period of your life."}, {"time": 780, "text": "Compared to primates, we are useless."}, {"time": 783, "text": "You take any primate at seven weeks and any human at seven weeks, we lose the battle."}, {"time": 788, "text": "But at 18 years, you know, all bets are off."}, {"time": 791, "text": "Like we basically, our brain continues to develop in an extremely malleable form till very late."}, {"time": 797, "text": "And this is what allows education."}, {"time": 800, "text": "This is what allows the person from Egypt to do extremely well now."}, {"time": 804, "text": "And the reason for that is that the wiring of our brain and the development of that wiring is actually delayed."}, {"time": 814, "text": "So, you know, the longer you delay that, the more opportunity you have to pass on knowledge, to pass on concepts, ideals, ideas from the parents to the child."}, {"time": 868, "text": "So the democratization of knowledge and the spread, the speed of spread of knowledge is what defines, I think, the human inheritance pattern."}, {"time": 878,

we use the genome to talk about DNA, but very often we say, I'm Greek, so people ask me, hey, what's in the Greek genome?"}, {"time": 940, "text": "And I'm like, well, yeah, what's in the Greek genome is both our genes and also our ideas and our ideals and our culture."}, {"time": 946, "text": "So the poetic meaning of the word."}, {"time": 948, "text": "Exactly, exactly, yeah."}, {"time": 950, "text": "So I think that there's a beauty to the democratization of knowledge, the fact that you can reach as many people as any other person on the planet and it's not who you are, it's really your ideas that matter, is a beautiful aspect of the internet."}, {"time": 971, "text": "I think there's, of course, a danger of my ignorance is as important as your expertise."}, {"time": 978, "text":

the democratization."}, {"time": 1002, "text": "And I think that within our educational system and within the upbringing of our children, we have to not only teach them knowledge, but we have to teach them the means to get to knowledge."}, {"time": 1015, "text": "And that, it's very similar to sort of you fish, you catch a fish for a man for one day, you fed them for one day, you teach them how to fish, you fed them for the rest of their life."}, {"time": 1025, "text": "So instead of just gathering the knowledge they need for any one task, we can just tell them, all right, here's how you Google it, here's how you figure out what's real and what's not, here's how you check the sources, here's how you form a basic opinion for yourself."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "And I think that inquisitive nature is paramount to being able to sort through this huge wealth of knowledge."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "So you need a basic educational foundation based on which you can then add on the sort of

the power of human genetics."}, {"time": 1672, "text": "That right now, it's actually simpler to figure out the phenotype of something by mining this massive amount of human data than by going back to any of the other species."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "And the reason for that is that if you look at the natural variation that happens in a population of seven billion, you basically have a mutation in almost every nucleotide."}, {"time": 1693, "text": "So every nucleotide you wanna perturb, you can go find a living, breathing human being and go test the function of that nucleotide by sort of

be honest, we haven't sequenced all seven billion people."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "It's not like we have every mutation, but we know that there's a carrier out there."}, {"time": 1755, "text": "So

question."}, {"time": 1890, "text": "It's hard to know what to do with that."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "I mean, if the genome has, if there's not much freedom, it's a..."}, {"time": 1898, "text":

the thing that gives it that visual... Yeah, the corona look basically."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "The corona look, yeah."}, {"time": 3686, "text": "So basically the spike protein sticks out of the virus and there's a first part of the protein S1 which basically attaches to the ACE2 receptor."}, {"time": 3694, "text": "And then S2 is the latch that sort of pushes and channels the fusion of the membranes and then the incorporation of the viral RNA inside our cells which then gets translated into all of these 30 proteins."}, {"time": 3710, "text": "So the S1 protein is evolving ridiculously fast."}, {"time": 3715, "text": "So if

have no idea what they do."}, {"time": 3728, "text": "We have some idea but nowhere near what S1 is."}, {"time": 3731, "text": "So what the..."}, {"time": 3732, "text": "Isn't that terrifying that S1 is evolving?"}, {"time": 3734, "text": "That means that's a really useful function and if it's evolving fast, doesn't that mean new strains could be created or it does something?"}, {"time": 3741, "text": "That means that it's searching for how to match, how to best match the host."}, {"time": 3746, "text": "So basically anything in general in evolution, if you look at genomes, anything that's contacting the environment is evolving much faster than anything that's internal."}, {"time": 3754, "text": "And the reason is that the environment changes."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "So if you look at the evolution of the cervical viruses, the S1 protein has evolved very rapidly because it's attaching to different hosts each time."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "We think of them as bats, but there's thousands of species of bats and to go from one species of bat to another species of bat, you have to adjust S1 to the new ACE2 receptor that you're gonna be facing in that new species."}, {"time":

organism."}, {"time": 3786, "text": "I mean, does it give you pause how incredible it is that the evolutionary dynamics that you're describing is actually happening and they're freaking out, figuring out how to jump from bats to humans all in this distributed fashion?"}, {"time": 3804, "text": "And then most of us don't even say they're alive or intelligent or whatever."}, {"time": 3807, "text":

of evolution, one is the stupid mutation, which is completely blind, and the other one is the super smart selection, which is ruthless."}, {"time": 3841, "text": "So it's not viruses who are smart."},

so then the intelligence is in the mechanism, but then by that argument, viruses would be more intelligent because there's just more of them."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "So the search, they're basically the brute force search that's happening with viruses because there's so many more of them than humans, then they're taken as a whole are more intelligent."}, {"time": 3887, "text": "I mean,

"text": "So let me answer, yeah, let me answer your question."}, {"time": 3903, "text": "So we would not be here if it wasn't for viruses."}, {"time": 3910, "text": "And part of the reason is that if you look at mammalian evolution early on in this mammalian radiation that basically happened after the death of the dinosaurs is that some of the viruses that we had in our genome spread throughout our genome and created binding sites for new classes of regulatory proteins."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "And these binding sites that landed all over our genome are now control elements that basically control our genes and sort of help the complexity of the circuitry of mammalian genomes."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "So, you know, everything's coevolution."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "That's

basically went through the ice ages and there was a scarcity of food."}, {"time": 4644, "text": "So there was a selection to being able to store every single calorie you consume."}, {"time": 4649,

come from this strain that was used."}, {"time": 4881, "text": "Moreover, there's been various claims of, ha ha, this was mixed and matched in lab because the S1 protein has three different components, each of which has a different evolutionary tree."}, {"time": 4894, "text": "So, you know, a lot of popular press basically said, aha, this came from pangolin and this came from, you know, all kinds of other species."}, {"time": 4902, "text": "This is what has been happening throughout the coronavirus tree."}, {"time": 4906, "text": "So basically the S1 protein has been recombining

"text": "And if you look at viruses, the reason why they're so elegant when you look at the design of this, you know, genome, it seems so elegant."}, {"time": 6046, "text": "And the reason for that is that it's been stripped down from something much larger because of the pressure to keep it compact."}, {"time": 6053, "text": "So many compact genomes out there have ancestors that were much larger."}, {"time": 6058, "text": "You don't start small and become big."}, {"time": 6060, "text": "You go through a loop of add a bunch of stuff, increase complexity, and then, you know, slim it down."}, {"time": 6067, "text": "And one of my early papers was in fact on genome duplication."}, {"time": 6072, "text": "One of the things we found is that baker's yeast, which is the, you know, yeast that you use to make bread, but also the yeast that you use to make wine, which is basically the dominant species when you go in the fields of Tuscany and you say, you know, what's out there, it's basically saccharomyces cerevisiae, or the way my Italian friends say, saccharomyces cerevisiae."}, {"time": 6093, "text": "Oh, which means what?"}, {"time": 6094, "text": "Oh, saccharomyces, okay, I'm sorry, I'm Greek."}, {"time": 6096, "text": "So yeah, zacharo, mikis, zacharo is sugar, mikis is fungus."}, {"time": 6101, "text": "Yes, cerevisiae, cerveza, beer."}, {"time": 6104, "text":

saccharomyces cerevisiae, basically the major baker's yeast out there is the descendant of a whole genome duplication."}, {"time": 6120, "text": "Why would a whole gene duplication even happen?"}, {"time": 6122, "text": "When it happened is coinciding with about a hundred million years ago and the emergence of fruit bearing plants."}, {"time": 6134, "text": "Why fruit bearing plants?"}, {"time": 6135, "text": "Because animals would eat the fruit and would walk around and poop huge amounts of nutrients along with a seed for the plants to spread."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "Before that, plants were not spreading through animals, they were spreading through wind and all kinds of other ways."}, {"time": 6152, "text": "But basically the moment you have fruit bearing plants, these plants are basically creating this abundance of sugar in the environment."}, {"time": 6160, "text": "So there's an evolutionary niche that gets created."}, {"time": 6162, "text": "And in that evolutionary niche, you basically have enough sugar that a whole genome duplication, which initially is a very messy event, allows you to then, you know, relieve some of that complexity."}, {"time": 6176, "text": "So I had to pause, what does genome duplication mean?"}, {"time": 6179, "text": "That basically means that instead of having eight chromosomes, you can now have 16 chromosomes."}, {"time": 6186, "text": "So, but the duplication at first, when you go to 16, you're not using that."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "Oh yeah, you are."}, {"time": 6195, "text": "Yeah, so basically from one day to the next, you went from having eight chromosomes to having 16 chromosomes."}, {"time": 6200, "text": "Probably a non disjunction event during a duplication, during a division."}, {"time": 6204, "text": "So you basically divide the cell instead of half the genome going this way and half the genome going the other way after duplication of the genome, you basically have all of it going to one cell and then there's sufficient messiness there that you end up with slight differences that make most of these chromosomes be actually preserved."}, {"time": 6222, "text": "It's a long story short to me."}, {"time": 6223, "text": "But that's a big upgrade, right?"}, {"time": 6225, "text": "So that's... Not necessarily, because what happens immediately thereafter is that you start massively losing tons of those duplicated genes."}, {"time": 6232, "text": "So 90% of those genes were actually lost very rapidly after whole gene duplication."}, {"time": 6238, "text": "And the reason for that is that biology is not intelligent, it's just ruthless selection, random mutation."}, {"time": 6246, "text": "So the ruthless selection basically means that as soon as one of the random mutations hit one gene, ruthless selection just kills off that gene."}, {"time": 6253, "text": "It's just, if you have a pressure to maintain a small compact genome, you will very rapidly lose the second copy of most of your genes and a small number 10% were kept in two copies."}, {"time": 6265, "text": "And those had to do a lot with environment adaptation, with the speed of replication, with the speed of translation and with sugar processing."}, {"time": 6274, "text": "So I'm making a long story short to basically say that evolution is messy."}, {"time": 6278, "text": "The only way... Like, so the example that I was giving of messing with 20% of your bits in your computer, totally bogus."}, {"time": 6287, "text": "Duplicating all your functions and just throwing them out there in the same function, just totally bogus."}, {"time": 6292, "text": "Like this would never work in an engineer system."}, {"time": 6295, "text": "But biological systems, because of this content based indexing and because of this modularity that comes from the fact that the gene is controlled by a series of tags."}, {"time": 6305, "text": "And now if you need this gene in another setting, you just add some more tags that will basically turn it on also in those settings."}, {"time": 6312, "text": "So this gene is now pressured to do two different functions and it builds up complexity."}, {"time": 6319, "text": "I see a whole gene duplication and gene duplication in general as a way to relieve that complexity."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "So you have this gradual buildup of complexity as functions get sort of added onto the existing genes."}, {"time": 6330, "text": "And then boom, you duplicate your workforce."}, {"time": 6334, "text": "And you now have two copies of this gene."}, {"time": 6336, "text": "One will probably specialize to do one and the other one will specialize to do the other or one will maintain the ancestral function."}, {"time": 6342, "text": "The other one will sort of be free to evolve and specialize while losing the ancestral function and so on and so forth."}, {"time": 6348, "text": "So that's how genomes evolve."}, {"time": 6349, "text": "They're just messy things, but they're extremely fault tolerant and they're extremely able to deal with mutations because that's the very way that you generate new functions."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "So new functionalization comes from the very thing that breaks it."}, {"time": 6367, "text": "So even in the current pandemic, many people are asking me which mutations matter the most."}, {"time": 6372, "text": "And what I tell them is, well, we can study the evolutionary dynamics of the current genome to then understand which mutations have previously happened or not."}, {"time": 6383, "text": "And which mutations happen in genes that evolve rapidly or not."}, {"time": 6388, "text": "And one of the things we found, for example, is that the genes that evolved rapidly in the past are still evolving rapidly now in the current pandemic."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "The genes that evolved slowly in the past are still evolving slowly."}, {"time": 6400, "text": "Which means that they're useful?"}, {"time": 6401, "text": "Which means that they're under the same evolutionary pressures."}, {"time": 6405, "text": "But then the question is what happens in specific mutations?"}, {"time": 6409, "text": "So if you look at the D614 gene mutations, that's been all over the news."}, {"time": 6413, "text": "So in position 614, in the amino acids 614 of the S protein, there's a D2 gene mutation that sort of has creeped over the population."}, {"time": 6427, "text": "That mutation, we found out through my work, disrupts a perfectly conserved nucleotide position that has never been changed in the history of millions of years of equivalent per million evolution of these viruses."}, {"time": 6443, "text": "That basically means that it's a completely new adaptation to human."}, {"time": 6447, "text": "And that mutation has now gone from 1% frequency to 90% frequency in almost all outbreaks."}, {"time": 6453, "text": "So this mutation, I like how you say the 416, what was it, okay."}, {"time": 6459, "text": "Yeah, 614, sorry."}, {"time": 6460, "text": "614."}, {"time": 6461, "text": "D614G."}, {"time": 6463, "text": "D614, so literally, so what you're saying is this is like a chess move."}, {"time": 6468, "text": "So it just mutated one letter to another."}, {"time": 6471, "text": "And that hasn't happened before."}, {"time": 6473, "text": "Yeah, never."}, {"time": 6474, "text": "And this somehow, this mutation is really useful."}, {"time": 6478, "text": "It's really useful in the current environment of the genome, which is moving from human to human."}, {"time": 6484, "text": "When it was moving from bat to bat, it couldn't care less for that mutation, but it's environment specific."}, {"time": 6489, "text": "So now that it's moving from human to human, it's moving way better, like by orders of magnitude."}, {"time": 6495, "text": "What do you, okay, so you're like tracking this evolutionary dynamics, which is fascinating, but what do you do with that?"}, {"time": 6505, "text": "What does this mean, what do you make, what do you make of this mutation in trying to anticipate, I guess, is one of the things you're trying to do is anticipate where, how this unrolls into the future, this evolutionary dynamics."}, {"time": 6519, "text": "Such a great question."}, {"time": 6520, "text": "So there's two things."}, {"time": 6522, "text": "Remember when I was saying earlier, mutation is the path to new things, but also the path to break old things."}, {"time": 6529, "text": "So what we know is that this position was extremely preserved through gazillions of mutations."}, {"time": 6536, "text": "That mutation was never tolerated when it was moving from bats to bats."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "So that basically means that that position is extremely important in the function of that protein."}, {"time": 6545, "text": "That's the first thing it tells."}, {"time": 6546, "text": "The second one is that that position was very well suited to bat transmission, but now is not well suited to human transmission, so it got rid of it."}, {"time": 6555, "text": "And it now has a new version of that amino acid that basically makes it much easier to transmit from human to human."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "So in terms of the evolutionary history teaching us about the future, it basically tells us here's the regions that are currently mutating."}, {"time": 6574, "text": "Here's the regions that are most likely to mutate going forward."}, {"time": 6577, "text": "As you're building a vaccine, here's what you should be focusing on in terms of the most stable regions that are the least likely to mutate."}, {"time": 6585, "text": "Or here's the newly evolved functions that are the most likely to be important because they've overcome this local maximum that it had reached in the bat transmission."}, {"time": 6599, "text": "So anyway, it's a tangent to basically say that evolution works in messy ways."}, {"time": 6604, "text": "And the thing that you would break is the thing that actually allows you to first go through a lull and then reaching new local maximum."}, {"time": 6615, "text": "And I often like to say that if engineers had basically designed evolution, we would still be perfectly replicating bacteria because it's my making the bacterium worse that you allow evolution to reach a new optimum."},

6645, "text": "We as engineers need to embrace breaking things."}, {"time": 6648, "text": "We as engineers need to embrace robustness as the first principle beyond perfection because nothing's gonna ever be perfect."}, {"time": 6656, "text": "And when you're sending a satellite to Mars, when something goes wrong, it'll break down."}, {"time": 6661, "text": "As opposed to building systems that

bottlenecks is people often use bottlenecks as a way to argue against exponential growth."}, {"time": 949, "text": "They say, well, there's no way you can overcome this bottleneck, but we seem to

"text": "So yes, that in the sense that you can't kind of push the dose up as high as you safely as one can, if they're in the right setting, like in our research as they can with the classic psychedelics."}, {"time": 967, "text": "But probably more importantly, just the nature of the effects with MDMA aren't the full on psychedelic."}, {"time": 974, "text": "It's not the full journey."}, {"time": 976, "text": "So it's sort of a psychedelic with rose colored glasses on."}, {"time": 981, "text": "A psychedelic that's more of, it's been called more of a heart trip than a head trip."},

speaking."}, {"time": 1001, "text": "That said at most doses of classic psychedelics, you still have a tether to reality."}, {"time": 1008, "text": "Changes a little bit when you're talking about smoking DMT or smoking 5 methoxy DMT, which are some interesting examples we could talk more about."}, {"time": 1017, "text": "But with MDMA, for example, it's very rare to have what's called an ego loss experience or a sense of transcendental unity, where one really seemingly loses the psychological construct of the self."}, {"time": 1039, "text": "But MDMA, it's very common for people to have this, they still are perceiving themselves as a self, but it's common for them to have this warmth, this empathy for humanity and for their friends and loved ones."}, {"time": 1054, "text": "So it's more, and you see those effects under the classic psychedelics, but that's a subset of what the classic psychedelics do."}, {"time": 1061, "text": "So I see MDMA in terms of its subjective effects is if you think about Venn diagrams, it's sort of MDMA is all within the classic psychedelics."}, {"time": 1070, "text": "So everything that you see on a particular MDMA session, sometimes a psilocybin session looks just like that, but then sometimes it's completely different with psilocybin."}, {"time": 1080, "text": "It's a little more narrowed in terms of the variability with MDMA."}, {"time": 1085, "text": "Is there something general to say about what the psychedelics do to the human mind?"}, {"time": 1091, "text": "You mentioned kind of an ego loss experience in the space of Venn diagrams."}, {"time": 1096, "text": "If we're to like draw a big circle, what can we say about that big circle?"}, {"time": 1103, "text": "In terms of people's report of subjective experience, probably one of the most general things we can say is that it expands that range."}, {"time": 1115, "text": "So many people come out of these sessions saying that they didn't know it was possible to have an experience like that."}, {"time": 1124, "text": "So there's an emphasis on the subjective experience that is there words that people put to it that capture that experience or is it something that just has to be experienced?"}, {"time": 1140, "text": "Yeah, people like... As a researcher, that's an interesting question because you have to kind of measure the effects of this and how do you convert that into numbers?"}, {"time": 1154, "text": "That's the ultimate challenge."}, {"time": 1155, "text": "So is that possible to one, convert it into words and the second, convert the words into numbers somehow?"}, {"time": 1162, "text": "So we do a lot of that with questionnaires, some of which are very psychometrically validated."}, {"time": 1168, "text": "So lots of numbers have been crunched on them."}, {"time": 1170, "text": "And there's always a limitation with questionnaires."}, {"time": 1173, "text": "I mean, subjective effects are subjective effects."}, {"time": 1175, "text": "Ultimately, it's what the person is reporting and that doesn't necessarily point towards a ground truth."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "So for example, if someone says that they felt like they touched another dimension or they felt like they sensed the reality of God or if they, I mean, just you name it, people's ontological views can sometimes shift."}, {"time": 1201, "text": "I think that's more about where they're coming from and I don't think it's the quintessential way in which they work."}, {"time": 1205, "text": "There's plenty of people that hold onto a completely naturalistic viewpoint and have profound and helpful experiences with these compounds."}, {"time":

more about consciousness than about material."}, {"time": 1238, "text": "That's a domain I'm very interested in."}, {"time": 1240, "text": "Right now, we have essentially zero to say about that in terms of validating those types of claims, but it's even interesting just to see what people say along those lines."}, {"time": 1249, "text": "So you're interested in saying like, can we more rigorously study this process of expansion?"}, {"time": 1254, "text": "Like, what do we mean by this expansion of your sense of what is possible in the experiences in this world?"}, {"time": 1262, "text": "Right, as much as what we can say about that through naturalistic psychology, especially as much as we can root it to solid psychological constructs and solid neuroscientific constructs."},

really into sort of theoretical physics these days at a very surface level and you can bring the language of physics, right?"}, {"time": 1322, "text": "And so that has to do with the language."}, {"time": 1324, "text": "Like if you read a Sean Carroll book or something recently, it seems like it has a huge influence on the way you might experience, might perceive the world and might experience the alteration that psychedelics brings to your perception system."}, {"time": 1343, "text": "So I wonder like the language you bring to the table, how that affects the journey you go on with the psychedelics."}, {"time": 1350, "text": "I think very much so."}, {"time": 1352, "text": "And I think there's, I'm a little concerned some of the science is going a little too far in the direction of around the edges, speaking about it changing beliefs in this sense or that sense about particular, in particular domains."}, {"time": 1368, "text": "And I think what really what a lot of what's going on is what you just discussed."}, {"time": 1373, "text": "It's the priors coming into it."}, {"time": 1376, "text": "So if you've been reading a lot of physics, then you might bring up like space time and interpret the experience in that sense."}, {"time": 1388, "text": "I mean, it's not uncommon for people come out talking about visions of the, it's not the most typical thing, but it's come up in sessions I've guided, the Big Bang and this sort of nature of reality."}, {"time": 1401, "text": "I think probably that the best way to think about these experiences is that, and the best evidence, even though we're in our infancy and understanding it, they really tap into more general psychological mechanisms."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "I think one of the best arguments is they reduce the influence of our priors, of what we bring into all of the assumptions that we all that we're essentially, especially as adults, we're riding on top of heuristic after heuristic to get through life."}, {"time": 1431, "text": "And you need to do that."}, {"time": 1433, "text": "And that's a good thing."}, {"time": 1434, "text": "And that's extremely efficient and evolution has shaped that, but that comes at an expense."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "And it seems that these experiences will allow someone greater mental flexibility and openness."}, {"time": 1452, "text": "And so one can be both less influenced by their prior assumptions, but still nonetheless the nature of the experience can be influenced by what they've been exposed to in the world."}, {"time": 1465, "text": "And sometimes they can get it in a deeper way."}, {"time": 1468, "text": "Like maybe they've read, I mean, I had a philosophy professor one time as a participant in a high dose psilocybin study."}, {"time": 1474, "text": "And I remember him saying, my God, it's like Hegel's opposites defining each other."}, {"time": 1480, "text": "Like, I get it."}, {"time": 1481, "text": "I've taught this thing for years and years and years."}, {"time": 1484, "text": "Like, I get it now."}, {"time": 1486, "text": "And so like that, you know, and even at the psychological, emotional level, like the cancer patients we worked with, you know, they told themselves a million times over this people trying to quit smoking, I need to quit smoking."}, {"time": 1498, "text": "Oh, I'm ruining my life with this cancer."},

in some sense that you bring some prize to the table, but psychedelics allow you to acknowledge them and then throw them away."}, {"time": 1523, "text": "So like one popular terminology around this in the engineering space is first principles thinking that Elon Musk, for example, espouses a lot."}, {"time": 1533, "text": "Let me ask a fun question before we return to a more serious discussion."},

influenced by psychedelic experience."}, {"time": 1601, "text": "I remember the, I think the person that came up with the concept of freeware or shareware, it's like it kind of was generated out of or influenced by psychedelic experience."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "So to this, I think there's incredible potential there and we know really next, there's no rigorous research on that, but."}, {"time":

depend on the person and their influences, but sometimes you come up with false positives."}, {"time": 1718, "text": "You connect the dots where maybe you shouldn't have connected those dots, but I think that can be constrained."}, {"time": 1724, "text": "And so much of our, not only our personal psychological suffering, but our limitations academically and in terms of technology are because of the self imposed limitations and heuristics, these entrenched ways of thinking."}, {"time": 1743, "text": "Like those examples throughout the history of science where someone has come up with the paradigm, Kuhn's paradigm shifts."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "It's like, here's something completely different."}, {"time": 1754, "text": "This doesn't make sense by any of the previous models."},

what science is about separating them from the valid paradigm shifting ideas."}, {"time": 1773, "text": "But we need more paradigm shifting ideas like in a big way."}, {"time": 1778, "text": "And I think we could, I think you could argue that we've, because of the structure of academia and science in modern times, it heavily biases against those."}, {"time": 1789, "text": "Right, there's all kinds of mechanisms in our human nature that resist paradigm shift quite sort of obviously."}, {"time": 1796, "text": "So, and psychedelics, there could be a lot of other tools but it seems like psychedelics could be one set of tools that encourage paradigm shifting thinking."}, {"time": 1808, "text": "So like the first principles kind of thinking."}, {"time": 1811, "text": "So it's a kind of, you're at the forefront of research here."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "There's just kind of anecdotal stories."}, {"time": 1818, "text": "There's early studies."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "There's a

the studies done."}, {"time": 1986, "text": "But the first thing I would do is like a really high dose session where you're not necessarily in front of your computer, which you can't really do on a really high dose."}, {"time": 1996, "text": "And then the work has been talked about, like you take a really high dose, you take a journey, and then the breakthroughs come from when you return from the journey and like integrate, quote unquote, that experience."}, {"time": 2009, "text": "I think that's where all the, again, we're babies at this point, but my gut tells me that it's the so called integration, the aftermath."}, {"time": 2018, "text": "We know that there's some different forms of neuroplasticity that are unfolding in the days following a psychedelics, at least in animals,

think you need even more credible, active controls or active placebo conditions to kind of tease this out."}, {"time": 2053, "text": "And then also in conjunction with that, and you can do this in the same study, you wanna combine that with more rigorous sort of experimental models where we actually give there a problem solving tasks that we know, for example, that you tend to do better on after you've gotten a good night's sleep versus not."}, {"time": 2070, "text": "And my sense is there's a relationship there."}, {"time": 2073, "text": "People go back to first principles, questioning those first principles they're operating under and getting away from their priors in terms of creative problem solving."}, {"time": 2085, "text": "And so I think wrap those things and you could speak a little more rigorously about those because ultimately, if everyone's bringing their own problem, that's more in the face valid side, but you can't dig in as much and get as much experimental power and

about three big hits, inhalations, in order to have what people call a breakthrough dose."}, {"time": 2325, "text": "And there's no great definition of that, but basically meaning moving away from,

the first exhalation, so we're talking about a few seconds in, or maybe just sometime between the first and the second hit, like it'll start to come on."}, {"time": 2363, "text": "And they're already up to, let's say, what they might get from a 30 milligram or 300 microgram LSD trip, a big trip."}, {"time": 2374, "text": "They're already there at the second hit, but their consciousness is geared,

interesting and it kind of points to something I was thinking about saying is that, I think what might be going on from a naturalistic perspective."}, {"time": 2635, "text": "So regardless, whether or not there are, it doesn't depend on autonomous entities out there."}, {"time": 2641, "text": "What might be happening is that just the associative net, the level of learning, the comprehension might be so beyond what someone is used to that the only way for the nervous system, for the aware sense of self to orient towards it is all by metaphor."}, {"time": 2667, "text": "And so I do think, when we get into these realms as a strong empiricist, I think we always gotta be careful and be as grounded as possible, but I'm also willing to speculate and sort of cast the nets wide with caveat."},

us."}, {"time": 2708, "text": "And this unlocks them in a certain kind of way."}, {"time": 2710, "text": "And we think about stories."}, {"time": 2711, "text": "Like our sense of self is basically, narrative self is a story."}, {"time": 2715, "text": "And we think about the world of stories."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "This is why metaphors are always more powerful than sort of laying out all the details all the time, speaking in parables."}, {"time": 2726, "text": "It's like, if you really get some, this is why, as much as I hate it, if you're presenting to Congress or something and you have all the best data in the world, it's not as powerful as that one anecdote as the mom dying of cancer that had the psilocybin session and it transformed her life."}, {"time": 2746, "text": "That's a story, that's meaningful."}, {"time": 2748, "text": "And so when this kind of unimaginable kind of change and experience happens with a DMT ingestion, these stories of entities, they might be that, stories that are constructed that is the closest, which is not to say the stories aren't real."}, {"time": 2769, "text": "I mean, I think we're getting to layers where it doesn't really, right."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "Yeah, but it's the closest we can come to making sense out of it."}, {"time": 2779, "text": "Because what we do know about these psychedelics, one of the levels beyond the receptor is that the brain is communicating it with itself in a massively different way."}, {"time": 2788, "text": "There's massive communication with areas that don't normally communicate."},

2802, "text": "I do think it comes with false positives, that could be some of the delusion."}, {"time": 2808, "text": "And so when you're so far out there, like with the DMT experience, like maybe

special club these days."}, {"time": 2904, "text": "So he definitely got onto my radar screen quickly."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "You were into both before it was cool."}, {"time": 2911, "text": "Right, I mean, this is all relative because there's people that were before the late 90s and early 2000s who were into it to say you're a Johnny come lately."}, {"time": 2919, "text": "But yeah, compared to where we're at now."}, {"time": 2922, "text": "But yet one of the things I always found fascinating by Joe's telling of his experiences I think is that they resemble very much Terrence McKenna's experiences with DMT and Joe has talked very much about Terrence McKenna and his experiences."}, {"time": 2943, "text": "If I had to guess, I would guess that probably just having heard Terrence McKenna talk about his experiences that that influenced the coloring of Joe's experience."}, {"time": 2955, "text": "It's funny how that works because I mean, that's why McKenna hasn't, I mean, poets and great orators give us the words to then like start to describe our experiences because our words are limited, our language is limited."}, {"time": 2970, "text": "And it's always nice to get some kind of nice poetry into the mix to allow us to put words to it."}, {"time": 2976, "text": "Right, but I also see some elements that seem to relate to Joe's psychology just from what I've seen from hours of watching him on his podcast is that he's a self critical guy."}, {"time": 2992, "text": "And I think with always his positive been, I'm always struck being a behavioral pharmacologist and no one else really says it about cannabis."}, {"time": 2999, "text": "I'll get back to the DMT thing about he likes the kind of the paranoid side of things."}, {"time": 3003,

and something's making you uncomfortable, like dig into that."}, {"time": 3013, "text": "And like, that's his, it's sort of along the lines of Goggins with exercise."}, {"time": 3016, "text": "And it's like, yeah, like things, learning experiences aren't supposed to be easy."}, {"time": 3021, "text": "Like take advantage of these uncomfortable experience."}, {"time": 3024, "text": "It's why we call in our research in a safe context with psychedelics, they're not bad trips, they're challenging experiences."}, {"time": 3032, "text": "Yes, yeah, that's fascinating."}, {"time": 3033, "text": "Just that's the tiny tangent."}, {"time": 3035, "text": "It's always cool for me to hear him talk about marijuana, like weed as the paranoia, the anxiety or whatever that you experience as actually the fuel for the experience."}, {"time": 3050, "text": "Like I think he talks about smoking weed when he's writing."}, {"time": 3054, "text": "That's inspiring to me because then you can't possibly have a bad experience."}, {"time": 3059, "text": "I'm a huge fan of that."}, {"time": 3060, "text": "Like every experience is good."}, {"time": 3063, "text": "Right, which is very Goggins."}, {"time": 3064, "text": "Yeah, yeah, is it bad?"}, {"time": 3066, "text": "Okay, all right, great, you know."}, {"time": 3068, "text": "Well, see Goggins is one side of that."}, {"time": 3069, "text": "He wants it bad."}, {"time": 3071, "text": "Like he wants the experience to be challenging always."}, {"time": 3074, "text": "But I mean like both are good."}, {"time": 3077, "text": "Like the few times of taking mushrooms, the experience was like everything was beautiful."}, {"time": 3086, "text": "There's zero challenging aspect to it."}, {"time": 3089, "text": "It was just like the world is beautiful and it gave me this deep appreciation of the world."}, {"time": 3095, "text": "I would say, so like that's amazing, but also ones that challenge you are also amazing."}, {"time": 3101, "text": "Like all the times I drink vodka, but that's another, let's not."}, {"time": 3105, "text": "So back to DMT."}, {"time": 3108, "text": "Yeah, Joe's treating cannabis as a psychedelic, which is something that I'd say like a lot of people treat it more like Xanax or like beer or vodka."}, {"time": 3119, "text": "But he's really trying to delve into those minor, it's been called a minor psychedelic."}, {"time": 3125, "text": "So with DMT, as you brought up, it's like the entity's mocking him."}, {"time": 3130, "text": "And it's like, you're not, I mean, this reminds me of him, him describing his, like writing his, or just his entire method of comedy."}, {"time": 3140, "text": "It's like, watch the tape of yourself."}, {"time": 3143, "text": "Don't just ignore it."}, {"time": 3144, "text": "Like that's where I screwed up."}, {"time": 3146, "text": "That's where I need to do better."}, {"time": 3148, "text": "This like sort of radical self examination, which I think our society is kind of getting away from because like, all the children win trophies type of thing."}, {"time": 3156, "text": "And it's like, no, no, don't go overboard, but like recognize when you've messed up."}, {"time": 3161, "text": "And so that's a big part of the psychedelic experience."}, {"time": 3165, "text": "Like people come out sometimes saying, my God, I need to say sorry to my mom."}, {"time": 3172, "text": "It's so obvious, or whatever interpersonal issue or like, my God, I'm not pulling enough weight around the house and helping my wife."}, {"time": 3182, "text": "And these things that are just obvious to them, the self criticism that can be a very positive thing if you act on it."}, {"time": 3192, "text": "You've mentioned addiction."}, {"time": 3193, "text": "Maybe we could take a little bit detour into a darker aspect of things, or not even darker, it's just an important aspect of things."}, {"time": 3202, "text": "What's the nature of addiction?"}, {"time": 3204, "text": "You've mentioned some things within the big umbrella of psychedelics may be usually not addictive, but maybe MDMA, I think you said might have some addictive properties, but the point is stuff outside of the psychedelics umbrella can often be highly addictive."}, {"time": 3223, "text": "So you've studied addiction from several angles, one of which is behavioral economics."}, {"time": 3229, "text": "What have you understood about addiction?"}, {"time": 3233, "text": "What is addiction from the biological physiological level to the psychological to whatever is the interesting way to talk about addiction?"}, {"time": 3242, "text": "Yeah, and the lenses that I view addiction through very much are behavioral economic, but I also think they converge on, I think it's beautiful at the other end of the spectrum, sort of just a completely humanistic psychology perspective."}, {"time": 3260, "text": "It converges on what people come out of, 12 step meetings talking about."}, {"time": 3264, "text": "Can you say what is behavioral economics and what is humanistic psychology?"}, {"time": 3270, "text": "Like, what do you mean by that?"}, {"time": 3271, "text": "And more importantly, behavioral economics lens, what is that?"}, {"time": 3274, "text": "Yeah, so behavioral economics, my definition of it is the application of economic principles, mostly microeconomic principles."}, {"time": 3281, "text": "So understanding the behavior of individual agents surrounding commodities in the marketplace, applying microeconomic types of analyses to non economic behavior."}, {"time": 3299, "text": "So basically at one point, like psychologists figured out that there's this whole other discipline that's been studying behavior, it just happened to be all focused on monetary behavior, spending and saving money, et cetera."}, {"time": 3312, "text": "But it comes with all of these like principles that can be wildly and fruitfully applied to understanding behavior."}, {"time": 3318, "text": "So for example, I've studied things like demand curve analysis of drug consumption."}, {"time": 3325, "text": "So I look at, for example, tobacco, cigarettes and nicotine products through the lens of demand curves."}, {"time": 3335, "text": "And in other words, at different prices, if there's different work requirements for being able to smoke cigarettes, sort of modeling price."}, {"time": 3345, "text": "Within that price data, there is some indication of addiction, how much the habits that you form around these particular drugs."}, {"time": 3354, "text": "It's one important dimension."}, {"time": 3356, "text": "So I think a particularly important one there is elasticity or inelasticity, two ends of the spectrum."}, {"time": 3362, "text": "So that's the price sensitivity."}, {"time": 3365, "text": "So for example, you could have something that's pretty price inelastic, like gasoline."}, {"time": 3374, "text": "So the price of gas at times can keep going up and Americans are just gonna pretty much buy the same amount of gas."}, {"time": 3381, "text": "Or maybe the price of gas doubles, but their consumption only decreases by 10%."}, {"time": 3386, "text": "So it's a sub proportional reduction."}, {"time": 3388, "text": "So that's an inelastic."}, {"time": 3390, "text": "And that changes, like you push the price up high enough."}, {"time": 3393, "text": "I mean, if it was $100 a gallon, it would eventually turn, the curve would turn and go downward more drastically and it would be elastic."}, {"time": 3401, "text": "But you can apply that to someone who, a regular cigarette smoker who was working for cigarette puffs, who's gone six hours without smoking."}, {"time": 3412, "text": "And you're asking questions like, how many times are they willing to pull this knob in the lab during this three hour session?"}, {"time": 3419, "text": "I do a lot of work like this in order to earn a cigarette."}, {"time": 3422, "text": "How does the content of nicotine in that affect?"}, {"time": 3425, "text": "It has the availability of nicotine replacement products like nicotine gum or eCigarettes affect those decisions."}, {"time": 3432, "text": "So it's a certain lens of, it's sort of a way to take the kind of the classic behavioral psychology definition of reinforcement, which is just basically reward."}, {"time": 3444, "text": "How much is this a good thing?"}, {"time": 3445, "text": "And it kind of breaks that apart into a multi dimensional space."}, {"time": 3451, "text": "So it's not just the ideas reward or reinforcement is not unit dimensional."}, {"time": 3456, "text": "So for example, you can unpack that with demand curves."}, {"time": 3459, "text": "At a cheap price, you might prefer one good to another."}, {"time": 3464, "text": "So the classic example is luxury versus necessity."}, {"time": 3467, "text": "So diamonds versus toilet paper."}, {"time": 3469, "text": "So at those cheap prices, you can look at something called intensity of demand."}, {"time": 3474, "text": "If it was basically as cheap as possible, or essentially zero, how much would you buy of this good?"}, {"time": 3479, "text": "But then you keep jacking up the price and you'll see, so diamonds will look like the better reward at that low price sort of intensity of demand side of things."}, {"time": 3489, "text": "But as you keep jacking up the price, you gotta have some toilet paper."}, {"time": 3493, "text": "And again, we can get into the whole bidet thing, but forget that, I know Joe's been pushing that too."}, {"time": 3501, "text": "You're gonna hang on and keep buying the toilet paper to a greater degree than you will the diamonds."}, {"time": 3506, "text": "So you'll see a crossing of demand curves."}, {"time": 3508, "text": "So what's the better reinforcer?"}, {"time": 3510, "text": "What's the better reward?"}, {"time": 3511, "text": "Depends on your price."}, {"time": 3513, "text": "And so that's an example of one way to look at addiction."}, {"time": 3519, "text": "So specifically drug consumption, which isn't all of addiction, but it's like in order for something to be addictive, it has to be a reward."}, {"time": 3528, "text": "And it has to compete with other rewards in your life."}, {"time": 3534, "text": "And one of the two main aspects of addiction in my view, and this doesn't map onto how the DSM, the psychiatry Bible defines addiction, which I think is largely bunk, but there's some value to have some common description, but it's how rewarding is it from this multi dimensional lens?"}, {"time": 3555, "text": "And specifically, how does that rewarding value compete with other rewards, other consequences in your life?"}, {"time": 3565, "text": "So it's not a problem if the use of that substance is rewarding."}, {"time": 3572, "text": "Okay, yeah, you like to have a couple of beers every once in a while, and it's like not a problem."}, {"time": 3578, "text": "But then you have the alcoholic who is drinking so much that it tanks their career, it ruins their marriage."}, {"time": 3587, "text": "It's in competition with these pro social aspects to their life."}, {"time": 3592, "text": "It's all about comparing to the other choices you're making, the other activities in your life."}, {"time": 3597, "text": "And if you evaluate it as a much higher reward than anything else, that becomes an addiction."}, {"time": 3606, "text": "And so it's not just the rewarding value, but it's the relative rewarding value."}, {"time": 3610, "text": "And the other major aspect, again, from behavioral economics, that the thing that makes addiction is something called delayed discounting."}, {"time": 3620, "text": "So in economics, sometimes it's called time preference."}, {"time": 3623, "text": "It's what compound interest rates are based upon."}, {"time": 3626, "text": "It's the idea that delaying a good access to a good or a reward comes with a certain decrement to its value."}, {"time": 3635, "text": "So we'd all rather have things now than later."}, {"time": 3639, "text": "And we can study this at the individual level of, would you rather have $9 today or $10 tomorrow?"}, {"time": 3648, "text": "And when you do that, you get huge differences between addicted populations and non addicted, not just heroin and cocaine, but like just cigarette smokers, like normal everyday cigarette smokers."}, {"time": 3662, "text": "And even when you look at something like monetary rewards."}, {"time": 3666, "text": "And so you can go into the rabbit hole with this delayed discounting model."}, {"time": 3670, "text": "So it's not only those huge differences that seem to have a face valid aspect to it."}, {"time": 3675, "text": "Like the cigarette smoker is choosing this thing that's rewarding today, but I know it comes with increased risk of having these horrible consequences down the line."}, {"time": 3684, "text": "So it's this competition between what's good for me now and what's good for me later."}, {"time": 3688, "text": "And the other aspect about delayed discounting is that if you quantitatively map out that discounting curve over time, so you don't just do that $10 tomorrow, how much is it worth to you today?"}, {"time": 3705, "text": "So you can say, what about nine?"}, {"time": 3706, "text": "What about eight?"}, {"time": 3707, "text": "What about $7?"}, {"time": 3708, "text": "And you can titrate it to find that indifference point."}, {"time": 3711, "text": "And so we can say, aha, $10 tomorrow is worth $6 today."}, {"time": 3717, "text": "So it's by the one day it's decreased by 40%."}, {"time": 3720, "text": "We can do that also at one week and one month and one year and 10 years and map out that curve, get a shape of that curve."}, {"time": 3729, "text": "And one of the fascinating things about this is that whether you're talking about pigeons, making these types of choices between a little bit of food now or a little bit of food a minute from now or rats, or like dozens of species of animals tested, including humans, the tendency is pretty consistently that we discount hyperbolically rather than exponentially."}, {"time": 3751, "text": "And what exponentially means is that every unit of time is associated with the same proportional reduction."}, {"time": 3757, "text": "Every unit of delay is associated with the same, causes the same proportional reduction in value."}, {"time": 3762, "text": "And that's the way the compound interest rate works."}, {"time": 3767, "text": "Every day you get this sort of out of whatever values in there at the beginning of that day, you get this, we'll give you this amount of extra money to compensate you for that delay."}, {"time": 3781, "text": "But then the way that all animals tend to function is of this very different way where the reductions, the initial, that initial delay, so like one day's worth of delay, you see a much stronger discounting rate or reduction in value than you do over those."}, {"time": 3800, "text": "So you see the super proportional, then it changes to these lesser rates."}, {"time": 3806, "text": "And so the implication of that, I know I've gone like really into the weeds quantitatively, but what that means is that there's these preference reversals."}, {"time": 3814, "text": "When you have curves of that nature, the decay that's hyperbolic, it maps onto this phenomenon we see both in terms of how people deal with future rewards, but also how perception works."}, {"time": 3832, "text": "When two things are far away, whether it's physical distance or whether in terms of perception or whether it's in terms of time, when you're really far away, the value, the subjective value for that further, that delayed reward is larger."}, {"time": 3848, "text": "So for example, like, let's say we're talking about 360, 364 days from now, you can get $9 or 365 days a year."}, {"time": 3861, "text": "Now you get $10 and you're like, dude, it's like, it's a year, like no difference."}, {"time": 3865, "text": "Like I'll take, why not get one more dollar?"}, {"time": 3869, "text": "You bring that same exact set of choices closer."}, {"time": 3871, "text": "Nothing's changed other than the time to both rewards."}, {"time": 3874, "text": "And it's like, would you rather have $9 today or $10 tomorrow and plenty of people would say, eh, just about the same, let's go ahead and take it today."}, {"time": 3883, "text": "So you see this preference reversal."}, {"time": 3885, "text": "And so that's a model of addiction in the sense that consistently with true addiction, I would argue, you see this competition between molar and molecular utility."}, {"time": 3901, "text": "It's like interpersonal, like within the person competing agents."}, {"time": 3907, "text": "Someone sometimes has control of the bus that wants to do what's good for you in the short term."}, {"time": 3914, "text": "And someone at other times is in control of driving the bus and they want to do what's good for you in the long term."}, {"time": 3922, "text": "So you tell the, you're trying to quit and you see a doctor, you see your 12 step therapist and say, God, I know this stuff is killing me."}, {"time": 3930, "text": "Like, I'm really, I'm on the path, like I'm done."}, {"time": 3935, "text": "And that's when you're kind of in their office or wherever you're not, it's not around you."}, {"time": 3939, "text": "And then later on that day, your buddy says that, hey man, I just scored."}, {"time": 3942, "text": "I got it right here."}, {"time": 3943, "text": "Do you want it?"}, {"time": 3944, "text": "And that reward is right in front of you."}, {"time": 3945, "text": "That's like bringing those two choices right in front of you."}, {"time": 3948, "text": "And it's like, hell yeah, I want to use."}, {"time": 3950, "text": "And then you can go through that cycle for like years of the person telling themselves, I want to quit."}, {"time": 3956, "text": "But then other times that same person is saying, I don't want to, you know, functionally, they're saying, I don't want to, because they're saying, yeah, like, yeah, give me some."}, {"time": 3964, "text": "So in the moment, it's very difficult to quit."}, {"time": 3967, "text": "And this isn't just something, this is something that has huge clinical ramifications with addiction, but it's like all humans do it."}, {"time": 3973, "text": "Anyone who's hit the snooze alarm in the morning, like the night before they realize, oh, I got to get up extra early tomorrow."}, {"time": 3979, "text": "That's what's ultimately better for me."}, {"time": 3981, "text": "So I'm going to set the alarm for, you know, 5 a.m. And it goes off at 5 a.m., you know, and then, so now those two consequences have come sooner and it's like, what the hell?"}, {"time": 3995, "text": "And they hit the snooze alarm."}, {"time": 3997, "text": "And sometimes not just once, but then five minutes later and five minutes later, you know, and so, and it's why it's easier to exercise self control at the grocery store compared to in your fridge."}, {"time": 4008, "text": "Like if that snack is like 30 seconds away in your fridge, you're going to more likely yield to temptation than if it is further away."}, {"time": 4021, "text": "So then just take a step back to something you brought up earlier, the inelasticity of pricing."}, {"time": 4028, "text": "Is it from a perspective of the dealers, whether we're talking about cigarettes or maybe venturing slightly into the illegal realm, you know, of people who sell drugs illegally, they also have an economics to them that they set prices and all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4049, "text": "Does addiction allow you to mess with the nature of pricing?"}, {"time": 4055, "text": "Like, so I kind of assume that you meant that there's a correlation between things you're addicted to and the inelasticity of the price."}, {"time": 4064, "text": "So you can jack up the price."}, {"time": 4066, "text": "Is there something interesting to be said both for legal drugs and illegal drugs about the kind of price games you can play because the consumers of the product are addicted?"}, {"time": 4083, "text": "Right, I mean, I think you just described it."}, {"time": 4086, "text": "Yeah, you can jack up the price and you know, some people are going to drop off, but the people, you know, and it's not dichotomous because you could just consume less, but some people are going to consume less and the people that are most addicted are going to keep, you know, I mean, you see this, they're going to keep purchasing."}, {"time": 4103, "text": "So you see this with cigarettes."}, {"time": 4104, "text": "And so it's interesting when you interface this with policy, like in one respect, heavily taxing cigarettes is a good thing."}, {"time": 4112, "text": "We know it keeps adolescents particularly price sensitive."}, {"time": 4116, "text": "So you definitely, people smoke less and especially kids smoke less when you keep cigarette prices high and you tax the hell out of them."}, {"time": 4124, "text": "But one of the downsides you've got to balance and keep in mind is that you disproportionately have working class, poor people."}, {"time": 4132, "text": "And then you get into a point where someone's spending, you know, a quarter of their paycheck on cigarettes."}, {"time": 4136, "text": "So they're going to smoke no matter what."}, {"time": 4138, "text": "And basically because they're addicted, they're going to smoke no matter what."}, {"time": 4142, "text": "And you're just, yeah, you're taxing their existence."}, {"time": 4146, "text": "Right, so you're making it worse for them."}, {"time": 4148, "text": "If they don't, if they are completely inelastic, you're actually making that person's life worse."}, {"time": 4152, "text": "Because we know that by interfering with the amount of money they have, you're interfering with the other pro social, the potential competitors to smoking, you know."}, {"time": 4163, "text": "And we know that when someone's in more impoverished environments and they have less sort of non drug alternatives, you know, the more likely they're going to stay addicted."}, {"time": 4175, "text": "Is there data, this is interesting, from a scientific perspective of those same kind of games in illegal drugs?"}, {"time": 4185, "text": "Sort of, because that's where most drug, I was, I mean, I don't know, maybe you can correct me, but it seems like most drugs are currently illegal."}, {"time": 4196, "text": "And so, but there's still an economics to them, obviously."}, {"time": 4200, "text": "That's the drug war and so on."}, {"time": 4201, "text": "Is there data on the setting of prices or like how good are the business people running the selling of drugs that are illegal?"}, {"time": 4211, "text": "Are they all the same kind of rules apply from a behavioral economics perspective?"}, {"time": 4216, "text": "I mean, they're basically, whether they're crunching the numbers or not, they're basically sensitive to that demand curve and they're doing the same thing that businesses do in a legal market."}, {"time": 4227, "text": "And, you know, you want to sell as much of a product to get as much money."}, {"time": 4232, "text": "You're looking more at the total income."}, {"time": 4233, "text": "So if you jack the price a little bit, you're going to get some reduction in consumption, but it may be that the total amount of money that you rake in is going to be more than, it's going to overcompensate for that."}, {"time": 4246, "text": "So you're willing to take, okay, I'm going to lose 10% of my customers, but I'm getting more than enough to compensate from that, from the extra money from the people who still are buying."}, {"time": 4255, "text": "So I think they're more, you know, and especially when we get to the lower, I wouldn't be surprised if people are crunching those numbers and looking at demand curves, maybe at the, you know, at the really high levels of the, you know, up the chain with the cartels and whatnot."}, {"time": 4267, "text": "I don't know, that wouldn't surprise me at all, but I think it's probably more implicit at the lower levels where something, you brought up drug policy."}, {"time": 4277, "text": "I will say that for years now, it's been this kind of unquestioned goal by, for example, the drug czar's office in the US to make the price of illegal drugs as high as possible without this kind of nuanced approach that, yeah, if you make, you know, for some people, if you make the price so high, you're actually making things worse."}, {"time": 4303, "text": "I mean, I'm all about reducing the problems associated with drugs and drug addictions."}, {"time": 4308, "text": "And part of that is the, are more direct consequences of those drugs themselves, but a whole lot is what you get from indirectly and, you know, sort of the, both for the individual and for society."}, {"time": 4322, "text": "So like making a poor person who doesn't have enough money for their kids, making them even poorer."}, {"time": 4326, "text": "So now you've made their children's future worse because they're growing up in deeper poverty because you've essentially levied a tax onto this person who's heavily addicted."}, {"time": 4338, "text": "But then at the societal level, you know, so everything we know about the drug war in terms of the heavy criminalization and filling up prisons and reducing employment and educational opportunities, which in the big picture, we know are the things that in a free market compete against some of the worst problems of addiction is actually having educational and employment opportunities."}, {"time": 4362, "text": "But when you give someone a felony, for example, you're pretty much guaranteeing they're never gonna go very high on the economic ladder."}, {"time": 4370, "text": "And so you're making drugs a better reward for that person's future."}, {"time": 4376, "text": "So this is a quick step into the policy realm."}, {"time": 4380, "text": "And I think for both you and I, I'm not sure you can correct me, but I'm more comfortable into studying the effects of drugs on the human behavior and human psychology versus like policy."}, {"time": 4393, "text": "It seems like a whole giant mess, but yeah, there's some libertarian candidates for president and just libertarian thinkers that had a nice thought experiment of possibly legalizing, I've spoken about possibly legalizing basically all drugs."}, {"time": 4412, "text": "In your intuition, do you think a world where all drugs are legal is a safer world or a less safe world for the users of those drugs?"}, {"time": 4425, "text": "It really depends on what we mean by legalization."}, {"time": 4427, "text": "So this is one of my beefs with this, how these things are talked about."}, {"time": 4432, "text": "I mean, we have very few completely laissez faire, you know, legal drugs."}, {"time": 4439, "text": "So even caffeine is one of the few examples."}, {"time": 4442, "text": "So for example, caffeine and tea and coffee is in that realm."}, {"time": 4445, "text": "Like there's no limits, no one's testing, there's no laws, regulation at any level of how much caffeine you're allowed to buy or how much is in the product."}, {"time": 4452, "text": "But even like with this Starbucks, like nitro, there are rules with soda and with canned products, you can only put so much."}, {"time": 4459, "text": "In there, yeah."}, {"time": 4460, "text": "So this is FDA regulated."}, {"time": 4462, "text": "And it's kind of weird because there's a limit to sodas that's not there for energy drinks and other things."}, {"time": 4467, "text": "But, you know, so even caffeine, it depends on what product we're talking about."}, {"time": 4471, "text": "Like if you're like no dose and other caffeine products over the counter, like you can't just put 800 milligrams in there."}, {"time": 4476,

severely damaging to the nervous system."}, {"time": 4498, "text": "Pretty much legal, but there's some regulation in the sense that there's a warning label, like it's illegal to do it for, not that they're busting people for this, but, you know, it's against federal law to use this in a way other than intended type of, basically saying like, yeah, don't huff this, you know, your paint thinner or whatnot."}, {"time": 4519, "text": "It at least keeps people from selling it for that."}, {"time": 4522, "text": "Like, no, because they're gonna go after that person."}, {"time": 4524, "text":

the so called illegal, like schedule one drugs, psilocybin, we do plenty in terms of schedule two, which is ironically less restrictive than psilocybin, but methamphetamine and cocaine, I've done human research with."}, {"time": 4545, "text": "My research has been legal."}, {"time": 4547, "text": "So they're scheduled compounds, but they're not completely illegal."}, {"time": 4549, "text": "Like you can do research with them with the appropriate licenses and approval."}, {"time": 4555, "text": "So there really is no such thing."}, {"time": 4557, "text": "And like alcohol, well, it's illegal if you're 12 years old or 18 years old or 20 years old."}, {"time": 4563, "text": "And for anyone, it's illegal to be drinking it while you're driving."}, {"time": 4566, "text": "So there's always a nuance."}, {"time": 4569, "text": "It's not dichotomy."}, {"time": 4571, "text": "And I actually should admit, it's been on my to do list for a while to buy in Massachusetts, some like edible, or buy weed legally."}, {"time": 4581, "text": "Yeah, haven't done that in Massachusetts, let's put it this way."}, {"time": 4584, "text": "And I wonder what that experience is like, because I think it's fully legal in Massachusetts."}, {"time": 4591, "text": "And so I wonder what legal drugs look like to me."}, {"time": 4595, "text": "You know, I grew up with even weed being like, you

progress."}, {"time": 4628, "text": "There's clearly a change."}, {"time": 4629, "text": "Right, it's moving in a trend."}, {"time": 4631, "text": "So that's the example of a drug that used to be illegal is now becoming more and more and more legal."}, {"time": 4637, "text": "So like, I wonder what like cocaine being legal looks like, what a society with cocaine being legal looks like, the

help for overdose."}, {"time": 4664, "text": "I don't know, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 4666, "text": "It does in a utopian sense feel like legalizing drugs at least should be talked about

enough that, for example, like I think safe injection sites for hard drugs makes a lot of sense."}, {"time": 4747, "text": "Like I wouldn't want heroin and cocaine at the convenience stores."},

education."}, {"time": 4811, "text": "But then I think with the opioids, like the big part of it is just like with naloxone, which is an antagonist, it goes into the receptor, it's called Narcan,

that we can save people."}, {"time": 4911, "text": "You know, so you could, the level that's been more explored in Switzerland is in some places is you actually provide the drug itself and you

kids, people's uncles, people's like, these are real lives that are being shattered."}, {"time": 4963, "text": "So you just look at that."}, {"time": 4965, "text": "And then the other thing, and I know this from having done residential, even like non treatment research, where we just have a cocaine user or something, stay on our inpatient ward for a month and you really get to know them."},

their drug use."}, {"time": 4985, "text": "Even if they're not looking to quit."}, {"time": 4987, "text": "And it's like, you know, you could imagine that in the safe injection settings where it's

every other drug we're moving away from the prohibition model slowly, but the big barge ship is like making a very slow turn."}, {"time": 5492, "text": "And like, okay, we really had to step back and question if we went with nicotine, tobacco, are we moving into that direction?"}, {"time": 5501, "text": "Like big picture."}, {"time": 5503, "text": "It doesn't quite make sense."}, {"time": 5505, "text": "You've done a study on cocaine and sexual decision making."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "Can you explain the findings?"}, {"time": 5516, "text": "I mean, in a broad sense, how do you do a study that involves cocaine and the other, how do you do a study involving sexual decision making?"}, {"time": 5533, "text": "And then how do you do a study that combines both?"}, {"time": 5536, "text": "Yeah, sex and drugs too."}, {"time": 5538, "text": "I'm just missing the rock and roll."}, {"time": 5539, "text": "It's like the two controversial, rock and roll isn't very controversial anymore."}, {"time": 5543, "text": "Yeah, so the cocaine, lots of hoops to jump through."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "You gotta have a lot of medical support."}, {"time": 5548, "text": "You gotta be at a basically an institution, a research unit like I'm at that has a long history and the ability to do that and get ethics approval, get FDA approval, but it's possible."}, {"time": 5561, "text": "And whenever you're dealing with something like cocaine, you would never wanna give that to someone who hasn't already used cocaine."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "And you wanna make sure you're not giving it to someone who is an active user who wants to quit."}, {"time": 5573, "text": "So the idea is like, okay, if you're using this type of drug anyway, and we're really sure you're not looking to quit, hey, use a couple of times in the lab with us so we can at least learn something."}, {"time": 5586, "text": "And part of what we learn is maybe to help people not use and it'll reduce the harms of cocaine."}, {"time": 5592, "text": "So there's hoops to jump through."}, {"time": 5594, "text": "With the sexual decision making, I looked at the main thing I looked at was this model of I applied delayed discounting to what we talked about earlier, the now versus later, that kind of decision making that goes along with addiction."}, {"time": 5607, "text": "I applied that to condom use decisions."}, {"time": 5610, "text": "And I've done probably published about 20 or so papers with this and different drugs."}, {"time": 5616, "text": "So the primary metric is whether you do or don't use a condom?"}, {"time": 5620, "text": "Right, and so this is using hypothetical decision making, but I've published some studies looking at, showing a tight correspondence to self report it in correlational studies to self reported behavior."}, {"time": 5634, "text": "So this is like, so like how do you, did you do a questionnaire kind of thing?"}, {"time": 5639, "text": "Right, so it's not quite a questionnaire, but it's a behavioral task requiring them to respond to."}, {"time": 5648, "text": "So you show pictures of a bunch of individuals and it's kind of like one of these fun behavioral, like a lot of them you get like numbers are boring, but it's like, okay, hot or not, like which of these 60 people would you have a one night stand with?"}, {"time": 5660, "text": "Men, women, so pick whatever you like, a little bit of this, a little bit of that, whatever you're into, it's all variety there."}, {"time": 5666, "text": "Out of that group, you pick some subsets of people."}, {"time": 5669, "text": "Who do you think is the one you most want to have sex with the least, he thinks most likely to have an STI or least likely a sexually transmitted disease by STI."}, {"time": 5677, "text": "And then you could do certain decision making questions."}, {"time": 5681, "text": "So what I've done is asked, say this person you read a vignette, this person wants to have sex with you now you've met them, you get along casual sex scenario, like a one night stand with a condoms available, just rate your likelihood from one to 100 on this kind of scale, would you use it?"}, {"time": 5697, "text": "But then you can change your scenario to say, okay, now imagine you have to wait five minutes to use a condom."}, {"time": 5702, "text": "So the choice is now instead of using condom versus not in terms of your likelihood scale, it now what ranges from have sex now without a condom versus on the other end of the scale is wait five minutes to have sex with a condom."}, {"time": 5716, "text": "So you rate your likelihood of where your behavior would be along that continuum."}, {"time": 5720, "text": "And then you could say, okay, well, what about an hour?"}, {"time": 5722, "text": "What about three hours?"}, {"time": 5723, "text": "What about 24 hours?"}, {"time": 5725, "text": "Misunderstanding, now without a condom or five minutes later with a condom?"}, {"time": 5733, "text": "So what's supposed to be the preference for the person?"}, {"time": 5741, "text": "There's a lot of factors coming into play, right?"}, {"time": 5744, "text": "There's like pleasure, a personal preference and then there's also the safety."}, {"time": 5751, "text": "Those are two like, are those competing objectives?"}, {"time": 5755, "text": "Right, and so we do get at that through some individual measures and this task is more of a face valid task where there's a lot underneath the hood."}, {"time": 5762, "text": "So for most people, sex with the condom is the better reward but underneath the hood of that is just at the purely physical level, they'd rather have sex without the condom."}, {"time": 5773, "text": "It's gonna feel better."}, {"time": 5774, "text": "What do you mean by reward?"}, {"time": 5775, "text": "Like when they calculate their trajectory through life and try to optimize it, then sex with the condom is a good idea?"}, {"time": 5784, "text": "Well, it's really based on, I mean, yeah, yeah."}, {"time": 5787, "text": "Presumably that's the case that there's, but it's measured by like what would you, really that first question where there is no delay."}, {"time": 5795, "text": "Most people say they would be at the higher end scale a lot of times 100% they would say they would definitely use a condom."}, {"time": 5801, "text": "Not everybody and that we know that's the case."}, {"time": 5803, "text": "See, it's like that some people don't like condoms, some people say, yeah, I wanna use a condom but quarter of the time ended up not because I just getting lost in the passion of the moment."}, {"time": 5813, "text": "So for the people, I mean, the only reason that people, so behaviorally speaking, at least for a large number of people in many circumstances condom use as a reinforcer just because people do it."}, {"time": 5823, "text": "Like, why are they doing it?"}, {"time": 5827, "text": "They're not because it makes the sex feel better but because it makes that it allows for at least the same general reward."}, {"time": 5835, "text": "Even if actually, even if it feels a little bit not as good with the condom, nonetheless, they get most of the benefit without the concurrent, oh my gosh, there's this risk of either unwanted pregnancy or getting HIV or way more likely than HIV, herpes in general awards, et cetera, all the lovely ones."}, {"time": 5857, "text": "And we've actually done research saying like where we gauge the probability of these individual different SDIs."}, {"time": 5862, "text": "And it's like, what's the heavy hitter in terms of what people are using to judge and to evaluate whether they're gonna use a condom."}, {"time": 5869, "text": "So that's why the condom use is the delayed thing, five minutes or more."}, {"time": 5874, "text": "And then, yeah, because that's the prefer."}, {"time": 5876, "text": "Which would normally be the larger later reward like the $10 versus the nine, it's like the $10, which is counterintuitive if you just think about the physical pleasure."}, {"time": 5884, "text": "So that's a good thing to measure."}, {"time": 5887, "text": "So condom use is a really good concrete, quantifiable thing that you can use in a study."}, {"time": 5893, "text": "And then you can add a lot of different elements like the presence of cocaine and so on."}, {"time": 5898, "text": "Yeah, you can get people loaded on like any number of drugs like cocaine, alcohol and methamphetamine are the three that I've done and published on."}, {"time": 5904, "text": "And it's interesting that."}, {"time": 5906, "text": "These are fun studies, man."}, {"time": 5908, "text": "Right, I love to get people loaded in a safe context and like, but to really, it started, like there was some early research with alcohol."}, {"time": 5916, "text": "I mean, the psychedelics are the most interesting, but it's like all of these drugs are fascinating."}, {"time": 5920, "text": "The fact that all of these are keys that unlock a certain like psychological experience in the head."}, {"time": 5926, "text": "And so there was this work with alcohol that showed that it didn't affect those monetary delay discounting decisions, $9 now versus $10 later."}, {"time": 5934, "text": "And I'm like getting people drunk."}, {"time": 5937, "text": "And I thought to myself, are you telling me that getting someone, that people being drunk does not cause people at least sometimes to make, to choose what's good for them in the short term at the expense of what's good for them in the long term."}, {"time": 5953, "text": "It's like, bullshit, like we see like, but in what context does that happen?"}, {"time": 5959, "text": "So that's something that inspired me to go in this direction of like, aha, risky sexual decisions is something they do when they're drunk."}, {"time": 5967, "text": "They don't necessarily go home."}, {"time": 5968, "text": "And even though some people have gambling problems and alcohol interacts with that, the most typical thing is not for people to go home, log on and change their allocation in their retirement account or something like that."}, {"time": 5980, "text": "But they're more likely, risky sexual decisions, they're more likely to not wait the five minutes for the condom and instead go no condom now."}, {"time": 5988, "text": "Right, that's a big effect."}, {"time": 5989, "text": "And we see that."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "And interestingly, we do not see, with those different drugs, we don't see an effect if we just look at that zero delay condition."}, {"time": 5997, "text": "In other words, the condoms right there waiting to be used, how likely are to use it?"}, {"time": 6000, "text": "You don't see it."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "I mean, people are by and large gonna use the condom."}, {"time": 6005, "text": "So, and that's the way most of this research outside of behavioral economics that just looked at condom use decisions, very little of which has ever actually administered the drugs, which is another unique aspect."}, {"time": 6017, "text": "But they usually just look at like assuming the condom is there."}, {"time": 6020, "text": "But this is more using behavioral economics to delve in and model something that, and I've done survey research on this, modeling what actually happens."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "Like you meet someone at a laundromat, like you weren't planning on like, and it's like one thing leads to another, they live around the corner, these things."}, {"time": 6037, "text": "And like we did one survey with men who have sex with men and found that 25% of them, 24%, about a quarter, reported in the last six months that they had unprotected anal intercourse, which is the most risky in terms of sexually transmitted infection."}, {"time": 6058, "text": "In the last six months, in a situation where they would have used a condom, but they simply didn't use one just because they didn't have one on them."}, {"time": 6064, "text": "So this to me, it's like, if unless we delve into this and understand this, these suboptimal conditions, we're not gonna fully address the problem."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "There's plenty of people that say, yep, condom use is good."}, {"time": 6077, "text": "I use it a lot of the time."}, {"time": 6079, "text": "It's like, where is that failing?"}, {"time": 6081, "text": "And it's under these suboptimal conditions, which in Frank, if you think about it, it's like most of the case."}, {"time": 6086, "text": "Action is unfolding, things are getting hot and heavy."}, {"time": 6088, "text": "Someone's like, do you got a condom?"}, {"time": 6091, "text": "Eh, no."}, {"time": 6092, "text": "It's like, do they break the action and take 10 minutes to go to the convenience store or whatever?"}, {"time": 6098, "text": "Maybe everything's closed."}, {"time": 6099, "text": "Maybe they gotta wait till tomorrow."}, {"time": 6102, "text": "And there's something to be studied there on the, that just seems like an unfortunate set of circumstances."}, {"time": 6109, "text": "Like, what's the solution to that is, I mean, what's the psychology that needs to be taken apart there?"}, {"time": 6120, "text": "Because it just seems like that's the way of life."}, {"time": 6122, "text": "We don't expect the things to happen."}, {"time": 6125, "text": "Are we supposed to expect them better to be self aware enough about our calculations?"}, {"time": 6131, "text": "Or you see the 10 minute detour to a convenience store as a kind of thing that we need to understand how we humans evaluate the cost of that."}, {"time": 6146, "text": "I think in terms of like how we use this to help people, it's mostly on the environment side, rather than on the individual side."}, {"time": 6154, "text": "Yeah, although those interact."}, {"time": 6156, "text": "So it's like, in one sense, if you're, especially if you're gonna be drinking or using another substance that is associated with a stimulant, alcohol and stimulants go along with risky sex."}, {"time": 6167, "text": "Good to be aware that you might make decisions just to tell yourself you might make a decision that you wouldn't have made in your sober state."}, {"time": 6174, "text": "And so, hey, throwing a condom in the purse, in the pocket, might be a good idea."}, {"time": 6180, "text": "I think at the environmental level, just more condom, I mean, it highlights what we know about just making condoms widely available."}, {"time": 6187, "text": "Something that I'd like to do is like reinforcing condom use."}, {"time": 6192, "text": "So just getting people used to carrying a condom everywhere they go."}, {"time": 6198, "text": "Because once it's in someone's habit, if they are, say, like a young, single person, and they occasionally have unprotected sex, like training those people, like what if you got a text message once every few days saying, ah, if you send back a photo of a condom, within a minute you get a reward of $5."}, {"time": 6217, "text": "You could shape that up like that."}, {"time": 6219, "text": "It's a process called contingency management."}, {"time": 6220, "text": "It's basically just straight up operant reinforcement."}, {"time": 6223, "text": "You could shape that up with no problem."}, {"time": 6225, "text": "And I mean, those procedures of contingency management, giving people systematic rewards is like, for example, the most powerful way to reduce cocaine use in addicted people."}, {"time": 6237, "text": "And by saying, if you show me a negative urine for cocaine, I'm gonna give you a monetary reward."}, {"time": 6245, "text": "And like that has huge effects in terms of decreasing cocaine use."}, {"time": 6249, "text": "If that can be that powerful for something like stopping cocaine use, how powerful could that be for shaping up just carrying a condom?"}, {"time": 6256, "text": "Because the primary, unlike cocaine use, here, we're not saying you can't have the main reward, like you could still have sex, and you can even have sex in the way that you tell yourself you'd rather do it if the condom is available."}, {"time": 6275, "text": "Relatively speaking, it's way easier than like not using cocaine if you like using cocaine."}, {"time": 6279, "text": "It's just basically getting in the habit of carrying a condom."}, {"time": 6283, "text": "So that's just one idea of like why."}, {"time": 6285, "text": "There could be also the capitalistic solutions of like, there could be a business opportunity for like a door dash for condoms."}, {"time": 6292, "text": "Like delivery."}, {"time": 6293, "text": "I thought about this."}, {"time": 6295, "text": "Within five minute delivery of a condom at any location, like Uber for condoms."}, {"time": 6299, "text": "I've thought about it, not with condoms, but a very similar line of thinking, a line that you're going into in terms of Uber and people getting drunk when they enter the bar playing to have one or two, they ended up having five or six, and it's like, okay, yeah, you can take the cab home, the Uber home, but you've left your car there."}, {"time": 6317, "text": "It might get towed."}, {"time": 6318, "text": "You might like, there's also the hassle of just, you wanna wake up tomorrow with your hangover and forget about it and move on."}, {"time": 6324, "text": "And I think a lot of people in their situation, they're like, screw it."}, {"time": 6327, "text": "I'm gonna take the risk, just get it."}, {"time": 6329, "text": "What if you had an Uber service where two, you have a car come out with two drivers and one of them, two sober drivers, obviously, and the person, the one driver drops off the other that then drives you home in their car, in your car, so that you can, I mean, I think a lot of people would pay 50 bucks."}, {"time": 6359, "text": "It's gonna be more than a regular Uber, but it's like, it's gonna be done."}, {"time": 6362, "text": "I got the money."}, {"time": 6363, "text": "I already spent 60 bucks at the bar tonight."}, {"time": 6366, "text": "Like, just get the damn thing done tomorrow."}, {"time": 6369, "text": "I'm done with it."}, {"time": 6370, "text": "I wake up, my car's in front of my house."}, {"time": 6372, "text": "I think that would be, I think someone could, I'm not gonna open that business, so if anyone hears this and wants to take off with that, I think it could help a lot of people."}, {"time": 6381, "text": "And Uber itself, I would say, helped a huge amount of people, just making it easy to make the decision of going home, not driving yourself."}, {"time": 6391, "text": "I read about in Austin where they, I don't know where it's at now, where they outlawed Uber for a while."}, {"time": 6396, "text": "You know, because of the whole taxicab union type thing and how just, yeah, there were like hordes of drunk people that were used to Uber that now didn't have a cheap alternative."}, {"time": 6407, "text": "So just, we didn't exactly mention, you've done a lot of studies in sexual decision making with different drugs."}, {"time": 6415, "text": "Is there some interesting insights or findings on the difference between the different drugs?"}, {"time": 6423, "text": "So I think you said meth as well."}, {"time": 6426, "text": "So cocaine, is there some interesting characteristics about decision making that these drugs alter versus like alcohol, all those kinds of things?"}, {"time": 6434, "text": "I think, and there's much more to study with this, but I think the biggie there is that the stimulants, they create risky sex by really increasing the rewarding value of sex."}, {"time": 6446, "text": "Like if you talk to people that are really, especially that are hooked on stimulants, one of the biggies is like sex on coke or meth is like so much better than sex without."}, {"time": 6455, "text": "And that's a big part of why they have trouble quitting because it's so tied to their sex life."}, {"time": 6461, "text": "So it's not that your decision making is broken, it's just that you, well, you allocate."}, {"time": 6466, "text": "It's a different aspect of their decision."}, {"time": 6468, "text": "Yeah, on the reward side."}, {"time": 6469, "text": "I think on the alcohol, it works more through disinhibition."}, {"time": 6472, "text": "It's like, alcohol is really good at reducing the ability of a delayed punisher to have an effect on current behavior."}, {"time": 6480, "text": "In other words, there's this bad thing that's gonna happen tomorrow or a week from now or 20 years from now."}, {"time": 6487, "text": "Being drunk is a really good way, and you see this in like rats making decisions."}, {"time": 6492, "text": "A high dose of alcohol makes someone less sensitive to those consequences."}, {"time": 6496, "text": "So I think that's the lever that's being hit with alcohol and it's the more, just the increasing the rewarding value of sex by the psycho stimulants on that side."}, {"time": 6506, "text": "We actually found that it, and it was amazing because like hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent by NIH to study the connection between cocaine and HIV."}, {"time": 6515, "text": "Like we ran the first study on my grant that like actually just gave people cocaine under double blind conditions and showed that like, yeah, when people are on coke, like their ratings of sexual desire, even though they're not in a sexual situation, yeah, you've shown them some pictures, but they're just saying they're horny."}, {"time": 6533, "text": "Like you get subjective ratings of like how much sexual desire are you feeling right now."}, {"time": 6537, "text": "People get horny when they're on stimulants."}, {"time": 6540, "text": "And a lot of people say, duh, if they really know these drugs."}, {"time": 6544, "text": "But that's a rigorous study that's in the lab that shows like there's a plot."}, {"time": 6549, "text": "Right, the dose effects of that, the time course of that."},

"text": "Yeah, we didn't say horniness."}, {"time": 6562, "text": "We said sexual arousal, yeah, basically, yeah."}, {"time": 6564, "text": "There's a plot, I'm gonna find this plot."}, {"time": 6566, "text": "Right, I'll send it to you."}, {"time": 6567, "text": "There was one headline from some publicity on the work that said, horny cocaine users don't use condoms or something like that."},

{"time": 6583, "text": "So you've published a bunch of studies on psychedelics."}, {"time": 6587, "text": "Is there some especially favorite insightful findings from some of these that you could talk about?"}, {"time": 6595, "text": "So maybe favorite studies or just something that pops to mind in terms of both the goals and like the major insights gained and maybe the side little curiosities that you discovered along the way."}, {"time": 6609, "text": "Yeah, I think of the work with like using psilocybin to help people quit smoking."}, {"time": 6614, "text": "And we've talked about smoking being such a serious addiction and so that what inspired me to get into that was just kind of having like behavioral psychology as my primary lens, sort of this sort of like, you know, kind of radical empirical basis of, I'm really interested in the mystical experience and all of these reports, very interested."}, {"time": 6644, "text": "And, but at the same time, I'm like, okay, let's get down to some behavior change and something that we can record, like quantitatively verify biologically."}, {"time": 6655, "text": "So find all kinds of negative behaviors that people practice and see if we can turn those into positive or change their behavior."}, {"time": 6662, "text": "Right, like really change it, not just people saying, which again is interesting, I'm not dismissing it, but folks that say my life has turned around, I feel this has completely changed me."}, {"time": 6671, "text": "It's like, yep, that's good."}, {"time": 6673, "text": "All right, let's see if we can harness that and test that."}, {"time": 6676, "text": "And just something that's real behavior change."}, {"time": 6681, "text": "It's quantifiable."}, {"time": 6682, "text": "It's like, okay, you've been smoking for 30 years, you know, like that's a real thing."}, {"time": 6686, "text": "And you've tried a dozen times, like seriously to quit and you haven't been able to long term, like, okay."},

a cup and we'll test that."}, {"time": 6700, "text": "And we'll have you blow into this little machine that measures carbon monoxide and we'll test that."}, {"time": 6704, "text": "So multiple levels of biological verification."}, {"time": 6708, "text": "Like now we're getting like, to me that's where the rubber meets the road in terms of like therapeutics."}, {"time": 6713, "text": "It's like, can we really shift behavior?"}, {"time": 6715, "text": "And since, and so much as we've talked about my other scientific work outside of psychedelics is about understanding addiction and drug use."}, {"time": 6722, "text": "So it's like, you know, looking at addiction, it's a no brainer and smoking is just a great example."}, {"time": 6727, "text": "And so back to your question, like we've had really high success rates."}, {"time": 6731, "text": "I mean, it really, it rivals anything that's been published in the scientific literature."}, {"time": 6736, "text": "The caveat is that, you know, that's based on our initial trial of only 15 people, but extremely high longterm success rates, 80% at six months per smoke free."}, {"time": 6747, "text": "So can we discuss the details of this?"},

fact, it wasn't people that, you know, largely were, you know, we were honest about what we were studying, but for most people, it was, they were in the category of like, you know, not particularly

like, what the hell, let's give it a shot."}, {"time": 7153, "text": "Like most of them were in that category, which I really, you know, I appreciate because it's more of a test, you know, of, yeah,

and they're wearing eye shades, which is a better connotation as a name than blindfold."}, {"time": 7300, "text": "But like, yeah, so they're wearing eye shades, but that's, and they're wearing headphones through which music is played, mostly classical, although we've done some variation of that."}, {"time": 7310, "text": "I have a paper that was recently accepted kind of comparing it to more like gongs and harmonic bowls and that type of thing, kind of like sound, you know, kind of."}, {"time": 7320, "text": "You've also added this to the science and have a paper on the musical

better of an effect, both in terms of subjective experience and longterm, whether it helped people quit smoking, just a little tiny non significant trend even favoring the novel playlist with the Tibetan singing bowls and the gongs and didgeridoo and all of that."}, {"time": 7350, "text": "And so anyway, just saying, okay, we can deviate a little bit from this, like what goes back to the 1950s

psychologists back in the 60s, masters in Houston that wrote a really good book, The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience, which is a play on varieties of religious experience by William James, that they described this, a perceptual level."}, {"time": 7844, "text": "So most people have that when, whether they're looking at the room without the eyeshades on or inside their mind's eye with the eyeshades on, colors, sounds like this, it's a much richer sensorium, which can be very interesting."}, {"time": 7862, "text": "And then at another level, a master's in Houston called it the psychodynamic level."}, {"time": 7868, "text": "And I think you could think about it more broadly than, that's kind of Jungian, but just the personal psychological levels, how I think of it, like this is about your life."}, {"time": 7877, "text": "There's a whole life review."}, {"time": 7877, "text": "Oftentimes people have thoughts about their childhood, about their relationships, their spouse or

they love people."}, {"time": 7901, "text": "Like in a way, for people that they'd love their family, but it just hits them so hard that how important this is and the magnitude of that love and what that means in their life."}, {"time": 7914, "text": "So those are some of the most moving experiences to be present for is where people like it hits home, like what really matters in their life."}, {"time": 7922, "text": "And then you have this sort of what masters in Houston called the archetypal realm, which again is sort of Jungian with the focus on archetypes, which is interesting, but I think of that more generally as like symbolic level."}, {"time": 7935, "text": "So just really deep experiences where you have, you do have experiences that seem symbolic of, very much in like what we know about dreaming and what most people think about dreaming, like there's this randomness of things, but sometimes it's pretty clear in retrospect, oh, like this came up because this thing has been on my mind recently."}, {"time": 7956, "text": "So it seems to be, there seems to be this symbolic level."}, {"time": 7960, "text": "And then they have this, the last level that they describe is the mystical integral level, which this is where there's lots of terms for it, but transcendental experiences, experiences of unity, mystical type effects we often measure."}, {"time": 7976, "text": "Europeans use a scale that will refer to oceanic boundlessness."}, {"time": 7980, "text": "This is all pretty much the same thing."}, {"time": 7982, "text": "This is like at some sense, the deepest level of the very sense of self seems to be dissolved, minimize, or expanded, such that the boundaries of the self go into in here."}, {"time": 7996, "text": "I think some of this is just semantics, but whether the self is expanding such that there's no boundary between the self and the rest of the universe, or whether there's no sense of self, again, might be just semantics, but this radical shift or sense of loss of sense of self or self boundaries."}, {"time": 8013, "text": "And that's like the most, typically when people have that experience, they'll often report that as being the most remarkable thing."}, {"time": 8020, "text": "And this is what you don't typically get with MDMA, these deepest levels of the nature of reality itself, the subjectivity and objectivity, just like the seer and the seen become one, and it's a process, and yeah."}, {"time": 8038, "text": "And they're able to bring that experience back and be able to describe it?"}, {"time": 8046, "text": "Yeah, but one of the, to a degree, but one of the hallmarks going back to William James of describing a mystical experience is the ineffability."}, {"time": 8055, "text": "And so even though it's ineffable, people try as far as they can to describe it, but when you get the real deal, they'll say, and even though they say a lot of helpful things to help you describe the landscape, they'll say, no matter what I say, I'm still not even coming anywhere close to what this was."}, {"time": 8071, "text": "Like the language is completely failing."}, {"time": 8074, "text": "And I like to joke that even though it's ineffable, and we're researchers, so we try to eff it up by asking them to describe the experience."}, {"time": 8081, "text": "I love it, it's a good one."}, {"time": 8084, "text": "But to bring it back a little bit, so for that particular study on tobacco, what was the results, what was the conclusions in terms of the impact of psilocybin on their addiction?"}, {"time": 8099, "text": "So in that pilot study, it was very small and it wasn't a randomized study, so it was limited."}, {"time": 8104, "text": "The only question we could really answer was, is this worthy enough of followup?"}, {"time": 8108, "text": "And the answer to that was absolutely, because the success rates were so high, 80% biologically confirmed successful at six months, that held up to 60% biologically confirmed abstinent at an average of two and a half years, a very long fall."}, {"time": 8122, "text": "Yeah, and so, I mean, the best that's been reported in the literature for smoking cessation is in the upper 50%, and that's with not one, but two medications for a couple of months, followed by regular cognitive behavioral therapy, where you're coming in once a week or once every few weeks for an entire year."}, {"time": 8141, "text": "And so it was very heavy."}, {"time": 8144, "text": "This is just like a few uses of psilocybin?"}, {"time": 8148, "text": "So this was three doses of psilocybin over a total course, including preparation, everything, a 15 week period, where there's mainly like, for most part, one meeting a week, and then the three sessions are within that."}, {"time": 8160, "text": "And so it's, and we scaled that back in the more, the study we're doing right now, which I can tell you about, which is a randomized controlled trial."}, {"time": 8169, "text": "But it's, yeah, the original pilot study was these 15 people."}, {"time": 8180, "text": "So given the positive signal from the first study telling us that it was a worthy pursuit, we hustled up some money to actually be able to afford a larger trial."}, {"time": 8188, "text": "So it's randomizing 80 people to get either one psilocybin session, we've scaled that down from three to one, mainly because we're doing fMRI neuroimaging before and after, and it made it more experimentally complex to have multiple sessions."}, {"time": 8205, "text": "But one psilocybin session versus the nicotine patch using the FDA approved label, like standard use of the nicotine patch."}, {"time": 8213, "text": "So it's randomized, 40 people get randomized to psilocybin, one session, 40 people get nicotine patch."}, {"time": 8220, "text": "And they all get the same cognitive behavioral therapy sort of the standard talk therapy."}, {"time": 8223, "text": "And we've scaled it down somewhat, so there's less weekly meetings, but it's within the same ballpark."}, {"time": 8229, "text": "And right now we're still, the study's still ongoing."}, {"time": 8236, "text": "And in fact, we just recently started recruiting again, we paused for COVID."}, {"time": 8239, "text": "Now we're starting back up with some protections like masks and whatnot."}, {"time": 8243, "text": "But right now for the 44 people who have gotten through the one year followup, and so that includes 22 from each of the two groups, the success rates are extremely high."}, {"time": 8256, "text": "For the psilocybin group, it's 59% have been biologically confirmed as smoke free at one year after their quit date."}, {"time": 8263, "text": "And that compares to 27% for the nicotine patch, which by the way is extremely good for the nicotine patch compared to previous research."}, {"time": 8273, "text": "So the results could change because it's ongoing, but we're mostly done and it's still looking extremely positive."}, {"time": 8281, "text": "So if anyone's interested, they have to be sort of be in commuting distance to the Baltimore area, but you know."}, {"time": 8286, "text": "To participate."}, {"time": 8287, "text": "Right, right, to participate."}, {"time": 8289, "text": "This is a good moment to bring up something."}, {"time": 8293, "text": "I think a lot of what you talked about is super interesting."}, {"time": 8297, "text": "And I think a lot of people listening to this, so now it's anywhere from 300 to 600,000 people for just a regular podcast."}, {"time": 8307, "text": "I know a lot of them will be very interested in what you're saying and they're going to look you up."}, {"time": 8312, "text": "They're going to find your email and they're going to write you a long email about some of the interesting things they've found in any of your papers."}, {"time": 8323, "text": "How should people contact you?"}, {"time": 8325, "text": "What is the best way for that?"}, {"time": 8327, "text": "Would you recommend?"}, {"time": 8329, "text": "You're a super busy guy."}, {"time": 8330, "text": "You have a million things going on."}, {"time": 8334, "text": "How should people communicate with you?"}, {"time": 8336, "text": "Thanks for bringing this up."}, {"time": 8337, "text": "This is a, I'm glad to get the opportunity to address this."}, {"time": 8341, "text": "If someone's interested in participating in a study, the best thing to do is go to the website."}, {"time": 8348, "text": "Of the study or of like, yeah, which website?"}, {"time": 8353, "text": "So we have all of our psilocybin studies."}, {"time": 8355, "text": "So everything we have is up on one website and then we link to the different study websites, but hopkinspsychedelic.org."}, {"time": 8364, "text": "So everything we do, or if you don't remember that, just go to your favorite search engine and look up Johns Hopkins Psychedelic and you're going to find one of the first hits is going to be our, is this website."}, {"time": 8375, "text": "And there's going to be links to the smoking study and all of our other studies."}, {"time": 8379, "text": "If there's no link to it there, we don't have a study on it now."}, {"time": 8382, "text": "And if you're interested in psychedelic research more broadly, you can look up, like at another university that might be closer to you."}, {"time": 8389, "text": "And there's a handful of them now across the country."}, {"time": 8392, "text": "And there's some in Europe that have studies going on, but you can, at least in the US, you can look at clinicaltrials.gov and look up the term psilocybin."}, {"time": 8402, "text": "And in fact, optionally people even in Europe can register their trial on there."}, {"time": 8406, "text": "So that's a good way to find studies."}, {"time": 8407, "text": "But for our research, rather than emailing me, like a more efficient way is to go straight and you can do that first, the first phase of screening."}, {"time": 8417, "text": "There's some questions online and then someone will get back in touch with you."}, {"time": 8421, "text": "But I do already, you know, and I expect it's like going to increase, but I'm already at the level where my simple limited mind and limited capacity is already, I sometimes fail to get back to emails."}, {"time": 8437, "text": "I mean, I'm trying to respond to my colleagues, my mentees, all these things, my responsibilities."}, {"time": 8443, "text": "And as many of the people just inquiring about I wanna go to graduate school, I'm interested in this, I had this, I have a daughter that took a psychedelic and she's having trouble."}, {"time": 8451, "text": "And it's like, I try to respond to those, but sometimes I just simply can't get to all of it already."}, {"time": 8458, "text": "To be honest, like from my perspective, it's been quite heartbreaking because I basically don't respond to any emails anymore."}, {"time": 8467, "text": "And especially as you mentioned mentees and so on, like outside of that circle, it's heartbreaking to me how many brilliant people there are, thoughtful people, like loving people."}, {"time": 8479, "text": "And they write long emails that are really, by the way, I do read them very often."}, {"time": 8486, "text": "It's just that I don't, the response is then you're starting a conversation."}, {"time": 8491, "text": "And the heartbreaking aspect is you only have so many hours in the day to have deep, meaningful conversations with human beings on this earth."}, {"time": 8500, "text": "And so you have to select who they are."}, {"time": 8502, "text": "And usually it's your family, it's people like you're directly working with."}, {"time": 8506, "text": "And even I guarantee you with this conversation, people will write you long, really thoughtful emails."}, {"time": 8514, "text": "Like there'll be brilliant people, faculty from all over, PhD students from all over."}, {"time": 8519, "text": "And it's heartbreaking because you can't really get back to them."}, {"time": 8521, "text": "But you're saying like many of them, if you do respond, it's more like here, go to this website when you're interested into the study, just it makes sense to directly go to the site if there's applications open, just apply for the study."}, {"time": 8536, "text": "Right, right, right, as either a volunteer or if we're looking for somebody, we're gonna be posting, including on the Hopkins University website, we're gonna be posting if we're looking for a position."}, {"time": 8550, "text": "I am right now actually looking through and it's mainly been through email and contacts, but should I say it?"}, {"time": 8557, "text": "I think I'd rather cast my nets wide, but I'm looking for a postdoc right now."}, {"time": 8561, "text": "So I've mentored postdocs for, I don't know, like a dozen years or so."}, {"time": 8566, "text": "And more and more of their time is being spent on psychedelics."}, {"time": 8570, "text": "So someone's free to contact me."}, {"time": 8572, "text": "That's more of a, that's sort of so close to home."}, {"time": 8574, "text": "That's a personal, you know, that like emailing me about that."}, {"time": 8578, "text": "But I come to appreciate more the advice that folks like Tim Ferriss have of like, I think it's him, like five cents emails, you know, like a subject that gets to the point that tells you what it's about so that like you break through the signal to the noise."}, {"time": 8594, "text": "But I really appreciate what you're saying because part of the equation for me is like, I have a three year old, and like my time on the ground, on the floor, playing blocks or cars with him is part of that equation."}, {"time": 8605, "text": "And even if the day is ending and I know some of those emails are slipping by and I'll never get back to them."}, {"time": 8610, "text": "And I have, I'm struggling with it already."}, {"time": 8612, "text": "And I get what you're saying is like, I haven't seen anything yet if with the type of exposure that like your podcast gets."}, {"time": 8619, "text": "This will bring in exposure."}, {"time": 8620, "text": "And then I think in terms of postdocs, this is a really good podcast in the sense that there's a lot of brilliant PhD students out there that are looking for a poster from all over, from MIT, probably from Hopkins, it's just all over the place."}, {"time": 8633, "text": "So this is, and I, we have different preferences, but my preference would also be to have like a form that they could fill out for posts."}, {"time": 8641, "text": "Because, you know, it's very difficult through email to tell who's really going to be a strong collaborator for you, like a strong postdoc, strong student, because you want a bunch of details, but at the same time, you don't want a million pages worth of email."}, {"time": 8659, "text": "So you want a little bit of application process."}, {"time": 8661, "text": "So usually you set up a form that helps me indicate how passionate the person is, how willing they are to do hard work."}, {"time": 8673, "text": "Like I often ask a question, people of what do you think is more important to work hard or to work smart?"}, {"time": 8681, "text": "And I use that, those types of questions to indicate who I would like to work with."}, {"time": 8689, "text": "Because it's counterintuitive."}, {"time": 8691, "text": "But anyway, I'll leave that question unanswered for people to figure out themselves."}, {"time": 8697, "text": "But maybe if you know my love for David Goggins, you will understand."}, {"time": 8702, "text": "Those are good thoughts about the forms and everything."}, {"time": 8705, "text": "And that's something that evolves."}, {"time": 8707, "text": "Email is such a messy thing."}, {"time": 8709, "text": "There's, speaking of Baltimore, Cal Newport, if you know who that is, he wrote a book called Deep Work."}, {"time": 8719, "text": "He's a computer science professor and he's currently working on a book about email, about all the ways that email is broken."}, {"time": 8725, "text": "So this is gonna be a fascinating read."}, {"time": 8728, "text": "This is a little bit of a general question, but almost a bigger picture question that we touched on a little bit, but let's just touch it in a full way, which is what have all the psychedelic studies you've conducted taught you about the human mind, about the human brain and the human mind?"}, {"time": 8752, "text": "Is there something, if you look at the human scientists you were before this work and the scientists you are now, how has your understanding of the human mind changed?"}, {"time": 8763, "text": "I'm thinking of that in two categories."}, {"time": 8768, "text": "One kind of more scientific, and they're both scientific, but one more about the brain and behavior and the mind, so to speak."}, {"time": 8782, "text": "And as a behaviorist, all we see sort of the mind as a metaphor for behaviors, but anyway, that gets philosophical."}, {"time": 8790, "text": "But it's really increasing the, so the one category is increasing the appreciation for the magnitude of depth."}, {"time": 8803, "text": "I mean, so these are all metaphors of human experience."}, {"time": 8807, "text": "That might be a good way to, because you use certain words like consciousness and it's like we're using constructs that aren't well defined unless we kind of dig in, but human experience like that, the experiences on these compounds can be so far out there or so deep."}, {"time": 8828, "text": "And they're doing that by tinkering with the same machinery that's going on up there."}, {"time": 8833, "text": "I mean, my assumption, and I think it's a good assumption is that all experiences, there's a biological side to all phenomenal experience."}, {"time": 8845, "text": "So there is not, the divide between biology and experience or psychology is, it's not one or the other."}, {"time": 8858, "text": "These are just two sides of the same coin."}, {"time": 8863, "text": "I mean, you're avoiding the use of the word consciousness, for example, but the experience is referring to the subjective experience."}, {"time": 8870, "text": "So it's the actual technical use of the word consciousness of subjective experience."}, {"time": 8905, "text": "And that's why it's hard because like it's hard to imagine anything."}, {"time": 8909, "text": "But I think what I was getting is that psychedelics have done this by, the reason I was getting into the biology versus mind, psychology divide is that just to kind of set up the fact that I think all of our experience is related to these biological events."}, {"time": 8953, "text": "Okay, so that's always another side of the coin."}, {"time": 8955, "text": "So another way to put that is all of our subjective experience outside of drugs, it's all a controlled hallucination in a sense."}, {"time": 8967, "text": "Like this is completely constructed."}, {"time": 8968, "text": "Our experience of reality is completely a simulation."}, {"time": 8973, "text": "So I think we're on solid ground to say that that's our best guess and that's a pretty reasonable thing to say scientifically."}, {"time": 8981, "text": "Like all the rich complexity of the world emerges from just some biology and some chemicals."}, {"time": 8986, "text": "So in that definition implied a causation, it comes from."}, {"time": 8989, "text": "And so we know at least there's a solid correlation there."}, {"time": 8993, "text": "And so then we delve deep into the philosophy of like idealism or materialism and things like this, which I'm not an expert in, but I know we're getting into that territory."}, {"time": 9003, "text": "You don't even necessarily have to go there."}, {"time": 9006, "text": "Like you at least go to the level of like, okay, we know there seems to be this one on one correspondence and that seems pretty solid."}, {"time": 9014, "text": "Like you can't prove a negative and you can't prove, you know, it's in that category of like, you could come up with an experience that maybe doesn't have a biological correlate, but then you're talking about, there's also the limits of the science."}, {"time": 9025, "text": "Is it a false negative?"}, {"time": 9026, "text": "But I think our best guess and a very decent assumption is that every psychological event has a biological correlate."}, {"time": 9033, "text": "So with that said, you know, the idea that you can throw, alter that biology in a pretty trivial manner."}, {"time": 9077, "text": "Like that's the thing about psychedelics that just floors me and it never fails."}, {"time": 9114, "text": "Whether it's like therapeutically or just to understand the mind and you're like, and you're still floored, like how is that possible?"}, {"time": 9125, "text": "How did we slightly alter serotonergic neurotransmission and say, and this person is now saying that they're making fundamental differences in the priorities of their life after 60 years."}, {"time": 9139, "text": "It also just fills you with awe of the possibility of experiences we're yet to have uncovered."}, {"time": 9148, "text": "If just a few chemicals can change so much, it's like, man, what if this could be up?"}, {"time": 9156, "text": "I mean, like how, cause we're just like took a little, it's like lighting a match or something in the darkness and you could see there's a lot more there, but you don't know how much more."}, {"time": 9167, "text": "And that's."}, {"time": 9169, "text": "And then like, where's that gonna go with like, I mean, I'm always like aware of the fact that like we always as humans and as scientists think that we figured out 99% and we're working on that first 1%."}, {"time": 9179, "text": "And we gotta keep reminding ourselves, it's hard to do."}, {"time": 9181, "text": "Like we figured out like not even 1%, like we know nothing."}, {"time": 9233, "text": "And it becomes easy to combine within virtual reality where the virtual reality is gonna move from being something out here to being more in there."}, {"time": 9241, "text": "And then we're getting, like we talked about before, we're already in a virtual reality in terms of human perception and cognition models of the universe being all representations and sort of color not existing and just our representations of EM wavelengths, et cetera, sound, being vibrations and all of this."}, {"time": 9263, "text": "And so as the external VR and the internal VR come closer to each other, like this is what I think about in terms of the future of drugs."}, {"time": 9273, "text": "Like all of this stuff sort of combines and like where that goes is just, it's unthinkable."}, {"time": 9282, "text": "Like we were probably gonna, you know, again, I might sound like a fool and this may not happen, but I think it's possible, you know, to go completely offline, like where most of people's experiences maybe going into these internal worlds."}, {"time": 9298, "text": "And I mean, maybe you through some, through a combination of these techniques, you create experiences where someone could live a thousand years in terms of maybe they're living a regular lifespan, but in over the next two seconds, you're living a thousand years worth of experience."}, {"time": 9313, "text": "Inside your mind."}, {"time": 9315, "text": "Yeah, through this manipulation of them."}, {"time": 9316, "text": "Like, is that possible?"}, {"time": 9319, "text": "Like just based on like first principles and like."}, {"time": 9323, "text": "Yeah, first principles, yes."}, {"time": 9326, "text": "Like give us another 50, 100, 500, like who knows, but like how could it not go there?"}, {"time": 9333, "text": "In a small tangent, what are your thoughts in this broader definition of drugs, of psychedelics, of mind altering things?"}, {"time": 9342, "text": "What are your thoughts about Neuralink and brain computer interfaces, sort of being able to electrically stimulate and read neuronal activity in the brain and then connect that to the computer, which is another way from a computational perspective for me is kind of appealing, but it's another way of altering subtly the behavior of the brain."}, {"time": 9373, "text": "That's kind of, if you zoom out, reminiscent of the way psychedelics do as well."}, {"time": 9380, "text": "So what do you have?"}, {"time": 9382, "text": "Like what are your thoughts about Neuralink?"}, {"time": 9385, "text": "What are your hopes as a researcher of mind altering devices, systems, chemicals?"}, {"time": 9393, "text": "I guess broadly speaking, I'm all for it."}, {"time": 9396, "text": "I mean, for the same reason I am with psychedelics, but it comes with all the caveats."}, {"time": 9400, "text": "You know, you're going into a brave new world where it's like all of a sudden there's going to be a dark side."}, {"time": 9406, "text": "There's going to be serious ethical considerations, but that should not stop us from moving there."}, {"time": 9414, "text": "I mean, particularly the stuff from, and I'm no expert, but on the short list in the short term, it's like, yeah, can we help these serious neurological disorders?"}, {"time": 9422, "text": "Like, hell yeah."}, {"time": 9455, "text": "I forget what the example was, but something like, something that came off to some of my neuroscientific colleagues as an oversimplification, or at least the way they said it."}, {"time": 9464, "text": "Oh, from a Neuralink perspective."}, {"time": 9510, "text": "So I'm extremely sympathetic, and I'm a big fan of like what that, you know, what Elon Musk does, like tunnels through the ground, and SpaceX, and all this, just like, hell yeah, like this guy has some, he has some great ideas."}, {"time": 9523, "text": "And there's something to be said, it's not just the communication to the public."}, {"time": 9527, "text": "I think his first principles thinking, it's like, because I get this in the artificial intelligence world, it's probably similar to neuroscience world, where Elon will say something like, or I worked at MIT, I worked on autonomous vehicles."}, {"time": 9540, "text": "And he's sort of, I could sense how much he pisses off like every roboticist at MIT, and everybody who works on like the human factor side of safety of autonomous vehicles, and saying like, nah, we don't need to consider human beings in the car, like the car will drive itself, it's obvious that neural networks is all you need."}, {"time": 9562, "text": "Like it's obvious that like we should be able to systems that should be able to learn constantly."}, {"time": 9570, "text": "And they don't really need LIDAR, they just need cameras, because we humans just use our eyes, and that's the same as cameras."}, {"time": 9578, "text": "So like it doesn't, why would we need anything else?"}, {"time": 9581, "text": "You just have to make a system that learns faster, and faster, and faster, and neural networks can do that."}, {"time": 9586, "text": "And so that's pissing off every single community."}, {"time": 9588, "text": "It's pissing off human factors community, saying you don't need to consider the human driver in the picture, you can just focus on the robotics problem."}, {"time": 9596, "text": "It's pissing off every robotics person for saying LIDAR can be just ignored, it can be camera."}, {"time": 9602, "text": "Every robotics person knows that camera is really noisy, that it's really difficult to deal with."}, {"time": 9608, "text": "But he's, and then every AI person who says, who hears neural networks, and says like, neural networks can learn everything, like almost presuming that it's kind of going to achieve general intelligence."}, {"time": 9622, "text": "The problem with all those haters in the three communities is that they're looking one year ahead, five years ahead."}, {"time": 9631, "text": "The hilarious thing about the, quote unquote, ridiculous things that Elon Musk is saying, is they have a pretty good shot at being true in 20 years."}, {"time": 9640, "text": "And so like, when you just look at the, you know, when you look at the progression of these kinds of predictions, and sometimes first principles thinking can allow you to do that, is you see that it's kind of obvious that things are going to progress this way."}, {"time": 9658, "text": "And if you just remove the prejudice you hold about the particular battles of the current academic environment, and just look at the big picture, the progression of the technology, you can usually see the world in the same kind of way."}, {"time": 9675, "text": "And so in that same way, looking at psychedelics, you can see like, there is so many exciting possibilities here if we fully engage in the research."}, {"time": 9684, "text": "Same thing with Neuralink."}, {"time": 9686, "text": "If we fully engage, so we go from a thousand channels of communication to the brain, to billions of channels of communication to the brain, and we figure out many of the details of how to do that safely with neurosurgery and so on, that the world would just change completely in the same kind of way that Elon is."}, {"time": 9707, "text": "It's so ridiculous to hear him talk about a symbiotic relationship between AI and the human brain."}, {"time": 9715, "text": "But it's like, is it though?"}, {"time": 9721, "text": "Because I can see in 50 years, that's going to be an obvious, like everyone will have, like obviously you have, like why are we typing stuff in the computer?"}, {"time": 9731, "text": "It doesn't make any sense."}, {"time": 9733, "text": "People used to type on a keyboard with a mouse?"}, {"time": 9737, "text": "And it seems pretty clear, like we're going to be there."}, {"time": 9739, "text": "Like, and the only question is like, what's the timeframe?"}, {"time": 9741, "text": "Is that going to be 20 or is it 50 or a hundred?"}, {"time": 9743, "text": "Like, how could we not?"}, {"time": 9745, "text": "And the thing that I guess upsets with Elon and others is the timeline he tends to do."}, {"time": 9751, "text": "I think a lot of people tend to do that kind of thing."}, {"time": 9753, "text": "I definitely do it, which is like, it'll be done this year versus like, it'll be done in 10 years."}, {"time": 9759, "text": "The timeline is a little bit too rushed, but from our leadership perspective, it inspires the engineers to do the best work of their life to really kind of believe, because to do the impossible, you have to first believe it, which is a really important aspect of innovation."}, {"time": 9775, "text": "And there's the delay discounting aspect I talked about before."}, {"time": 9778, "text": "It's like saying, oh, this is going to be a thing 20, 50 years from now."}, {"time": 9781, "text": "It's like, what motivates anybody?"}, {"time": 9784, "text": "And even if you're fudging it or like wishful thinking a little bit, or let's just say airing on one side of the probability distribution, like there's value in saying like, yeah, like there's a chance we could get this done in a year."}, {"time": 9798, "text": "And if you set a goal for a year and you're not successful, hey, you might get it done in three years."}, {"time": 9803, "text": "Whereas if you had aimed at 20 years, well, you either would have never done it at all, or you would have aimed at 20 years and then it would have taken you 10."}, {"time": 9809, "text": "So the other thing I think about this, like in terms of his work and I guess we've seen with psychedelics, it's like there's a lack of appreciation for like sort of the variability you need a natural selection, sort of extrapolating from biological, from evolution like, hey, maybe he's wrong about focusing only on the cameras

consciousness?"}, {"time": 9958, "text": "You've mentioned that it feels like psychedelics allows you to kind of dismantle your sense of self, like step outside of yourself."}, {"time": 9970, "text":

be like Nagel's description, but the sense of self, which can be sort of like the experiential self moment to moment, or it can be like the narrative self, the stringing together of stories."},

resting state fMRI imaging, that there's less synchronization or presumably communication between these areas."}, {"time": 10178, "text": "And so I think it has been overstated in terms of, ah, we see

up some, just our ability to just function in the holistically like we do in order, yeah, for the brain to perceive stuff, to be able to map it to memory, to connect things together, the whole recur

not feeling like yourself."}, {"time": 10237, "text": "Like, so whether that be like really drunk or really hopped up on amphetamine or, you know, like we found it like decoupling of the default mode

drives them crazy if you say that it's the ego and that just like, but self referential processing, if you go that far, like that was already known before psychedelics."}, {"time": 10305, "text":

absolutely striking that psychedelics that people report with pretty high reliability, these unity experiences that where people subjectively, like they report losing or again, like the boundaries,

intelligence or any of that."}, {"time": 10431, "text": "What I really mean is the more the appearance starts to look like the thing, the more there's this area where it's like, I don't think, our whole idea of what is real and what is just an illusion is not the right way to think about it."}, {"time": 10456, "text": "So the whole idea is like, if you create a system that looks like it's having fun, the more it's realistically able to portray itself as having fun, like there's a certain gray area which the system is having fun."}, {"time": 10474, "text": "And same with intelligence, same with consciousness."}, {"time": 10476, "text": "And we humans wanna simplify, like it feels like the way we simplify the existence and the illusion of something is missing the whole truth of the

to talk about things, we don't have the right science to talk about things."}, {"time": 10500, "text": "But to me, like the faking it and actually it being true is the difference is much smaller than

actually built?"}, {"time": 10523, "text": "So like to me is that's the difference in philosophy and engineering."}, {"time": 10528, "text": "It feels like if we push the creation, the engineering, like fake it until you make it all the way, which is like fake consciousness until you realize, holy crap, this thing is conscious."}, {"time": 10541, "text": "Fake intelligence until you realize, holy crap, this is intelligence."}, {"time": 10544, "text": "And from my curiosity with psychedelics and just neurobiology and neuroscience is like it feels, I love the armchair."}, {"time": 10555,

simple."}, {"time": 10575, "text": "Like there's some, there could be some dance of chemicals that we're totally unaware of, not from aspects of like which chemicals to combine with which biological

actually exists."}, {"time": 10606, "text": "Like those weird sort of hypothetically, like maybe we're just thinking about the human mind totally wrong."}, {"time": 10613, "text": "Maybe there's no

about subtle manipulation of the chemicals of the brain, which feels like the best or one of the great chances of the scientific process leading us to an actual understanding of the hard problem."},

fascinated by the so called Psi phenomenon, you know, like stuff that people just kind of reject out of hand."}, {"time": 10690, "text": "You know, I kind of orient towards that stuff with an idea of, you know, hey, look, you know, what we consider, like anything exists as natural."}, {"time": 10699, "text": "And so, but the boundary of what we observe in nature, like what we recognize as in nature

the moving together of the model and the real thing of conscious, like, I'm very sympathetic to that."}, {"time": 10740, "text": "So that's that part of like, on the armchair side, where I want to be clear, I can't say this as a scientist, but just in terms of speculating, I find myself attracted to these, more of the sort of the panpsychism ideas."}, {"time": 10755, "text": "And that kind of makes sense to me."}, {"time": 10757, "text": "I don't know if that's what you meant there, but it seemed like related, the sense that ultimately if you were completely modeling, like it's like, if you completely modeling, unless you dismiss like the idea that there is a phenomenal consciousness, which I think is hard, given that we all, I seem like I have one, that's really all I know."},

there's something better that comes to replace it."}, {"time": 10820, "text": "So, I kind of think about like consciousness and I didn't, I kind of had this inclination before I knew there was a term

of consciousness permeates all matter and, or it's a fundamental part of physics of the universe kind of thing."}, {"time": 10845, "text": "So, and there's a lot of different flavors of it as you're alluding to."}, {"time": 10851, "text": "And something that struck me as like consistent with some just, you know, inclinations of mine, just total speculation is this idea of everything we know in

mean, again, totally in the speculation area."}, {"time": 10931, "text": "And something else based on, so it's funny because we don't have this, neither the science nor the proper language to talk about it."}, {"time": 10938, "text": "All we have is kind of a little intuitions about there might be something in that direction of the darkness to pursue."}, {"time": 10946, "text": "And in that sense, I find panpsychism interesting in that like, it does feel like there's something fundamental here, that consciousness is, it's not just like, okay, so the flip side, consciousness could be just a very basic and trivial symptom, like a little hack of nature that's useful for like survival of an organism."}, {"time": 10973, "text": "It's not something fundamental."}, {"time": 10975, "text":

you feel any kind of way about them?"}, {"time": 3861, "text": "So trying to get at that, you know, I don't know what that is, I guess that's bias."}, {"time": 3867, "text": "And it's such a difficult question to ask, like I asked myself with that question, like how much, you know, we all kind of want to pretend that we're not racist, we don't judge, we don't have, we're like these, we're the reasonable human, but, you know, legitimately asking yourself like, what are the prejudgments you have in your mind?"}, {"time": 3893, "text": "Is that even impossible for a human being?"}, {"time":

me, sounds more honest."}, {"time": 3958, "text": "And if you want a person, you want a person to try to do that."}, {"time": 3962, "text": "And then in closing arguments, as the lawyer, I'd say

3979, "text": "And I'm confident that you're going to do that here."}, {"time": 3983, "text": "So when you heard that police officer's testimony, the judge told you, you can't give more credit to that testimony just because it's a police officer."}, {"time": 3993, "text": "And I trust that you're going to do that and that you're going to look at witness number three, you know, John Smith, you're

Warty."}, {"time": 5390, "text": "And he says that our most deeply held beliefs are received wisdom and highly contingent along a number of registers."}, {"time": 5401, "text": "And he does that, but

love his vocabulary and the way he's helped me resolve the tension."}, {"time": 5469, "text": "So right, I mean, yeah, so like, you know, infanticide, for example."}, {"time": 5475, "text": "Perhaps it's socially contingent, perhaps it's received wisdom, perhaps it's anthropological, you know, we need to propagate the species, and I still think it's wrong."}, {"time": 5489, "text": "And Warty has helped me develop a category to say that, no, I can't provide any, in Warty's words, noncircular theoretical backup for this proposition."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "At some point, it's going to run me into a circularity problem, but that's okay."}, {"time": 5508, "text": "I hold this nonetheless in full recognition of its contingency, but what it does is makes you humble, and when you're humble, that's good because, you know, this notion that ideas are always already in progress, never fully formed, I think is the sort of intellectual I strive to be."}, {"time": 5532, "text": "And if I have a sufficient degree of humility that I don't have the final answer, capital A, then that's going to help me to get to better answers, lowercase a."}, {"time": 5546, "text": "And Warty does that, and he talks about in the solidarity part of the book, he has this concept of imaginative, the imaginative ability to see other different people as we instead of they."}, {"time": 5563, "text": "And I just think it's a beautiful concept, but he talks about this imaginative ability and it's this active process."}, {"time": 5569, "text": "So I mean, so that's a book that's done a lot of work for me over

like a Fitbit that measures, I don't know, some very basic measurements about your body is really cool."}, {"time": 677, "text": "But the bandwidth of information, the resolution of that information is very crude, so it's not very interesting."}, {"time": 683, "text": "The possibility of just building a data set coming in a clean way and a high bandwidth way from my brain opens up all kinds of..."}, {"time": 697, "text": "I was kind of joking when we were talking, but it's not really, it's like I feel heard in the sense that it feels like the full richness of the information coming from my mind is actually being recorded by the machine."}, {"time": 716, "text": "I mean, I can't quite put it into words, but there is genuinely for me, there's not some kind of joke about me being a robot."}, {"time": 725, "text": "It just genuinely feels like I'm being heard in a way that's going to improve my life, as long as the thing that's on the other end can do something useful with that

"text": "Of course, there's health that I consider, but honestly, to me, the exciting thing is just being heard."}, {"time": 786, "text": "My state of mind, the level of focus, all those kinds of things, being heard."}, {"time": 833, "text": "Yeah, that's the promise, that was the feeling, and it felt like the future."}, {"time": 839, "text": "So it was a pretty cool experience."}, {"time": 840, "text": "And from the sort of mechanical perspective, it was cool to have an actual device that feels pretty good, that doesn't require me to go into the lab."}, {"time": 851, "text": "And also the other thing I was feeling, there's a guy named Andrew Huberman, he's a friend of mine, amazing podcast, people should listen to it, Huberman Lab Podcast."}, {"time": 861, "text": "We're working on a paper together about eye movement and so on."}, {"time": 866, "text": "And we're kind of, he's a neuroscientist and I'm a data person, machine learning person, and we're both excited by how much the, how much the data measurements of the human mind, the brain and all the different metrics that come from that could be used to understand human beings and in a rigorous scientific way."}, {"time": 890, "text": "So the other thing I was thinking about is how this could be turned into a tool for science."}, {"time": 895, "text": "Sort of not just personal science, not just like Fitbit style, like how am I doing on my personal metrics of health, but doing larger scale studies of human behavior and so on."}, {"time": 907, "text": "So like data, not at the scale of an individual, but data at a scale of many individuals or a large number of individuals."}, {"time": 914, "text": "So personal being heard was exciting and also just for science is exciting."}, {"time": 919, "text": "It's very easy, like there's a very powerful thing to it being so easy to just put on that you could scale much easier."}, {"time": 928, "text": "If you think about that second thing you said about the science of the brain, most, we've done a pretty good job, like we, the human race has done a pretty good job figuring out how to quantify the things around us from distant stars to calories and steps and our genome."}, {"time": 952, "text": "So we can measure and quantify pretty much everything in the known universe except for our minds."}, {"time": 960, "text": "And we can do these one offs if we're going to get an fMRI scan or do something with a low res EEG system, but we haven't done this at population scale."}, {"time": 971, "text": "And so if you think about human thought or human cognition is probably the single law, largest raw input material into society at any given moment is our conversations with ourselves and with other people."}, {"time": 987, "text": "And we have this raw input that we can't, that haven't been able to measure yet."}, {"time": 995, "text": "And if you, when I think about it through that frame, it's remarkable, it's almost like we live in this wild,

relationships, politics, economics, education, all the above."}, {"time": 1049, "text": "And so to me that the most significant contribution that kernel technology has to offer would be the formal, the introduction to formal engineering of cognition as it relates to everything else in society."}, {"time": 1065, "text": "I love that idea that you kind of think that there's just this ocean of data that's coming from people's brains as being in a crude way, reduced down to like tweets and texts and so on, just a very hardcore, many scale compression of actual, the raw data."}, {"time": 1086, "text": "But maybe you can comment, because you're using the word cognition."}, {"time": 1091, "text": "I think the first step is to get the brain data."}, {"time": 1095, "text": "But is there a leap to be taking to sort of interpreting that data in terms of cognition?"}, {"time": 1102, "text": "So is your idea is basically you need to start collecting data at scale from the brain, and then we start to really be able to take little steps along the path to actually measuring some deep sense of cognition."}, {"time": 1117, "text": "Because as I'm sure you know, we understand a few things, but we don't understand most of what makes up cognition."}, {"time": 1127, "text": "This has been one of the most significant challenges of building Kernel, and Kernel wouldn't exist if I wasn't able to fund it initially by myself."}, {"time": 1135, "text": "Because when I engage in conversations with investors, the immediate thought is, what is the killer app?"}, {"time": 1142, "text": "And of course, I understand that heuristic, that's what they're looking at, is they're looking to de risk."}, {"time": 1147, "text": "Is the product solved?"}, {"time": 1149, "text": "Is there a customer base?"}, {"time": 1150, "text": "Are people willing to pay for it?"}, {"time": 1151, "text": "How does it compare to competing options?"}, {"time": 1154, "text": "And in the case with brain interfaces, when I started the company, there was no known path to even build a technology that could potentially become mainstream."}, {"time": 1164, "text": "And then once we figured out the technology, we could even, we could commence having conversations with investors and it became, what is the killer app?"}, {"time": 1171, "text": "And so what has been, so I funded the first $53 million for the company."}, {"time": 1176, "text": "And to raise the round of funding, the first one we did, I spoke to 228 investors."}, {"time": 1182, "text": "One said yes, it was remarkable."}, {"time": 1185, "text": "And it was mostly around this concept around what is a killer app."}, {"time": 1189, "text": "And so internally, the way we think about it is, we think of the go to market strategy much more like the Drake equation, where if we can build technology that has the characteristics of, it has the data quality is high enough, it meets some certain threshold, cost, accessibility, comfort, it can be worn in contextual environments."}, {"time": 1212, "text": "If it meets the criteria of being a mass market device, then the responsibility that we have is to figure out how to create the algorithm that enables the human, to enable humans to then find value with it."}, {"time": 1232, "text": "So the analogy is like brain interfaces are like early 90s of the internet, is you wanna populate an ecosystem with a certain number of devices, you want a certain number of people who play around with them, who do experiments of certain data collection parameters, you want to encourage certain mistakes from experts and non experts."}, {"time": 1248, "text": "These are all critical elements that ignite discovery."}, {"time": 1251, "text": "And so we believe we've accomplished the first objective of building technology that reaches those thresholds."}, {"time": 1261, "text": "And now it's the Drake equation component of how do we try to generate 20 years of value discovery in a two or three year time period?"}, {"time": 1272, "text": "How do we compress that?"}, {"time": 1274, "text": "So just to clarify, so when you mean the Drake equation, which for people who don't know, I don't know why you, if you listen to this, I bring up aliens every single conversation."}, {"time": 1282, "text": "So I don't know how you would know what the Drake equation is, but you mean like the killer app, it would be one alien civilization in that equation."}, {"time": 1291, "text": "So meaning like this is in search of an application that's impactful, transformative."}, {"time": 1296, "text": "By the way, it should be, we need to come up with a better term than killer app as a."}, {"time": 1301, "text": "It's also violent, right?"}, {"time": 1303, "text": "It's very violent."}, {"time": 1303, "text": "You can go like viral app, that's horrible too, right?"}, {"time": 1306, "text": "It's some very inspiringly impactful application."}, {"time":

run all my trials."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "And so if you look just at the information that one can acquire on their wrist, and now you're applying it to the entire cortex on the brain and you say,

my coworkers."}, {"time": 1661, "text": "We performed four cognitive tasks over 13 sessions."}, {"time": 1665, "text": "And we focused on reaction time, impulse control, short term memory, and then a

play the game."}, {"time": 1684, "text": "The point of the study was I had, the brain study I did at Kernel confirmed my life experience that if I, my deep sleep determined whether or not I would be able to resist temptation the following day."}, {"time": 1701, "text": "And my brain did show that as one example."}, {"time": 1704, "text": "And so if you start thinking, if you actually have data on yourself, on your entire cortex and you can control the settings, I think there's probably a large number of things that we could discover about ourselves, very, very small and very, very big."},

attention."}, {"time": 1732, "text": "With the computer."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "I mean, that seems like a compelling place to where you would want to put on a Kernel, by the way, what is it

eight hours of deep work, of focus, zero distraction."}, {"time": 1816, "text": "And for me to analyze, I mean I'm very aware of the waning of that, the ups and downs of that."}, {"time": 1824,

objective is betterment across ourselves, individually and also with each other."}, {"time": 1953, "text": "Yeah, so it's a nice data stream to have if you're building an app, like if you're building a podcast listening app, it would be nice to know data about the listener so that like if you're bored or you fell asleep, maybe pause the podcast, it's like really dumb, just very simple applications

account with their checking account versus their credit cards."}, {"time": 5965, "text": "And then when they'd use PayPal to pay a merchant, PayPal had a cost of payment of zero versus if you have coming from a credit card, you have to pay the bank the fees."}, {"time": 5975, "text": "So PayPal's margins were 3% on a transaction versus a typical payments company, which may be a nickel or a penny or a dime or something like that."}, {"time": 5984, "text": "And so I knew PayPal really was the model to replicate, but a bunch of companies had tried to do that."}, {"time": 5990, "text": "They tried to come in and build a two sided marketplace."}, {"time": 5992, "text": "So get consumers to fund the checking account and the merchants to accept it, but they'd all failed because building a two sided marketplace is very hard at the same time."}, {"time": 6001, "text": "So my plan was I'm going to build a company and get the best merchants in the whole world to use our service."}, {"time": 6008, "text": "Then in year five, I'm going to have, I'm going to acquire a consumer payments company and I'm going to bring the two together."}, {"time": 6014, "text": "And to

University of Chicago."}, {"time": 6028, "text": "And weirdly it happened exactly like that."}, {"time": 6032, "text": "So four years in our customer base included Uber, Airbnb, GitHub, 37 Signals,

private financial transactions which people previously thought were something that should be hidden from others."}, {"time": 6063, "text": "And we acquired Venmo and at that point we now had, we replicated the model because now people could fund their Venmo account with their checking account, keep money in the account."}, {"time": 6074, "text": "And then you could just plug Venmo as a form of payment."}, {"time": 6077, "text": "And so I think PayPal saw that, that we were getting the best merchants in the world."}, {"time": 6082, "text": "We had people using Venmo."}, {"time": 6085,

was, the objective was I want to earn enough money so that I can basically dedicate my attention to doing something that could potentially be useful on a society wide scale."}, {"time": 6118, "text":

so that what PayPal offered was sufficient for me to get that amount of money to basically have a go."}, {"time": 6145, "text": "And that's when I set off to survey everything I could identify an

cryptocurrency."}, {"time": 6193, "text": "And payments are very much connected to this, but in general, just money."}, {"time": 6198, "text": "And many of the folks I've spoken with, they also kind of connect that to not just purely financial discussions, but philosophical and political discussions."}, {"time": 6208, "text": "And they see Bitcoin as a way, almost as activism, almost as a way to resist the corruption of centralized centers of power."}, {"time": 6220, "text": "And sort of basically in the 21st century, decentralizing control."}, {"time": 6224, "text": "Whether that's Bitcoin

6263, "text": "It was an attempt at communication that when I was surveying the world, it was an algorithm of what could I individually do?"}, {"time": 6275, "text": "So there are things that exist that have a lot of potential that can be done."}, {"time": 6281, "text": "And then there's a filtering of how many people are qualified to do this given thing."}, {"time": 6286, "text": "And then there's a further characterization that can be done of, okay, given the number of qualified people, will somebody be a unique out performer of that group to make something truly impossible to be something done that otherwise couldn't get done?"}, {"time": 6299, "text": "So there's a process of assessing where can you add unique value in the world?"}, {"time": 6304, "text": "And some of that has to do with you being very formal and calculative here, but some of that is just like, what do you sense, like part of that equation is how much passion you sense within yourself to be able to drive that through, to discover the impossibilities and make them possible."}, {"time": 6321, "text": "That's right, and so we were at Braintree, I think we were the first company to integrate

you can trade cryptocurrencies."}, {"time": 6339, "text": "Yeah, which was one of the only places you could."}, {"time": 6342, "text": "So we were early in doing that."}, {"time": 6345, "text": "And

think about building next generation institutions for society."}, {"time": 6493, "text": "And that's why I think it's much broader than money."}, {"time": 6496, "text": "So I guess what you're saying

yes, I see their similarities."}, {"time": 6544, "text": "So I guess what you're saying is Bitcoin will somehow help me not pig out at night, or the equivalent of, speaking of diet, if we could just

a ton more about how this pandemic started."}, {"time": 871, "text": "And so this is, it's like grasping at straws in the dark with gloves on."}, {"time": 879, "text": "But to steel man the argument, we have this evidence from this market, and yes, the Chinese government has turned off the lights essentially, so we have very little data to work with, but this is the data we have."}, {"time": 893,

market as evidence for anything because it's probably not even the starting point."}, {"time": 942, "text": "So it's just a good place for it to continue spreading."}, {"time": 945, "text": "That's certainly my view."}, {"time": 947, "text": "What Michael Warby's argument is, Marco, is that, well, what are the odds of that?"}, {"time": 953, "text": "That we're seeing this amplification in the market."}, {"time": 957, "text": "And if we, let me put it this way."}, {"time": 960, "text": "If we had all of the information, if the Chinese government hadn't blocked access to all of this, because there's blood bank information, there's all sorts of information, and based on a full and complete understanding, we came to believe that all of the early cases were at this market."}, {"time": 979,

questions."}, {"time": 1005, "text": "Okay, so let's then talk about the Chinese government."}, {"time": 1010, "text": "There's several governments, right?"}, {"time": 1011, "text": "So one is the

of the whole information space and why I believe this has been so contentious?"}, {"time": 1370, "text": "If I had to give my best guess, and I underline the word guess of what happened, and your background, your family background with Chernobyl I think is highly relevant here."}, {"time": 1382, "text": "So after the first SARS, there was a recognition that we needed to distribute knowledge about virology and epidemiology around the world, that people in China and Africa and Southeast Asia, they were the frontline workers, and they needed to be doing a lot of the viral monitoring and assessment so that we could have an early alarm system."}, {"time": 1405, "text": "And that was why there was a lot of investment in all of those places in building capacity and training people and helping to build institutional capacity."}, {"time": 1414, "text": "And the Chinese government, they recognized that they needed to ramp things up."}, {"time": 1420, "text": "And then the World Health Organization and the World Health Assembly, they had their international health regulations that were designed to create a stronger infrastructure."}, {"time": 1430, "text": "So that was the goal."}, {"time": 1432, "text": "There were a lot of investments, and I know we'll talk later about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and I won't go into that right now."}, {"time": 1439, "text": "So there was all of this distributed capacity."}, {"time": 1442, "text": "And so in the early days, there's a breakout in Wuhan."}, {"time": 1447, "text": "We don't know, is it September, October, November?"}, {"time": 1450, "text": "Maybe December is when the local authorities start to recognize that something's happening."}, {"time": 1456, "text": "But at some point in late 2019, local officials in Wuhan understand that something is up."}, {"time": 1463, "text": "And exactly like in Chernobyl, these guys exist within a hierarchical system, and they are going to be rewarded if good things happen, and they're going to be in big trouble if bad things happen under their watch."}, {"time": 1476, "text": "So their initial instinct is to squash it."}, {"time": 1479, "text": "And my guess is they think, well, if we squash this information, we can most likely beat back this outbreak, because lots of outbreaks happen all the time, including of SARS 1, where there was multiple lab incidents out of a lab in Beijing."}, {"time": 1496, "text": "And so they start their coverup on day one."}, {"time": 1499, "text": "They start screening social media."}, {"time": 1502, "text": "They send nasty letters to different doctors and others who are starting to speak up."}, {"time": 1508, "text": "But then it becomes clear that there's a bigger issue."}, {"time": 1512, "text": "And then the national government of China, again, this is just a hypothesis, the national government gets involved."}, {"time": 1519, "text": "They say, all right, this is getting much bigger."}, {"time": 1521, "text": "They go in and they realize that we have a big problem on our hands."}, {"time": 1526, "text": "They relatively quickly know that it's spreading human to human."}, {"time": 1530, "text": "And so the right thing for them to do then is what the South African government is doing now is to say, we have this outbreak."}, {"time": 1537, "text": "We don't know everything, but we know it's serious."}, {"time": 1540, "text": "We need help."}, {"time": 1541, "text": "But that's not the instinct of people in most governments and certainly not in authoritarian governments like China."}, {"time": 1548, "text": "And so the national government, they have a choice at that point."}, {"time": 1552, "text": "They can do option one, which is what we would hear called the right thing, which is total transparency."}, {"time": 1559, "text": "They criticize the local officials for having this coverup."}, {"time": 1563, "text": "And they say, now we're going to be totally transparent."}, {"time": 1565, "text": "But what does that do in a system like the former Soviet Union, like China now?"}, {"time": 1570, "text": "If local officials say, wait a second, I thought my job was to cover everything up, to support this alternative reality that authoritarian systems need in order to survive."}, {"time": 1582, "text": "Well, now I'm gonna be held accountable for if I'm not totally transparent, like your whole system would collapse."}, {"time": 1589, "text": "So the national government, they have that choice and their only choice according to the logic of their system is to be all in on a coverup."}, {"time": 1599, "text": "And that's why they block the World Health Organization from sending its team to Wuhan for over three weeks."}, {"time": 1605, "text": "They overtly lie to the World Health Organization about human to human transmission."}, {"time": 1611, "text": "And then they begin their coverups."}, {"time": 1613, "text": "So they begin very, very quickly destroying samples, hiding records, they start imprisoning people for asking basic questions."}, {"time": 1622, "text": "Soon after they establish a gag order, preventing Chinese scientists from writing or saying anything about pandemic origins without prior government approval."}, {"time": 1632, "text": "And what that does means that there isn't a lot of data, there's not nearly enough data coming out of China."}, {"time": 1639, "text": "And so lots of responsible scientists outside of China who are data driven say, well, I don't have enough information to draw conclusions."}, {"time": 1649, "text": "And then into that vacuum step a relatively small number of largely virologists, but also others, respected scientists."}, {"time": 1660, "text": "And I know we'll talk about the, I think, infamous Peter Daszak who say, well, without any real foundation in the evidence, they say, we know pretty much this comes from nature and anyone who's raising the possibility of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist."}, {"time": 1683, "text": "So that message starts to percolate."}, {"time": 1687, "text": "And then in the United States, we have Donald Trump and he's starting to get criticized for America's failure to respond, prepare for and respond adequately to the outbreak."}, {"time": 1699, "text": "And so he starts saying, well, I know first after praising Xi Jinping, he starts saying, well, I know that China did it and the WHO did it and he's kind of pointing fingers at everybody but himself."}, {"time": 1713, "text": "And then we have a media here that had shifted from the traditional model of he said, she said journalism, so and so said X and so and so said Y and then we'll present both of those views."}, {"time": 1725, "text": "With Donald Trump, he would make outlandish starting positions."}, {"time": 1730, "text": "So he would say, Lex is an ax murderer."}, {"time": 1733, "text": "And then in the early days, they would say, Lex is an ax murderer, Lex's friend says he's not an ax murderer and we have a four day debate, is he or isn't he?"}, {"time": 1742, "text": "And then at day four, someone would say, why are we having this debate at all?"}, {"time": 1746, "text": "Because the original point is just is baseless."}, {"time": 1751, "text": "And so the media just got in the habit, here's what Trump said and here's why it's wrong."}, {"time": 1756, "text": "It's very complicated to figure out what is the role of a politician?"}, {"time": 1761, "text": "What is the role of a leader in this kind of game of politics?"}, {"time": 1765, "text": "But certainly in when there's a tragedy, when there's a catastrophic event, what it takes to be a leader is to see clearly through the fog and to make big bold decisions that does speak to the truth of things."}, {"time": 1781, "text": "And even if it's unpopular truth, to listen to the people, to listen to all sides, to the opinions, to the controversial ideas and to see past all the bullshit, all the political bullshit and just speak to the people, speak to the world and make bold, big decisions."}, {"time": 1802, "text": "That's probably what was needed in terms of leadership."}, {"time": 1804, "text":

we write books about them."}, {"time": 1821, "text": "And even though, I mean, I think of myself as a progressive person, I certainly was a critic of a lot of what President Trump did."}, {"time": 1833, "text": "But on this particular case, even though he may have said it in an uncouth way, Donald Trump was actually, in my view, right."}, {"time": 1843, "text": "I mean, when he said, hey, let's look at this lab."}, {"time": 1846, "text": "I mean, he said, I have evidence, I can't tell you."}, {"time": 1848, "text": "I don't think he even had the evidence."}, {"time": 1851, "text": "But his intuition that this probably comes from a lab, in my view was a correct intuition."}, {"time": 1858, "text": "And certainly I started speaking up about pandemic origins early in 2019."}, {"time": 1864, "text": "And my friends, my democratic friends were brutal with me saying, what are you doing?"}, {"time": 1869, "text": "You're supporting Trump in an election year."}, {"time": 1871, "text":

it's correct, just as if he says something that I don't like, I'm gonna speak up about that."}, {"time": 1886, "text": "Good, you walked through the fire."}, {"time": 1888, "text": "So that's, you laid out the story here."}, {"time": 1891, "text": "And I think in many ways it's a human story."}, {"time": 1896, "text": "It's a story of politics, it's a story of human nature."}, {"time": 1900, "text": "But let's talk about the story of the virus."}, {"time": 1905, "text": "And let's talk about the Wuhan Institute of Virology."}, {"time": 1908, "text": "So maybe this is a good time to try to talk about its history, about its origins, about what kind of stuff it works on, about biosafety levels, and about Batwoman."}, {"time": 1920, "text": "Yeah, Xu Zhengli, yes."}, {"time": 1922, "text": "Xu Zhengli."}, {"time": 1923, "text": "So what is the Wuhan Institute of Virology, when did it start?"}, {"time": 1927, "text": "Yeah, so it's a great question."}, {"time": 1929, "text": "So after SARS 1, which was in the early 2000, 2003, 2004, there was this effort to enhance, as I mentioned before, global capacity, including in China."}, {"time": 1943, "text": "So the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been around for decades before then."}, {"time": 1949, "text": "But there was an agreement between the French and the Chinese governments to build the largest BSL4 lab, BSL4 lab, so biosafety level four."}, {"time": 1959, "text": "So in these what are called high containment labs, there's level four, which is the highest level."}, {"time": 1964, "text": "And people have seen that on TV and elsewhere, where you have the people in the different suits and all of these protections."}, {"time": 1971, "text": "And then there's level three, which is still very serious, but not as much as level four."}, {"time": 1978, "text": "And then level two is just kind of goggles and some gloves and maybe a face mask, much less."}, {"time": 1985, "text": "So the French and the Chinese governments agreed that France would help build the first and still the largest BSL4 plus some mobile BSL3 labs."}, {"time": 2000, "text": "And they were going to do it in Wuhan."}, {"time": 2002,

before the pandemic broke out."}, {"time": 2012, "text": "And that was why I knew that Wuhan, it's not some backwater where there are a bunch of yokels eating bats for dinner every night."}, {"time": 2020, "text": "This is a really sophisticated, wealthy, highly educated and cultured city."}, {"time": 2025, "text": "And so I knew that it wasn't like that even the one on seafood market wasn't like some of these seafood markets that they have in Southern China or in Cambodia, where I lived for two years."}, {"time": 2037, "text": "I mean, it was a totally different thing."}, {"time": 2039, "text": "I'm gonna have to talk to you about some of the, including the Wuhan market, just some of the wild food going on here."}, {"time": 2044, "text": "Because you've traveled that part of the world."}, {"time": 2046, "text": "But let's not get there."}, {"time": 2047, "text": "Let's not get distracted."}, {"time": 2048, "text": "Good, as I was telling you, Lex, before, and this is maybe an advertisement, is having now listened to a number of your podcasts when I'm doing long ultra training runs or driving in the mountains."}, {"time": 2062, "text": "Like the really, because in the beginning, we have to talk about whatever it is is the topic."}, {"time": 2066, "text": "But the really good stuff happens later."}, {"time": 2068, "text": "So stay tuned."}, {"time": 2068, "text":

find out."}, {"time": 2089, "text": "Exactly, stay tuned."}, {"time": 2092, "text": "So France had this agreement that they were going to help design and help build this BSL4 lab in Wuhan."}, {"time": 2101, "text": "And it was going to be with French standards, and there were going to be 50 French experts who were going to work there and supervise the work that happened even after the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the new location started operating."}, {"time": 2152, "text": "And he said, we can't support, we have no idea what this is, whether it's safe or not."}, {"time": 2160, "text": "And when this lab opened, remember it was supposed to have 50 French experts, it had one French expert."}, {"time": 2167, "text": "And so the French were really disgusted."}, {"time": 2171, "text": "And actually when the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its new location opened in 2018, two things happened."}, {"time": 2179, "text": "One, French intelligence privately approached US intelligence saying, we have a lot of concerns about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, about its safety, and we don't even know who's operating there, is it being used as a dual use facility?"}, {"time": 2194, "text": "And also in 2018, the US embassy in Beijing sent some people down to Wuhan to go and look at, well, at this laboratory."}, {"time": 2204, "text": "And they wrote a scathing cable that Josh Rogin from the Washington Post later got his hands on saying, this is really unsafe, they're doing work on dangerous bat coronaviruses in conditions where a leak is possible."}, {"time": 2222, "text": "And so then you mentioned Shujing Li, and I'll connect that to these virologists who I was talking about."}, {"time": 2231, "text": "So there's a very credible thesis that because these pathogenic outbreaks happen in other parts of the world, having partnerships with experts in those parts of the world must be a foundation of our efforts."}, {"time": 2248, "text": "We can't just bring everything home because we know that viruses don't care about borders and boundaries, and so if something happens there, it's going to come here."}, {"time": 2256, "text": "So very correctly, we have all kinds of partnerships with experts in these labs, and Shujing Li was one of those partners."}, {"time": 2267, "text": "And her closest relationship was with Peter Daszak, who's a British, I think now American, but the president of a thing called EcoHealth Alliance, which was getting money from NIH."}, {"time": 2279, "text": "And basically, EcoHealth Alliance was a pass through organization."}, {"time": 2283, "text": "And over the years, it was only about $600,000."}, {"time": 2286, "text": "So almost all of her funding came from the Chinese government, but there's a little bit that came from the United States."}, {"time": 2291, "text": "And so she became their kind of leading expert and the point of contact between the Wuhan Institute of Virology and certainly Peter Daszak, but also with others."}, {"time": 2305, "text": "And that was why in the earliest days of the outbreak, I didn't mention that, I did mention that there were these virologists who had this fake certainty that they knew it came from nature and it didn't come from a lab and they called people like me conspiracy theorists just for raising that possibility."}, {"time": 2323, "text": "But when Peter Daszak was organizing that effort in February of 2020, what he said is we need to rally behind our Chinese colleagues."}, {"time": 2334, "text": "And the basic idea was these international collaborations are under threat."}, {"time": 2339, "text": "And I think it was because of that, because Peter Daszak's basically his major contribution as a scientist was just tacking his name on work that Shujang Li had largely done."}, {"time": 2352, "text": "He was defending a lot, certainly for himself and his organization."}, {"time": 2356, "text": "So you think EcoHealth Alliance and Peter is less about money, it's more about kind of almost like legacy because you're so attached to this work?"}, {"time": 2366, "text": "Is it just on a human level?"}, {"time": 2369, "text": "I mean, I've been criticized for being actually, I'm certainly a big critic of Peter Daszak, but I've been criticized by some for being too lenient."}, {"time": 2378, "text": "I mean, it's so easy to say, oh, somebody they're like an evil ogre and just trying to do evil and cackling in their closet or whatever."}, {"time": 2389, "text": "But I think for most of us, even those of us who do terrible, horrible things, the story that we tell ourselves and we really believe is that we're doing the thing that we most believe in."}, {"time": 2402, "text": "I mean, I did my PhD dissertation on the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia."}, {"time": 2406, "text": "They genuinely saw themselves as idealists."}, {"time": 2409, "text": "They thought, well, we need to make radical change to build a better future."}, {"time": 2415, "text": "And what they described as, that they felt was radical change was a monstrous atrocities by us."}, {"time": 2421, "text": "So the criticism here of Peter is that he was a part of an organization that was kind of, well, funding an effort that was an unsafe implementation of a biosafety level four laboratory."}, {"time": 2443, "text": "So what he thought he was doing was, and then what he thought he was doing is itself highly controversial because there's one there that in 2011, there were, I know you've talked about this with other guests, but in 2011, there were the first published papers on this now infamous gain of function research."}, {"time": 2467, "text": "And basically what they did, both in different labs and certainly in the United States, in Wisconsin and in the Netherlands, was they had a bird flu virus that was very dangerous, but not massively transmissive."}, {"time": 2488, "text": "And they had a gain of function process through what's called serial passage, which means basically passing advice, like natural selection, but forcing natural selection by just passing a virus through different cell cultures and then selecting for what it is that you want."}, {"time": 2506, "text": "So relatively easily, they took this deadly, but not massively transmissive virus and turned it into, in a lab, a deadly and transmissive virus."}, {"time": 2517, "text": "And that showed that this is really dangerous."}, {"time": 2519, "text": "And so there were, at that point, there was a huge controversy."}, {"time": 2523, "text": "There were some people, like Richard Ebright and Mark Lipsitch at Harvard, who were saying that this is really dangerous."}, {"time": 2532, "text": "We're in the idea that we need to create monsters to study monsters."}, {"time": 2537, "text": "I think maybe even you have said that in the past."}, {"time": 2541, "text": "It doesn't make sense because there's an unlimited number of monsters."}, {"time": 2544, "text": "And so what are we gonna do?"}, {"time": 2545, "text": "Create an unlimited number of monsters."}, {"time": 2547, "text": "And if we do that, eventually the monsters are going to get out."}, {"time": 2551, "text": "Then there was the Peter Daszak camp, and he got a lot of funding, particularly from the United States, who said, well, and certainly Collins and Fauci were supportive of this."}, {"time": 2562, "text": "And they thought, well, there's a safe way to go out into the world to collect the world's most dangerous viruses and to poke and prod them to figure out how they might mutate, how they might become more dangerous with the goal of predicting future pandemics."}, {"time": 2581, "text": "And that certainly never happened with the goal of creating vaccines and treatments."}, {"time": 2587, "text": "And that largely never happened, but that was, so Peter Daszak kind of epitomized that second approach."}, {"time": 2598, "text": "And as you've talked about in the past, in 2014, there was a funding moratorium in the United States, and then in 2017, that was lifted."}, {"time": 2607, "text": "It didn't affect the funding that went to the EcoHealth Alliance."}, {"time": 2613, "text": "So when this happened in the beginning, and again, coming back to Peter's motivations, I don't think, here's the best case scenario for Peter."}, {"time": 2624, "text": "I'm gonna give you what I imagine he was thinking, and then I'll tell you what I actually think."}, {"time": 2629, "text": "So I think here's what he's thinking."}, {"time": 2631, "text": "This is most likely a natural origin outbreak."}, {"time": 2636, "text": "Just like SARS one, again, in Peter's hypothetical mind, just like SARS one, this is most likely a natural outbreak."}, {"time": 2644, "text": "We need to have an international coalition in order to fight it."}, {"time": 2648, "text": "If we allow these political attacks to undermine our Chinese counterparts and the trust in these relationships that we've built over many years, we're really screwed because they have the most local knowledge of these outbreaks."}, {"time": 2704, "text": "That's a strong, positive discussion because it's true that there's a lot of political BS and a lot of kind of just bickering and lies as we've talked about."}, {"time": 2718, "text": "And so it's very convenient to say, you know what?"}, {"time": 2721, "text": "Let's just ignore all of these quote unquote lies and my favorite word, misinformation."}, {"time": 2727, "text": "And then because the way out from this serious pandemic is for us to work together."}, {"time": 2733, "text": "So let's strengthen our partnerships and everything else is just like noise."}, {"time": 2738, "text": "Yeah, so let's, and so then now I wanna do my personal indictment of Peter Daszak because that's my view, but I wanted to fairly."}, {"time": 2747, "text": "Because I think that we all tell ourselves stories and also when you're a science communicator, you can't in your public communications give every doubt that you have or every nuance, you kind of have to summarize things."}, {"time": 2765, "text": "And so I think that he was, again, in this benign interpretation trying to summarize in the way that he thought the conversations should go."}, {"time": 2774, "text": "Here's my indictment of Peter Daszak."}, {"time": 2776, "text": "And I feel like a Brutus here, but I have not come here to praise Peter Daszak because while Peter Daszak was doing all of this and making all of these statements about, well, we pretty much know it's a natural origin."}, {"time": 2794, "text": "Then there was this February, 2020 Lancet letter where it turns out, and we only knew this later that he was highly manipulative."}, {"time": 2802, "text": "So he was recruiting all of these people."}, {"time": 2805, "text": "He drafted the infamous letter calling people like me, conspiracy theorists."}, {"time": 2810, "text": "He then wrote to people like Ralph Barak and Linfa Wang, who are also very high profile virologists saying, well, let's not put our names on it."}, {"time": 2819, "text": "So it doesn't look like we're doing it, even though they were doing it."}, {"time": 2824, "text": "He didn't disclose a lot of information that they had."}, {"time": 2829, "text": "It was a strategic move."}, {"time": 2830, "text": "So just in case people are not familiar, February, 2020, Lancet letter was TLDR, is a lab leak hypothesis, is a conspiracy theory."}, {"time": 2844, "text": "Essentially, yes."}, {"time": 2846, "text": "So like with the authority of science, not saying like it's highly likely, saying it's obvious, duh, it's natural origin."}, {"time": 2857, "text": "Everybody else is just, everything else is just misinformation."}, {"time": 2862, "text": "And look, there's a bunch of really smart people that signed this, therefore it's true."}, {"time": 2866, "text": "Yeah, not only that, so there were the people who, 27 people signed that letter."}, {"time": 2871, "text": "And then after President Trump cut funding to EcoHealth Alliance, then he organized 77 Nobel laureates to have a public letter criticizing that."}, {"time": 2881, "text": "But what Peter knew then that we didn't fully know is that in March of 2018, EcoHealth Alliance, in partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and others, had applied for a $14 million grant to DARPA, which is kind of like the VC side of the venture capital side of the Defense Department."}, {"time": 2905, "text": "They're kind of, where they do kind of big ideas."}, {"time": 2909, "text": "By the way, as a tiny tangent, I've gotten a lot of funding from DARPA."}, {"time": 2913, "text": "They fund a lot of excellent robotics research."}, {"time": 2916, "text": "And DARPA is incredible."}, {"time": 2917, "text": "And among the things that they applied for is that we, meaning Wuhan Institute of Virology, is gonna go and it's gonna collect the most dangerous bat coronaviruses in Southern China."}, {"time": 2929, "text": "And then we, as this group, are going to genetically engineer these viruses to insert a furin cleavage site."}, {"time": 2939, "text": "So I think when everyone's now seen the image of the SARS CoV2 virus, it has these little spike proteins, these little things that stick out, which is why they call it a coronavirus."}, {"time":

topic."}, {"time": 5310, "text": "I mean, I think they're deeply thoughtful and intelligent, whether you agree with them or not."}, {"time": 5319, "text": "And I always learn something from their conversations."}, {"time": 5322, "text": "And they are legitimately or have been for a long time friends."}, {"time": 5326, "text": "And it's a little bit heartbreaking to me to see that they

want, their ideas as much as you want."}, {"time": 5367, "text": "But if you're not sufficiently open minded to admit that you have a lot to learn from their conversations, I think you're not being honest."}, {"time": 5377, "text": "And so I do hope they have those conversations."}, {"time": 5380, "text": "And I hope we can kind of, I think there's a lot of repairing to be done post COVID of

also a public call out to put a little bit more love in the world."}, {"time": 5408, "text": "And for these difficult conversations to happen."}, {"time": 5414, "text": "Because Brett Weinstein could be very wrong about a bunch of topics here around COVID, but he could also be right."}, {"time": 5427, "text": "And the only way to find out is to have those conversations."}, {"time": 5431, "text":

possessors of truth and nobody else is the possessor of truth, what starts happening is you both lose track or the capability of arriving at the truth."}, {"time": 5456, "text": "Because nobody's in the possession of the truth."}, {"time": 5458, "text": "So anyway, this is just a call out that we should have a little bit more conversation, a little bit more love."}, {"time": 5464, "text": "And

you that we don't have to agree with everybody, but it's great to have healthy conversations."}, {"time": 5500, "text": "That's how we grow."}, {"time": 5502, "text": "And absolutely, we live in a world where we're kind of, if we're not careful, pushed into these little information pockets."}, {"time": 5509, "text": "And certainly on social media, I have different parts of my life."}, {"time": 5513, "text": "One is focusing on issues of COVID origins."}, {"time": 5518, "text": "And then I have genetics and biotechnology."}, {"time": 5520, "text": "And then I have, which maybe we'll talk about later, one shared world, which is about how do we build a safer future?"}, {"time": 5526, "text": "And when I say critical things like the Chinese government, we'd have to demand a full

wouldn't, in my normal life, I'm not watching that much of Fox News or even television more generally."}, {"time": 5576, "text": "But I just feel like if I just speak to people who are very similar to me, maybe it'll be comfortable."}, {"time": 5583, "text": "But what have I contributed?"}, {"time": 5585, "text": "So I think we really have to have those kinds of conversations and recognize that at

talked about my website on pandemic origins."}, {"time": 6696, "text": "So when I launched it, I had it, I'm not a Chinese speaker, but I had the entire site translated into Chinese and I have it up

certainly, as I mentioned before, I'm a huge critic of what Xi Jinping is doing, the incredible brutality in Xinjiang, in Tibet and elsewhere."}, {"time": 6942, "text": "Yeah, the censorship one gives me a lot of trouble on the science realm and just in journalism and just the world that prevents us from having conversations with each other."}, {"time": 6956, "text": "Do you know about the Winnie

censorship has to be petty because the goal of censorship, maybe you experienced in the Soviet Union, is to get into your head."}, {"time": 6976, "text": "Like if it's just censorship, like you say down with the state and like you can't say that, but you can say all the other things up to that point, eventually people will feel empowered to say down with the state."}, {"time": 6989, "text": "And so I think the goal of this kind of authoritarian censorship is to turn you into the censor."}, {"time": 6996, "text": "And so the... Like self censor."}, {"time": 6999, "text": "Yeah, because they almost have to have you think, well, if I'm gonna make any criticism, maybe they're gonna come and get me."}, {"time": 7005, "text": "So it's safer to not do it."}, {"time": 7008, "text": "I mean, I've traveled through North Korea pretty extensively and I've seen that in its ultimate form, but that's what they're trying to do in China too."}, {"time": 7016, "text": "Yeah, so for people who are not familiar, it's such a clear illustration of just the pettiness of censorship and leaders, the corrupting nature of power."}, {"time": 7027, "text": "But there's a meme of Xi Jinping with, I guess, Barack Obama."}, {"time": 7033, "text": "And the meme is that he looks like Winnie the Pooh in that picture."}, {"time": 7040, "text": "And that was the President Xi Jinping looks like Winnie the Pooh."}, {"time": 7046, "text": "And I guess that became, because that got censored, like mentions of Winnie the Pooh got censored all across China."}, {"time": 7053, "text": "Winnie the Pooh became the unknowing revolutionary hero that represents freedom of speech and so on."}, {"time": 7061, "text": "But it's just such a absurd...

maybe it's almost understandable errors that happen in the progress of science."}, {"time": 7082, "text": "I mean, you could always argue that there's a lot of mistakes along the way and the censorship along the way caused the big mistake."}, {"time": 7091, "text": "You can argue that same way for the Chernobyl."}, {"time": 7094, "text": "But those are sort of understandable and difficult topics."}, {"time": 7098, "text": "Like Winnie the Pooh."}, {"time": 7099, "text": "But in your message, it shows both sides of the story."}, {"time": 7102, "text": "I mean, one, how petty authoritarian censors have to be."}, {"time": 7106, "text": "And that's why the messaging from the Chinese government is so consistent."}, {"time": 7110, "text": "No matter who you are, you have to be careful what you say."}, {"time": 7113, "text": "And that's why it's the story of Peng Shui, the tennis player."}, {"time": 7118, "text": "She dared raise her voice in an individual way."}, {"time":

"text": "I mean, the thing is if they open up freedom of speech really in a meaningful way, they can't maintain their current form of government."}, {"time": 7178, "text": "And it's connected, as I was saying before, to the origins of the pandemic."}, {"time": 7182, "text": "I mean, if my hypothesis was right, that was the big choice that the national government had."}, {"time": 7188, "text": "Do we really investigate the origins of the pandemic?"}, {"time": 7191, "text": "Do we deliver a message that transparency is required, public transparency is required from local officials?"},

"Do you really buy even on this story that China did nothing wrong, even though in the earliest days of the pandemic, these two, at least Chinese scientists themselves, courageously issued a preprint paper that was later almost certainly forcibly retracted, saying, well, this looks like this comes from one of the Wuhan labs that we're studying."}, {"time": 7263, "text": "Like if you opened up that window, I think that the Chinese government would not be able to continue in its current form."}, {"time": 7272, "text": "And that's why they cracked down at Tiananmen Square."}, {"time": 7274, "text": "That's why with Feng Shui, the tennis player, if they had let her accuse somebody from the Communist Party of sexual assault, and they said, okay, now people, you can use social media and you can have your me too moment and let us know who in the Chinese Communist Party or your boss in a business has assaulted you."}, {"time": 7297, "text": "Just like in every society, I'm sure there's tons of women who've been sexually assaulted, manipulated, abused by men."}, {"time": 7305, "text": "And so I certainly hope that there can be that kind of opening."}, {"time": 7311, "text": "But if I were an authoritarian dictator, that's the thing I would be most afraid of."}, {"time": 7316, "text": "Yeah, dictator perhaps, but I think you can gradually increase the freedom of speech."}, {"time": 7321, "text": "So I think you can maintain control over the freedom of press first."}, {"time": 7326, "text": "So control the press more, but let the lower levels sort of open up YouTube, right?"},

authoritarian perspective, you can just say that's misinformation, that's conspiracy theories, all those kinds of things."}, {"time": 7348, "text": "But at least I think if you open up that freedom of speech at the level of the individual citizen, that's good for entrepreneurship, for the development of ideas, of exchange of ideas, all that kind of stuff."}, {"time": 7361, "text": "I just think that increased the GDP of the country."}, {"time": 7364, "text": "So I think there's a lot of benefits."}, {"time": 7366, "text": "I feel like you can still play, we're playing some like dark thoughts here, but I feel like you could still play the game of thrones, still maintain power while giving freedom to the citizenry."}, {"time": 7380, "text": "Like I think just like with North Korea is a good

being completely kind of flipped upside down."}, {"time": 7418, "text": "But it seems like on the whole, ability to defeat lies with more, not through censorship, but through more conversations, more information is the right way to go."}, {"time": 7433, "text": "Can I tell you a little story, true stories about North Korea?"}, {"time": 7436, "text": "So a number of years ago, I was invited to be part of a small six person delegation advising the government of North Korea on how to establish special economic zones because other countries have used these SEZs as a way of building their

flew to China across the border into North Korea."}, {"time": 7464, "text": "And then we were met by our partners from the North Korean Development Organization."}, {"time": 7470, "text": "And then we zigzagged the country for almost two weeks visiting all these sites for where they were intended to create these special economic zones."}, {"time": 7479, "text": "And in each site, they had their local officials and they had a map and they showed us where everything that was going to be built."}, {"time": 7487, "text": "And the other people who were like really technical experts on how to set up a special economic zone, they were asking questions, well, like, should you put the entrance over here or shouldn't you put it over there and what if there's flooding?"}, {"time": 7498, "text":

saying RATG13 is the backbone, but is there, I believe there is a possibility that other viruses that were collected either in that mine in Yunnan in Southern China or in Laos or Cambodia, because

the Wuhan Institute of Virology had in its repository, prior to the outbreak, either SARS CoV2 or a reasonable precursor to it, that would prove the lab incident hypothesis."}, {"time": 8319, "text": "In my mind, that's almost certainly why they are preventing any kind of meaningful investigation."}, {"time": 8326, "text": "So my hypothesis is not that what RITG13 says is because as I mentioned earlier, the genetics of virus are constantly recombinating."}, {"time": 8339, "text": "So that what that means is if you have, you don't have very many total outlier viruses in a bat community

China."}, {"time": 8392, "text": "And they are in Wuhan."}, {"time": 8394, "text": "And when we can talk about this deeply compromised, now vastly improved World Health Organization process."},

already know."}, {"time": 8467, "text": "And that's why, again, my point from day one has been, we need a comprehensive international investigation in Wuhan with full access to all relevant records,

not the World Health Assembly, but the leadership of the WHO, announced the establishment of what's called SAGO, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens."}, {"time": 9651,

had an open call for nominations to be part of SAGO."}, {"time": 9677, "text": "And so a lot of people put in their nominations."}, {"time": 9683, "text": "They selected 26 people."}, {"time": 9685,

of lab incidents."}, {"time": 9733, "text": "And then one of the, so they added those two."}, {"time": 9737, "text": "And then when they just released the list of people who are part of SAGO, this one woman, a highly respected Dutch virologist named Marion Koopmans, who had been part of that deeply flawed and compromised international study group, who had called, who has consistently called a lab incident origin, quote, unquote, a debunked conspiracy theory."}, {"time": 9759, "text": "As of now, her name is not on the list."}, {"time": 9762, "text": "We haven't seen any announcements."},

they exist within a political context."}, {"time": 9779, "text": "And they're pushing at the edges, but there's only so far that they can go."}, {"time": 9787, "text": "And that's why we definitely need to have full accountability for the WHO."}, {"time": 9792, "text": "We need to expand the mandate to WHO."}, {"time": 9794, "text": "But we need to recognize that states have a big role."},

leadership."}, {"time": 9818, "text": "Leadership and empowerment, as I mentioned, the World Health Assembly is meeting now."}, {"time": 9825, "text": "And I think that it shouldn't be that we require superhumans."}, {"time": 9830, "text": "And there are some people who are big critics of WHO."}, {"time": 9833, "text": "The leader of the WHO in SARS 1 was definitely more aggressive."}, {"time": 9840, "text": "She had a different set of powers at that time."}, {"time": 9845, "text": "But it can't be entirely, we definitely need strong willed, aggressive, independent people in these kinds of roles."}, {"time": 9854, "text": "We also need a more empowered WHO."}, {"time": 9857, "text": "Like when the Chinese government in the earliest days of the pandemic said, we're just not going to allow you to send a team to collect your own information."}, {"time": 9867, "text": "And we're not going to allow you to have any kind of independent surveillance, there was very little that the WHO could do because of the limitations of its mandate."}, {"time": 9880, "text": "And we can't just say we're going to have a WHO that only compromises Chinese sovereignty."}, {"time": 9886, "text": "If

into the future, let's first step into the past, sort of the philosophical question about China."}, {"time": 9939, "text": "If you were to put yourself in the shoes of the Chinese government, if they were to be more transparent, how should they be more transparent?"}, {"time": 9951, "text": "Because it's easier to say, we want to see this."}, {"time": 9957, "text": "But from a perspective of government, and not just the Chinese government, but a government on WHO's geographic territory, say it's a lab leak, a lab leak occurred that has resulted in trillions of dollars of loss, countless

something in geopolitical sense, the United States will bring up, oh, remember that time you cost us trillions of dollars because of your fuck up?"}, {"time": 10021, "text": "So what is the incentive

topic."}, {"time": 10123, "text": "But I actually think short term travel bans actually are not a terrible idea."}, {"time": 10129, "text": "They should have, on day one, they should have allowed WHO experts in."}, {"time": 10135, "text": "They should have shared information."}, {"time": 10137, "text": "They should have allowed a full and comprehensive investigation with international partnerships

accidental lab incident and then from what I've consistently called a criminal cover up."}, {"time": 10182, "text": "Because the cover up has done, in many ways, as much or more damage than the incident."}, {"time": 10189, "text": "Well, what happens?"}, {"time": 10190, "text": "You could easily imagine Xi Jinping has had two terms as the leader of China."}, {"time": 10197, "text": "And he

question, if I were, let's just say I were the Chinese government, not, I mean, kind of an idealized version of the Chinese government."}, {"time": 10363, "text": "And let's just say that they had come to the conclusion that it was a lab incident."}, {"time": 10369, "text": "And let's just say they knew that even if they continued to cover it up, eventually this information would come out."},

terribly about that."}, {"time": 10465, "text": "And we know that we were very aggressive in covering up information in the beginning, but the reason we were doing that is because we thoroughly, we fully believe that it came from a natural origin."}, {"time": 10477, "text": "Now that we see otherwise, we feel terribly."}, {"time": 10481, "text": "Therefore, we're doing a few different things."},

responsibility?"}, {"time": 10536, "text": "Well, so it's not the, like just a lab leak."}, {"time": 10540, "text": "Like if China on day one had said we have this outbreak, we don't know where it

relevant information because however this started, we're all victims."}, {"time": 10563, "text": "That's a totally different story than punishing Australia, preventing the WHO, blocking any

sure that it's all true in the sense that we have millions of people who are getting vaccinated and different things."}, {"time": 14156, "text": "And what Sanjay should have said was, I know that's anecdote."}, {"time": 14161, "text": "Here's another anecdote of like when Francis Collins was with you and he talked about the world wrestling guy who was like 6.6 and a big muscly guy, and then he

die."}, {"time": 14210, "text": "He was no big deal at all for him."}, {"time": 14213, "text": "And he said that to him."}, {"time": 14214, "text": "I think, I'm not sure."}, {"time": 14216, "text":

up, you know, cause like why?"}, {"time": 14229, "text": "But he, that was not at all, like that was a pretty public case."}, {"time": 14233, "text": "He had an interview with him, that wrestler, he was just fine."}, {"time": 14237, "text": "So that anecdotal case, I mean, Francis should not have done that."}, {"time": 14241, "text": "So if I have any, so I have a bunch of criticism of how that went."}, {"time": 14246, "text": "People who criticize that interview, I feel like don't give enough respect to the full range of things that Francis Collins has done in his career."}, {"time": 14255,

{"time": 14264, "text": "And one of them was why, when you're trying to present some kind of critical, like criticize Joe Rogan, why bring up anecdotal evidence at all?"}, {"time": 14278, "text": "And if you do bring up anecdotal evidence, which is not scientific, if you're a scientist, you should not be using anecdotal evidence."}, {"time": 14286, "text": "If you do bring it up, why bring up one that's first not true and you know it's not true?"}, {"time": 14295, "text": "So I know, pretend, so you don't know it's not true."}, {"time": 14298, "text": "So yes, that would find another case where, exactly."}, {"time": 14303, "text": "So the basic thing coming back to Sanjay and Joe's conversation was that Sanjay was trying to use statistical evidence and Joe was using anecdotal evidence."}, {"time": 14313, "text": "And so I think that for Sanjay, and there are all kinds of things where there are debates where often the person who's better at debating wins the debate regardless of the topic."}, {"time": 14326, "text": "So I think what Sanjay could have done, and Sanjay is such a smart guy, is to say, well, that's an anecdote, here's another anecdote."}, {"time": 14337, "text": "And there are lots of different anecdotes."}, {"time": 14340, "text": "And there certainly are people who have taken the vaccine and have had problems that could reasonably be traced to the vaccines."}, {"time": 14348, "text": "And there certainly are lots of people, I would argue, more people who've not had the vaccine, but who've gotten COVID and have either died or our

they're relying on public transport."}, {"time": 14437, "text": "So there was this whole liberal effort."}, {"time": 14439, "text": "And then in the black community in New York, according to the New

there must be something wrong with it."}, {"time": 14454, "text": "They must be doing something."}, {"time": 14456, "text": "And so we have to listen to each other."}, {"time": 14459, "text": "Like I

what they're saying, then don't talk about it."}, {"time": 14603, "text": "Like if you're a scientific leader and the communicator, you need to look into it."}, {"time": 14607, "text": "It's not that much effort."}, {"time": 14609, "text": "And I think that humility, it's a constant theme of your podcasts and I love that."}, {"time": 14615, "text": "And so after the conversation debate, whatever it was between Sanjay and Joe, I reached out on Twitter to someone I've never met in person, but I'm in touch privately to a guy named Daniel Griffin, who's a professor at Columbia Medical School and

best job of saying, well, here are these concerns."}, {"time": 14674, "text": "And then here is our evidence making a counterclaim and here are links to if you want to look at the studies upon which these claims are made, here they are."}, {"time": 14685, "text": "And Daniel, who's incredibly busy, I mean, he reads every, I mean, it seems every paper that comes out every week and it's unbelievable."}, {"time": 14695, "text": "But he sent me a link to the CDC Q&A page on the CDC website."}, {"time": 14702, "text": "And it wasn't that, it was people who were, I mean, it was written by people like me who were convinced in the benefit of these vaccines."}, {"time": 14713, "text": "So the questions were framed, they were kind of like, they weren't really the framing of the people with the concerns."}, {"time": 14721, "text": "They were framing of people who were just kind of imagining something else."}, {"time": 14725, "text": "I mean, you always talk about kind of humility

vaccines and masks and all of those things."}, {"time": 14739, "text": "But if we don't hear other people, if we don't let them hear their voice in the conversation, if it's just saying, well, you may think this and here's why it's wrong, the argument may be right."}, {"time": 14752, "text": "It'll just never break through."}, {"time": 14753, "text": "By the way, my interpretation of Joe and Sanjay, I listened to that conversation without looking at Twitter or the internet and I thought that was a great conversation and I thought Sanjay actually really succeeded in bringing the temperature down."}, {"time": 14765, "text": "To me, the goal was bringing the temperature down."}, {"time": 14768, "text": "I didn't even think of it as a debate."}, {"time": 14770, "text": "I was like, oh, cool, this isn't gonna be some weird, it's like two friendly people talking."}, {"time": 14775, "text": "And then I look at the internet and then the internet says, Joe Rogan slammed Sanjay like as if it was a heated debate that Joe won."}, {"time": 14784, "text": "And it's like, all right, it's really the temperature being brought down."}, {"time": 14790, "text": "Real conversation

think it was a success, but I also felt that a takeaway, and again, because this is something that I don't agree with, even though I have great, as I've said, respect for Joe, I think a reasonable person listening to that conversation would come away with the conclusion that all in all these vaccines are a good thing, but if you're young and healthy, you probably don't need it."}, {"time": 14831, "text": "And I just felt that there was a stronger case to be made, even though Sanjay made it."}, {"time": 14837, "text": "It wasn't that Sanjay didn't make it."}, {"time": 14839, "text": "It was just that in the flow of that conversation, I felt that the case for the vaccines and the vaccines both as an individual choice and then certainly again, as I said before, I think that while people can be afraid of the vaccines, the virus itself is much scarier and we're seeing it now in real time with these variations and variants."}, {"time": 14863, "text": "I just felt that that was kind of the rough takeaway from that conversation."}, {"time": 14870, "text": "And I felt that Sanjay, again, whom I love, I felt it could have made his case a little bit stronger."}, {"time": 14876, "text": "So the thing he succeeded is he didn't come off as like a science expert looking down at everybody, talking down to everybody."}, {"time": 14889, "text": "So he succeeded in that, which is very respectful."}, {"time": 14892, "text": "But I also think sort of making the case for taking the vaccine when you're a young, healthy person, when you're sitting across from Joe Rogan is like a high difficulty on the video game level."}, {"time": 14906, "text": "So it's difficult to do."}, {"time": 14911, "text": "And also it's difficult to do because it's not as simple as like, look at the data."}, {"time": 14918, "text": "There's a lot of data to go through here."}, {"time": 14922, "text": "And there's also a lot of non data stuff, like the fact that, first of all, questioning the sources of the data, the quality of the data, because it's also disappointing about COVID is that the quality of the data is not great."}, {"time": 14964, "text": "I mean, vaccination is not just a public health tool."}, {"time": 14968, "text": "It's also a tool for a government to gain more control over the populace."}, {"time": 14973, "text": "Like, there's a lot of truth to that too."}, {"time": 14976, "text": "Things that have a lot of benefit can also be used as a Trojan horse to increase bureaucracy and control."}, {"time": 14987, "text": "But that has to be on the table for a conversation."}, {"time": 14989, "text": "I think it has to be on the conversation."}, {"time": 14992, "text": "But your parents, when they were in the Soviet Union and here in the United States, and actually it was a big collaboration between US and Soviet Union, when the polio vaccine came out, there were people all around the world who had a different life trajectory, no longer living in fear."}, {"time": 15009, "text": "And all of these people who were paralyzed or killed from polio, smallpox has been eradicated."}, {"time": 15015, "text": "It was one of the great successes in human history."}, {"time": 15020, "text": "And while it for sure is true that you could imagine some kind of fraudulent vaccination effort, but here I genuinely think, I mean, whatever the number, 15 million, 16 million is the economist number of dead from COVID 19, many, many, many more people would be dead but for these vaccines."}, {"time": 15041, "text": "And so I get that any activity that needs to be coordinated by a central government has the potential to increase bureaucracy and increase control."}, {"time": 15053, "text": "But there are certain things that central governments do,

Allergy and Infectious Disease, NIH funding."}, {"time": 15073, "text": "I mean, this was a public private partnership throughout and that we got a working vaccine 11 months was a miracle."}, {"time": 15081, "text": "So I, yeah."}, {"time": 15081, "text": "It's not purely a victory."}, {"time": 15084, "text": "Again, you have to be open minded."}, {"time": 15086, "text": "I'm with you here playing a bit of devil's advocate, but the people who discuss any viral drugs like ivermectin and other alternatives would say that the extreme focus on the vaccine distracted us from considering other possibilities."}, {"time": 15102, "text": "And saying that this is purely a success is distracting from the story that there could have been other solutions."}, {"time": 15110, "text": "So yes, it's a huge success that the vaccine was developed so quickly and surprisingly way more effective than it was hoped for."}, {"time": 15122, "text": "But there could have been other solutions and they completely distracted from us from that."}, {"time": 15128, "text": "In fact, it distracted us from looking into a bunch of things like the lab leak."}, {"time": 15132, "text": "And so it's not a pure victory."}, {"time": 15135, "text": "And there's a lot of people that criticize the overreach of government and all of this."}, {"time": 15140, "text": "That one of the things that makes the United

stand and kind of, we're going to spin around in a circle for 45 minutes."}, {"time": 16029, "text": "And so I spun around in the circle for like 10 minutes, but then I had to leave because I had to go to something else."}, {"time": 16035, "text": "And so that, I thought that was that."}, {"time": 16038, "text": "But then I saw Viviana the next day, and I said, well, how did the cacao ceremony

was more sane because it was part of this thing."}, {"time": 16071, "text": "And at the end of that, I had this, I thought one, the greatest thing ever, a sacred cacao ceremony, like you drink chocolate milk and everybody's free."}, {"time": 16081, "text": "And I love that idea because I've never done drugs, I don't drink."}, {"time": 16087, "text": "But just part of it is because I think whatever, like I was saying with the ultra running, all of the possibilities are within us if we can get out of our own way."}, {"time": 16096, "text": "And then I thought, well, you know, I think I can do a better job than what I experienced in Berlin."}, {"time": 16102, "text": "So I came back and I thought, all right, I'm gonna get accredited as a cacao shaman."}, {"time": 16106, "text": "And this will shock you."}, {"time": 16107, "text": "Because I know if you're gonna be like a rabbi or a priest or something, there's some process."}, {"time": 16112, "text": "But shockingly, there's no

you're drinking this cacao, but there's a person who planted the seed, there's a person who watered the plant, there's a person, and I just think that level of awareness, and it's true with anything."}, {"time": 16284, "text": "Like you have in front of you a stuffed hedgehog, so."}, {"time": 16287, "text": "Somebody made that."}, {"time": 16288, "text": "I love it, it's great."},

building all these nuclear weapons."}, {"time": 16567, "text": "Who cares that we solved climate change because we're all gone anyway."}, {"time": 16570, "text": "And the meta category, bringing all

{"time": 16589, "text": "And there's a historical issue, which is that prior to the 30 Years War in the 17th century, we had all these different kinds of sovereignty and religious and different kinds of organizational principles and everybody got in this war."}, {"time": 16604, "text": "And in this series of treaties that together are called the Peace of Westphalia, the framework for the modern, what we now understand as the modern nation state was laid."}, {"time": 16615, "text": "And then through colonialism and other means that idea of a state is what it is today, spread throughout the world."}, {"time": 16625, "text": "Then through particularly the late 19th and early 20th century, we realized how unstable that system was because you always had these jockeying between sovereign states and some were rising and some were falling and you ended up in war."}, {"time": 16641, "text": "And that was the genius of the generations who came together in 1945 in San Francisco and the planning had even started before then, who said, well, we can't just have that world, we need to have an overlay."}, {"time": 16652, "text": "And we talked about the UN and the WHO of systems which transcend our national sovereignties."}, {"time": 16659, "text": "They don't get rid of them, but they transcend them so we can solve this category of problems."}, {"time": 16664, "text": "But we're now reaching a point where our reach as humans, even individually, but collectively is so great that there's a mismatch between, as I said, the nature of the problems and the ability to solve those

number of problems that present themselves in the world that face all of human civilization and to be able to work together."}, {"time": 16798, "text": "Well, that is, but there's a macro, a meta problem, which is the global collective action problem."}, {"time": 16804, "text": "And so the idea is even if we just focus on the verticals, on the manifestations of the global collective action problem, there'll be an infinite number of those things."}, {"time": 16816, "text": "So while we work on those things, like climate change, pandemics, WMD and other things, we also have to ask the bigger questions of why can't we solve this category of problems."}, {"time": 16827, "text": "And the idea is, at least from my observation, is that whenever big decisions are being made, our national leaders and corporate leaders are doing exactly what we've hired them to do."}, {"time": 16840, "text": "They're maximizing for national interest, even, or corporate interests, even at the expense of everybody."}, {"time": 16848, "text": "And so it's not that we wanna get rid of states."}, {"time": 16850, "text": "States are essential in our world system."}, {"time": 16852, "text": "It's not we
